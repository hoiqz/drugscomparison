2	Hypertension	Very Low BP - Lowest reading of 101/52Mild 'lightheadedness'Mild itchiness of the scalpMild shortness of breathSevere muscle cramps	I'm 33y/o, 5'7", 150# male, blood chem all perfect but diagnosed with hypertension (genetics) since I was 28y/o.I exercise at least 4 times a week (light weights lifting and playing basketball, sometimes biking and tennis).  Have taken Losartan and Losartan HCTZ that I have outgrown, my body got immuned to them I think.  Then I was prescribed w/ Benicar HCT 40mg/25mg.  On the 4th day taking this benicar, while playing basketball, I experienced leg cramping like I had when I first started on Losartan HCTZ.  I checked my BP that night, had a lowest reading of 101/52. I felt some mild lightheadedness but felt OK overall.  But on the 6th day of taking this Benicar, I experienced a very severe cramping while playing basketball which started from my thighs up to my torso!  Driven home by a friend, cramps continued at home and in dire agony I asked my wife to take me to the hospital.  In the ER I was given intravenous rehydration and after 4hrs was released.  I know very well and I had muscle cramps before but that time it was so severe that really frightened the hell out of me, I could not breathe because almost my whole body except from the neck up were cramping alternately.  I am kind of pain tolerant but it was so severe cramping and pain that I have never experienced before.  It was like a very bad nightmare that still frightens me up to now (happened 4days ago while writing this review).I guess for active persons, be very extra careful while taking this Benicar HCT.

1	Hypertension	Trouble breathing, frequent urination	My Dr. prescribed this medication last year and I took it for several months.  I began having trouble breathing, but attributed it to the fact that I'm a smoker.  My company switched insurance and they wouldn't fill the script without going through hoops, which during this time I went without and didn't notice my breathing had returned to normal. Recently started on it again and the breathing issue returned.  I didn't realize that the Benicar HCT was the reason. This was a severe side effect for me. I literally had no air. I couldn't take in enough to finish a sentence. Very scarry. I'm going to request my Dr. change my script.	F	52	10  days20 1X D	2/18/2013Email
1	HBP	Was feeling short of breath and thought it was asthma and got an inhaler from my doctor.  No help.  Later developed a cough and irritation in upper chest, but nothing would ever come out.  This has gone on for at least 6 weeks.  After eliminating the Asthma theory I thought I inhaled a dog hair or something.  Then I thought allergies and tried allergy pills with no effect on the constant cough.  Then accidentally I missed my BP meds one day and the next day I felt less of a cough.  When I started back up the cough returned in full force!   Now I stopped again 3 days ago and the irritation causing me to cough is gone, but I am left with a chest infection.  Come to find out on the testing of Benicar/HCT they had several instances of chest infection when testing the drug.	You never suspect that a drug designed to help you is actually poisoning your body.  Sad	M	53	1  years20/12.5 1X D	1/8/2013
1	Hypertension	Palpitations, fast heart beat, added sleepiness, headaches, itchiness.  Soreness in back and neck with muscle spasms and cramps.	I have Fibromyalgia so when a lot of these symptoms would happen I just brush it off as my Fibro acting up.  It was only when I needed a new script and had a few days w/o I noticed the difference almost immediately.  I didn't feel so groggy, foggy, or achy.  I stopped sleeping almost around the clock even though I have sleep apnea I don't feel so sleep deprived.  In the beginning the Benicar was helping  and it did lower my pressure but shortly thereafter my blood pressure returned to being high.  I didn't realize this stuff causes bone deterioration which can lead to kidney failure!  No way would I take a chance like this having Diabetes I'm already at risk.  I also suffer from a Degenerative Disk so my back hurts anyway but since I've stop this script I haven't been hurting near as much even with the Fibro, back pain, and migraines.  Benicar exacerbated all my ailments to the degree I could hardly move.  I feel so much more better.  I'll find a natural way to decrease my blood pressure by exercising, losing weight, and taking suppliments.I also believe it made me more anxious, something I really don't need being that I live in a stressful neighborhood.  I definitely feel more mellow.	F		2  years40-25 mg 1X D	8/20/2012Email

5	hypertension	I haven't experienced any side effects, aside from the cost causing my blood pressure to rise at the pharmacy. It controls my hypertension very well.	Benicar HCT is not available in generic for yet. It may be offered in generic in 2016, according to the web. It is very expensive to buy, without insurance to cover at least part of the cost. The price here in OH is approximately $160.00 for a 30 day supply. Benicar HCT website does offer a payment assistance card. It reduced the price of copay to $25.00 per month, but only if you have a primary insurance plan. If you don't have insurance, it will reduce the price by $25.00, making your cost still $145.00. That makes no sense to me, but that is how the plan works (small print). The plan is offered directly from Benicar HCT's website. It is called the Right Fit plan. You enter your information and you can print a temp card to use, until they send you a card.  It would be a great plan, if it offered the same benefit cost for everyone, not just those fortunate enough to have primary insurance coverage.	F	48	6  years40/25 1X D	4/6/2012Email

1	High Blood Pressure	Started out with blood pressure controlled and feeling ok but over time noticed pain in my legs with heaviness when walking. The leg pains increased so badly that even walking short distances caused so much pain. Told my doctor but she did not think it was the Benicar. Went through several tests including xrays of knees, blood pressure circulation test by a cardiologist on my legs and arms, also 2nd opinion treadmill test, diabetes and cholesterol reading, and all tested normal.  Also went through 2mos of Physical therapy and no respite. Then i found that the side effects I was experiencing were all the Benicar side effects. This drug is dangerous over time, now I am using a Disabled placard because it hurts to walk. Sleep deprivation, heart palpatations are some of the effects too.	I have used other HBP medication with other side effects such as coughing, upset stomach and dizziness so when my doctors switched to Benicar I thought finally, this would work and it turned out to be the end of my feeling better and the beginning of disabling pain and limited well being. Am feeling unbalanced all of the time. what????	F	65	365  days20 mg 1X D	10/4/2011
4	High Blood Pressure (genetic)	none. It seems to be regulating my blood pressure to below normal levels and I have had no noticeable side effects. I take the lowest dosage combo Benicar. I am unemployed and went to a clinic and was prescribed Lisinopril  & a desperate diuretic (both generic because they were free) and had HORRIBLE side effects (weigh loss, lethargic, no appetite).I asked the clinic Dr to prescribe me Benicar HCT which my Dr had me on before I lost my job and health insurance. Side effect: I have to pay out of pocket and it is very expensive	I am 5'3" and weigh 110 and have an healthy diet and exercise. I do not smoke. I do not use salt. I walk but don't work out daily. I am considered underweight by some and at one point my Dr. wanted me to gain 10 lbs. My Dr told me because of no other health issues and no diet or weigh issues that my hypertension is most likely genetically inherited. I have it on both paternal and maternal sides (mother, father, grandmother, grandfather) and heart disease and heart failure issues on both sides of my family. I am in my early 40's but not over 45. Had low blood pressure until I hit 40 years of  age.	F	40	2  years12.2/20 1X D	3/29/2011Email
3	Hypertension	I started with neck and back pain/stiffness. Now I have bouts with Vertigo and soreness of muscles in my knee, hip and elbows. Slight bouts with breathing occasionally.	Benicar is the ONLY prescription medication that I take, over than a low dose aspirin. It controls my BP very well, however I am now experiencing these effects, especially muscle pain/soreness. My joint especially in my knees, elbows and hips hurt. When I checked the rare side effects of Benicar it listed everything I just mentioned. I told my dr. He doesn't believe that its' the Benicar. He ordered several blood tests and I'm waiting to hear back. He told me to discontinue the Benicar, but didn't give me anything in it's place to control my chornic BP. I feel horrible. Standing up from sitting and getting out of bed and walking stairs are VERY difficult now.	F	55	3  years20/12.5 1X D	3/24/2011Email

Once I connected these symptoms to the new med and stopped taking it, within three days I was better. Went back on the Lisinopril, which gives me a wet cough and congestion feel.

1	hypertension	Peripheral edema in legs, ankles, feet. Pain in legs, heaviness in legs. Swelling of wrists and hands. Extreme fatigue. Saw Dr on 11/18 and BP was 130/100. Also she doesn't believe the med caused the swelling. Switched back to lisinopril and happy with this.	Diovan HCT also caused horrible peripheral edema in me and my dr. didn't believe me then. She said it can't be that because it contains HCT. Now she doesn't believe the Benicar caused the same reaction, even though it is in the same class of drug (ARB). Only reason I went on Diovan or Benicar is because she suspected my cough was from the lisinopril. I still had the cough with Benicar.	F	51	4  months20/12.5 1X D	11/21/2010Email

Try using a bar of soap under your sheet in the area of your legs/feet.  I have been using it since I read about it in Dr. Gott.  It works for me at night when the cramping sometimes starts.  I have used Dial, Dove, Ivory soaps and there is no bed in the house without a bar of soap.

I kept getting shortness of breath, high pulse rate, lack of motivation, chest pressure.	finally asked to switch me to 10mg lisinopril because I was sick of having benicar pushed on me.  My pressure went from 180/70 within 3 hours of taking the med.  No side effects.

2	Hypertensn (160/104 typical premed)	Moderate weakness, shortness of breath, lightheaded, headache, some dizziness, feeling ill, moderately severe diarrhea, felt like (mild case) food poisoning. Did not have an increase of Urination, however, already was getting up 3-4 times a night to go.	Question: can the 20/12.5 pills just be cut in half, as current dose appears to be too strong for my physiology???Took 20/12.5 for a couple of months, then discontinued for almost a year.  Then I recently checked my BP again - was 160/100, yikes!  SO I said, OK, I can't ignore this, and resumed.  Both times, I had extreme sensitivity to being outdoors in the sun, extreme sweat.  If all you look at is the numbers, it's excellent: a 160/100 dropped the next day to 120/80s, but in the sun (just watering the yard) got very lightheaded, weak, ill feeling, moderately severe diarrhea, checked BP ASAP and got 102/64, explained a lot.   Had this a bit first time I took this, but reading returned to good range quickly, this time, even after major re-hydration still low.I will either be taking this every 48 hours or splitting the pills in half.  I'd love to discontinue, but not without a plan in place.  Regards to all, Thanks for making this a valuable resource for all whom take this med!	F	59	45  days20/12.5 1X D	8/9/2010Email
4	hypertension	The first 2 to 3 weeks I had a cough but that went away. My cholesterol has risen but that may be due to aging.	I was trying to control my BP with diet and exercise alone but it didn't work. After a course of treatment with other BP meds - none of them worked -- I was given  Benicar HCT by a new doctor. Within the first 3 days my pressure went from 190/100 to 130/70. I have now been on it for 4 years, and my pressure is consistently 120/80 or below.

5	hypertension	After trying 4 other medications for hypertension all of which gave me persistent side effects ranging from dizziness to a chronic sore throat and cough, my doctor FINALLY switch my medication to Benicar HCT.  It worked immediately to bring down my blood pressure with a relatively low dosage (20-12.5mg) and I had absolutely no side effects from the first dose.	Now my prescription plan has been switched to another provider and Benicar HCT is not on the approved list.  I am now being force to try another medication for hypertension Diovan HCT  before my doctor will complete the approval process for the Benicar.  To buy the Benicar HCT without a prescription plan the cost would be over $250 for a 90 day supply that I used to get for a co pay of less than $50.  I'm disgusted with my doctor for not pushing the approval process and taking the easy way out and just recommending one of the other medications.  This after taking Benicar HCT with excellent results for over 5 years.	F	61	5  years20-12.5 mg 1X D	3/10/2010Email
5	Blood Pressure	No major side effects except frequent urination.	I was taking Benicar for one year with minor side effects.  My insurance company changed their formulary, charging me more, so I requested my doctor change meds.  I first tried Lisinopril, it gave me severe headaches, so dizzy I could hardly stand in the mornings, and a general bad feeling.  I switched to Diovan, after 2 weeks my blood pressure shot up to 235/175 and was jumping all over the place, I had severe headaches, dizziness, and flu like symptoms.  It was very scary!!  I still had some Benicar left so I switched back.  The following day my blood pressure was 117/72 and stayed within a few points of that, all headaches, dizziness, and bad feelings went away. I will stay with Benicar and pay the extra costs.	M	65	1  years40-25 1X D	3/5/2010
2	HTN	Severe muscle spasms.  Cramping in my ear and weird little muscles.  If I stretched my legs at night would generate a cramp.  Joint pains, rash, itching.  Fatigue and sleep problems.  Forgetfulness.  Cough, urinary problems seem to be enhanced.	It does control my blood pressure but at what price?  Totally unable to lose weight.  My absolute biggest problem is the incapacitating muscle cramps.  Stood up from a chair the other day and one leg went into a total cramp.  There is no worse pain in the world.  Severe hip pain when walking.  Now it has stopped and moved to my arms.  Can't pick up a cup of coffee.  All of my lab comes back 'normal.'  I don't feel normal.  Something is very wrong.  I feel like a hypochrondriac and I am normally a very up-beat person.	F	59	3  years40 mg 1X D	2/23/2010
4	High Blood Pressure	An intense urge to urinate at the most twice per day.  Occassional extreme dizziness aggravated by the sun and upon standing up.	I was on benicar by itself about two years ago, it worked for about a week, I missed three days, went back on and it did not work any more.  Stayed off for two years, doctor recommended benicar hct and I've been on it almost a year.  Aside from the previously mentioned side affects it has brought my bp from 200/97 to 120/76.  I have not experienced any of the lethargy described by others, nor the depressive episodes.  I did however keep my bp in check with exercise, but now, because of a busy lifestyle have not been able to exercise.  Keep this in mind prior to taking any meds for bp, an active lifestyle is beneficial especially aerobic.	M	41	1  years	1/27/2010Email
5		No seriously or lasting side effects.	This medication has drastically reduced my BP. When I was first diagnosed with high BP about a year ago my BP was around 160/90. I started out with Lisinopril and it didn't work and it gave me a dry cough. Now my BP averages around 115/65. some days are higher but overall it is much much lower than when I was diagnosed a year ago.	M	34	1  years	1/18/2010
3	High Blood Pressure	Felt like I was going to faint. Urination 20 times a day (usually). Depression, lack of interest in things I used to be interested in. This medicine is way over-priced. Goes up every month. Needed Lopressor prescription, in addition to Benicar Hct, to get my BP down to normal levels. My prescription drug plan with WellCare Inc has eliminated it from their covered drugs in their PDP Plans.		M	62	5  years	1/17/2010
5	High BP	Benicar HCT 40/12.5.  Possibly a slight cough, although my doctor says it isn't due to this medication.  I've had the cough with other BP meds as well, and it started when I started taking them.  Could be acid reflux but I don't have all the symptoms for that.	After taking Benicar HCT for about a year I dropped the HCT and now take only Benicar. I prefer not taking medications and the reason for the diuretic was to deal with water retention.  That was presumably caused by too much sodium (salt).  I cut way back on salt and that helped so I tried dropping the HCT.  My BP did go up a little as a result. Overall, I've had virtually no side effects with Benicar HCT or Benicar without HCT, except the possibility of a slight cough.  Again, not sure the Benicar is causing the cough.  Main problem is that there is no generic and my co-pay is pretty high.	M	68	16  months	1/14/2010Email

Symptoms presented only after taking Benicar HCT 20/5. Stopped taking Benicar HCT 20/5 after 45 days. Doc said "no way" med had any link with my subsequent physical condition. Have slowly recovered with aid of PT. Believe my body flushing this poison out of my system as I am regaining functions without the suggested fusion spine surgery.

4	Stage 4 high Blood Pressure	It is premature to rate this drug but I wanted to note that this drug was chosen to quickly drop my blood pressure from a dangerous level. I was started at the 40 mg/25 HCT and I hope it is effective.  I read through the symptoms and what I see to expect, is muscle cramps. Take not that no one mentioned a potassium supplement with the HCT as you usually need potassium.   Also the age of some folks and slowing down will also make you feel tired.  The drug seems to have good results in lowering pressure and it seems the side effects of feeling lousy are common. I hope it works for me. My BP was 220/122 when I began. So it is a bit challenging to imagine what should happen taking this spill beginning at maximum dose.		F	55	5  days	8/23/2009
1	high blood pressure	severe muscle pain,  no stamina, weakness, tiredness, sleepiness!   Just plain lousy.	have had high BP readings for years.   My physician had me on several different meds, but I kept complaining that they made me "dopey".  So he'd try another.   I started with Vasaretic many yrs ago, and it dropped my BP very good, then after a blood test, he took me off! Then it was this merry go round of different companies, trying to find something I could "tolerate".   I thougt Benicar was the answer.   But kept complaining about extreme tireness/weakness etc.  So I had a mucsle biopsy done and the lab said "polymyositis".   Ya sure.  I have been on meds for that for a year now!  But I still feel crappy.   I am going to show this site to my doctor - soon!  Have I been stupid or what! the year 2004 I had my really bad, first wiped out/sleepy event.  Now I know I am not alone!

2	High Blood Pressure	So here I was at the ER for the first time of my life with a frightening tachycardia. This followed a set of unpleasant episodes (palpitations, arythmia and what appears as angina-like symptoms - tight chest, etc). Never had this before. These symptoms had been building-up for a few months.I consider myself at 53 in rather good health and fit: No more than 1 sick day in past 20 years, doing various sports, etc.My cholesterol is a steady 150 total. So I suspected my only medication: Benicar/HCT, 20mg/10, for more than a year. I stopped this, took palliatives such as Hawthorn, CoQ10 and Eucommia, as previous other medications had also annoying side effects. Within 3 weeks the most serious symptoms disappeared.But it took several months for the remaining angina-like symptoms to slowly abate but not completely. So not sure if these are medication-related, yet.	I do not buy the "Herxheimer" syndrom explanation that someone on this forum suggested: tests indicated no sign of infection at all. As the Benicar-enthusiasts of the MP protocol recognize themselves, Benicar hits a lot of receptors beyond what HBP requires. It is clear that long time exposure to these drugs modify your bio-chemical balance in a durable way.Now looking at less disruptive ways to maintain a lower BP.	M	52	18  months	8/9/2009Email
3	High BP	I'm not too sure, but it certainly doesn't have the super depressive mental component that the ACE inhibitors have had for me.  A little sour stomach sometimes after the first hour of taking it.	Lowered numbers from 150s over 100s, to low 130s over low 80s.  Not too bad. I tried about 10 different drugs to lower BP over the last three years.  This one seems to be the least oppressive in terms of side effects.  I don't recommend it, but on the other hand, none of these poisons called "medicines" are anything but compromises.	M	60	60  days	6/2/2009
1	High Blood Pressure	Chest and Back Pain--it is a grabbing pain if I turn a certain way.  Been taking since mid March.  I was put on Exforge in December and did the same thing to the point my Dr. set up 3 heart tests--including a heart cath--my heart is fine.	In my research for Exforge, I found information that this type of pain can be a side effect for people w'Fibromyalgia which I have had since 1993. As of tomorrow 5/18/09, I will be off BenicarHCT.  I believe these 2 meds are beta blockers.	F	71	60  days	5/17/2009
2	Blood Pressure	- Shortness of Breath - Cough- Dry eyes- More frequent urination	It did lower the blood pressure by approximately 10 degrees.	M	30	6  months	4/22/2009
2	Highpertension	None at first then depression, lack of interest, lower back pain started, loss o libido, tired all in progression. Then medium chest pain. Stopped immediately after switching. Was using Narvasc on days above 140 and was worse in combination.		M		8  days	4/7/2009
5	lower bp	NONE	Switched to Benicar HCT from Avaliid, reluctantly. Turned out to be, for me, far superior. Much more alert, never groggy, see things much clearer,doesn't make me sleepy, can take a drink or two with no real effect and has kept my  BP very much under control.	M	74	21  days	3/26/2009
3	HBP	Week feeling, dizziness, headaches, chest pressure, shortness of breath, feel like I can't get enough air, increased anxiety.	Brought BP from 160/100 to 120/80. Diovan worked better with less side effects, but insurance stopped covering it!	M	27	30  days	3/3/2009
5	High Blood Pressure	Dizziness upon standing in the first few days	I love this med, though 1/2 tab works just fine and eliminates the dizziness	F	51	2  years	3/2/2009
1	High Blood Pressure	Shortness of breath, pressure in the chest and back.  Symptoms get worse when climbing stairs or physical exhertion. I wake up at night with my heart racing.		F	55	2  weeks	1/3/2009
3	hypertension	Muscle cramps, primarily in lower limbs, that are intense, prolonged and progressive.  Deep muscle pain through out body.  A sensation of "buzzing" in neck and back of head sometimes at night. Difficulty sleeping.  Fatigue, intense fatigue.	It was only recently that I have begun to identify the relationship between how I feel (constant pain) and the medication.    I am not overweight, cholesteral is not elevated, I am active, tho' not on an exercise program.  I have a healthy diet. The side effects abate if I am off the med for a few days.  Given how I feel, it is not worth it.  There has got to be a better way!!!	F	51	8  months	1/1/2009
4	High Blood Pressure	Restless legs - went away with exercise.  Some occasional muscle pain that improved with regular exercise.	This drug was very effective dropping my blood pressure from 140/100 to 114/78 on average over three years.  Recently, over the last 3 months the diastolic has risen to high 80's with little change in systolic; I don't know why.	M	51	3  years	12/15/2008

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
