3	Crohn's	None for the first several months.  After taking it for 9+ months, I started to notice "prednisone-type" side effects... slow and steady weight gain (up to 20 pounds now), mood swings, etc.  My Dr. then informed me that this has been happening to many people who stay on it for an extended period.	Entecort REALLY helps my symptoms at the 9mg dose but when I was trying to wean, I found I was having a resurgance of symptoms on the 6mg and had to go back to the 9mg.  We're going to try a new drug now.	F	32	1  years9 MG 1X D	3/2/2011
5	Microscopic colitis	None.	Entocort has been very effective for me in controlling symptoms Microscopic Colitis (Collagenous). Initially the dose was 9mg. per day and that dose was gradually reduced to 3mg./day. This medication has been effective for me, where the 5ASAs  -- Asacol and Pentasa  both failed miserably. In fact, I can maintain good copntrol for weeks at 3mg. every other day with  some assistance from a gluten REDUCED diet.	F	73	2  years3mg 1X D	3/1/2011Email
3	Crohn's	None that I can tell	If you have Crohn's symptoms exclusively in your colon, this is made for you. I get problems from mouth to backside, doesn't seem to be helping anything north of my large intestine. Not helping my diahrea (sp?), or severe pain in my stomach.	M	40	3  months6mg 1X D	9/28/2010
4	Crohns	Nothing I can pinpoint on the drug.  I have the usual Crohns stuff, like arthritis and fatigue, no matter what drug I'm on.	This drug has helped.  It seems to be more effective than purinethol or asacol was for me.  I have occasional bad flares and some symptoms while on it.  If I watch my diet and stress levels, then I have mild symptoms.  I had more flares when I was on the other meds.	F	33	3  years3 pills 1X D	6/12/2010Email
