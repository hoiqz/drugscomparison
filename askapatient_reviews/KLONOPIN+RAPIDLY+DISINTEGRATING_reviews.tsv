				F M	 	 	    
1	to withdraw off of ativan	Depression, suicide attempts, depersonalization, lethargic, agoraphobia, and lifeless!	Trying to withdraw has led to many problems including seizures!! I still am tapering off of it!! This should never be prescribed for more than a week!!	F	40	12  months10 4X AN	4/8/2013Email
1	anxiety	dizzy, clumsy, insomnia, poor decision making, night wandering, depression, fear, inner shaking, extreme change in personality	This poison should be removed permanently from the market because it is ruining lives by the thousands.  Doctors are so misinformed and misguided about how these drugs work, and ruining lives of the patients who trust them.	F	72	3  years0.5 MG 1X AN	4/8/2013
1		Horrible debilitating nerve damage and down regulated gaba receptors!		F	42	2  years1mg 1X D	4/8/2013
1	Extreme agitation - Serotonin Syndr	Depressed, no affect	This drug is extremely addictive, especially for people who are poor metabolizers. Coming off this drug was like a descent into hell and has left me with nerve damage and severe irritable bowel for years. Even if you think this drug is helping you, it has the potential to eventually destroy your life!	F	65	1  years2 mg 1X D	4/8/2013Email
4	Bipolar Disorder, high anxiety	Peaceful, no manic symptoms, depressive symptoms started to lift, massive and life-shattering panic attacks vanished immedietly.	I was prescribed this by a psychiatrist who was more interested in dosing me up with something to shut me up than finding a way to quell my problems stemming from living with Bipolar Disorder. After a few attempts that never worked out, this was the medication I settled on. And from the depths of my soul, it was worth it. I had a tiny dose and suddenly I could function as a normal human being again. The world could fall apart at my feet and I'd die with a smile on my face. I would like to clearly state that if you have an addictive personality, you should clearly not take a benzo in the first place. I see a lot of negative reviews on here, generally from people who claim it effected their family, or it effected this or that and "I got addicted" and blah blah blah. I don't doubt it, but perhaps you should have thought about that before taking the damn pill in the first place, hmm? All in all, helped my bipolar disorder on both sides of the coin, and as an added bonus it helped my crippling anxiety.	F	19	2  years.5 MG 1X D	1/4/2013Email
5	Panic w/ Agorophobia	Reduced acne, erection issues (not all the time, and very infrequent)	I can leave my house... I started taking it at 19, I'm 28.  This drug is mostly the reason I can walk outside. It's the only reason I ever met my wife. It's the only reason I didn't just off myself years ago, because fearing the world is really the worst thing any person can go through (almost, next to dying/ cancer... etc)But I am serious... just as deadly to ignore.  Klonopan along with a few other meds (no anti-depressants) have made me "OKAY"	M	28	7  years2mg 3X D	8/1/2012Email
1	anxiety, PTSD	None	Klonopin is a benzodiazepine.  The long-term withdrawal effects are horrendous, even for some people who have taken it for a very short period of time.  You can quickly build up tolerance, with a need to increase dosage.  Do not take this drug!	F	56	7  years0.5 mg 2X D	1/14/2012Email
1	anxiety	Like you dont exist.	Horrible ! I felt like a drone. Worst of the worst medications for anxiety. Dont even try being 10 minutes late taking your dose either or your brain feels like its dying of thirst or something.	F	25	1  months 2X D	6/16/2011
2	Anxiety			F	21	4  years1 MG 1X D	3/14/2011
1	anxiety, depression, panic attacks	I was prescribed this medication mainly for my depression, however it seemed to have a reverse effect on me. I became so depressed that i began cutting my arm up with a knife. I had never cut myself before taking this medicine and have not done so since I stopped taking it. I believe this to be a very dangerous drug, it scares me to see my scars and know that I could have killed myself.	My sister was also prescribed this same medication for her depression, it was crazy because even though we were not even in the same house we both had the same reactions on the very same night. My sister also cut her wrist very badly almost killing herself. My mom almost lost both her daughters on the very same night all because of klonopin!	F	21	5  days0.5 mg 1X D	10/20/2010
5	Panic Disorder	At first I felt a little clumsy and very lethargic, especially in the morning. Now I'm tired sometimes and it's a little hard to get out of bed, but so much better than how I was before.	This drug has been like a miracle for me. I had a recurrence of panic attacks after not having them for 25 years. I was so dizzy I felt that I couldn't drive and function. I almost quit my job, but my doctor tried this and it's been so much better than expected. I don't feel drugged. I take a surprisingly small dose, just 1/8 of a mg twice a day, but it's helped me function whereas I felt on the verge of not being able to before. I'm in cognitive therapy to deal with the anxiety, but this drug has been the extra boost I needed to stay involved in life and not become agoraphobic or unable to drive.

1	seizures	BRAIN DAMAGE! destroyed my memory and cognitive abilities. My IQ was up in the genius range. Now I have trouble making a grocery list. Also caused severe GI problems, including GERD. Hormonal problems. Irregular heartbeats and chest pains. Trouble breathing. Depression. Personality changes. Hellish withdrawal when you try to stop.	This drug should be banned. It ruins lives--seriously. When you first take it, you become a zombie and so you don't notice that's it's changing you, wrecking your brain, altering your personality. by the time you figure it out, you are unwittingly addicted, but when you try to quit you find withdrawal is the WORST TORTURE ever experienced. I spent months vomiting all day, having panic attacks, dizzy, cramps, painful "electric" zaps in my feet (that's from the nerve damage this junk causes, btw). I'm no wimp--but I had to taper for 2 years to get off this stuff, and now that I'm completely off, I'm still having horrendous withdrawal symtoms months later. I know I sound a bit crazed, but trust me, there is no way to be calm in explaining just how harmful this drug (and all benzos) are. Please protect yourself.		36	2.5  years	2/15/2009
2	anxiety, panic attacks	i am feeling drowsy all the time and very lethargic, i am having problems getting motivated and performing sexually, have gained weight(which might also be due to the harsh winter) and ironically am having trouble sleeping at night, i feel like everything is a big effort	helped with my panic attacks, but as my body got more accustomed i feel i needed to increase the dosage...have tried to stop taking but the panic  restarted..when i did come off of it for like 10 days i had bad headaches but my sexual life was much better..now i am back on it and feel i am having a really bad time overall..except i am able to get through work more comfortably..i am a teacher	M	38	4  months	2/2/2009Email
4	Unspecified mood disorder	Drowsiness, especially at night, feeling peaceful, calmness	This medicine has really helped me with stabilizing my mood. I take .5mg of it twice a day along with 20mg of Geodon twice a day, 36mg of Concerta in the morning, and 20mg of Inderal up to three times a day.	F	17	1  years	7/28/2008Email
5	stress disorder	none	even @ taking 1mg every 6 hours or so, I still feel as if I am on the verge of a nervous breakdown at times.  Most days it works wonders though!	F	31	1  weeks	7/7/2008
1		loss of short term memory. Disoriantation every where I went. Thoughts of suicide. Difficult in writing and signing my name. Cannot hold a conversation as my speech has slowed down and in addition cannot focus on conversation.		M	74	 	3/29/2008
3	depersonalization/anxiety	@.25 mg per day:  definite loss of "pep" and mental clarity, some mild loss of motivation, some memory problems and brain fog, some confusion and disorientation	certainly tones down unpleasant emotions, and has been helpful with depersonalization, but it's more like a band aid then anything greatly therapeutic...i've found that vitamins work better for my condition, and only take a little klonopin here and there to fill in any blanks the vitamins leave	M	33	2  months	3/2/2008
3	Depression and Anxiety	Headaches, very tired and drousy	I'm not one for anti depressants but when I started having severe anxiety and depression I decided to take 1 0.5mgs of the generic brand of Klonopin. I felt very tired, dizzy and had light headaches but the anxiety went away. I felt a sigh of relief (probably because I became so tired). I slept extremly well that night and the next night too. One thing I have to say is this drug is highly addictive so be extremly careful. I have never been an addict nor will I be but I believe there is some addictive chemical in this medicine just like cigerettes. So please be extremly careful and only take on dire need.	F	22	1  days	2/21/2008
5	Panic attacks and Nerve pain	Just tired, Dry Mouth	have not had a panic attack since they put me on this for nerve pain after failed back surgery 16 months ago..I was Ativan for 2 years and I still had attacks, after back surgery they used valium and it did nothing then they put me on Klonopin and it helps the nerve pain some but its amazing on the painc attacks...I have no fear of one anymore even....	F	47	7  months	11/26/2007
1	Panic Disorder	Fatigue, complete loss of motivation, irritability, heartburn, weakness, loss of appetite, sexual dysfunction, memory problems, clumsiness. I was taking 0.5mg once daily at bedtime.	I stopped taking this medication because of the side effects and began having horrible withdrawals: Uncontrollable shaking,  disorientation, memory loss, headache, blurred vision, sensations such as the ground shaking/moving, muscle cramps, trouble sleeping, extreme sensitivity to sounds and movements, extreme weakness. Basically, I could hardly function for a week and a half after quitting. I would not recommend this medication as it is not worth all the side effects and is highly addictive even at low doses.Physicians need more information before prescribing these types of drugs and I would also suggest patients do their homework before starting benzodiazepines. I sure wish I would have.	F	29	5  months	10/2/2007

1	stress relief  from chronic illness	HAIR LOSS! I've got long hair that is fine and it has become incredibly thin while taking this pill. I'm hoping since I've stopped taking it, the hair loss will reverse. Why didn't my doctor warn me of this side effect???? Oh yeah, and it caused depression.	I typically took between .25 and .75 mg a day off/on for about 4 months. It did not do anything for my stress levels, but it did knock me out at night. I'm switching to trazodone after this horrible hair loss experience.	F	30	4  months	7/17/2007
1	For sleeping	It made me progressively more incapacitated over a 7 year period until I could hardly get out of bed.  If I had not tapered off the drug, I would not have known that it was NOT my Chronic Fatigue Syndrome just getting worse.	This drug shuld not be taken long term.  Google the *Ashton Manual* and read about Klonopin. Xamax, Valium, and all the bad benzos.	F	50	7  years	7/14/2007
5	SOCIAL ANXIETY	none	Klonopin has helped me so much. Like the person above taking it for social anxiety, I too wished I had been able (afford a doctor) to take this earlier in my life. Before I would be nervous about meeting new people, my fork would shake when trying to eat in front of people that were not family(eventhough I was not nervous), I didn't go to a high school prom (i was asked) i was too shy and didn't want to have to deal with the anxiety, same goes for dates. In college, I would panic if the teacher just wanted me to read out of the book, much less speak in front of the class. One time I just couldn't bare having to wait for my turn to give my opinion on a book we read, I just got up and left. These are only a few examples of what social anxiety has done to me. It started probably in junior high and only got worse. If I had taken this earler, my life would of been a lot easier. But finally at 27 I went to the doctor and was prescribed it.Now I am in my last year of school, I am gettin	F	31	5  days	7/2/2007
4	Panic attacks while flying	I began to feel the effects of slow relaxation within 20 minutes of putting the tab under my tongue, with a deeper feeling of general slowness of movement inside of an hour, but by then I was buckled into my seat on the plane. I was flying to another country with 12 hours in the air and took one every 4-5 hours to prevent severe flying-induced panic attacks. I slept most of the time on the flights, which I cannot normally do. I did not really experience any grogginess or lasting effects except feeling relaxed and unstressed. Even while navigating in airports between flights I did not feel disoriented or confused or sleepy, just relaxed. The only problem I had is when I took 2 dissolve tabs within 3 hours of each other b/c I was concerned over a trans-pacific flight. After taking the 2 tabs during that time fream I didn't fall asleep on the plane so much as I was most-likely unconscious for at least 2-3 hours during the flight. I won't do again as I didn't like the idea of being actuall		F	32	2  days	4/25/2007
5	Social/general  Anxiety	Even at .25 MG taken only as needed, I sometimes feel it is a little too sedating. And if I take it for more than a few days in a row I have to bump the dose up to .5 to get the same calming results. If I have to take it too many days in a row I do get some withdrawal like symptoms when I stop, but nothing bad enough to deter me from using it. In any given 30 day period, I probably only take it intermittently an average of 10-15 of those days.	I am very careful to only take as needed, and do not have an addictive personality, so this drug works well for me. I self-medicated for decades unsuccessfully. This has eliminated the stabs of panic and upset stomach I would almost always get when confronted with a crowd situation. I can sit next to a stranger now without coming unglued inside. Still prefer not to, but can handle it. I have needed something like this since I was in 4th grade or so. Can't imagine what my life would have been like if I had started it then. Might've finished college!	F	38	1  years	4/5/2007
1		after taking for about three weeks and did not take for one day,I start to get shortness of breath, not able to walk and rapid heart rate and I and up at MRI. Doktor gave me prescription because I was nervous temporary, but I never had that kind simptoms us I had after taking clonazepam. I would not recomend to people to take this pils. Doctors must be more careffull when preskribe this kind medication. This could cost you dependency on medication and permanentli damage your heart.				19  days	3/11/2007

3	Panic attacks	Gernerally the wafers took care of my immediate panic attack, but they lasted for such little time and made me so drowsy that I didn't have a change to go through the steps of rationalizing the panic attack before it started up again. I was taking .25 mg and ended up needing to take 4-5 a day, which sort of scared me.	For myself, I found that regular pill form worked much, much better. It lasts longer, keeps me from getting drowsy and I only need 1-2 a day.	F	21	1  years	10/14/2005Email
3	Panic Attacks	None	Paid through the nose to get this instead of generic clonazepam and didn't notice any difference. Both mute, but don't get rid of, my panic symptoms.	F	32	2  times	10/16/2004

4	anxiety accompanying depression	sedating and some short term memory impairment	many people bash benzos.  but they can be very helpful if used correctly.  they also can control mania. i believe best not to use them on a regular basis but i have.  currently i am only taking .25 but i have been up to 2 mg a day and feel much better tapering them down again.  but they have helped me much and maybe without them i could not have held full-time employment after years of hospital, homeless shelters, and pschosis.
