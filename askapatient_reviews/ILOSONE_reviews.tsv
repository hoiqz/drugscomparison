3	NSU - Chlamydia	Side effects are really a pain the a**. Nausea,dizzines,back pain,letargia,stomach disorders,diarrhea. I felt like a dead man walking.	Well,despite the side effects it's the only drug able to kill Chlamydia Thracomathis.I did a first course with Zythromax , 1 gram in a single dosage but it didn't work.I went on Ilosone,500mg.every 6 hours x 7 days and finally my NSU was solved.

5	Whooping Cough (& my baby was)		some notes from MOTHERING magazine, #46, Winter 1988 (Jan., Feb., March), article titled "Whooping Cough", pp. 32-35:Regarding treatment with erythromycin (estolate form, such as ilosone) for 14 days:    "Some forms of erythromycin are more effective than others. The estolate is considered most reliable, providing the least incidence of relapse.... Ilosone, the liquid form of erythromycin given to children, is an estolate. The succinate variety is generally considered least effective." p. 35    "...a 14-day course of treatment is considered essential to avoid relapse...." p. 34    "The nature of the disease process makes treatment of pertussis difficult. While the bacteria, Bordetella pertussis, is actually very responsive to erythromycin, the bacteria produces an endotoxin that is not responsive. The erythromycin will usually eradicate the bacteria within the first five days of treatment (although a 14-day course of treatment is considere	F	2	14  days	9/15/2005
5	#2 (& my baby was)	...continued...	"EARLY intervention with erythromycin...can abort or minimize the course of the illness." p. 34    "...The first two weeks are the prodrome, during which time the symptoms are a runny nose, congestion, and a rather ordinary cough. A diagnosis at this stage is nearly impossible without a culture, and culturing often appears unnecessary. In addition, the cultures are difficult to  read and culturing too early can produce false-negative results...." p. 34 (I believe I have learned somewhere--don't now know where--that culturing after the "whooping" stage begins almost frequently results in a false negative culture...I may have found where!...see under "re testing...")Regarding testing for pertussis (timing is important, as noted above and below). Additionally:    "The culture for pertussis is best taken through the nose and sinus passages. The old method of having the person cough onto a culture plate resulted in many false negatives.

5	#3 Whooping Cough (& my baby was)		...continued...I cannot find my copy of Science News from November 25, 1995 (p. 356 or thereabouts), but believe that this is where I read that a reliable test for pertussis is ONLY available through a research hospital....(This was an article about a study of 130 UCLA students who had sought help for a cough that lasted more than 6 days. Researchers armed with this special test found that 34 of them had undiagnosed infection with B. pertussis.) (There are more similar articles in Science News from April 8, 1995, p. 214 and July 20, 1996, p. 46.)...or maybe what I was looking for is this:    "Even if a physician were to suspect pertussis in an adult, there's no easy way to test for the bug, Nennig [Mary E. Nennig, a researcher at the Kaiser Permanente Pediatric Vaccine Study Center in San Francisco] says. The antibody test used by the Kaiser team remains a research tool and is not available to physicians. (from Science News, July 20, 1996, p. 47)	F	2	142  days	9/15/2005
5	#7 Whooping Cough (& my baby was)		Called doctor's office, finally called again about 5 PM: (nurse practitioner) says "it won't hurt" to give more antibiotic--she still thinks it's allergies with a persistent cough because she has not "gotten sick" (meaning running a fever of 103 degrees)--She kept saying that many children in the 50's died from Pertussis & that's why she doesn't think she has it."About 6 years later (November 30, 1996), when my husband took our youngest child (born in July, 1992) to the emergency room at Brackenridge Children's Hospital because he was coughing and I was terrified that he might be developing whooping cough (or whatever My Daughter had), the doc told him that there had been an outbreak of pertussis in Austin 6 to 6 1/2 years previously.These notes/comments typed out on computer on June 9, 2005.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________	F	2	14  days	9/15/2005

5	#4 Whooping Cough (& my baby was)		(I just found this in my daily notes from when my daughter probably had pertussis in 1990!:) "notes from Beeson & McDermott, TEXTBOOK OF MEDICINE, c. 1967, section on Whooping Cough, Diagnosis, pp. 203-204: "By the 3rd or 4th week of illness the organism can be recovered in only 50% of cases, & in the convalescent stage it is unusual to obtain a positive culture. Also, re bacteriologic diagnosis (p. 204): ...although the trained observer can recognize the small, bisected pearl colonies of Bordetella pertusis within 48 hours, at least 72 hours of growth is usually required."  Then I have a note that says: "(but there is at least 1 other quicker method--done with a fluorescent antibody staining procedure.)..." I don't know if this note comes from the same source....On a more Personal Note:My Daughter developed what we believe was pertussis in around May of 1990. She was 2 1/2 years old, had never had a pertussis shot, and was not totally weaned. I	F	2	14  days	9/15/2005
5	#5 Whooping Cough (& my baby was)		My notes say that she developed a runny nose on 5/1/90, and that on 5/13/90 she "started vomiting & gagging after coughing, first at night, then more during day...difficulty breathing." The doctor treated her for asthma, but that didn't work (and wasted valuable time...). Finally we began treatment with Ilosone on 5/29/90 but it was really tricky getting the med down her as she was throwing up so frequently by that time (she would cough, cough, cough, cough, cough....then vomit....Mostly she threw up "buckets and buckets" of clear mucus, but if she had an episode too soon after eating or taking meds, the food & meds came up too.)At some point she would cough, cough, cough, cough, ...then cough/WHOOP and throw up (I actually made a recording of the WHOOP and took it to the doctor's office, but they weren't impressed). It was generally worse at night...we were both scared to go to sleep before about 2:00 am most of the time...and when we DID finally go to	F	2	14  days	9/15/2005
5	#6 Whooping Cough (& my baby was)		The nurse practitioner at our doctor's office always denied that My Daughter could have whooping cough (she said she "wasn't sick enough--she's not in the hospital--children DIE from this disease!"). She agreed to give us a prescription for Ilosone, but only for a 10-day course (ending 6/8/90). One week after finishing the meds (on Friday,  6/15/90), my notes say "yesterday evening coughing becoming more troublesome again, with choking up mucus & continued last night & throughout day." At 3:00 p.m. I called our doctor's office & talked to the nurse practitioner who "said it was prob. a virus, or allergy, or bacterial--& most prob. bacterial since it seemed to respond to Ilosone...said to wait it out until Monday & then call again if still bad & will give Rx for Ilosone again."The next day she seemed better, but by Wednesday, 6/20/90,  was getting worse, spitting up, & that night was getting "really bad"....Finally	F	2	14  days	9/15/2005
