5	Reactive Airway Disease	Initially when I started, it felt like I drank too many cups of coffee.  But over time my body adjusted to it and now have no side effects from it.	I seem to use it more in the winter.  Hardly ever in the spring and summer.  Really clears up any wheezing quickly.  Good stuff.	M	51	25  yearsAs needed 2X W	1/16/2013

4	Asthma induced breathing difficulty	Weakness especially when standing, light-headedness, feeling anxious and overwhelmed.	Ventolin does help me breathe so it is worth the side-effects.	F	33	20  years5mg 6X D	12/17/2012Email

3	allergies/asthma	I've been taking ventolin since I was a kid only when needed during allergy season. I never had any side effects until I hit my 20s. Practically my whole body tremors, I feel light headed, jittery and almost paranoid. I can't handle it anymore. It has always helped me breathe but the side effects have become too intense for me.

1	Have Bronchitis, sinusitis	Due to bronchitis, they offered me this pump. The first 2 days I took it seemed fine.When mixed with qvar, I almost passed out, lightheaded and immediately my arm hurt and leg all on my left side. I thought I as experiencing a stroke. I was really trembling and didn't know what to think of it? Doctor said try again , maybe you held you breath too long after inhaling.Same thing happened all over again with qvar and ventolin.	My arm is still bothering me and heart-rate is irregular, it has been 3 days now.Got off of it all. Never had athsma before and managing with parsley, garlic, honey, and ginger to surpress my cough and give my lungs a break.I was on nasal med, antibiotic, and these pumps.I feel for you who ca not breath. I can't imaging life dependant on this pump. Plus I experienced major anxiety with it.	F	37	  1X D	10/3/2011Email
4	Asthma	MASSIVE anxiety and mania if used longer than a few days in a row. I get jealous, suspicious and have out of control rage at those I love the most and cant seem to stop being agitated and furious for sometimes days on end. I used to just think it was 'that time of month' but it is definitely from this.  I am over-sensitive to lots of poisons and have history of anxiety in the family anyway but this triggers it badly and I am so glad most people arent affected like this as it definitely saves lives.	Without it I would probably be dead but my manic attacks have almost killed me at times too (depression and thoughts of suicide once Ive alienated those I love because of my rage). If I only use it once or twice a week its a lifesaver but for any more than a couple of days in a row and Im a mess. I have to be VERY careful with it and only use it for emergencies and take my daily preventer's instead. This is hard because I try regularly to get off them because I dont feel 'right' while on them. I have had success being asthma free for a few years in between with perfect diet and exercise but thats very hard to maintain. Asthma is MUCH more debilitating than most poeople acknowledge. It has ruled my life for so long now and Im almost sure its just something we all have from pollutants in food/air/water. I wish you all luck <3	F	35	14  years 1X AN	9/13/2011Email
3	Asthma	When I was a child it made me shaky, and if I had to take a lot, it would give me a headache and even make me vomit. When I reached my 20s the shakiness felt much more like intense panic and my heart beat so fast it felt like it would burst. I can't make myself take it anymore because it's such a frightening and distressing experience. I only need it when I have a cold, but now I'll tolerate that feeling of sucking air through an itchy drinking-straw for days without daring to take Ventolin. Also, my uncles and aunts all grew out of asthma after puberty (they mostly missed out on Ventolin as kids), but I never grew out of it and can't help wondering if the childhood Ventolin made it worse.	I'm sure it saved my life many times when I was a child and my asthma was worse than it is now. I used to feel like it was magic. As an adult I seem to have sensitised to it, so I can't take it at all now. Bricanyl's the same with me - wish there was something else!	F	32	25  years 1X M	5/3/2011
5	Asthma	Slight trembling of hands, nervousness	Overall Ventolin has been a godsend. It has returned my breathing to normal many times when exercise and allergies have triggered potentially serious asthma reactions. Sometimes have mild side effects of some trembling after taking a dose, but it is very mild and disappears soon.	F	31	20  years 1X AN	4/16/2011
5	Asthma	Tremors, Slightly spacey feeling in my head.	I have had asthma since I was 13 years old. I've been on numerous medications to try and control it, and the only medication I've ever taken that as worked better than Ventolin is Xopenex. This medicine keeps me breathing, and allows me to live a normal life. Thank God for this medicine. I can live with the skeletal reflexes (the tremors). We all have to live with them. This stuff literally gets me through my day sometimes.	F	26	5  years90mcg 2X D	1/18/2011
5	asthma	none	loved the dose counter, allowed me to know how many puffs were left	M	20	365  days90mcg 1X D	12/26/2010
4	asthma	shaking and weakness immediately, especially in arms and legs, slightly elevated heart rate (but my heart rate is usually low so within normal range), lightheadedness.  The following day i usually have a mild throat irritation.  It may also be giving me a mild eczema rash on my arms but since i mostly get asthma with exposure to perfumes or pollen, these could be causing the rash instead.	because of the sore throat and feeling like i need to lie down for half an hour or so after using it, i use my inhaler as little as possible, but it does relieve the breathing issues remarkably well and i never go anywhere without it.

4	Asthma	Tremors, anxiety attacks	Look, Ventolin gets the job done. I take a high dose with albuterol, and I someimes get the most disturbing tremors, they consume my entire upper body.  It scares the poeple I'm around, and it scares me as well, but the fact is I need it.  I was born with asthma, so I don't get it easy, we don't get it easy.  It works, and the side effects are a small price to pay to keep me breathing.	F	15	2  years	1/17/2010
5	Asthma	tremors, adrenaline	Sometimes this medication makes me feel a little weird, but the bottom line is that it stops an asthma attack. It's also been great now that I have gotten the flu and have had my chest get tight a few times. I don't use it much. This is an "in case of emergency" drug and I wouldn't go anywhere without it.	M	17	5  years	10/14/2009
4	asthma	I NOW HAVE BARRETS ESOPHOGUS DISEASE. AFTER MUCH RESEARCH, HAVE FOUND THAT THIS MEDICATION RELAXED MY ESOPHAGAL SPHINCTER WHILE ALSO RELAXING MY BRONCHIAL PASSAGES. THIS MAY HAVE ALOOWED ACID FROM THE STOMACH TO THE ESOPHOGUS, THEREBY PERMENANTELY SCARRING IT.	THE VENTOLIN WORKED WELL AT RELIEVING THE SYMPTOMS, BUT AT A COST NOW THAT IS NOT AFFORDABLE TO ME .  ALL DRUGS HAVE SIDE EFFECTS. SOME TAKE YEARS TO REAR THEIR HEADS.	M	53	30  years	2/15/2009Email
4	Asthma	None so far but sometimes doesn't always control attack		F	31	22  days	2/11/2009
5	Asthma	Jittery	Possibly because I started it young, and was on it very regularly, I didn't really get anxiety or even the jitters very much. I only seem to get jittery if I have the nebuliser version, where you hold a mask over your face and breathe the vaporised stuff for several minutes. Then I get trembly, but I really don't think it makes me anxious.So - the jitters probably won't bother you, and either way, the relief is pretty fantastic.	F	20	17  years	4/28/2008
3	Asthma	As a child i suffered with asthma and was prescribed ventolin. I had uncontrollable tremors for hours after taking the drug As a child i truly hated it because it increased my heart rate so much that i could actually hear my heart beat in my chest I am 26 now and i still notice that my hands tremor slightly I believe that this is a result of this drug	like someone else said the tremors and increased heart rate was a small price to pay in order to breathe. Without it i may have died	F	26	7  years	11/9/2007
5		Minimal side-effects.  Slightly-increased heart-rate and an increased sense of alertness, lasting for about 15-minutes. Relief lasts between 4 and 6 hours.	I have the non-inflammatory varient of Asthma.  It is triggered almost exclusively by stress, in my case.  There is a dogma, amongst medical professionals, which has it that all Asthma patients should be taking steroids to reduce their intake of short-acting Beta2-Agonists, such as Ventolin.  My experience of steroid treatment is that it induces psychosis in me, driving-up my stress levels beyond anything acceptable, and to the point where my Ventolin consumption rises above my customary 2 - 4 single inhalations, per day.  I have managed my Asthma with Ventolin since the product was first made available.  I have never developed a resistance to it, nor found it to bring me anything other than almost instant relief.  I had bronchitis, last year, and the Doctor insisted on prescribing me a variety of increasingly-potent steroid inhalers.  Each produced degrees of confusion or outright psychosis in me, along with 24-hour bouts of hives, plus increased breathlessness. Recovery only began wh	M	52	35  years	10/20/2007
5	Asthma	None. Same for my sister, and she's been taking it even longer than me (I'm 17 and I started taking it age 3).	Works well, I'm very pleased with it, never let me down. I more commonly use Bricanly inhaler now, doctor changed medication when I had a bad bout of asthma, but it always did the job for myself and my sister.	M	17	14  years	6/2/2007
4	Asthma	Hyperactivity and faster heart beat when my son resumes medication after not using it for several months.  He takes 1-2 puffs 3 times a day during spring and early fall.	My son acts like he has ADHD when he initially starts medication.  He has difficulty sitting in his chair.  He seems to have a faster heart beat in gym class. Fortunately, the side effects disappear in a week after restarting medication.	M	8	3  years	5/27/2007
5	Asthma	Shaking and impatience	It's a stimulant.  I hate how jittery it makes me, but it a small price to pay for being able to breath.  It almost always works right away.	M	28	20  years	4/10/2007
4	Asthma-related cough	Trembling all over after use, for up to half an hour, accompanied by slight dizziness and disorientation.		F	21	1  months	1/4/2007
1	bronchitis	I took it a few times and it gave me horrible fevers, tremors, and hallucinations for years. It nearly killed me.	I would not recommend this for small children.	F	20	3  days	10/7/2006
1	Astma	Rapid heart-beat. Also I feel that although it gives an "instant fix", overall Ventolin makes my condition worse & I have to take more steroids & it takes longer to recover from an attack. I manage my condition much better without it.	Ventolin mistakenly gives patients the feeling that they are instantly "cured". This is dangerous, as they then continue with energetic activity. The best thing to do is to rest as much as possible to allow your body to recover. Other drugs, such as Becotide, work more slowly, but the results last longer. Using Becotide, with resting as much as possible during an attack, means I have less attacks & recover much more quickly. Ventolin is very dangerous, as it quickly builds up a dependece, which means high profits for the drug companies, but is very bad for the asthma sufferer.	F	46	10  days	9/29/2006Email
2	asthma	terrible palpitations	I've been taking ventolin since I was a kid, but it stopped working for me.  I spent a year with terrible asthma attacks before the doctors realized the ventolin just wasn't helping me.  I've switched to Atrovent (as needed), and that's working much better.	F	33	27  years	5/20/2006
3	Asthma	All over trembling, dizzyness & weakness.		M	26	26  years	4/6/2006
4	Asthma	Shaky hands		F	29	26  years	7/21/2005
5	asthma	shakiness (Only when taking more than 2 puffs at a time)	Love this brand, seems to be the best out there.	F	22	20  years	4/29/2005
