5	Dermatitis Herpetiformus	Initially my white blood count was low off and on.Upon taking it for the first time my -entire- body, which was completely plagued with sores, was completely free of the DH in slightly over 2 weeks.	I was told to take it as needed for DH due to celiac. For some people with DH it cures the issue after some time, however, I can only go about 2 days without it after taking it for over a week. Upon the 2 days of missing it I find a few sores on my elbows, knees and, occasionally, scalp; I can feel the pain recede after taking it when I've gone too long without it. Unfortunately, I will be a life-time dependent on Dapsone.

4	Undiagnosed skin condition	Diarrhoea / frequent lose bowel movements and soft stools / bloatedness.  Some nerve tingling in legs.	The rash cleared almost immediately and the drug prevented further flare-ups.  However, eventually the side effects were worse than the effects so I stopped.  Now taking it again for PCP prophylactic.  Ho-hum.	M	34	16  years	7/4/2004
4	Dermatitis Herpetiformis	Possible sensory neuropathy, muscle cramps?	Cleared condition very well within a day or two, being evaluated for possible side effects mentioned, not sure this medication is the cause.	M	47	2  years	3/14/2004
