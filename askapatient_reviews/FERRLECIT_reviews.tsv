4	Iron deficiency anemia	Blurred vision, lightheadedness, edema.	Have combated the first two side effects by doubling the amount of saline to 250ml and slowing the infusion time down to 100.  Using diuretic to combat the edema.  Have recently cut dose in half to 62.5 every four weeks.  This drug is a lifesaver for me since I don't absorb iron at all.	F	54	4.5  years	12/28/2009Email
1	Sickle cell anemia	Blurred vision, nausea and light headedness, and severeabdominal pain	I would not recommend this drug to anyone! I have been afraid ever since I took it of what the long-term negative effects may do to my body. I just checked it all about a year ago and started my Oxygen Therapy Program. Today I am healthier than I have ever been.	F	53	6  months	11/3/2009Email
