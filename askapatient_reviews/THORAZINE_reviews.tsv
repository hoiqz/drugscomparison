1	uncontrollable hiccups	I was hospitalized for a ruptured appendix and had a reaction to the anesthesia, which resulted in uncontrollable hiccups.  The doctor ordered me Thorazine, and I had a reaction of psychosis, was very manic, couldn't sleep, was angry and nasty. The reaction lasted 4 days. The hiccups never went away.  I do not recommend this medication to anyone.		M	56	4  days	5/11/2009Email
1	Bipolar type 2	Tardive Dyskinesia-Tongue was frozen.	This had to have been the most terrifying medication I have ever taken. It's a good thing I only found out the symptoms could be permanent after they went away.	F	23	1  days	3/25/2009

F	43	5  months	6/18/2008
1	attempt to help with depression	was having migraines at the same time & was being given compazine for that nausea.  All of a sudden, I couldn't walk or even coordinate my hands to feed myself.  Went to ER & they realized initially that compazine causes these parkinson like symptoms.  They stopped the compazine immediately but didn't realize that the thorazine was also causing the parkinson like symptoms which was why the symptoms didn't go away after stopping just the compazine.  It took over a month & going to a neurologist for him to realize that the continued parkinson symptoms were being caused by the thorazine even after stopping the compazine.  Both meds cause these symptoms & after both were stopped it took about another month for the symptoms to go away.  I couldn't coordinate my hands & needed help just to walk.  I couldn't even walk myself into the bathroom so had to wait for my husband to get home from work just to go to the bathroom.  It took so long for the Dr's to realize the symptom	I was on the combination for about 6+ months before the symptoms just immediately showed up.  It didn't even help with the depression & high anxiety level that I was having so it definitely wasn't worth the side effects.	F	46	 	2/16/2007
3	chronic hic-ups	taken 48 hrs ago- slept 21 of the next 24 hrs, now I havent been able to sleep since and so far Ive gone from very happy to very angry to very depressed in the last 12 hrs. Knocked the hell out of those hic-ups though.	Emergency room administers Thorazine for chronic hic-ups and nausia, but I dont recommend it unless you REALLY need it.	M	34	1  days	7/17/2006
5	Insomnia	Nothing else worked long term by itself.  Take 100 mg. with Chloryl Hydrate (Somnote 4*500 mg.) before bed.  I can now sleep sometimes 13 hours (on weekends only).  I get up relatively refreshed (vice other meds), ready for work.  Multiple traumatic brain injuries require 7-9 hours sleep, else hallucinations (no lie).	Dry mouth is a bummer, but I'm getting used to it.	M	47	16  days	3/22/2006
3	anxiety, suicidal ideation	sleepy knocks you out for a long time which was good for me. woke up unrefreshed though.	took 10 25mg and slept for 32 hours!	F	19	6  months	3/3/2006
1	Mental Illness	I slept almost all day and felt like taking my life when I was awake and did not know why I was feeling like this.	I will never take this medication again. I never slept so much in my life and I did not like feeling like killing myself, stop taking.	F	32	3  days	9/6/2005
1	A So-Called Schizophrenic Process	Temporary-but-frightening loss of creativity; overall depression; weight-gain; water-retention; sleep-paralysis; short period of flatulance; lowered libido; brief episodes of blindness; drowsiness; jaundice.	Prescribed in late summer of 1973.  Off in spring of 1976.  See my entry under Navane.  I recommend this even less than Navane.  Although I was misdiagnosed, I don't think that was fully responsible for side-effects.  Just a nasty drug.	F	52	3  years	7/11/2005
1	bipolar II	extreme physical agitation combined with a zombielike mind state	horrible stuff. Got off it as soon as possible	M	38	1  weeks	2/9/2005
5	just for fun	couldn't understand anything	wow	M	38	1  days	10/15/2004
1	Recreation	Extreme salivation. Tightness in throat. Excessive sleep: It knocked me out for 13 hours.	Tried this in high school as a cheap substitute for Quaaludes. It became apparent why this is given to psychotics. The sole purpose of this drug is to knock you out. I threw the remaining tablets I possessed into the garbage. This is not a recreational drug.
