4	cough that had gone on for 2 weeks	none; son liked the grape flavor, helped him sleep without coughing.Doctor recommended it.		M	6	2  days	11/1/2012
4	cough, possibly Whooping Cough	Positive effect:  Unexpected relief from neuropathic pain! Undesirable effect:  Histamine-type skin itching reaction all over and migrating, which was helped by taking an oral antihistamine (Tagamet off label use - Benadryl leaves me too hung over the next day).  I worry about side effects I've read about on Erowid (great site also) of depression and cognitive issues, and building tolerance.  Luckily it's working for me at low doses and I won't go beyond that if it stops being effective as I'm not interested in recreational doses.	Dextromethorphan in various cough syrups was the only thing that seemed to help my 8 week cough after a cold, which might have been Whooping Cough.  Nebulizers and an albuterol inhaler made it worse.  DXM also helped a great deal with peripheral neuropathy and neuropathic pain that I suffer from long-term chronic infection, which was a surprise.  Apparently DXM, like Guaifenesen, can act as an analgesic for some.  I have slept better on it than in years.  On Delsym I'm able to take only 5mg, or half of an adult dose and get relief from the cough, pain, and insomnia for the whole night and it tastes like candy. So far I feel better the next day as well, and not hung over like with other pain or sleep meds.  Maybe it will be a new tool in achieving a better quality of life by alleviating certain types of pain and insomnia.  Hopefully side effects and building tolerance won't interfere.

2	bronchial cough	Light-headedness and insomnia.	For me, it wasn't worth the price. Moderately effective, but wouldn't let me sleep and caused light-headedness.	F	60	14  days	1/6/2007
