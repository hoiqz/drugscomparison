3	BP	Re Post from11/3/2012	I have reverted back to straight 16mg daily instead of 16+.Its made a big difference as the cronic side effects slowly subside,pressure is normal.Moderate sinus & throat gunk problem occuring lately,dont know yet if the sinus problem is related to attacand.I will post the outcome when known.	M		 16mg 1X D	2/14/2013
1	Hypertension	Peripheral Neuropathy,Muscle Pain	Had been taking Diovan 160 for many years.Diovan made my toes numb.Doctor suggested Atacand 16mg.From Day 1 ,Atacand created more numbness in entire foot and some fingers plus muscle cramping/pain in legs.Just didn't work for me so I went back to Diovan 160 and the numbness reduced to just my toes again.	M	70	3  months16 1X D	1/18/2013
1	Hypertension	Depression, lethargy, intolerance to heat, feeling of 'doom', significant weight gain, aching joints.	The longer I took Atacand, the worse I felt, and it didn't significantly decrease my blood pressure.  I asked my Dr. to change the medication and feel much better now that I am on Teveten.  Additionally, the Teveten is lowering my blood pressure more effectively than Atacand did.	F	53	1.5  years4 mg 2X D	1/11/2013
1	Hypertension	Severe joint pain and sinusitis. Anxiety. And this was only 4 mg. Worked well for my BP But it has been 5 days off and the joint pain is actually  getting worse. I will try to manage the BP some other way. Not worth it. I know people who are on a much higher dose and are fine. This was a horrible drug. The side effects became worse as time went on.				1  months4mg	11/22/2012
2	BP	Unbearable allover cronic muscle pain,BP down.	Have stopped taking Atacand 2 weeks ago, my body is slowly returning to normal. I feel great.Atacand was my only med.I can lift a cup of coffee,but BP up.	M		 16+ 1X D	11/3/2012
1	high blood pressure	Severe nausea and fatique.  sometimes related to moderate heat and exercise  sometimes not. the unwell feeling was so severe that I went to bed or the hospital on a couple of occasions...     felt that I was incacerated in my own body...      a terrible experience.    was a terrible drug for me....my cardiologist said that I had a sense of doom , undoubtedly caused by this drug....	my experiences are totally different than the side effects listed by the drug company...   this drug should be investigated!

2	Medium High Blood Pressure			M	55	 16 1X D	7/29/2012EmailHistory
1	high blood pressure16m	depression, fatigue, wieght gain, muscle cramps, shortness of breath, arthritic joints, exhaustion, heart burn, forgetfullness and foggy head. This has been a life crushing drug for me.	took myself of this drug, my MP insisted that I could not have any of these side effects from atacand.  finally quit aticand and all the drugs i took to counter its side effects. BP is 220/118 but at least i have some quality of life.  trying to find alternatives, but doctors are not  empathetic. I  do NOT recommend atacand!	F	53	 16mg/12.5 1X D	5/6/2012Email
1	Kidney Protection	I posted the note below as well. So second day off of meds and I cannot speak! I went to the Dr. and he said it swelled my voice box up and my sinuses and that I may not talk for a few days yet. He figures up to 5 days. Takes 48 hours for the drug to leave your body, but the side effects a little longer. This stuff is poison. I can't take any bp meds.. so good thing bp is good from all the walking but my kidney is not protected. Rather have quality of life though. This is misery.	You are not crazy if you are experiencing panic, anxiety, sinus infections, sore throat, burning throat, swollen voice box... get OFF this drug! Most Dr's are not even aware of the extreme side effects for some people. Mine was not but I educated him and looking at my throat today, he could see it was not B.S.	F	48	5  days4 1X D	3/26/2012Email
1	Kidney Protection	This stuff is not good for me. They had me on it back in 2006 and I had wicked panic attacks.. a sinus infection that lasted a year... I felt like I was going insane... I found this board in 06 and saw what someone had written about his panic attacks and realized it was the drug and I took myself off of it.. don't do that, though.. my bp spiked but it normalized again. Anyway, because my one and only kidney leaks protein and recently increased the dr convinced me to try atacand again at a much lower dose... same problems starting all over again... started in the sinus... now it feels like my throat and esophagus are on fire... lots of phlegm, coughing... just feel crappy. So tomorrow back to my water pill. It keeps my bp steady but unfortunately does not have the kidney protection atacand does... not sure what to do about that...	I hate this crap. What really bugs me is you are given something to make something better but it creates a bunch of other problems.. not quality of life to me.	F	48	5  days4 mg 1X D	3/25/2012Email
3	hi blood pressure	dizzy, memory problems..upset stomach..muscle aches...added 4 mg pill as 8 not enough and more severe problems occured..breathing,lethargic, dopey,depressed,libido...		M	57	8  years8 1X D	3/4/2012

2	high blood pressure	depression and thoughts of "what is life for?"Never had any thoughts like that except when I took its cousin Benecar.	Try something else.	F	63	5  weeks5mg 1X D	1/31/2012Email
3	high blood pressure	After three weeks, I notice an almost chronic sore throat.  Have had two episodes of foot cramps so bad I was disabled.  Had to get out of bed to "unclaw" my foot.    Sore back a lot.	Previously on Lisinopril for 8 years but the coughing was so bad I couldn't take it any more.   After three weeks off Lisinopril,  the cough seems to be better, now replaced by a sore throat.	F	60	3  weeks16 mg 1X D	12/18/2011Email
1	high blood pressure	This drug gave me such severe anxiety I was mostly bed ridden for 3 months.   I lost 30 pounds in 3 months, could not work, and had no life.  I went from an extremely active person to a nothing.  The cardiologists said no one else had reactions to it.   I changed doctors and was put on tribenzor which gave me  most of my life back,  I am still taking anxiety medication because of the damage this drug did to me,   I am  not able to work full time yet but hope to soon.     I wouldn't give atacand to my worst enemy.		F	76	3  months32 mg 1X D	12/16/2011Email
5	High Blood Pressure	No side effects - a miracle!	I am super sensitive to all drugs, so I can take almost nothing without bad side effects and allergies.  I had been on Tenormin (atenolol) for many years, but it no longer was controlling my blood pressure, it was only lowering my heart rate (something I needed in addition to BP reduction).  I (worriedly) added Atacand to my Tenormin regime in hopes of lowering my uncontrolled BP.  What I really liked was I had no side effects and also the fact that there was no cumulative effect on blood pressure or heart rate reduction between the two - the Atacand controlled only my high blood pressure and the Tenormin continued to control only my heart rate.  Another thing I like is that it is short-acting so I knew when I started it that if there was a problem, I could stop it and it would be out of my system in a few hours.  I started small (1/4 of a 4mg tab) to test it out and found no side effects, just a reduction in my blood pressure - a miracle for me!  Now I take an amount based on my current blood pressure - that way I don't overdo it if my BP happens to be low and I don't under-dose it if it's high - the smartest way to dose a short acting drug (take only what you need).  So for me personally, I take (3x a day) 1/2 a 4mg tab if my BP is in the 130's, 3/4 of a 4mg tab if it's in the 140's and a whole 4 mg tab if it's 150 or above.  I take 50mg Tenormin 3x a day along with it to keep my heart rate below 80.  No sleepiness, dizziness or cough! GREAT DRUG!!	F	51	1  years2-4mg 3X D	11/13/2011Email
3	High	First prescribed Atacand HCT 32/12.5. Dizziness tired, lowered libido. Switched to 16/mg/12.5 & no dizziness. I recently tried cutting back to 1every other day that helped libido issue but bp crept up. Dr said it must be taken everyday.		M	62	5  years16 1X D	9/17/2011
4	high blood pressure	have no side effects other than insomia,but i read an article on the internet that said during a research with this medication they found out that it could increase your chance of getting cancer,has anybody heard about that.		M	50	7  days32 mgs 1X D	9/16/2011
1	hypertension	Vertigo, dizziness, sinusitis, lower back pain, nausea, weakness in limbs and neck.	Slightly effective as a hypertensive med, but the side effects have disabled me  completely. Side effects took about 1 month to appear, so I didn't connect worsening health with the meds.Currently being weaned off this.Was on Bisoprolol Fumarate too, but forgot to take on hols and daily nausea disappeared within 3 days.I don't intend taking any other BP meds again - I get too many side effects.  Will try Far Infra-Red therapy.	F	52	18  months16mg 2X D	8/14/2011Email
2	hypertension	TAKEN FOR 2 MONTHS AND WAS BADLY BLOATED EVERYDAY. DID NOT REALIZE IT WAS CAUSING MY BLOATING UNTIL I ACCIDENTLY FORGOT TO TAKE IT.IT IS NOT A  PLUBLISHED SIDE EFFECT. IT DID LOWER MY BP. MY DOCTOR LISTENED AND STARTED ME ON A NEW BP DRUG.		F	61	2  days16-24mg 1X D	8/11/2011
3	Hypertension	Fatigue, Lethargy, Exhaustion, Palpitations, out of breath after minimal activity.		M	30	 16mg 2X D	6/29/2011Email
2	HBP	Loss of libidio, clogged ears and nose not starting to have minor blurred vision.		M	52	90  days5 1X D	6/12/2011Email
4	HBP	None that I have noticed.	Seems to work pretty good	M	52	2  years32mg 1X D	6/10/2011Email
3	Hypertension	Very mild anxiety/confusion. Slight tiredness, possibly due to difficulty sleeping (previously never an issue). Nightmare is probably too strong but now having "dark" dreams which awaken and having trouble getting back to sleep. The anxiety issue often occurs at this point equating to getting out of bed either very early for the day, or watching TV and then returning to bed.	Was previously on Norvasc to treat my hypertension. Excellent results in terms of BP, but swollen ankies and fluid retention a problem. Therefore changed to Atacand on GPs advice. BP on Atacand also very good. Have own BP Unit and no change in BP seen since change	M	50	20  days8MG 1X D	5/8/2011Email
2	hypertension	dizziness, nausea, sweating, lethargic..... don't want to move. insomnia,just feel unwell. Stopped taking it for 1 week and felt great.Thirsty all the time and can't tolerate heat in summer on this drug. Dry mouth all the time just on 4 mg. Dr. thinks I'm nuts and couldn't possibly be having these side effects on this dose. I am very sensitive to drugs and this one is no exception. Worried about what I can take next to contol my BP. I do not feel well on this drug and I don't want to do anything therefore I have gained weight while on it. Wish I could get off it completely. Just had complete blood test and it came out fine so I know these side affects are from this drug and not from something else. Have had reactions to several other drugs for BP as well. Also I have  muscle aches all over all the time on this drug and they went away when I quit it for a week.		F	56	1  years4mg 1X D	2/23/2011Email
3	high blood pressure	Arthritis of hands, never had problems before.  Numbness of fingers and toes.  Leg cramps.  Tiredness and exhaustion. Mental confusion and eyesight affected.  Hair thinning.  Most side effects have coincided with the move from 16 mg to 32mg.	Will be seeing doctor about other options.	M	63	7  months32 1X D	2/21/2011Email
3	High BP	Fatigue, Feeling unwell, stuffy feeling in my Head,tiredness and some depression every so often. Took Crestor Cholesterol lowering Medication. Got off that as it was poisioning Me. My Legs got much better but still found that now Atacand was also coursing me dramas.	Amazing when Doctors and even Specialists tell you that taking this Drug amongst other Drugs that they are classed as being good for you because they do what they are supposed to do. What is often forgotten is; That many Patients are Not listened to when they tell their Doctor that they are severely affected by it and look at you as if You" are just imagining it. Fix one thing and poision you with another. What is the point of that? I may as well die earlier but at least I would have felt better during that time I had and enjoyed it more. Stay of Statins. They are really bad. Reasearch has found that high Colesterol is not the problem but why higher cholesterol is being produced in the first place? read and research more about this. You'd be surprised. read about Palin and his conclusive research.Instead; Try Vitamin C, L- Lysine, Vitamin B, Enzime Q10 and L-Proline as an alternative for the correct treatment.	M	56	2  years8 1X D	2/19/2011Email
5	high blood pressure	Very sore throat and hoarse voice - couldn't sing! - as well as dizziness on 4 mg every morning. No side effects on 2 mg, but I always take it at night. It seems to make me sleep better, and I must sleep through the hoarseness. My doctor did not believe the sore throat was from the Atacand, but it was.		F	58	1.5  years2 mg 1X D	2/11/2011
2	high BP	I suffered with a backache and other aches a pains for ten years. First few years it caused excessive sweating a night and stomach pain. After taking this drug for ten years I became incredibly allergic to it. My drug plan decided that I should cut a 32mg pill in half instead of taking 16mg twice daily and that triggered the allergic reaction. Go Figure.		F	69	10  years32 1X D	12/14/2010Email
3	High Blood Pressure	New doctor increased dose to 8 mg this summer.  Not sure it's the drug, but have been very lethargic, depressed, nauseous, stomach problems, intestinal problems, generally not feeling well.	I've decided to cut back on my own to 4mg a day.  When I took that dose I felt fine.  I'll wait 2 weeks see how I feel and go back to my doctor.	F	55	6  years4 1X D	12/7/2010
4	HBP	None that I have noticed.		M	65	3  months16mg 2X D	11/8/2010
4	high blood pressure	none noticed	The first med I tried made my head feel like it was full of cement. I have felt much better on Atacand but my bp is starting to creep up again. I am trying to increase my exercise time and lose 20-30 pounds in hopes that I can keep the bp down without having to increase the dose of Atacand.	F	60	3  years16 mg. 1X D	10/13/2010
3	systolic hypertension	blurry vision, floaters, sinus problems, post nasal drip, painful feet and hands, bone pain		F	74	 4 mg 1X D	9/26/2010
5	high blood pressure	none thus far	began to control my blood pressure within a few days.  Was previously on Benicar for 6 years and began to experience asthma like symptoms, blood sugar problems, etc.  Took Accupril for a couple of weeks and it gave me chest pains.  This drug at 16 mg. has brought my pressure down from 148/88 to 110/70.  Great so far!	M	42	1  weeks16 mg 1X D	9/24/2010
3	Hypertension	Moved from 16mg to 32mg. BP now under control. Side effects include a feeling of breathlessness, feeling of heart racing/skipping, dry cough on deep exhaling and slight depression.		M	48	30  days32mg 1X D	9/17/2010
2	H BP	Both my forearms fell numb, my fingers can not grip as well, slight ear ringing, dizzyness.	I'm testing this medicine (7 days now), I feel if I lose about 40 pounds I may not have to take.  I will continue to monitor my BP.  I'm about 140/78.  Don't know much about Atacand but I'm expeiencing some side effects.	M	52	7  days8 MG 1X D	9/7/2010
5	Hypertension	No side effects.	I tried several durgs such as HZTZ, Atenol, Lisinopril etc. All had side effects. This helped me. Now I had changed my insurance (to Kaiser) and it seems they don't allow this , so I shall have to switch to naother cheaper medicine such as cozaar. I wish my insurance supports it.	M	40	1  years16 1X D	7/12/2010
4	High Blood Pressure	I've had side effects from 5 different medications, I must take something to lower my blood pressure, as my B.P. is extremely high (and everyone in my family died of heart disease)  this one seems to be the least invasive.	I take 32mg. but I cut in in 2, half in the a.m. and the other half at night.  This works best for me. I wake up around 5.30 a.m. but that's a small price to pay.  IIt keeps my B.P. lower than taking 32mg. once a day.  It also made me depressed, but I do cardio excercise 3 times a week, and long walks the other days, which takes care of the depression.  So far, it has the least side effects.	F	66	6  months32mg-Split 2X D	6/24/2010Email
1	High Blood Pressure	Depression, Apathy, Unable to walk farther than 2 blocks, Exhaustion and Fatigue	I thought that the side effects were caused by something else.  It really didn't help my High BP much either. I was seriously considering taking an Antidepressant except ALL my symptoms cleared up in 2 weeks after stopping Atacand.  What a crappy and dangerous drug.	F	52	2  years8 mg 1X D	6/22/2010
3	high blood pressure	Lightheadedness sometimes. Weakness in legs that I've never had in my life is my main problem. Some diarea.	My blood pressure is down. Other meds made my heart race and made me cough constantly	F	56	2  months16 mg 1X D	6/21/2010
3	hypertension	Shortness of breath, weight gain because of poor stamina I live to cycle. Itchy blistery skin. DEPRESSION all around rotten feeling. I quit taking it as I was tired of living. Now I feel great but my BP is up.	It was the best BP medicine I've tried to date as far as side effects go. The side effects came on so slowly I never even thought it was the pills making me feel so bad.	M	50	3  years16 1X D	6/1/2010Email
3	HP	Back pain, muscle cramps, some depression, uneven blood pressure counts.	Horrible medication at exhorbitan price. However, my nephrologist says it is good for my failing kidneys,so that is my one consideration.  It is either Atacand or die.	M	82	 8mg 2X D	5/14/2010
3	High bloodpressure	dizzyness, muscle cramps at night in legs, bathroom 2 - 3 times a night, unexplained WAVES of depression, extreme itching of skin all over,	seems to be controlling blood pressure but I am going to try more natural methods like losing weight	F	50	90  days16 mg 1X D	5/5/2010
5	hypertension	rhinitis	This is a wonderful antihypertensive.  It is also expensive but worth it.	F	58	4  years32 mg 1X D	4/23/2010
5	Hypertension	Maybe a little bit of lightheadedness early on but it was comparable to that lovely feeling after having a glass of wine - just nice and relaxed.	Way expensive but able to get generic "Amias" more reasonably from Canada.	F	55	90  days32mg 1X D	3/24/2010
5	Hypertension	None anymore. Suffered from fatigue for the first few weeks.	Has stabilized my high blood pressure. I sometimes forget to take it, because I feel nothing at all from it,or from withdrawal, so do not notice that I have not taken it.	M	39	5  years8mg 1X D	3/23/2010Email
3	labile BP	Dr. didn't know what to give me because most BP meds caused more side effects than cures. One Dr. gave me a 16mg.sample of it when my BP was 195/95. At that time, it only brought it down to 160/80 after a few days.I started with 16mg. + 25 mg.atenolol but still had spurts of the 195 BP.Read about a study in Italy re:controlling labile BP by taking 1/2 of the pills in AM & second 1/2 @ bedtime.It lowered the peaks to 160- 170 with an average of 130 - 120; however, a statin had been added in Dec. & the average has risen to 140-150 with muscle pains.

5	high blood pressure			M	65	365  days8mg 1X D	2/21/2010
4	high blood pressure	Hair Loss, not major balding but significant enough to notice thinning of hair.	Other than the hair thinning problem, side effects are practically nil.	M	46	2  years16mg 1X D	2/5/2010
5	hbp	none		M	62	6  months16 1X D	2/3/2010
5	Hypertension	Minimum side effects.  Sometimes I experience chills, mouth ulcers, depression, tingling, numbness in my hands and fingers; I consider these minor side effects; with the exception of the slight depression.  However, compared to briefly being prescribed Divoan and Hyzaar, THEY ARE HORRIBLE BPH meds!  Diovon and Hyzaar made me feel very lethargic for almost 24 hours!  The only reason I was asked to switch is because of the insurance company not wanting to cover for 2010 the co-pay.  However, I fought with Medco and told them the horrible side effects that I was experiencing when prescribed Diovan and Hyzaar and it was overturned and I now am back on Atacand, 32 mg.  Yes; it is very expensive compared to the other BPH meds but my life is worth it to take a medication that helps lower my BPH for quality of life.	Atacand is an excellent BPH medicine. I hope my body will take to this drug forever; do not want to ever swtich to another BPH drug because I have horrible side effects thus far with other BPH meds which may lower my quality of life.	F	48	3  years32 mg 1X D	2/3/2010
5	hypertension	No side effects.  Is expensive compared to others but others caused side effects.  Also helps control my migraines.		F	43	7  years	12/29/2009
3	High Blood Pressure	Feeling unwell, Head feeling tired and muffled up, itching on ride side of my Thigh	This Medication works in keeping my Bp level but over a long time I discovered that it was making me feel unwell. Tired feeling in my Head Muscle energy low and leaving me feel slower on my Feet.	M	55	2  years	12/26/2009
2	high blood pressure	mouth ulcers, flu like symptoms, neck ache, bronchitus, fevers, chills.		M	59	30  days	12/24/2009
2	HBP	Does this medicine increase urination at night.   I have the kind without a diuretic.   It doesn't lower my pressure.  Otherwise I would like to keep taking it as I feel fine taking it.   But, I need for it to work!		F	67	4  months	12/15/2009Email
3	Hypertension	Started to develop hives,edema, wheezing and problems urinating after taking 16mg Atacand and 25mg HCT for 1 year.Allergist tells me I am running out BP medications to try	Atacand kept my bp on the low side of high, which was as good as I've ever got.	M	63	1  years	12/13/2009Email
3	Hypertension	Depression and fatigue	Started Atacand (4 mg)16 months ago for mild hypertension simply because all other meds caused fatigue.  After a week, I noticed some fatigue but it was mild and I couldn't realistically attribute it to Adacand.  The increase in fatigue and depression was so slow and subtle over a years time that it was like the proverbial "frog in a pot" that was cooked to death by slowly increasing the temperature.  After a year the depression was so bad that I almost forgot I was taking Adacand; so, I decided to stop.  The depression immediately left and I felt normal again.  I guess I'm one of those 5 in 1000 patients that suffer depression from Atacand and it was bad.  Beware!	M	67	16  months	12/9/2009Email
2	HBP	None!	I experience zero side effects from this medicine so far, but I'm also not noticing ANY improvement in my blood pressure.  I'm not sure how long to hang on before trying another drug.  I was pretty excited after reading other reviews, but not working for me yet...16 mg	M	31	1  months	12/7/2009Email

3	Hypertension and PKD	I've only been on it for few days so it's hard to know right now...I also started my cycle on the same day I started taking Atacand 8 mg so hard to say if the facial flushing I am experiencing is hormonal or the drug.  Also noticing some slight breathing/chest issues.   Was on Lisinopril 5 mg previously and it was a nightmare...the cough, chest problems (almost like chest infection or asthma), loss of libido and heartburn (while on meds for it!) I am just waiting it out right now to see if the things I am experiencing settle down or continue...was on hydrochlorothizide before also and it caused severe facial flushing and swelling of the ankles.  I'm all for anything that does the job and leaves me feeling relatively human!		F	41	4  days	11/28/2009Email

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011
1	manic depression , anxiety	every day had horrible trembles, would wake up from the pills every night , causing me to none stop throw up, not funn at all	DONT DO IT	M	18	7  days30 mg 1X D	1/19/2011
1	Bipolar disorder	No side effects while on the Abilify. But ever since I stopped(4 years ago) I still have dizziness upon standing up and seizures randomly throughout everyday. I cant afford a lawyer or I would sew. SERIOUS BRAIN DAMAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!	I wish i could sew them and make it to where these companies can not sell their poison to another child teen or adult. All they want is money they dont care what the pills do to you.	M	19	6  months10mg 2X D	1/12/2011
1	addition to an anti-depressant	Oh my god it was terrible. A day or two after starting it I got sooooo dizzy I couldn't even stand I just wanted to lay down and die. Worst feeling ever-it made me not able to think clearly, and keep my train of thought. I got off of it within 1-2 weeks	Spare yourself and don't try it	F	18	2  weeks 1X D	1/9/2011
2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email
2	depression/ insomnia	temperature change ever so often, have been feeling like im going to faint the room feels like its spinning. helped with the depression, but did nothing for the insomnia toss and turn all night feels like my joints in my legs hurt. hip just started hurting. makes me feel weird.   i think i gained weight but everybody says i look the same.	if i had a choice i would not take it, i would try and get prescribed some thing else that's just for me it may work for other people a different way.

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.	F	35	4  weeks15 MG 1X D	8/29/2010Email
5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it.

5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.

5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
