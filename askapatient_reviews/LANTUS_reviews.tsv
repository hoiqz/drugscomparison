1	Type I Diabetes	At first no issues except injection site irritation.  Then developed serious side effects including extreme constipation, significant weight gain, cramping in my hands, swollen abdomen, and fatigue.	Lantus has serious quality control issues with new bottles working too well and sending me into insulin shock for the entire duration of the Lantus.  Scary Stuff.	F	37	 44 Units 1X D	3/24/2013Email
2	I'm a diabetic type 1	fatigue, increased farting, weight gain, forgetfulness, depression, appetite disorder, sleep disturbances, hypoglycaemia		F	46	6  years19 1X D	1/25/2013
5	Physician recommend	Slight burning for about 30 seconds at injection sites.	I have never read such a group of un-informed blather as I see here. #1.  Lantus does NOT "go bad quickly", and does NOT require refrigeration after beginning usage.  Read the directions sometimes. Also it seems that a lot of the "side effects" mentioned more than likely are not caused by the drug but by the insecurity of the patient.  One thing not mentioned is that injection site location is important, with the abdomen being the most effective location.	M	70	3  months15 units 1X D	12/21/2012
1	Type 1diabetes	At first i thought this was going to be great, one shot of longacting without ups and downs or peaks.  After years of feeling like I was surely in deaths door, i figured out this med was THE issue!   Not only would the site of injection burn, but eventually my entire body was burning.  I had back pain, leg pain, felt unwell all the time.  I noticed once i would inject, i would begin to feel this unnatural"rise" climb up my spine and it would feel like i was in a vice grip starting in my low back up to the top of my head.  I developed osteoporosis, gum disease, hair loss, depression, weight gain, migraines and an unrelenting rash!		F	40	6  years15units	10/3/2012

2	Diabetes	Stinging and burning when I injected it.  Occasional swelling at injection site.	Mostly this just didn't work for me.  Although it did seem to lower my blood sugar sometimes, my numbers were still usually in the 200's or above.  Only after my Dr. started me on the Humalog mix 75/25 did my numbers come down more.  I also use Novolog.	F	51	3  yearsVaried 2X D	3/16/2011
5	Diabetes	No side effects	Lantus has given me tight control of my blood sugar. It works very well . I Give lantus an all star.rating . My blood sugar is now normal thanks too lantus.	F	40	1  days10units 1X D	11/14/2010
5	Diabetes	The only side effects I expirence is burning during injection and it doesn't happen with every dose. It just happens time to time.	Lantus has been an amazing drug for me. It has effectively lowered my high blood sugar to normal levels! I was struggling with very high sugar from 200 to300 range before lantus. It works so well for me my levels are that of a person without diabetes now. Once you find the dose that's right for you its amazing how effective lantus is! I really like the fact that lantus doesn't peak like other insulins so I don't get unwanted lows while taking lantus! Just one shot a day covers me all day! I'm on a sliding scale of humulin but rarely have to take it because lantus does such a great job! I truely recomend lantus to all who are struggling with high blood sugar. The side effects are so minimumal its really a great drug. I use lantus in the solostar pen and its sooo. Easy to use. The small needle is so painless and the pen is so nice it can be taken anywhere and it looks like a regular marking pen! Its soo convienant. So much easier than vials and syringes! With lantus, once you find the dose correct for you, its a God send! Don't give up just do some trials with your doctor to find your dose and once you do, your sugar will run normal again with lantus! I can not stress enough how well this drug has been doing for me! No more struggle with high numbers for me! I think the most important thing to remember is be patient because it does take a little time to find the correct dose for your bodys needs. Once you find that dose, you will be amazed on how well lantus works! I am very gr	F	41	6  months10 units 1X D	10/26/2010
5	Diabetes	Slight Burning during injection from time too time if insulin was left on the tip off  the needle after the insulin was primed in the solostar pen.	Lantus has helped me achieve great control over my blood sugar levels.solostar pen is easy to use and is so convineant! Id recommend lantus to anyone struggling with high blood sugar. Lantus lasts twenty four hours and it's only one shot a day which is nice. I'm Very pleased with lantus solostar pen.	F	41	6  months20 units 1X D	10/8/2010
2	Type 1 diabetes	Bad hypos during the night	I would have to spike myself up during the night, just so I wouldn't drop too low. Was constantly worrying that one morning I wouldn't wake up	F	20	8  months40 units 1X D	2/18/2010
2	type 2 diabetes	I definitely helped with my blood sugars but I got an allergic reaction - very bad rash	After four and a half years of ugly, red, very itchy spots on my legs (dermatologist told me they were insect bites) I finally made the connection!  another dermatologist did two biopsies and results came back as "definite drug eruption!" the symptoms started the same summer I started Lantus. Will be switching to Levemir.	F	54	4.5  years	1/23/2010Email
5	Diabetic - Type 1	No side effects	The real value of Lantus is that it keeps staedy rate of glugose rate in blood for the whole 24 hours. Before lantus I used to wake up 4:00 AM due to low glucose rate, or have to keep higher rate of glucose beofre sleeping. But after Lantus I am no longer having this dillema. It is a perfect product for Type 1 diabetes.	M	37	5  years	11/8/2009
1	Type 1 Diabetes since aged 4 years	Chronic fatigue, debilitating muscle & joint pain, loss of hypoglycaemia symptoms, memory difficulties, depression, felt toxic as if I was being poisoned, felt as if I was walking around with a cold fish bowl over my head all the time despite good glycaemic control, weight gain	My deepest regret with taking this GM synthetic analogue was that I didn't make the connection sooner regarding the debilitating side effects I was experiencing.Since changing back to Porcine Animal Insulin I have got my life back - my energy levels have returned, muscle & joint pain disappeared, lost that foggy toxic feeling, lost weight & hypo symptoms have returned.	F	43	5  years	8/26/2009Email
2	Diabetes type 1	Fatigue, tiredness, emotional effects (anxiety, depression type feelings)	I spent a long time with specific feelings of weakness, fatigue, and a tendency to anxiety, while on Lantus. On going off it, I found this whole set of symptoms disappeared within 24 hours, especially the anxiety. Later, I went back on and off it again briefly (few days), and found the same symptoms again correlated with the insulin.	M	33	3  years	5/14/2009
2	Type 2 Diabetes	Dramatic weight gain.. During the first month, I gained 10 lbs! Most of it is midsection, which is not heart healthy. Diet has not changed.Some edema, especially in ankles, which I have never had before unless eating too much salt. 	I did not see appreciable improvement in my BG levels, and the weight gain will add to insulin resistance.. so this has actually set me back.

5	High glucose level	acidity issues	take it in conjunction with 750 metformin 1 X a day	M	57	1  days	1/7/2009
4	Diabetes	none	Noticed that it degrades easily. Must dispose of it after 30 days of opening. I have had a couple of vials that are bad and I believe it was because of a change of temperature due to the mail order pharmacy i am forced to use through my insurance	F	39	6  years	1/7/2009
5	type 2  diabetes	No side effects	Lantus is really working for me....glucose levels are close to normal all day...taking in conjunction with actos and metforminHave gotten off glyburide...	F	64	4  weeks	1/2/2009
1	type 2	Weard dreams,cramping in hands, neuromotor malfunction in fingers	Posion has 2.7 mg of cresol (LYSOL) per 10ml vial look up side effects of cresol lots of neurological problems	M	45	2  years	11/7/2008
3	type 2 diabetes	weight gain	The insulin has helped reduce blood sugar, but it must change your metabolism. Unfortunately the weight gain has caused my bloodsugar to increase, but it's still lower than without using it. For the person who said the injection site stings - you need to wait until the alcohol is completely dry before injecting.	M	56	3  months	8/4/2008

4	diabetes			M	57	6  years	4/3/2008
2	Diabetes Type 2	I was on Lantus for 4 days. I started experiencing anxiety the second day, my blood sugar was coming down so it was working in that respect. I also take Metformin. By the end of day 4, I had a huge anxiety attack and felt faint while driving home from the store. I didn't think that I would make the 1/2 mile but did. I immediately checked my BS and it was 140 so I wasn't hypoglycemic. I also take 40 mg of Inderal 4x a day so I can image what it would have been like if I had not been on it. I'm sensitive to any stimulants including my own adrenaline so this might just be specific to those with the same condition. I did notice a new insulin advertised on TV and it had 'jittery' as one of the side effects where as Lantus doesn't. I wonder if it's unreported. I stopped taking it.		F	60	4  days	10/18/2007
4	Type 1 Diabetes	sudden drop in blood sugar levels, burning (mostly during the first few weeks I started taking it)	When I was first diagnosed with Type-1 Diabetes, I was prescribed Lantus as my long acting insulin, and Novolog as my short acting insulin.  When I first started taking Lantus, I would notice a mild burning sensation after the injection.  That burning sensation doesn't happen that often anymore.  The other thing I notice is that generally when my blood sugar levels are around 120 or lower I feel shaky, along with the rest of the symptoms of a low blood sugar level.  I generally have to eat something when my blood sugar levels are stabilized or else my blood sugar levels will dip down past 90.  I have never been on any other long acting insulin.  I take 32 units of Lantus every 24 hours.  As for the Novolog, I take one unit per 15 grams of carbohydrate.  When my blood sugar levels are high, I take one unit of Novolog for every 50 points over the 120 reading on my glucometer.  I generally try to aim for a higher blood sugar level than a lower one,  I'd rather have to take more insulin la	M	21	3.4  years	3/31/2007
5	diabetes	low sugar	does the trick with novolog	M	53	1.2  years	1/17/2006
5	diabetes type 1	increased neuropathy pains in afternoon or towards end of vial.	I can eliminate most neuropathy pains by taking more units or splitting up my doses into morning and night.  Only problem with splitting up the doses though is the complications it makes from travelling and having to keep the lantus cool.  Though it's hard to fault find with a medicine that is the reason why you are still alive.	M	26	2  years	12/6/2005Email
5	Type 1 DM	none that I know of. Although I noticed that it goes bad quicker than other insulins.	I usually eat 2 big meals a day, plus 2-3 very light snacks (e.g. 1 oz almonds, fruit, cheeze, etc.) Prior to using Lantus, I was on Humalog 75/25 mix. Now I take the pure Humalog (5-25 units depending on food) before each meal, and 20-25 units of Lantus at bedtime. Very rare cases of hypo/hyper-glycemia now. Maintaining a good glucose level throughout the day was never this easy. Though traveling is a bit difficult because Lantus needs to be refridgerated at all times. Plus it's not cheap. This isn't a cure-all miracle drug for diabetes but it's almost like having a pump as it really levels out your glucose level nicely.WARNING:  don't mix it with other insulin -- don't use the same needle for different insulins. Also, don't let it out of the fridge for too long... it'll go bad really quickly!	M	36	1  years	1/24/2005
5	Type 1 Diabetes	Burning at injection site	Worth the pain.	M	34	30  days	10/23/2004
4	type2 diabetes	none		F	45	5  months	8/21/2004
5	Type 1 Diabetes	When taking Lantus in conjunction with Humalog insulin, be more cautious of low blood sugar reactions.	Thi insulin provides an excellent, long-lasting basal dose of insulin.  It is convienently taken once a day, at bedtime.  However,some users may not get adequate control with one dose daily and must split their insulin dose to a twice-a-day schedule.  It's like the pump in the way you receive constant coverage.  It has helped this brittle diabetic lower her HgA1C to an 8!  Hooray!  My neuropathy and blurry vision have also improved.  If your internist recommends Lantus definately give it a try.	F	35	2  years	8/11/2004Email
