1	post nasal drip	Three months into taking Astelin I experienced anxiety, paranoia, and high blood pressure.  I went off for two weeks and things cleared up; I had such bad allergies I took it again for five days and the symptoms came back.  I also lost a lot of my sense of smell and taste while taking Astelin.	The FDA drug study on Astelin is a joke.  250 people took it for 30 days???  That is a study in stupidity.	M	33	3.5  months2 sprays 1X D	2/26/2013Email
1	Allergies	I experienced fatigue and joint pain after taking this medication. It got so painful that I had to stop taking it completely. Luckily the symptoms went away soon after I stopped taking it.		F	28	21  days2 sprays 2X D	2/4/2013
5	Allergic rhinitis	Bad taste when you first use it	Works great for keeping my sinuses clear. I use it at night because it can cause some drowsiness.	M	52	3  years1 spray 1X D	9/5/2012
1	Rhinitis	Anxiety, sweaty palms and feet, racing thoughts, high blood pressure, high heart rate, depressed mood, facial pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, drowsiness, vivid dreams, and severe congestion		M	29	1  days1 Spray 1X D	8/22/2012
2	Post-Nasal Drip	heart palpitations, extremely vivid dreams, woke up every night feeling anxious and restless, very hard time getting up in the morning	My PND has been quite bad for several months, and my Doctor recommended adding Azelastine to the Nasonex Spray I was already taking. I didn't mind the bitter taste - it is a medication after all - but it felt as if my symptoms were getting worse, including incessant coughing at night. I didn't even put the severe heart palpitations and the super-weird dreams together with the Azelastine use before I read the comments other people left here... I am not a morning person to begin with but now it is almost impossible to get out of bed in the morning. I will discontinue the use of this nose spray today.	F	42	3  days1 spray 1X D	5/4/2012
5	Sinus infection, nasal congestion	Burns nostrils slightly right after spraying, short-lived bitter taste in throat, and tiredness. I only use the spray at night because of tiredness and it's just as effective.		F	19	2  weeks137 mcg	1/16/2012
4	Allergic Rhinitis	Typical antihistamine side effect:  Made me as sleepy as chlorpheniramine does when I used two sprays in each nostril.Atypical antihistamine side effect: medicine taste in back of throat	worked for itchy eyes and runny nose	M	28	3  days2spray ino 1X D	11/13/2011
4	Allergies	I sometimes had a burning in my throat and almost always a burning in my nose (probably due to the citric acid in it).  However, it really stopped the sneezing and really helped out with allergy-related fatigue.	This product does not contain sucralose, as Astepro does, so I feel more comfortable taking it.  Astepro is sweeter than Astelin, but it's due to the sucralose in it.  See the following link for the dangers of sucralose:  http://www.livestrong.com/article/85719-dangers-sucralose/.	M	49	6  years2 sp 2 X D 2X D	10/25/2011
3	Post Nasal Drip, Allergies	Intense hunger, Stomach Cramps, Drowsiness, Fatigue, Facial Pain, Minor Nose Bleed.	Rating: 1/5 on post-nasal drip. 4/5 on clearing my nose/sinuses.Pro: Helps with stuffiness. But my major problem is post-nasal drip and that has not significantly improved.Cons: Hunger is so bad I can't think about anything other than food. Find myself snacking at least once an hour (typically I eat about every 5-6 hours). Very tired and fatigued. Not helping the post-nasal drip.	F	40	4  days137 mcg 2X D	9/17/2011
1	allergies	I took Astelin for 3 days but had to stop due to unexplained muscle jerks and twitching.  Stopping the medicine did not stop the side effects, they became much worse.  They are now so severe I have to take 2 different meds to control them and have to visit my neurologist every 6 months.  I would like to know if anyone else has experienced this side effect.	I would NEVER recommend this drug to anyone!!!  3 neurologists and alot of money later, I have them about 90% under control.  This is a life long effect which I am hoping does not get worse over time.	F	47	3  days 1X D	7/22/2011Email
4	post-nasal drip	No bad taste experienced, but it made me drowsy, and feeling as if I had a general anesthetic a couple of hours earlier.  This drug evidently crosses the blood-brain barrier.  I thought that only first generation antihistamines were supposed to do that.  Too risky.  Comments here pretty scary.  I'll use in future only if desperate.	Very effective elimination of post-nasal drip, which had been with me for several months.  The PND had been affecting my breathing by dripping into the bronchial passages.  However, I still feel a little short of breath. I don't know if that's due to the drug or because there's some pre-existing bronchial constriction in sync with the nasal congestion. At least I've established that my PND is curable.	M	54	3  days 2X D	11/6/2010
1	allergies	palpitations,jaw locked, infection on my gums, nightmares, tweetching eye, feeling tense with my musles, irritable, hard time focousing, bliry vision , not feeling myself, depress lost of interest, hard time breathing, numbess on my feet, strong headaches,	went to the ER twice.. be careful with the side effects	M	34	3  months 1X D	10/30/2010Email
1	Sinuses were congested due to cold	Within mins of 1st use: non stop vomiting for 30 mins; hives near mouth, lips swollen, chest pains, heart being fast. Hours later felt very sick and dizzy.	I would not recommend this to anyone. If I could stop the vomiting long enough I would have called someone for help. Very scary experience.	F	31	1  days 1X D	10/26/2010
2	Post nasal drip, plugged ears	Very bad headache, pressure in back of head, jaw and sinus area.  Heart Palpitations, and very weird dreams.	It seemed to help the first few days but now I see no difference.  Ears are still plugged and I still get very dizzy.	M	41	1  weeks30 ml 1X D	10/22/2010
1	for nearsightedness & baldness	Did not cure my nearsightedness at all.  Also didn't cure my baldness. Also didn't make me look younger.		M	99	1  days2 sprays 1X D	10/22/2010
5	sinusitis, allergies, polyps	none.  bad taste in mouth from actual drug.	This is a wonderful drug.  As a chronic sinus problem sufferer this product has been wonderful to me.  Sinus allergies almost gone with out having to take a pill.  During spring and fall one squirt a day does the trick.	M	42	8  years137 mcg 1X AN	10/21/2010
3	allergies	skin problems in sinus area, weight gain	I was prescribed this medication after a bad reaction to fluticasone.  Don't know what to do next!	F	44	2  months137 mcg 1X D	10/19/2010
3	Chronic sinusitis	I initially tolerated Astelin quite well. It made me tired at work but nothing a cup of tea wouldn't fix. After a year an half, I suddenly began experiencing a sensation as if I didn't have enough oxygen in my system. After discontinuing all medications, I began to re-introduce them one at a time. After the first dose of Astelin, I began experiencing the same sensation. I discontinued use of Astelin and was fine. Unfortunately, nothing worked quite as well as Astelin with my sinusitis. They introduced a new version of it so my doctor gave me a sample, thinking it may have been some particular ingredient in the original that may have been changed in the new version. He was wrong. After the first dose, I began experiencing the same lack of oxygen sensations. I have not used it since.	It was great while it lasted but it seems I developed a hyper-sensitivity to it after having used it successfully for a long period of time.	M	53	2  years1 spray ea 1X D	9/29/2010
3	Seasonal Allergies	Until recently, none, but I have since suffered from a migraine that lasted over 10 days (concentrated mostly in the eye and temple area), heart palpitations, dizziness, tinnitus, nausea, and insomnia.	As a long-time sufferer of seasonal allergies, my allergist prescribed me Astelin nose spray to use nightly, starting in August.  Astelin has worked wonderfully well at preventing any allergic attacks so far this season and I have had NO trouble breathing.  It took approximately 1 month of use before any side effects occurred, and since I currently take NO other medications and am in generally good health, I can only attribute my recent problems with Astelin.  I am an RN and have been researching my symptoms day in and day out, only to end up on numerous medications for a "migraine" that has lasted over 10 days.  I decided to stop taking ALL medications last night and am just finally free of pain in my head.  I will not be taking Astelin anymore.  I am sure this medicine is wonderful for some, but the side effects just are not worth the freedom from allergies for me.  I would rather sneeze my way into oblivion...	F	30	1  months 1X D	9/19/2010
1	allergies	After using on and off during summer allergy season I noticed a white lace in mouth.  Looked up this website and think i have Lichen Planus also.		F	30	 squirt 2X D	9/8/2010
3	allergies, migraines	The Medicine was a life saver for the first couple of weeks i used it.  I have a very bad nose(deviated septum) and have always had problems from allergies(grass,ceder,pets).  Not until i tried to wing myself off of astelin is when i noticed i am having heart palpitations.  I have been a college athlete and know my body very well...Do have some history of overweight grandpa with irregular heartbeat.  I am 26 and i am in tremendous shape.  Prolonged use of Astelin has turned out to be a very scary thing for me.	I have been tired at work, but do not think astelin is the culprit, many people(me) have sleep apnea that also suffer from extreme allergies and deviated septum.the Heart Palpitations is consistent in my experience.  Not until my third 30 ML bottle, did i start to experience the irregular heart beat.  I run and weight train close to 5 days a week and have been a collegiate athlete as little as three years ago.  I guess i will be running much more in the near future.	M	26	5  months30Mg/Month 2X D	7/23/2010
1	non-allerginic rhinitis	I'm the one who described having Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms after taking Astelin for 6 weeks.  The symptoms are still on-going, though lessened a bit.  Turns out my body is only mimicking RA.  It is also mimicking another auto-immune, inflammation response: Lichen Planus.  With this disease I get white webbing through the tissue under my tongue.  This is the only fatal form of the disease and I have had a small chunk of my tongue cut out for biopsy.  My mother also took Astelin for a couple of months.  Her body is also mimicking RA.  Looks like we'll both have the extreme pain and fatigue of RA for life.  Plus, with the Lichen Planus I'll have to be screened for cancer once a year.  The thing I don't get is if my lab work shows that my body is only mimicking these two auto-immune, inflammation responses, why won't the symptoms go away now that I'm no longer taking the Astelin.	Has ruined both mine and my mother's lives.	M	52	6  weeksmaximum 2X D	6/28/2010Email
2	Allergic rhinitis	Increasing daytime drowsiness, headaches, vivid sleep-disturbing dreams accompanied by awakening and finding myself talking to and even lecturing an unknown audience.	Now off Astelin one week. All side effects have disappeared and I have returned to Allegra for symptom control.	F	71	3  weeks1-2 sprays 2X D	6/7/2010
5	allergies  sinusitis	bitter taste,	Before seeing  ENT had unbearable runny nose sneezing etc.Started using Astelin and it completely dried up my sinuses.Best I've felt in a long time. Makes me a little more irritable.No headaches or sleep problems. Nasonex alone did nothing.	M	48	3  weeks2 sprays 2X D	5/26/2010
1	sinusitis/allergies	The worst facial pain and migraines i've ever had in my life!	This medication caused very severe migraines and facial pain.  They stopped within 2 days of being off the medication.	F	26	3  months30mg 2X D	5/4/2010
5	allergies	It worked great for me.  Bitter taste but I learned to keep my chin to my chest so I didn't taste it.		F	62	 don't know 1X D	4/30/2010
4	sinus congestion	Slight palpitation but could be from combination of pseudoephedrine, Claritin and too much coffee.  Slight short lived bad taste, no drowsiness.  Generally live with constant sinus congestion, a 4 timer for endoscopic sinus surgery with #5 right around the corner.  Side effects are minimal compared to the benefits.	Right now I am sleeping through the night and still breathing clearly through my nostrils.  Planning on using Astelin as long as I can.	M	52	15  days1 x each 2X D	4/20/2010Email
1	allergies	Worked great for my allergy symptoms but after a week I began to experience joint pain and fatique.  I feel a hundred years old.  I have discontinued use of this because it just isn't worth the pain.  I also experienced vivid dreams (nice dreams) and jaw clenching at night.	I would not recommend this product.  I hope my symptoms go away soon	F	45	2  weeks 1X D	4/18/2010
2	Sinus congestion	I ended up in the ER with heart palpatations two weeks ago.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  After 3 hours they sent me home saying there was nothing wrong with me.  My friend looked up the side effects and through this Web site I was able to pin point my problem as Astelin.  I have been off of it for a week, and my heart and BP are back to normal.	I loved Astelin for the first 4 months.  It cured my congestion and ear infections.  I don't love it anymore.	F	53	4  months30 ml 2X D	3/15/2010
1	sinus drip allergies	nose bleeds dry cough after 3 days mouth very dry drinking water only helps thrist for a few min.I fell asleep and ran off the road and hit a small sign because i was drowsey	cost not covered by insurance	M	55	10  days2 sprays 1X D	3/15/2010
2	Sinus drainage/allergies	I have taken his drug off and on for over two years. I have been on it this time for 14 days and on the 11th day I lost my since of smell completely and can not taste hardly anything.		F	39	2.5  years30mg 2X D	3/8/2010
5	Post nasal drip after nasal infect.	None.	I had a bad sino-bronchial infection. Even after I was cured of that, I had very bad post nasal drip. Astelin was amazingly effective in clearing up the post nasal drip. I used 2 sprays per nostril twice a day until I was out of the 200-spray bottle. I held my head down for a few minutes after the sprays, to assure I did not taste the bitter taste. This is a wonderful drug in my opinion.  It cost me $50 co-pay since it is a brand drug, but it was worth every penny. Note: I don't have any allergies, so this use of the drug was for inflammation left over from a nasal infection. February 2010.	F	63	25  days2 sprays 2X D	3/5/2010Email
2	allergies, post-nasal drip	At first seemed to help control post-nasal drip but caused drowsiness.  As use continued, heart began racing and palpitating to the point where I could not sleep.  I took a break and tried it again last night - same thing.  Going back to Allegra.		M	41	3  months30 ML 2X D	2/21/2010Email
4	chronic congestion	mild sense of confusion.	works amazing.  after 20yrs of congestion this is by far the best product I have ever tried. I think I will only take it once at night.	M	37	3  days	1/7/2010
1	year round allergies for dust mites	very tired, irritable. i had a hard time getting up in the morning.	this spry is for seasonal allergies only. it also works for environmental odors. i don't know why my doctor prescribed this medicine for me. i have year round allergies. the only spray that has worked well is a steroid spray called nasacort	F	46	6  months	12/2/2009
5	nasal congestion,	Nasty taste in the back of the throat.	I work at altitudes of 8-10 thousand feet. This cleared up my nasal congestion (allergies) and ended the vertigo from congestion. This stuff is great!	M	60	6  months	11/21/2009Email
3	Severe mold allergies	None-until about after a year, I got persistent bloody nose, with severe bleeding: It looked like I was a member of "Fight Club"		F	42	1  days	11/7/2009
5	Sinus Congestion	None	I am a "walking side effect" to medications and have not had any with Astelin!  I am so grateful for it because it really helps clear up my sinuses.  I suffer year round allergies and when zyrtec + singulair combined weren't helping with the congestion, my doctor added the astelin and I hit the trifecta!	F	41	2  years	10/22/2009
1	runny nose, sneezing.	Right off, I am VERY upset about this. I have not felt my toes or the bottom of my feet for six months (which coincides with when I started taking this stuff). I had no idea this was a drug side effect. Never thought of it. Will stop taking it immediately. Would not recommend it for anyone.		M	51	6  months	10/15/2009
3	year around allergies	RAPID weight gain with daily exercise and healthy eating (18lbs in 1-1/2 months)- anxiety- palpitations- increase in cough from drainage - elevated blood pressure (have never had before)seeing cardiologist for stress test. Severe sleepiness, no energy, increased hunger. mild headache at initial use.	Did help with congestion- after reading these comments will stop using and hope the side effects disappear. ESP the weight!!!!	F	44	2  months	10/13/2009
1	nasal congestion	Very serious side effects.....many blood clots in legs...mesentary and lungs....this stuff is dangerous	Was not warned of any side effects by physician,may concide legal action.	M	71	21  days	10/13/2009Email
1	Pollen allergies (post nasal drip)	dizziness, light nose bleeds, headaches, nausea, sore throat, twitchyness, bad taste, SEVERE drowsiness and disorientation	I will most likely NEVER use this product ever again. It is too expensive, dangerous and the only time that I wasn't severly affected by the drowsiness was when I only squirted the orange liquid in one nostril and leaned forward while I gently breathed in through that clogged nostril. I used this product a grand total of 3 times. I was perscribed this by a new doctor and she told me to just "try it out" and she also perscribed me Atarax which also causes drowsiness, the combination of the two often causes upper respirator issues and I have enough of those already. I couldn't even notice if it actually worked because it seemed that all I could do was sit on my bed at home and twitch. The only time I will ever use it again is if I get so sick that I can't breathe through either one of my nostrils.	F	16	2  days	10/10/2009
1	seasonal allergies	extreme, marked drowsiness, even while on adderall xr, which is a stimulant! astelin was the only new addition to my routine, so i'm 100% certain it caused my sleepiness at work. could barely keep my eyes open and was misspelling simple words (and i'm a writer!).	would not recommend. zyrtec works for me, but in all reality, i'd rather sneeze all day than take astelin again. oh, and it's not cheap!	F	25	 	10/8/2009
4	Chronic nasal allergies	I take it only when my condition gets very bad. I take one spray in each nostril. Makes me very drowsy and so I take it at night only. While the sleep is always good, it also produces vivid dreaming. Fortunately they are good dreams. Last night's were beautiful, including wonderful landscapes , exquisite architecture, subdued colors, festive people, etc.etc. Only bad was a friend in trouble. But everything is sooo  realistic, it was amazing. That is why I googled Astelin side-effects this morning and here I am!	If it works take it only when absolutely necessary. The other unpleasant side-effects like bitter taste, temporarily sore sinus and nasal-passages  are outweighed by the relief, unlike say Benadryl which leaves me almost disabled with drowsiness and long period of lethargic malaise.	M	63	2  years	9/30/2009
3	Allergic Rhinitus	Falling asleep at my desk, terribly sleepy and physically fatigued and weak. Face pain.	Worked great for my post-nasal drip, but I haven't had such an extreme sleepy side-effect from an antihistamine except for benedryl. I'm going to try using it just at night.	F	47	7  days	9/23/2009
2	chronic sinusitus/allergies	Terrible heart palpitations and panic especially at night. Can't wake up in the morning-- fell asleep at work after large quantities of caffiene. No considerable difference in symptoms or allergic reactions. Dissappointed.	As this is a last resort-- I've tried eveything else-- I gave Astelin 2 full weeks of full dosage and still no improvement. But quality of life otherwise took a nose-dive (no pun intended!).	F	27	2  weeks	8/22/2009
2	chronic sinus problems/no allergies	Extreme drowsiness especially during first week.  Heart palpitions, weird dreams, continually waking up during night. Very difficult to get out of bed in the morning and lethargic during the day. Did not help with sinus headaches in morning and all day.  Extra weight gain (in addition to menopause)!  No bitter taste at all because I did not breathe in heavily while spraying (as per directions).  Unable to fully function at work or home and loss of interest in regular activities.  Overall, not a good experience.	While it does seem to clear the sinuses the side-effects don't warrant continued use.  As this was an interim option until results of Sinus CT I don't suspect my doctor will prescribe in the future for me.	F	52	2  weeks	8/15/2009
2	nasal inflammation/polyp	Heart palpitations (scary), irritability, horrible achy feeling in nose, loss of smell or weird smells, confusion as to what I am smelling.	Doctors wake up!  People have major side effects to prescription drugs AFTER the FDA has approved it and it's on the market.  When a study has only used 250 people to test the drug before it hits market (such as Astelin), I don't think that is representing the whole population.  When I read how many other people have similar side effects to mine on this website, I am wondering why prescription drug companies are overlooking this issue. We as consumers need to speak up and report these things to the FDA and the company who manufactures the drug.	F	30	5  days	8/11/2009
2	Chronic Rhinitis	Heart palpitation 5 to 6 hours after using it, shortness of breath, dry mouth, blurred vision	Ineffective for opening nasal and sinus passages.	M	54	4  days	7/6/2009
1	sinus headaches	Just had an EKG today and am wearing a holter monitor for 24 hrs. Have heart palpitations and pins and needles feeling in my hands and feet. Thought the problem was with my thyroid or menopause but those checked out fine. Did not suspect Astelin until cardiologists asked which meds I took (Astelin is the only one) and I checked for side effects on the web. Still have an echo and stress test scheduled but hate to spend the money if Astelin has caused it.	Have taken Astelin for at least 5 years; have not experienced weight gain but have alot of fatigue.	F	54	5  years	7/6/2009
3	allergies	jitters and profound fatigue	works very well but since I can't do anything but sleep and sit around with my muscles twitching it isn't much of a life.  will stop using yet another drug...sadly...because it does work but the side effects are not worth it	F	60	6  days	7/4/2009Email
1	severe allergy	After taking for 5 days lost my sense of taste and smell..working on second round of antibiotics for severe sinusitis..I lost my smell in March 09..It is now July. o9.I love to cook and it has greatly affected my life..I never get headaches now my sinuses hurt all the time..I will never use anything in my nose again..I had some other effects too that went away after I stopped medication.. but this is awful..		F	59	5  days	7/2/2009Email
3	Chronic Sinus Congestion	Tired during the day.  Acts as a sleep drug.	Take at night and Nasonex in the morning.  No longer need to take decongestants but side effects are not too good. May drop one or both drugs. Better to irrigate twice a day	M	52	4  months	6/29/2009
1	severe sinus infection	insomnia, having weak spells (was about to go to cardiologist), indigestion, lack of energy, no motivation, memory loss, vision blurry in afternoons and evenings, pressure in my head at night	I am furious. I've been taking this stuff for about 6 weeks. I haven't slept much, I'm tired, I had my second "weak" spell last night when I thought I was going to pass out (nausea, shaking, legs weak). I was going to make an appointment to see my cardiologist on Monday because I was scared to death. I'm a little upset with my ENT too.	F	54	6  weeks	6/20/2009
1	severe rhinitis	This drug worked great and unstuffing my nose and clearing up my rhinitis but the horrible side effects of rapid weight gain and irregular heartbeat (I thought I was having a heart attack) were sure not worth it.  Avoid this drug at all costs!!!!				 	6/16/2009
1	Dr thought allergies	Heart racing, horrible headaches, and weight gain even though I eat right and exercise daily.	I hate when the guessing game costs so much....this $100 a bottle spray did nothing to relieve my symptoms and made me feel worse than when I went in to Dr.	F	55	30  days	6/12/2009
3	Severe allergic rhinitis	Drowsiness, mood swings, headaches, memory problems, inability to lose weight, extreme hunger, strange dreams, pain in face and nose.	Have been using Astelin for about 2 months along with Clarinex, and my allergies are almost gone, but I think I'm going to stop the Astelin because I can't take the side effects.  They're a little scary, especially after reading everyone else's side effects.  Not worth it.  Maybe the Clarinex will do.	F	39	2  months	5/19/2009
3	Post Nasal Drip due to Allergy	Well I only took this once yesterday morning.  It worked, however my vision was off all day.  I don't need glasses for close up however could not see close up well all day.  I will try it again, maybe at night is what I was thinking until I saw all of the comments on here. Anyway, thought I would add this, because I did not see it on here.  I was taking no other new drug when I tried this, so it has to be connected.	I am sure it still works for a lot of people.  My Doctor uses it and swears by it.	F	49	1  days	4/27/2009
4	Seasonal Allergies	For the first two weeks of taking Astelin, I was very dizzy and felt generally out of sorts.  I also expereinced relatively bad headaches.  However, I was desperate to have relief from my allergies (runny nose, itchy eyes, ears and throat, sneezing, congestion) so I stuck it out.  After the initial two weeks, the side effects faded to almost non-existance (they are much more tolarable than the effects of the allergies).	I am on the one spray, twice a day dosage.  It has definitely worked for me.	F	27	1  years	4/23/2009
3	Yes	Severe Rapid Weight Gain	I was in love with this nose spray for about 5 months. I usually have 2-3 sinus infections every winter and had had none since taking it. In fact, head colds seemed to stay away from me, too although they were affecting everyone else around me. In the meantime, I was depressed about my 15 pound weight gain in 5 months even though I had started exercising and eating better. Finally put 2 and 2 together, especially after reading the comments here. If you are gaining mad weight in a short amount of time and are taking this drug, I would seriously consider this as your culprit. Too bad since it seemed to be an answer to prayer for me and I'm not sure what I will do now.	F	36	5  months	4/17/2009

Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
