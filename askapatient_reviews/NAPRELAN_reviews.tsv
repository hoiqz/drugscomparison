5	Osteoarthritis	Works Great. Kinney Drugs never seems to have it in stock so refills always takes 2 trips to the drugstore. The insurance company hates it, but with the coupon it only costs $15.00 initially and $7.50 a refill. Ends up being cheaper then Aleve. Works great, no side effects and once a day is sweet.	NO side effects at all.	M	56	180  days750 1X D	10/8/2012Email

1	menstrual cramps	bloating, gas, cramping, diarreah	I've had no problems taking advil, Aleve, Tylenol, Aspirin, or even 550 mg of Anaprox (non-time release).  I cannot believe how much digestive pain this is causing me!  Would definately urge caution---this formula must be different from everything else out there!	F	42	2  days 1X D	3/13/2010Email
1	Endomitriosis Pain	None	My pain was taken away for approx 1 hour, then came back strong - not good when you can only take this once every 24 hours.  This was a nightmare - and very expensive.  I will not refill.	F	34	1  days	7/31/2008
5	Back injury	None, worked great.  Only had to take it once a day.	Doctor gave me coupon and I got 20 bucks off my copay	F	30	18  days	6/17/2008
