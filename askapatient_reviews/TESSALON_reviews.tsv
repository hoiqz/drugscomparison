1	bronchitis	very little help and eyes have been burning	My daughter is a respiratory therapist and she says this med is HIGHLY over-rated and basically worthless, but a common cough suppressent given in clinics for whatever reason.	F	58	3  days100 3X D	1/10/2013Email
1	Pneumonia	Felt like my throat was swelling up, difficulty swallowing , burning eyes and dizziness . Pills were taken as directed .  I did not chew them.   I ended up losing more sleep trying to wait until the side effects to wear off.		F	32	2  days100mg	12/8/2012
5	Cough	None	Ad bedtime...let me sleep alll night...sometimes needed second dose during night, but medicine did calm cough and let me get important rest to recuperate from bad flu	M	48	1  weeks 1X D	11/29/2012Email
1	chronic cough	did nothing	did nothing..I kept coughing until I was couching up blood	M	55	4  days1 1X D	10/28/2012
1	bad cough	Paranoia, suicidal.	The most horrible time in my 55 years.  I became extremely paranoid and suicidal.  My wife had to literally lay on me in the bed to keep me from getting up in the night to kill myself.  I ended up in lock-up in the psychiatric ward of a local hospital for three weeks, and took over a year psychiatric counselling and more drugs and more recovery from the symptoms from those drugs.  After three years, I am finally getting back to normal.  PLEASE EVERYONE READ THE FINE PRINT AND BE AWARE OF POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS BEFORE YOU START A NEW MEDICATION.	M	55	6  weeks 1X D	2/28/2012Email
1	Asthma, bad hacking cough	Dizzy, tired, weird feeling in my chest, still felt the need to cough and stuff still coming up. Itch in throat. I am not sure how this should work, but it didn't work at all for me.		F	26	7  days200mg 3*s	1/1/2012
1	cough	Shortness of breath, foggy mind, still have cough.		F	71	2  days100 3X D	5/18/2011
4	Post-Sinus Surgery coughing	Drowsiness	I was coughing a lot after a major sinus procedure and this medicine helped keep some of the pain from coughing at bay and helped me to get some decent sleep.  I use it as needed now and usually only at night but it seems to help with little to no side effects for me.	F	26	5  days100mg 3X D	3/11/2011
4	Chronic cough	Headache, dry mouth/thirst, drowsiness, loopiness, dizziness	The medication does help with cough, but as others stated, it wears off in about 3-4 hours.  The first few days, I was extremely thirsty; could not get enough ice water.  My hands were warmer and drier than usual.  I would wake up with headaches.  Upon standing, I would feel dizzy and sometimes loopy.  After maybe 1 week, the side effects started to subside.  Someone else mentioned "psychotic dreams", I did experience crazier than usual dreams.	F	39	6  days200mg 3X D	9/8/2010
2	upper respritory infection/ cough	Dry Eyes, Insomnia, Head Ache	Not really helping.  It does slightly work for about 2 or 3 after hours taking it, but then I cough for 3 or 4 hours until my next dose.  Waste of money for me.	M	35	2  days200 4X D	8/27/2010
4	sinusitis bronchitis	This drug made me feel a little loopy but very hyper and talkative. Apparently no one else has had this reaction.		F	27	10  days100mg 6X D	5/12/2010Email
4	chronic cough	Some nasal stuffines.	It has definetly helped keep me from coughing as much. I can tell when it is wearing off and need to take another dose.	F	61	7  days200 mg 3X D	3/5/2010
5	severe cough & congestion	Increased drowsiness	Took 200 MG in addition to PSE BPM liquid BPH.  The combination worked like a charm. Neither medication is cheap.	M	78	7  days	12/31/2009
5	bronchitits	no side effects except slight eye irratation	I was finally able to get a good nights sleep after a week of hacking all nighters.  Would take again if needed.	F	39	5  days	11/24/2009
5	Post Viral (H1N1) Cough	None.  I got a little dizzy about 30 minutes after the first dose. It subsided within minutes.	I have a HORRIBLE cough after having H1N1. The cough is worse than having the flu.  This has worked great! It does not completely get rid of the cough, but it brings it down to a less severe, manageable level.		32	4  days	10/26/2009
1	Bronchitis	None	This medicine did absolutely nothing for my cough. I took the perles - not sure whether the formulation makes a difference - I found no change until I changed to Tussionex.	F	39	6  days	6/9/2009
4	cough	slight shortness of breath.  But overall, helped me sleep at night by subsiding my cough just enough.  I am very sensitive to side effects with med (see nasonex!) but experienced nothing with this medicine.	Mine was 200mg- may need 2 if you are at 100mg	F	39	2  days	3/14/2009
3	unproductive cough	trouble sleeping, when taken right before bedtime		F	48	3  days	3/3/2009
4	Constant cough/ viral bronchitis	None at all.	Started taking this 3 days ago with almost immediate improvement.  Yes, I still cough some.  But nothing like before.  Doesn't make me sleepy during the day.	F	63	3  days	12/1/2008
1	Acute bronchitis	Within half an hour from taking Tessalon, I experienced: severe vertigo, nausea, stomach pain, numbness on my throat that made me feel like I was choking (no, I did not break the capsule before swallowing it...) visual distortion/red spots, slight confusion.  The cough returned as strong as ever when the drug wore out. I was told that the body adjusts to the drug after a few days, so I took another Tessalon the next day but the symptoms felt even worse, so I quit taking it. I have no known allergies to medications and I was only taking the antibiotic clarythromycin at the time which did not cause any side-effects. I did not find any drug counteractions with clarythromycin online and the same doctor prescribed these drugs, so I assume she would know (I hope!)		F	41	2  days	11/19/2008
4	Bronchitis	none noted	I would have these severe coughing fits that would come on very sudden along with chronic coughing throughout the day. These seem to help stop the urge to cough. I can still cough if needed but didnt have that constant "itch" in my throat as I did before. Seems like this would only last on me for 4-5 hours so I'd take this 3x a day and then the Tussionex at night. I could definitely tell when this would wear off.	F	37	10  days	4/7/2008
4	cough	none	great cough suppressant without the serious sedation	M	23	4  days	3/3/2008
5	chronic cough- post viral	I'm on a number of prescriptions right now so not really sure.	I am coughing less often and less deeply. Nexim seems to help with the roughness in my esophagus and the Diflucan for the yeast in my throat I got from the inhaler.I am happy with the results from Tessalon. Nothing has worked for six months, Tessalon is! Yay!	F	57	10  days	8/18/2007Email
3	Chronic Cough	None at all	It is starting to work after 4 days; still some coughing.	M	50	4  days	1/2/2007Email
3	Cough	Shimmery lines through line of vision, temporary loss of peripheral vision, and worst headache of my life. It did control the cough but horrid side effects. Would never take again.		F	48	2  days	10/16/2006
5	chronic cough	none, drowsiness at night	This stuff works great!  Super results. Used only at night or if at home too sick to work. Used with phenergan and got the only sleep I'd had in days. Used it only until I could sleep at night. Have used it three times and requested it twice. Finding this was almost as good as Christmas.	F	41	7  days	7/7/2006
1	chest cold and cough	Increased coughing and suppressed coughing up of mucus. Burning eyes.		M	75	2  days	6/5/2006
1	uncontrollable dry cough during flu	dizzy, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, dry mouth, hard to swallow, felt awful.  Discontinued after 1st dose.  Took Benedryland lived on cough lozenges until cough subsided-Benedryl helped a lot.  Tussins didn't help at all.	Really expensive and risky side effects	F	49	1  days	5/11/2006
1	influenza with chronic coughing	Burning in the eyes	Did not work for me at all.  I didn't notice any help after taking it.	F	29	2  days	3/23/2006
3	bronchitis	tired, dizzy, bad taste in my mouth	it worked great to control coughing but it wasn't worth dealing with the side effects.	F	41	1  days	3/3/2006
2	Cough due to Bronchitis	Burning eyes	It was expensive, made my eyes burn, and wasn't very effective at suppressing my cough AT ALL.	F	47	4  days	2/27/2006
5	Cold/Cough	None	Worked as advertised.  No hacking cough when on the drug.  If I skipped a dose, the cough would return.  Would use again.	M	39	7  days	12/13/2005
1	Cough	It did not suppress my cough.		M	36	3  days	9/15/2005
