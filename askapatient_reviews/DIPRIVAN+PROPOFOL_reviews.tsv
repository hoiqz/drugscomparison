5	Colonoscopy	None	Propofol is very smooth. I rather enjoyed the first minute as I went under. I awoke in the OR right after the procedure and was awake and alert as if no time had passed at all.  This was my 3rd experience with Propofol as it was used for other surgeries I have had.  Same effect every time.  I would highly recommend this medication for monitored sedation. Do not worry about having Propofol.  Do not put off your Colonoscopy It could save your life.	M	55	1  timesUnknown 1X H	3/15/2013Email
1	lumpectomy	cognitive dysfunction,depression,very flat affect,my hands will not work very well. SEE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.	Felt like I had a hangover x's 10 million upon waking,however,I expected that,though I had never been put under. Felt great when I got home.24 hours later....my hands will not work very well,cog-fog,difficulty getting words out....I have multiple sclerosis,and all of what I am experiencing are symptoms of ms,but this is MS on steroids!  Will it go away? Do I call my neurologist?	F	44	1  timesuaware 1X D	3/15/2013Email

3	Colonoscopy	Terrible sore throat - feel hoarse and voice raspy - - feels like throat is inflamed.  They told me no intubation - just propofol by IV.		M	50	 Not sure 1X D	2/28/2013Email
1	Endoscopy	I had a routine endoscopy done.  I don't know much about anesthesia so I trusted the anesthesiologist to make the right decision.   After being used as a human pin cushion the iv was administered and shortly after the propofol was introduced.  I went right out and came back to almost full consciousnesses in about 20 min.  The next day I awoke with a headache which I normally don't get that has lasted 4 days now.  On top of that I don't feel like my normal self and my brain doesn't seem to be functioning well in terms of memory and conversation. I've also been experiencing minor tinnitus and a feeling that I'm lacking oxygen.  I'm almost positive the propofol is the cause.  I called the endoscopy center to see if this was normal. They said it wasn't and that I may have the flu or something....	Beware of propofol and this potential effect on some people..	M	29	1  days? 1X D	2/14/2013
4	Colonsocopy	Woke up really "thick in the head", stoned.  Took about 30 minutes to wake up. Felt really groggy the rest of the day. Got bad headache that night and the next day. Had trouble driving and remembering things the next day. Forgot how to shift my manual transmission. Still feel kinda drugged in the head.  My procedure was early yesterday.	Overall it was OK and I'd probably have it again. Better that some of the alternatives from what I can tell.	M	66	1  daysnot sure 1X D	12/1/2012Email
5	Endoscopy and Colonoscopy	No negative side affects.  Drug was administered at about 11:30 am and I awakened within 30-45 minutes.  I walked back to recovery area. (and I remember walking back to recovery area which I was not able to remember after procedure 5 years ago and a different drug)  I was driven back to my home, but did not sleep until I went to bed that evening at my regular time.A positive thing that I've noticed, is that immediately after my procedure my brain function seemed to regain its level of decades ago.  I'm 63 and my brain is functioning like I'm 35.  I have no trouble solving complex problems or recalling the smallest of details including names, which I'm horrible at.  If this is a side effect, I hope that it remains.  Strange, but I thought I would mention this.		M	63	1  times 1X O	9/22/2012Email
5	Remove cancerous growth on my back	I did not experience any side effects. The anesthesiologist and I talked about past experiences with versad. He put together a "cocktail" of fantyal(spelled wrong), versed and propofol. I asked him if I would feel the sharp pain in my arm as it was being administered. I asked him about being sleepy the rest of the day and the length of time in recovery. I did not experience any  pain as they slowly started sedating me as I was being wheeled to OR. There was no counting nor did he tell he was going to give me the cocktail. I rolled over on my side and just closed my eyes. The next thing I remember was being wheeled into my room where my wife was. I was awake, alert and joking with the nurses. I feel tired because of lack of sleep from worrying about the surgery but it was absolutely great. I shouldnt have worried. The fact that we talked about what to expect helped a great deal. The doctors and staff at the St Vincent Hospital Surgery Center were also very warm, caring and jok		M	61	  1X D	9/19/2012Email
5	colonoscopy	No side effects at all.   I was very nervous about having this procedure  because I had never been sedated before.  However, it was no problem at all!  After the anesthesiologist  injected the medication, I felt dizzy for a second and the next thing I knew my stretcher was being pushed into the recovery room.  I woke up that quickly.  I felt a little tired for about 10 minutes and within a half hour after that I was walking out the door of the surgi-center.  Do not be nervous like I was -  it's not needed.

5	EGD twice and colonoscopy	This was an amazing drug. Peacfully nodded off to sleep and then awakened a bit groggy but ok. The key to success with this and any other medication is to be honest about all medications you are taking including supplements. Also, make sure you are honest about your weight and health history because they dose based on all of those considerations.		F	48	3  times	9/8/2012
1	Given small dose for upper endoscop	I was given propofol three days ago for an upper endo. I am no stranger to the upper endo. I have also had a few surgeries including joint reconstruction for sports injuries. I am beyond upset. I just turned 37 on Monday. I am in shape, eat raw foods, and work out. My procedure was done around 2pm on Thursday. I slept pretty much until 11 pm that evening. I was told the next day I could go back to work. I am on no other meds except for my thyroid and prilosec.. Friday I drove to work in a fog. I should not have. The lines in the road were glowing. I felt sluggish and had to hold onto walls while walking. I forgot my usernames and passwords at work (which are my name). Coworkers said I appeared to be drunk (I drink ZERO alcohol). I left work and drove home right away, except I lost my way home. I drive it every day. I had to pull over and plug in my gps. I have no memory of yesterday. Apparently I called people. I do not remember the conversations I had. And I yelled at people.

5	Colonoscopy	I was so scared to be sedated, and some of the things I read on the Internet terrified me even more- which is why I want to tell anyone that's nervous about propofol for this kind of procedure that everything went brilliantly smoothly.  I have panic disorder and was very frightened about what it might feel like, but honestly it was just like when you fall asleep at night.  I woke when the procedure was over with no side effects or pain.  Don't let the Internet scare you, it was a wonderful experience and I highly recommend it.  One thing I want to add is that it's nice to have an anesthesiologist administering it for further peace of mind, but to anyone like me that's scared, I hope this puts your mind at ease a bit.

1	Endoscopy	So much burning! and my arm keeps on getting like a charlie horse.  & knot that hurts very much and my left side temple is throbbing a lot.	The drug does what it's set out to do I just wish that it didn't have to burn so much.	F	37	1  days 1X D	7/19/2012Email
1	colonoscope	3-4 minutes into colonoscope I had a "respiratory event"-stopped breathing. They had to insert a tube through my nose into the trachea to help me breathe and get me stabilized. When I woke up in the recovery room I was throwing up and coughing up blood and my nose was bleeding. The doctor told me that he takes full responsibility for what happened, and will find out why this happened. I still have a terrible cough 5 days later, have been on antibiotics since the day of the "event", had to go to the ER for the uncontrollable coughing, and was put on steroids and an inhaler.	I will absolutely avoid this medicine in the future, and ask more questions of the dr. and the person administrating any anesthesia. The dr. has called at least once a day, very concerned about what happened. He has sent the remainder of the batch to the manufacturer for testing. I think it should have been sent to an independent laboratory. This has been a terrible experience, and I am anxious to get answers.	F	47	  1X D	7/13/2012Email
4	bunionectomy, screw removed	Bunionectomy went well with no problems.  A year later I had surgery again to remove the screw on the same foot. In the recovery room, I had myoclonus that affected my whole body. My legs and arms were flaring, my back was arching and my neck twisted back and forth. I remember being aware but had no control of my muscles.  After about an hour, the surgicenter called 911 and I ended up in the ER.  I was at the ER for a good 3 hours before the myoclonus went away. I have no longterm adverse reaction but will avoid Propofol in the future.		F	35	1  days1 time	6/23/2012Email
5	Colonoscopy	Only a scratchy sore throat after administration.	This was my first colonoscopy and this drug was great!  Nurse administered under supervision (I suppose) of anesthesiologist.  No burning.  She did administer a clear liquid first and this might have been Lidocaine.  The cloudy liquid followed that both via syringe into my IV.  I said "Oh, I am feeling dizzy" and I didn't have a chance to say that my ears were ringing because I was out.  Woke up w/o nausea or vomiting, fresh, could have driven home.  So, outside of the sore throat (and haven't found anything on the internet so far as to why that is happening with some people) I would have this drug again for sure.	F	55	  1X D	5/16/2012Email
2	colonoscopy/endoscopy (@ same time)	Propofol worked well for the immediate procedure/ It was administered by a nurse anesthesiologist. I had no burning upon administration, just a roaring sound in my ears. My problems have been afterward. The day after the procedure, I experienced agitation, severe (and sudden onset) depression and also paranoia. I did not have a depression or anxiety issue prior to this procedure. (Mechanically, I also had challenges urinating -- no flow, and my bowels still aren't back to normal) One week later the paranoia, agitation, and anxiety are still here. It has disrupted my life. I had been taking acetycholine precursor supplements prior to procedure and note in the research that propofol acts on that system, but I cannot understand exactly how or what I can do to revere these effects.

4	not sure	I had eye surgery 2 wks apart and propofal was given both times.   I had no injection pain. No burning, etc.  The first time was wonderful, slept, woke up as needed and felt wonderfully rested.  the second time I was in an euphoric state and DID NOT GO OUT. I was awake during the surgery.  FELT NO PAIN, nothing.  but I was aware of everything...  I felt like I had "pulled back into my body"  weird feeling..  I saw the laser light as it cut the flap...  omg wonderful beautiful color... I saw the new lens go in... and pop into place.    No anxiety... just amazing to watch....	It was wierd when this drug started to take effect.    I felt like I was drawing backward/downwards into myself...  and it was more what I heard!   IF you have ever been on a jet... THat was the sound.   Like engines starting to rev up to full power... almost a roaring louder and louder...  but coming from inside my head... until boom  I was out.  except for the second time... I still heard and saw everything...but was ok with it.	F	61	1  daysunsure 1X D	4/15/2012Email
3	Colonoscopy	Excruciating pain on injection. It felt like a corkscrew being driven into my hand and acid being injected into my vein. I could feel the drug BURN its way inch by inch up my vein to my shoulder. When it reached my shoulder I still was consious and my hand and arm felt like they were burning from the inside out. The nurse asked if I was ok. I told her the Propofol HURT and she mentioned something about "tiny veins" to the doctor. I felt like I had been tortured. Later I found out there are ways to minimize the pain, for example mixing the Propfol with Lidocaine. I would suggest asking about this before the procedure. This was the WORST pain I have ever felt. Why bother giving anesthesia if the anesthesia is more painful then the procedure.	Make sure they use it with Lidocaine to minimize injection pain!	F	52	  1X D	2/3/2012Email
1	colonoscopy	I was supposed to have propofol administered for a colonoscopy by an anesthesiologist.  Just before the procedure I was told that a CRNA would be administering the drug and: "she was just as qualified" as an anesthesiologist.  Nope, she wasn't. A CRNA is a nurse and she totally blew the "sedation" which nearly turned into a disaster.  As I struggled to breathe, the nurse/CRNA kept asking the GI doc what to do since I was obviously becoming apnic.  After aborting the exam, I spent 2 days in the hospital and was told: "if you need propofol sedation get an anesthesiologist not a nurse.  AT least I wasnt' charged and got an apology from the CRNA..she told me that "she's just a nurse, not an anesthesiologist"...thanks you almost killed me.		F	55	1  days 1X D	1/18/2012

1	Colonscopy	It burned when administered through my IV now 2 weeks later I still feel foggy and have noticed problems with my cognitive abilities (ie today I said erotic when I meant erratic) funny as that may be I have noticed other issues and frankly is scares me because I don't know how long this will last.	Next time before any procedure I will want to talk with the anestesiologist prior to the procedure to see which drug he/she plans on using. I will avoid all further sedation.

1	anesthesia for colonoscopy	I was depressed and had cognitive impairment for two weeks.	Did not realize until it was too late that I was not getting conscious sedation drug such as Versed.  This anesthesia was totally unnecessary other than to get me up and out of the facility quicker. Now I know to inquire in advance about anesthesia.	F	71	  1X D	12/1/2011Email
4	low back steriod injections	Laying here at 3 a.m. for the second time now in 2 weeks after having this. I'm wondering if it is causing it,  but can't find anything online to back up my theory.

3	endoscopic carpal tunnel release	I had this surgery done for my left hand and yes the med. worked so great that I woke up thinking "that was fun - let's do it again."  I have a major depression/anxiety disorder that I already take so much medication for and also in the recovery room I asked everyone that came walking by that I wanted this medicine in pill form instead of benzodiazepams which I have taken for 30 years.Well it has been almost 2 weeks since that surgery and after that "happy medicine" I have had more depression than I have had for years.  I think I would prefer to be drugged by the benzodiazepamseven if I have to take three times as much as a normal person would take and be wide awake (and calmed down) than to wake up with the "happy juice" and have depression episodes afterwards.	I guess I should really rate this medicine high but I won't because of the euphoria afterwards and then the weeks of unwanted depression episodes.  I have had 3 surgeries before this and of course never did get euphoric or depressed!  (And kind of grouchy too even though I have no pain from the surgery).  This is the first time with this propofol that I have ever had.	F	56	 ? 1X D	9/6/2011Email

2	Colonoscopy	I had a colonoscopy yesterday at a surgicenter. I have had all previous colonoscopies done at hospitals. This is the first time with Propofol. There was slight burning in my arm, then I was asleep. Less than an hour after the procedure, on the way home, the glands under both jaws hurt and swelled slightly. It is now almost 24 hours and they still hurt and now itch. I like Versed better.	I know it was a CRNA but I did tell her I need only half of what my weight indicates. I have never had any problems or side effects with anything else if given in a half dose... I don't know if she gave me a full dose or this medicine is not right for me.	F	48	  1X D	6/29/2011Email
5	EGD	Did not feel any discomfort while it was being injected through IV tubing.  Went to sleep quickly and awoke quickly.   Had a cough immediately afterwards which nurse says happens sometimes.   Once I got home I didn't feel great, sore throat and raspy voice.  Cough.   Laid down to rest and was freezing and couldn't warm up.   Had a low grade fever.  It took two blankets, socks, and heating pad to get warm.   I think this was from the propofol.	Last EGD I had done was with Versed.  No problems experienced.	F	60	 unknown 1X D	6/17/2011
5	EGD	I felt very light-headed during injection, but fell asleep instantaneously afterward. It was like blinking and being awake again; felt like a very restful peaceful rest.	There was no burning sensation that they warned about, but it did make me feel light-headed and euphoric for about an hour after it wore off.	M	21	1  timesUnknown 1X D	6/2/2011
5	TWICE--surgery and upper endoscopy	Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Both times I had Propofol, I literally drifted off into a peaceful "slumber." I'd had Versed/Demerol for anesthesia before and had horrible panic when it was administered, as well as a minute or so where I couldn't quite go under. Both of my experiences with Propofol were awesome and cured my fear of anesthesia.	My first "twilight sleep" with Propofol was amazing. I was totally knocked out (for an operation) and I came to in the recovery area feeling really quite great. I was groggy for maybe a minute total. I was able to get up immediately, sip some juice, eat some crackers, get dressed, and walked out the door with my ride. An hour later, my husband took me for grilled cheese and fries and I was totally back to normal within a few hours. Today I had my second experience with Propofol, used for an upper endoscopy with biopsy. I'm glad my doc uses Propofol for this as it makes the experience much easier. I did have a much harder time with recovery today though--was very groggy and emotional for about 45 minutes after being woken up. I wasn't able to leave the recovery area for an hour. My doctor mentioned that this was probably due to my poor health in recent years, so it makes sense that it was harder on my body this time. Needless to say, I'll take Propofol over any other anesthesia any day. None of that nausea or horrible need to sleep that comes with Versed. Side note--my Propofol was administered by an excellent anesthesiologist. He used a lidocaine solution to eliminate all of that burning sensation (which is really kind of scary--I had it the first time). He also had me suck down some oxygen while I was counting to 10 and the Propofol went in--I was totally out by 7.	F	25	1  days 1X D	5/25/2011
5	ERCP	Euphoria then complete sedation.  First times used I had no side effects other than groggy for about 30-45 mins.  Last procedure, I developled allergy like symptoms, severe including watery, itchy eyes; itchy irriated nasal passages, particularly on left side - the side on which I was laying; lots of sneezing and drainage.	Would definitely use again. Have used during numerous surgeries and procedures. Accomplishes the objective of "amnesia" during surgeries and procedures with limited side effects.  I am a mostly healthy person, don't smoke, not overweight. Have trusting doctors with whom I communicate clearly and openly.	F	44	 Unknown 1X D	5/2/2011Email
1	colonoscopy	yep, I was given 500mg of propofol (50ml of propofol 1%) for a supposedly simple outpatient colonoscopy.  I couldn't breathe or communicate,  they kept giving me more of this drug despite my begging for them to stop.  It did NOTHING for pain and left me unwilling to every have anesthesia or sedation again.	Don't consent to propofol unless it's given by an anesthesiologist; nurses such as CRNA just don't have the skill set to handle this drug.  My doc told me this after I had a HORRIBLE incomplete colonoscopy with propofol and she blamed the CRNA for everything....	F	55	1  days500mg 1X D	3/29/2011
5	Colonoscopy	The effects of any drug depends on your personal health, what other drugs you are taking, the length and type of procedure...just a bunch of stuff.  I had 'sedation' administered by a nurse...not a CRNA (a nurse that past a hospital made-up test).  I screamed, I remember screaming, it hurt really bad (found out women have more turns than men...there is a uterus in the way or adhensions after other surgery) and I lost the entire day.  (I found out the gastroenterologist was also working on my rear while directing a nurse not trained in anesthesia to give me Versed, Fentanyl and Phenergan...it was so bad, I paid to have my records sent to me.A CRNA gave me Propofol (Diprivan) 5 years later.  I found out that propofol burns when a smaller vein is used and in younger patients.  The CRNA gave me lidocaine before the propofol....it was no more unpleasant than getting my TB skin test.

3	Shoulder surgery	When the anethesiologist started the Propofol into my IV, I immediately felt a horrible sensation in my IV arm. I remember saying outloud 3 times to the staff in the OR-OW!OW!OW! My arm-something is wrong. I felt like the drug was going into my arm and not the vein. Next thing I remember is waking up in recovery. The good thing about this drug is I had no nausea or side effects at all. I went home after being in recovery for around an hour and felt really good. Not sleepy or anything. Actually was smiling and saying the surgery was a piece of cake EXCEPT the anethesia when it was started.		F	55	  1X D	2/18/2011

But when I woke up I was sneezing and my nose was running, now its the next day, and its the same. I cant stop sneezing and my nose is running. I wonder if its the drug.

1	colonoscopy	A couple of hours after this outpatient procedure, I started with some pain in my throat.  I thought I may have caught something like a cold.  By the next morning, I had both sides of my neck (lymph nodes) swollen, and was experiencing a lot of pain, even to the touch.  I could not swallow very well, and had also a rash on the sides of my face.  The pain did not go away for several days, and even a week after the procedure I still had some pain on my right side node under the jaw.		F	57	 unknown 1X O	1/28/2011
4	Anesthesia during GI Endoscopy	No side effects during induction or recovery. Induction was instantaneous and recovery following initial wake up was complete within 5 minutes. I awoke (became conscious) in the middle of talking to the Anesthetist about her job and how she liked her field. I was also given a dose of Versed to induce amnesia during the procedure (which was apparently very successful, given that I didn't even remember starting a conversation with the anesthesiologist during recover.) From what I gather I came out of the Propofol first and started talking, then the Versed wore off and I started "remembering" what I was talking about - a strange sensation to be sure, but not unpleasant or frightening in any way.	While I would not recommend using this drug as a sleep aid, it is a very efficacious anesthetic and I had NO ill effects from it. I would like to note that I asked the nurse who did my prep care to place the IV line in my antecubital vein (I did so due to reports I had read about venous irritation from the propofol - I had NO irritation with the antecubital placement, the reports seemed to indicate an increased likely hood of irritation when the Propofol was infused into the smaller veins - so if you are asked - you may want to tell them you want your IV line in the antecube space, as opposed to arm or hand placement) My hereditary linage is German/Irish, former smoker (10+ years post quit) and not athletic at all(unfortunately). I was real spooked about this stuff going in, new drug to me and all, and if you are going to be receiving it, it should only be administered in a facility that has the proper tools to handle any potential ACLS events - the only folks who should be giving Propofol (IMHO) are licensed and experienced anesthetists - and then, they need to ALL the tools ready at hand to manage any problem, should it arise. This is just common sense, and a famous singer might be alive today had he taken this basic precaution. All the latter being said, if I would need to be anesthetized again, I would not hesitate to choose Propofol!	M	40	1  days<60mg 1X D	1/10/2011
3	eye surgery	Had it three times.  Twice for the administration of local anesthestics.  It worked fine for the brief periods required--left me mildly euphoric.  Had it once for a 40-minute procedure.  It left me in a "manic" state--euphoric, very irritable, slightly irrational.  For a brief period, I'd rate propofol a 5; for a 40-minute procedure, I'd give it a 1.5.  The amnesia for local anethesia injections was not a problem.  However, the 40-minute amnesia was (for reasons not quite rational) extremely upsetting, leaving me feeling "violated."		F	57	  1X D	11/28/2010
1	outpatient surgery	I wanted to have a simple operation fone with regional anes only (bier block).. the surgi center doesn't have anesthesiologist coverage, so I got stuck with a nurse (crna) who "insisted" on sedation with propofol/fentanyl for this simple procedure.  after she gave me multiple 30mg bolus injections of propofol, I begged he to stop. I couldn't breathe and the feeling was awful.  finally, I got a hand free and grabbed the IV and yanked it out.   The crna got stuck, the surgeon totally freaked out and screamed at the idiot crna.  awful drug.	if you want propofol, get an anesthesiologist not a nurse (crna)..if you want your brain intact.

5	IV Sedation procedure	Immediately after I was administered the Propofol, I had a very SLIGHT burning, then I closed my eyes, and a second later I woke up and was ready to go home. It was like I blinked. I wasn't even groggy - just relieved that I got my work done. Being out of it for a day or two is definitely worth a life saving procedure - although with Propofol I woke up alert and probably could have driven myself home. It's the other drugs they use that can give you a hangover and linger. Not Propofol. Thank God for Propofol. I'll be having this again for an upcoming proecedure in January 2011. I'm not scared at all.	This was used for deep sedation and not General Anesthesia (GA) along with no other meds. If you had a bad experience under Anesthesia or IV sedation, it was probably from one of the other drugs they put in your IV... NOT Propofol.		24	2  times10mg 1X O	11/20/2010
5	Colonoscopy	Pleasantly light-headed for about 3 hours following the procedure.  Time also seemed to speed by for several hours after O woke up--everytime I looked up at the clock another 45 minutes had sped by almost instantaneously.	Great stuff.  This is the second colonscopy I've experienced, the first one five years ago being overwhelmingly painful with 200 mcg fentanyl and 2 mg versed.  This time they booked me in for propofol.  The anesthetist hooked up the drug line to the IV and told me the stuff had started flowing in.  My legs sudddenly felt relaxed, then I became a little bit dizzy, and then I was waking up in bed in the holding cell.  Amazing.  I thought I was home in bed and was wondering if it was time to get up yet and then realized there was a door opposite me and thought, "wait a minute this isn't my bedroom".  I was out of there 45 minutes later.  Stairs and walking were a slight challenge for a couple of hours because of some pleasant light-headedness and time seemed to speed by.  Stripping off the tape to remove the IV was the only painful part.  Oh, and this morning I found out I had these things stuck to my chest where they must of had the EKG leads--they're not coming loose anytime soon.	M	61	1  times? 1X O	10/28/2010Email
5	Colonoscopy	None.	About 10 seconds after the drug was administered, I felt an  amazing sedative sensation. Just great, really. The next thing I knew, the procedure was done and I felt like I had the the most wonderful restful sleep, ever. I remember nothing. This stuff is just the best!	M	53	1  days 1X D	10/25/2010
1	Laser surgery		This was a very short laser surgery, only about 15 minutes to laser a small spot where my son has some Multiple Glomuvenous Malformations.  It didn't help them, but caused him this debilitating pain and him not being able to walk hardly at all without even more severe pain and weakness.	M	14	 ? 1X D	10/4/2010EmailHistory
1	General anesthesia	In post op, I had a difficult time waking up.It took much longer for me to become coherent than it should have.  WELL, SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT. It is 7 days post op and I continue to feel "out of it," confused, have headaches, difficulty concentrating at work & home, discolored urine and more. I talked with the anesthesiologist before surgery and reminded her that I take very little medication, rarely drink, don't smoke and that I require less medication to achieve the proper level of anesthesia for surgery.I will never give permission for this medication to be used on me again.		F	60	1  times 1X D	9/23/2010

Lost sense of direction while driving, cannot multiply in higher numbers, am having to re-learn computer functions vs keys for my job, and worst of all while I'm talking about something... i don't just forget the next word... but i cannot substitute another word because I Do NOT remember WHAT i was saying...

5	colonoscopy	It entered my vein and I imediately felt calm and closed my eyes, that was it.  I woke up and everything was over.	After researching everything on colonoscopy and the propofol they would use I was petrified...I had never been put to sleep.  I will never be afraid again, it was a breeze and I've learned a great lesson...Don't google your procedure or meds to death...you'll always find weird and negative feedback that will scare you...there's no need for it. Trust God, trust your Dr.	F	35	  1X D	8/9/2010
4	EGD	Went under fairly quick, woke up without any grogginess. Within a few hrs I felt very disoriented and sleepy which they said might happen. No burning when administered. But it's 48hrs after procedure and aim still 'out of it' and experiencing jaw pain, no idea why	Kind of confused about the jaw pain and the length of time it's taking to leave mt system but No Anxiety!

5	I give it	For those getting it as part of general anesthesia,do you know how many other drugs you are getting? the only real complaint is burning as it goes in. Other than that it does not cause sore throat unless you get a device placed for breathing, it is supposed to render you unconscious in the case of general anesthesia, so quit acting surprised, and some of you are just had to please. MJ did not have a rxn to the drug. It did what it does in large doses and there was no one to support his breathing.	It does not make you stop breathing while you are awake, muscle relaxants do that!!!and when you give consent general for anesthesia, it is part of it, otherwise let us know if you want us to use ether drops to make sure you stay asleep or better yet wrestle you like they did in the dark ages.		30	 1mg/kg 1X D	7/13/2010
2	surgery	I was given this drug for general anesthesia for a ruptured appendix. I noted no side effects until a couple of weeks later when I was helping my daughter with her math and temporarily could not do simple multiplication(ie. 8x9 which is in my long term memory)I spoke to the pharmacist at work who told me that how propafol works is that it cuts down oxygen supply to the brain.This drup has only been around for a few years.(My nurses PDR which is from 2001 does not have this drug in it). I will never take this drug again.	I am perfectly healthy,not overweight,not diabetic ,no hypertension.The only medication I take is daily thyroid replacement	F	57	1  daysdon't know 1X D	6/10/2010
1	colonoscopy	burning sensation in my throat at the time the drug was administered--when I woke up I had a severe sore throat and my voice was almost gone.  It's been 3 days since my surgery and voice is coming back slowly.	I've had propofol before and never had any problem, but after this experience I won't take it again.	F	67	  1X D	4/30/2010
2	anesthesia for colonoscopy	The drug really worked ..put me out instantly/no pain/  woke up feeling a little loopy.  I attributed  2 days of dizziness  and muscle spasms(post procedure)to hang- over from drug.I had muscles spasms in the neck and shoulders..(very painful.).muscles at back of neck,across the shoulders and along the jaw were very stiff. Glands under the jaw were tender to the touch. Four days after the procedure I was still having problems...Pain was so severe that I sought out assistance at an urgent care facility as my primary Doctor was not available.  The Doctor examining me  told may be it was the position I was placed in during the procedure that was causing the pain.  I asked her  if it was possible that the drug was a causitive factor..I felt fine before I went in for the colonoscopy and the only change was the fact I was given that drug....The Doctor said she couldn't correlate the symptoms I was having with the use of diprivan/propofol..I think she needs to go on the internet and educate		F	71	  1X D	4/22/2010
4	5 surgeries	Minor burning upon injection (although sometimes they mixed it with something else so it wouldn't burn), vertigo after injection during induction (although this didn't happen when they also gave me Versed), minor nausea which ended up being prevented entirely in future surgeries, and just the general tired, groggy and dizzy feeling after surgery.	I have had 5 surgeries (3 laparoscopies, 1 mini laparotomy (with a laparoscopy), breast augmentation and rhinoplasty) in the last few years and I have discovered for me the best combination is Propofol with Versed and multiple antiemetics.  If you have to have surgery/general anaesthesia, this is by far the nicest option.	F	27	5  days 1X O	4/20/2010
1	colonoscopy	I have been in extreme pain and on meds for 5 weeks after having propofol. The pain is mostly in my joints but my bones and almost everything hurts including the glands under my jawbone. I cam currently taking 400mg celebrex, 7-500 Hydrocodone, 5mg prednisone, to stop whatever is causing the pain.	When administered, it was one of the worst pains that I have ever felt. I screamed to the anesthesiolist that she was killing me and all she said was that the vapors had only gotten into my system the liquid hadn't entered yet. I have had a dozen surgeries and this is the first time that I have ever had pain, especially severe pain. I do not know what to do if the pain doesn't stop soon, I am crippled and hardly able to get out of bed? Already lost my job last Friday because I cannot function at any level. Just lying in bed hurts!	M	62	1  days? 1X D	2/23/2010Email
5	Oral Surgery	Very SLIGHT burning sensation (I'm a small person!) which lasted a few seconds and then my eyes got a little blurry, then I woke up feeling wonderful. The good feeling only lasted a few minutes because Propofol wears off SO fast! I am EXTREMELY sensitive to all drugs affecting brain as I am a recovering benzodiazepine dependent, and this drug is very safe. Even with a bolus dose and Asthma, I didn't even come close to being apneic or having low blood pressure. My anesthesiologist agrees that it is the most well tolerated anesthetic/sedative and MJ's doctor was not using it properly. The media is full of crap.	I've had this drug twice in the last 5 years. Both good experiences. Last week was for Oral Surgery, with just Propofol and a small dose of Valium, it was very smooth going to sleep, no panic and waking up clearly. Very good exp. I am also a recovering benzodiazepine addict, which made it even more important that I not have Versed (it is a benzodiazepine), as it (Versed) would either not work requiring huge doses or it would provoke a return of withdrawal symptoms that I experienced coming off of other benzos such as Xanax. Before I was a dependent on benzos, Versed worked very well for me, BUT These days, Versed would most probably make me EXTREMELY sick due to my brain's sensitivities.

5	Surgery	Total Euphoria, this was given to me with Ketamine.	I was completely out! I woke up and thought I was in Paradise, I have craved the feeling since, I had a headache later on, but the euphoria and sedation was very good.	M	25	1  days	2/2/2010
5	Upper Endoscopy	Burned terribly when IV was started, but only for about 10 seconds, then I was out.	LOVED it.  In the past, I've hated being knocked out- crying, panic attack, etc.  This was absolutely peaceful.  It was no more than 10 seconds from when they started the IV (and I felt burning) until my eyes were closing.  When it was over a simple "It's time to wake up now" woke me right up.  It was like waking up in the morning- within 5 minutes I was wide awake- no "fog", not groggy, not "out of it".  I'm a medical wimp, and I wouldn't even sweat it if I had to have Diprivan again.	F	25	1  times	1/25/2010
5	Anesthesiologist	Pain on injection is the most common complaint	A great medication for those who need sedation during invasive procedures.  Side effects:  If every single possible side effect was discussed prior to surgery then you would never have the surgery.  Side effects can range from nothing to death, if not used properly.  Water can kill you if you drink too much!  I think it is reasonable to discuss common or dangerous side effects.  If you want a zero percent chance of a side effect then do not request anesthesia.  Propofol is a great drug that has the best side effect profile of any medication that is available.  Bad experiences:  This can range based on the anesthesia provider (an art and science), the surgical provider, overall hospital/clinic experience and the underlying personality of the patient.  Let's be honest, some people are impossible to safisfy.	M	40	 	11/27/2009
1	Wisdom tooth removal	Catastrophic loss of memory, dizziness, inability to function at normal cognitive level	I woke up from anaesthetic and was euphoric. My problems started as the anaesthesia wore off. I became dizzy and disorientated and unable to think logically or remember correctly. After 2 days  I rang the doctor, and could remember my name but not my date of birth. I lost all higher cognitive function. I stopped going out. I couldnt any way as I had no mind maps I could follow. I could see my front door and "see" the place I wanted to go but couldnt visualise a route from memory. I could not compute; if I picked up two packs of meat in a shop I could not work out which was better value. A 2 year nightmare, and then a 2 year recuperation.	F	35	1  days	11/22/2009

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS.

His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself.

4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .

This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me.

Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!	M	37	21  days10 1X D	2/24/2011Email
5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
