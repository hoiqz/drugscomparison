4	Depression/Anxiety	Slight dizziness and some hypotension early on.	Helped much more for anxiety than other drugs I have taken in the last year (celexa, pristiq, wellbutrin, remeron and Viibryd.  I feel like this drug is in a whole different category as far as horsepower to get rid of the anxiety.  Still to be determined how it will take care of my other depression symptoms, but for anxiety nothing can touch it.  Good luck finding someone to prescribe it without going through a checklist of all the newer drugs first.	M	43	50  days20 mg 3X D	7/13/2013Email
5	Atypical depression, panic disorder	Afternoon fatigue during the first couple of weeks which has dissappeared. A small amount of dry mouth, easy to deal with.	This medication has been an absolute life saver. I have tried almost every medication inthe psychotropic arsenal, several doctors, and Parnate has relieved nearly every symptom that I have suffered from for the last 22 years. The grass is green, the sky blue, I wake up early every morning, motivated, hobbies are fun again, appetite control (have lost 16 lbs in the 5 weeks I have been taking it), I can concentrate on work and tasks, and I could go on. I have used EMSAM and Nardil also, but for me Parnate is far superior to both. EMSAM too stimulating and caused easy agitation and Nardil made me want to sleep all the time with rediculous weight gain. Parnate has my highest recommendation (generic or brand, I've had both with no difference).	M	40	5  weeks10mg 2X D	7/9/2013Email

5	subcycling unipolar disorder	13 yrs total now down to 20 mg. My posting before must have been too long as it didn't save. I had another tyramine  reaction... middle eastern food. Someone else ordered and I never thought of what marinated meant. 10 minutes after the meal I had a head ache like never before and my blood pressure was way out there. It meant a trip to the emergency room. The triage people were not very nice...but once I got the med to bring my blood pressure down I recovered quickly. Hair loss continues but not as much now at 20? or it is my age.	To the person wanting encouragement... keep on. It may take awhile. It might help to keep a journal so you can go back and read it later and find that you are improving. Be reasonable with the diet. New guidelines are not as strict as the old ones. A tiny tiny bit of something you like as a  treat might work. Or if it is something you don't like, use your diet as an excuse to not have it! Like Herring or liver!

5	treatment resistant depression	bad taste after eating - getting used to itdry mouthhair loss - fortunately I have plenty!feel cold more easilyappetite loss - a good thing	I have been depressed for years and although I tried about 12 different meds and combinations, as well as several sessions of EST, was non-responsive.  Dr. at hospital recommended this "old" drug Parnate; said its benefits might outweigh its side-effects/restrictions.   I don't miss cheese or coldcuts; I do miss salted fish and soya sauce.  But not enough to give up Parnate.  For the first time in years, I feel like a normal person.   I didn't even know how depressed I was until it went away.   I can't believe what a difference this has made to my life.   I already had hereditary hypertension, but was already on meds for it and have not had to adjust them any.  I was already on Imovane for sleeping so am not experiencing any insomnia that some have reported.  It took about a month before I really felt well; so don't give up after just a week or two.   For me, this was a life-saver.	F	59	4  months30mg 1X D	2/12/2013
4	Depression	Tired in the early evening	Parnate is an effective medication.  I do take it with a small dose of Zyprexa (1.25 mg).  The zyprexa will make you gain a lot of weight. So, if you go this route only take the lowest dose.The Parnate would seem effective most of the time but then become less effective.  I would up the dose... now up to 60 mgs.  Then I DISCOVERED THAT CINNAMIN WASHS OUT PARNATE.  Only Dr Bob memtions this important fact.  SinceI stopped eating cinnamin Parnate is effective daily.  I do not eat chesse, soy or aged meants.  I not not drink wine or tap beer.   Now NO CINNAMIN.	M	59	3  months60 Mgs 1X D	1/14/2013Email

5	subcycling unipolar disorder	I find Parnate very activating. Hair loss has been significant (this time.) I am glad to read others have had the same thing. To help the insomnia, my doctor and I worked out a plan to take most of the 30 mg early in the day. I take 20 in the morning and the other 10 about 2 pm.  I still sleep less than before, but that is ok.	I tried everything. Most things helped a little. Even lithium. The lithium took care of the depression but I got so shaky it was not good. I took another medication that was making me bald which is not ok with me. I took Parnate for about 8 years the first time, very very slowly decreasing the dose and still doing great. After about 5 years I recognized the depression was coming back. I went back to the doctor, we started on the 30 mg and in about 1 month I felt much better. Now, 9 months on t30 mg I don't even think about it.. I just throw the pills in my mouth and love life again.	F	49	10  years30 1X D	5/27/2012Email
3	Depression	Always cold, insomnia, dry mouth, sexual side effects, and deminishing benefits.	The drug was helpful at first but over a relatively short time I needed to up the dose until the doctor siad I hit my limit at 60.Now he is puting me back on Nardil... which was more effectivebut had a worse sexual side effect.  The doctor claims that this side effect will go away in time. >>>? Best Wishes Gang.	M	58	100  days30 MG 2X D	4/19/2012Email
4	Anxiety/depression	Other than feeling chilled all the time, fatigue was a constant issue. Parnate worked well for my panic disorder. I had been on parnate for three years when out of nowhere the worst headaches came on suddenly( no relation to parnate) neurologists believe I had a bout w/ cluster headaches. They lasted 22 days and since I was on parnate, they couldn't treat them. The doctors were blocked because of all the drug interactions. Needless to say I was in and out of the hospital to be on iv w/ dialoded for 22 days to cover the pain. If these intact were clusters, I couldn't stay on an MAOI. This was an easy decision to make since the headaches felt just as painful as giving birth. I did a quick 2 1/2 wk ween off and have been parnate free for 1 week now. Yes, the anxiety is back. So parnate did do it's job. But I'll take panic( although aweful) over clusters anyday.		F	33	3  years40 mg	1/27/2012
5	Treatment Resistant Depression	Acute blood pressure spikes when starting first initial dosing, which disappeared after a couple days. Some hypo-tension, afternoon fatigue, anhedonia, cold intolerance, and memory recall problems have surfaced.	First anti-depressant/psychiatric medication to work for me... EVER. Tried everything from SSRI/SSNI/TCA's, mood stabilizers, anti-psychotics to stimulants and even NDMA antagonists.. Name it, I've tried it. The first 4 weeks I felt clear, motivated, and best of all NORMAL. Fatigue has been my biggest complaint, but on some days I am side-effect free. Memory recall is bothersome to some degree, but memory seems to be improving over time. The first 4 weeks were interrupted by bereavement, which I am still dealing with now. I believe if it wasn't for Parnate, I'd be in a much scarier place than all the places I've been over the past 5 years while dealing with atypical depression.	M	28	4  months20 3X D	1/18/2012
5	Major Depression, Anxiety	Insomnia for the first couple of months. .5mg Ativan at night helps a lot. Sensitivity to cold (which is totally bearable and seems to be common). Otherwise very few compared to other antidepressants (no fatigue, dry mouth, constipation, sexual side effects).	This drug completely changed my life. I was diagnosed at 16 and have tried every SSRI and "new" drug on the market (Cymbalta in particular was a disaster), and it was just last year that a psych finally went outside the box and suggested this. Before this I was constantly tired (body and mind), had poor cognitive function, and going to the grocery store took every ounce of energy I could muster. My depression was obviously resistant to treatment so why an MAOI wasn't suggested earlier is beyond me. All drugs have drawbacks, so avoiding a very small selection of foods is a small price to pay in exchange for overall mental health. I have had no issues with interactions even having eaten many of the off limits foods in small amounts (not that I'm testing it). If you have never tried an MAOI and haven't found relief from the more mainstream medications, talk to your doctor about this.	F	32	8  months30mg 1X D	12/30/2011Email
3	depression	Parnate was the 1st (& only) anti~d that has ever helped me. I felt 'normal'. But sleep disorders and eventual constant sedation forced me to discontinue. I still question why. The 2nd time I tried it (year later) it sedated me from day one and discontinued after 3 weeks.		F	32	8  monthstwice dail	12/6/2011
5	Depression, Body Dysmorphia	Unstable sleep cycle (insomnia alternating with hypersomnia), intolerance to cold, mild tachycardia, mild hypotension, dilated pupils	I find it fascinating that all of the low ratings were given by people who did not reach a therapeutic dose of the drug for a standard amount of time and therefore can't really judge whether or not it "worked." Yes, Parnate can be a difficult medication to take. But once you've experienced the Parnate response, you'll be amazed that you ever complained about side effects. This drug works if you let it work.

5	treat. resist. depress. for 29yrs!	2.5 Hr Half Life-take 2 FID/2 Q4hrs. Neg.few esp.compared to Nardil(mega SE)-was on for 20 yrs; Parnate mild orthostatic hypotension, hypomania/good-like rather than not being able to get out of bed-urinary hestitancy. Been on 5 yrs. tot. but stopped, tried Cymbalta; NO, stay on Parnate-"most potent REM blocker of any meds" (I still dream too much as I have REM sleep disorder) and everyone with any depression has an overative brain-too much REM (PET SCAN shows too much glucose being used anyone depressed-only with remission of depression does glucose metab. return norm-Deep Brain Stimulation fixes-"cures depression" and will replace ECT). Overactive REM from whatever cause, excessive glucose uptake/use-overactive kappa system, ie, not enough natural endorphins-Buprenorphine/Subutex tremendously helped my TRD as it's a kappa antagonist-blocker.  Newer meds don't block REM as well only Parnate (MAOI B + A with preference to B so more DA-dopamine-great for libido, but	The World Health Organization, WHO, has recognized that "Suicide will be the number "2 cause of deaths second only to heart disease by the year 2020." It's 10 years from now. I need to get writing my autobiography as I have additional techniques that no psychiatrist ever mentioned to me to treat my TRD with anxiety; Sleep deprivation for 1-2 nights will make most feel 100% normal except for sleepiness-reduces glucose levels to normal in brain-as soon as one gets any amount of sleep-depression returns; Cold Water Therapy-decreases glucose metabolism in the brain- increases NE-endorphins-enkephalins in the brain and wakes one up, revitalized and is good for the immune system-depressed patients are at risk-as it suppresses immunity; Physical Exercise decreases glucose in the brain, increases all monoamines NE,5HT,DA+GABA-increases endorphins+enkephalins and over a long period downsizes the overactive kappa receptors and sweating cools off the overactive brain too.  Ask away-I've had severe TRD+anxiety+somatic symptoms since 15y/o currently 44y/o, medically trained-allopathic+naturpathic. Had 80 ECT's 18y/o + 19y/o without success+have tried over "100 psychotherapeutic drugs" alone+combination-even non FDA approved ones from other parts of the world, other treatment from spiritual John of God in Brazil-you name-tried it.

5	Severe depression	Parnate has allowed meto be somewhat normal, the rest are my quirks. Tried switching several times due tomy docs, never worked. I had to plead them to keep me on. I'm on veteran care.  I've had 5 headaches, the bad ones, due to eating unknown aged foods, those really stink!  Concerned about my libido, porn, and question the morality of it!

5	Clinical Depression and Anxiety	initially: afternoon tiredness and insomnia both have gone away for the most part but i still require very little sleep maybe 4-5 hrs.i still have: a "speed" like feeling when i initially take it, will flush and sweat, no appetite, weight loss, withdrawal symptoms sometimes occur before I can even take my next dosage which involve "brain zaps" and crying episodes, high sex drive, dry mouth	I suffered almost my entire life with sometimes crippling anxiety and depression. From the age of 14 until 30 I have been on almost every medication and medication combo. This drug gave me back my life. They were looking at ECT before they started me on this and it truly is a wonder drug. The side effects for me are pretty severe but, it's so worth it to feel this wonderful when I never thought I would know happiness or at least be able to live a semi normal life. I must admit I follow the diet very loosely and ive been told not everyone can do that but I haven't had any issues aside from eating a 2 day old hotdog once and you will definitely know if you eat something you shouldnt.

1	Anxiety, severe depression, ADD	blurred vision, emotional blunting, short term memory problems, worsened ADD, aggressiveness, irritability, low blood pressure, derealization, depersonalization, insomnia, fatigue	The weird thing about the medication was that I seemed to get different side effects on different days. Some days I was really aggressive and had insomnia, some days I was emotionally blunted and slept like a baby. I had blurred vision throughout and stopped the medication (with docs approval) mostly because of that and the episodes of aggressiveness. I can see why it works for well for some people because it is very strong and it did help some with my depression, anxiety, and motivation problems, but the side effects were too severe for me to continue the med. I still have blurred vision, memory problems, and worsened ADD 3 weeks after discontinuing the medication which is very worrisome. If you are sensitive to medications like me (I have tried many different medications), I would advise against going the MAOI route.	F	26	2  weeks5 to 10 mg 1X D	6/25/2011Email
5	Major Clinical Depression	Found I had high blood pressure side effects w/some on the list but not others.  Soy sauce is a major culprit, as is sauerkraut.	I'm 60 yrs. old and before taking Parnate I could never deal with the depression or the side effects of other medication.  I can live w/the dietary constrictions easily because it has helped with depression and mood stabilization for so long with me.	F	60	24  years30 MG 1X D	5/24/2011

1	Major Depression	Major increase in blood pressure at all times; had to go on a beta blocker just to be able to continue taking the med. Insomnia. Major anxiety upon discontinuation (which had only been a minor issue previously).	I realize parnate has been a life-saver for a lot of people, but it was a horrible drug for me! My blood pressure immediately rose to dangerous levels up initiation of treatment, so my dr. put me on a beta blocker just to stabilize my bp enough to continue taking the drug. After 6 weeks at 40mg/day with NO improvement in my depression, I abruptly stopped taking it. No withdrawel symptoms per se, but my blood pressure, which had been normal prior to taking parnate, has remained elevated 2 months after discontinuation and my anxiety levels have skyrocketed. I had minor anxiety prior to taking parnate, but never like I've had since stopping treatment. It seems to have permanently changed my body/brain chemistry. Example -- I tried to resume taking wellbutrin after stopping parnate (after a 2 week washout) and while the wellbutrin did help improve my mood as it had done in the past, my anxiety was so increased that I could no longer take wellbutrin, leaving me in a bad situation. I am now trying various serotonin-type drugs to help quell my anxiety so I can resume treatment with wellbutrin at some point (that's the only drug that's helped me much over the years, but had pooped out on me), but so far , not having any luck. MAOI's are generally known for decreasing a patient's blood pressure, but be aware that for a few people, it can majorly increase your blood pressure and that effect may not go away even after ceasing treatment...be careful!

5	Bipoler II	Dry mouth quit after 3yrs, Hair loss upped protein intake helped, Hard falling asleep need meds.,sometimes dizzy,	I started on Nardill which dropped my blood pressure saver lie. Then on Parnate it happened not as bad. Figured out black licorice was the problem. It's one of ther bad foods. I can tolerate most other foods in moderation and not at the same time except red wine even something cooked with red wine. I have a restricted diet anyway from having gastric bypass surgery 7yrs ago so I'm not sure that some of my symptoms are related to that. I am going thru menopause too.		54	5  years40mg 2X D	1/31/2011Email
5	depression with anxiety	no circadium rhytmn (sleep in naps like cat), major libido increase, appetite increase, progrogressive cognitive abilitity over time, no clincial response until nearly twice clinical dose.	Slight need to up/down dose with body weight, Weight gain is major issue; no manic symptoms, but definate acceleration of word and concept recall and ablility to learn after years. Dose of Li help stablize and even effect of this shortacting drug.The time a day regimen a laborior, but worth it. 5 BP machinse, 1 in car, in boat, 2 in hours, 1 in man-bag, etc. Been on MAOi for over over 20 years.

5	Major Depression	Very sleepy at first, especially after eating a meal.  Dry mouth that I still have which I have learned to live with.	Parnate saved my life.  I suffered severe depression for over 30 years before I finally found this drug after doing my own research in one of my darkest hours. I had been in the wrong group of drugs my entire life.  I sincerely wish a doctor would have figured that out sooner.  Parnate was effective for me within a few days.  The world was just lighter.  I finally realized how "normal" people feel.  Parnate should not be a drug of last resort.  I lost years of my life without knowing about it and the medical community did not mention it.	F	56	2  years10 mg 6X D	11/16/2010Email
2	Major depression	In the first 1-2 weeks, extreme fatigue (not so much tiredness) in the afternoons. I could barely keep my eyes open. I also had trouble falling asleep initially, although did not feel tired in the mornings. An odd side effect was feeling very cold, particularly at night time, when others reported the room temperature was fine. Overall, there were none of the horrible side effects associated with tricyclics or SSRIs.	I've tried SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclics and others, with limited success. After reading the positive comments on here, I thought Parnate would prove to be a success for me. However, after 3.5 weeks, I can't say I feel any better, and in fact feel that I'm deteriorating. I've ordered Stablon from an overseas pharmacy and hope that proves to more helpful.	M	34	3.5  weeks30mg 1X D	11/4/2010
1	Major Depression	Extreme fatigue, drowsiness and inability to concentrate to the point that I can no longer work full time.  Extreme water retention ~ 10 lbs gained in 1 week.	After trying many other types/combinations of anti-depressants and ECT over the past 19 yrs, I have never felt worse than I have since switching to Parnate.  Maybe these side effects will go away with time but I have never experienced anything similar with other medications.	F	43	1  weeks10 MG 3X D	10/15/2010
5	Atypical Depression	When I first started taking it my vision would "roll" like a frame by frame film when I was driving.  With time, that went away.	I'd been through every medication available and 9 electric shock therapies in a 3 week time frame.  Nothing was helping.  I was cycling down further each time and staying there longer.  Parnate keeps me from cycling and has me on an even keel unless I'm experiencing a lot of stress in my life.  I'm not "happy", but I'm able to function and interact.  When I couldn't go to sleep or stay asleep the doctor put me on Neurontin 400 mg and it helps most of the time.  I break the Parnate dosage into 2 parts, one at 8 am and one at lunch.  I take the larger dose in the morning.	F	51	15  years70 mg 1X D	8/27/2010Email
5	atypical depression	urinary frequency, esp. at night (every hour last night!), urinary hesitancy, feeling very cold (cold sensitivity- only when A/C air blowing on me) alternating with very hot, decreased appetite (YAY!!!!), increased libido (double YAY!), some odd hand/leg flailing movements when sleeping (wakes me up).	I've been depressed all of my life. I'm 38. I was on the EMSAM (MAOI) patch and it was the first thing that ever worked for me (20 years of my life wasted on trial after long trial of the "new!" antidepressants) and it felt like a miracle but it only lasted a year. I was at max dose and augmentation strategies (ritalin, adderal, provigil, abilify, seroquel, xanax) did not help. I've only been taking Parnate for a week but on day 3 it was like BOOM!- life changed again. I hope it lasts!!! I feel like a person again instead of an immobile hermit!  Doc was hesitant about trying MAOI- I told HIM about the patch. He was afraid I'd intentionally kill myself by eating the wrong stuff.  If your doctor gives you this line, simply say, "Well, if this works I won't want to kill myself, will I?!"	F	38	1  weeks10 1X D	8/7/2010EmailHistory

5	major depression	insomnia which decreased over time	Best AD available.  Worked for me, finally, after 20 yrs of depression. It did "poop-out" after 1-2 yrs; then on many other AD's with Effexor as the only one to come close. Helped me feel energy again to deal w/ life.  Later was tried on the generic, which did nothing.  Didn't realize the brand-generic disconnect. Now am looking forward to returning to Brand name Parnate.  MAOI's are the only true antidepressants.  I would have died without it.	F	53	1.5  years30 mgs 2X D	6/23/2010
5	Major Depressive Disorder	Sleep Disturbances at 30 mg or more	I've tried nearly all the ADs on the market.  NONE of them came close to Parnate in effectiveness.  My nurse & doc said it was the "nuclear weapon" against depression - very effective, but one of the last resorts.  You MUST pay attention to the warnings and avoid alcohol, certain other meds & anesthetics, & certain foods.  After the first course of 30mg/day, I found I could use 10 mg/day for less side effect danger, but it still gives me the boost I need.  It is expensive even in generic (less with a drug discount card) but well worth it.  Can have sleep problems (insomnia & strangely, afternoon drowsiness) at 30 mg or more.	M	51	2  years10 mg 1X D	6/3/2010
5	Anxiety and panic attacks	If taken after 3.00pm insomnia can develop.Sensitivity to light(only sometimes) and dry  mouth are the three main symptoms that have effected me over the years.	I have been on this medication for some time. I have stopped it twice during two pregnancy of which I survived without any problems. After the birth of my first child I  developed post natal depression and the doctor put me on nardil. This helped me a great deal. Then when I was pregnant the second time I stopped taking the medication but as soon as the baby was born I knew the symptoms of depression and I went straight to my doctor who started me on Nardil so I did not suffer the symptoms of depression for long. Then Nardil was taken off the market and my doctor then prescribed Parnate for me which is from the same family as Nardil. Without this medication I would not have been able to survive the normal things that you do from day to day. I have been able to rare a family and work at the same time and if taking a tablet everyday means getting you out of bed and putting a smile on your face then its worth the while.

5	ptsd; refractory depression	Orthostatic hypotension, insomnia and fatigue, 24/7 jaw clenching, dilated pupils and blurred vision, low appetite, anorgasmia, choreoathetoid movements (worse at night), urinary hesitancy	I wouldn't be putting up with all these side-effects if my response hadn't been so profound. It wasn't mania; it was a recovery of myself; it was happiness and it was pure and normal. But it pooped out. I'm still playing around with increasing the dose and/or augmenting it with different things.  Dexedrine in small doses has helped with the hypotension.  So does spacing out the Parnate.The choreoathetosis is apparently unusual.A lot of people report a stimulant-like effect from Parnate.  I don't experience this feeling at all, apart from the magical absense of leaden paralysis and psychomotor slowing.	F	22	1  years100mg 1X D	4/3/2010Email
3	Depression	Cold Sensitivity, High Blood Pressure (non-diet related), slight weight loss (good thing), afternoon fatigue (went away)	Started taking Parnate in December at 10mg.  Taped up 10mg about every 2 to 3 weeks until I reached 60mg.  It helped with depression but didn't necessarily make things more enjoyable.  I felt more focused about getting things done when I had things to do.  It also seemed to really help with self-confidence in social situations.  However at the same time I felt a little empty in the feeling department (not enough serotonin?).  I'd still be on it but I noticed (accidentally really) that an hour or two after each dose my blood pressure was going extremely high (like 170/100).  The only reason I caught this was because I was at a CVS waiting for a script and used their machine out of bordom - it was extemely high. Freaked me out so I bought a BP monitor and sure enough every morning my BP was around 115/75 which is normal but after taking my first dose of Parnate (2x10mg) it would shoot up to at least 160/90.  This wasn't diet related as I checked it for 4 days and made sure I wasn't taking anything even remotely risky for MAOI takers.  Due to that unfortunate side effect my pdoc and I decided to take me off Parnate and we're going to give Marplan a try.  Hopefully that'll work as well as Parnate and w/o the weight gain Nardil is supposed to cause.  I'll post my experience w/ Marplan in a few months.  My pDoc was adamant that my other meds didn't contribute to the BP problem but to be fair I was also taking: Lamictal (200mg), Lithium (600mg), and Seroquel (100mg).

5	Major Depression	Some vertigo, Insomnia, altered taste of some foods	Began zoloft about 15 years ago and switched to several SSRIs and SNRIs that all stopped working. Pdoc suggested Parnate in November 2009 and I began with generic that did not work. Once I switched to brand name it worked! I never feel the symptoms of depression i once had although I do have some recurring anxeity that I take .5 mg of Xanax for maybe 5x per week tops. The diet is no big deal to stick to and I lost 18 lbs on it anyway. People say I look great and those who know about my depression say I appear happier and more social. Honestly, I was tired of crying about whatever was bothering me and never wanting to leave my apartment. I'll stick with Parnate and watch my diet so I can be 'normal'. I strongly advise trying it if SSRIs or SNRIs do not work for you. Find a Pdoc who knows how to prescribe an MAOI since they are not time released you need to take the correct dose at correct intervals during the day.	M	42	3  months10mg 4X D	2/25/2010
5	Depression (treatment-resistant)	Restlessness (improved w/ Vitamin B6 and Ambien), acne and dry skin/hair (improved w/ B6 and regular skin regimen), enhanced libido, weight gain.	Best medication I've ever t*ken. Currently combined with dextroamphetamine, which has not caused any hypertensive crises at all. Doctors are far too ignorant and afraid of MAOIs.

Reserve Nardil for second choice. Hypertensive and serotonin syndrome way over rated but can happen.	Ask me what you want.  I've had severe treatment resistant depression (along with anxiety, lots of somatic symptoms) since 15y/o and currently am 42y/o.  I had about 80 ECT's at 18y/o and 19y/o without success and have tried over 50 psychotherapeutic drugs without success.  I still can have my "not the best days", however, Parnate give me life. and all other MAOIA (not the new "RIMA")Deep Brain Stimulation, I believe, will be the cure all.	M	42	1  years	11/19/2009
5	depression, bipolar II	Nausea and other digestive issues at first, but they went away after a few weeks. Lost weight, and have increased energy and desire to do anything (even exercise).	The reviews from many others at this website are true, and I believe this drug will work long term. Fall has been an especially tough time for me in the past, and so far this year no problems. I had to talk my pych. into using this drug (she was scared), but  11 years on SSRI's,Tricyclics,etc did little to help me.	M	45	4  months	11/14/2009Email
4	None of the SSRI's have worked	I'm having muscle weakness, pain and joint pain, especially at night when I try to go to sleep.  Also need a pill to help me sleep. Has anyone else had this muscle and joint problem?	I do feel better after trying the SSRI's for 25 years!	F	61	4  months	9/22/2009Email
5	Atypical Depression and Anxiety	Sometimes a bloated feeling, especially with dairy products; insomnia (trouble both falling asleep and staying asleep) with "crashes" maybe every 6 weeks or so, where I sleep for 12-16 hours a night for 2 or 3 days.	Parnate really saved my life. I'm able to hold down a job and interact with people and life in a marginally normal way. I still have some anxiety, and there are spells when it doesn't seem to work. I notice that some people on this site have had success with Klonopin for sleep and anxiety issues, so maybe I will talk to my doctor about that. I wish I'd discovered this ten years earlier.

2	Major Depression (16yrs)	Irritability, anger, aggressiveness, euphoria that felt like it bordered on manic, reduced appetite (forgetting to eat sometimes), vertigo, mild nausea, reduced sleep (5 1/2 hours), 'strangeness' in personal interractions - missing cues, making unconnected responses. Chest pain during exercise initially.  Increased bowel activity in the morning (usally two evacuations within an hour), excessive urination in the mornings, after two cups of tea. Improved ejaculation (over tricyclics). Sour stomach.	My old tricyclic cocktail (Dothep & Tofranil) was causing arrhythmias so Dr. wanted me to change. I thought Tetracyclic, but Psychiatrist suggested MAOI, but let me choose which one (strangely). I chose parnate for less toxic nature of side effects over Nardil.  Psychiatrist usually suggests Nardil for being less stimulating.  No great food interractions.  Have eaten chees and avovcado with no ill effects.  Good quality chocolate now puts me to sleep, and milk, up until recently, has helped extend my sleep up to 8 hrs.  Coffee makes me manic/euphoric so now drink tea. However depression has broken through.  Taking even 1/8th of a pill above 10mg increases the irritability, anger and aggressiveness to an intolerable level. I will be coming off these as soon as my my daughter's 21st birthday later this month is over.  Only Tetracyclics and moclobemide left of antidepressants I haven't tried.  If they don't work then it may be back to the tricyclics and onto heart drugs.  Oh joy oh bliss.	M	52	9  weeks	5/12/2009Email
1	Depression	Sex headaches, inability to exercise, hair loss, nervousness, flat affect, RAVENOUS INSATIABLE HUNGER, weight gain, memory loss, cognition decline, headaches, inability to focus.	I took three of two pills and had potent side effects for the next 3-4 months.	F	23	2  days	4/30/2009
4	major depression	Initally none really to speak of - biggest difference: no more headaches.  Now, having swelling and weight gain.  Could tell a huge difference between brand v generic.	Am on 5 tablets, 3 at breakfast 2 at lunch...worked up to this dose.  Have bouts of extreme tiredness and can't keep my eyes open.  Sleeping ok when I can get to sleep, can get up easier in morning even after only a couple of hours.  Most trouble some is NO WEIGHT LOSS - WEIGHT GAIN and swelling now of hands, feet and face.  I feel like that little girl who ate the blueberries in Willy Wonka!  After being on MAOI's forever this was supposed to be a miracle drug.  Emotionally, I give it a 9, physically a negative 10.

5	chronic depression	dry mouth, feeling cold (went away)  water retention (minor)manic behaviour on higher doses, can't drink coffee or alcohol without getting headaches or nausea	I started with 3x 10mg tabs per day.  Worked like a charm, but had an immediate loss of appetite, vertigo, and manic behaviour.A year later tapered off to 2 per day.  Five years later levelled off to 1x10mg. per day, and that's where I am right now.On rare occasions I feel the need for an extra dose, but this happens maybe once or twice a year.  I had tried mannerix about 15 years ago since a new doctor thought parnate had too many interactions.  That lasted about 3 weeks and it was very difficult for me because it did nothing for me.  I was relieved to get back on the parnate.  I was also relieved when I found this website and read other people's reports.  I thought I was one of very few left taking the drug.  I'm always worried they will take it off the market.  Now I see there are many other users.  For me it is a wonder drug.	F	58	33  years	3/23/2009
5	severe depression and anxiety	Some gastrointestinal to begin with but after that only good side effects such as unimagined energy and interest in life - but no sleep. Also lost weight as I lost my appetite - a real bonus. I always put on weight on anti depressants.	I have had an awful endogenous depression for about 6 years. Have tried everything. I have been on tricyclics most of the time as SSRIs just don't work for me. I just decided after 4 years of tricyclics with no real improvement wasn't good enough and looked around for something else. I was a bit nervous about the alleged side effects of the MAOIs and dire warnings about diet but in the end found that I just needed to avoid red wine and vast amounts of dark chocolate (milk is fine).It was like a miracle cure! I was able to get out of bed, work 12 hour days, be interested in life, rarely had obsessive dark thoughts. The only down side was that I only slept one or 2 hours a night and that was with pills but I was never tired. Parnate was like low level speed. I loved it! After about 4 months I crashed from the lack of sleep and my doctor said to reduce the dose from 30mg to 20mg. 25mg would have been ideal but they don't come in that dose and the pills are coated so cannot be broken in ha	F	52	4  months	3/12/2009

4	Treatment-Resistant Depression	Insomnia above 30 or 40 mg per day.	In my experience, Parnate is much more effective than the more commonly prescribed modern antidepressants, but you must obey the dietary and medication restrictions to avoid serious medical problems. Also check your blood pressure regularly.  Get to the ER quickly with your Parnate pharmacy info sheet if you get a severe headache or other significant symptoms (that your doctor can explain). You should wear a medical alert bracelet or neck pendant (engraved as your doctor says with something like "Taking Parnate"), or carry a yellow or orange medication card while wearing the bracelet or pendant. (You can get these at some pharmacies or online.) Also tell your dentist that you are taking Parnate, since it can cause have serious interactions with certain anesthetics.  This may sound a little scary, but it is worth it if the other meds don't work for you.  If you want to recover from depression, the medication is only a first step.  You must also greatly simplify your life and m	M	45	7  months	2/8/2009

4	Depression & ADHD	First course - None at allSecond course - daytime drowsiness, so much so that i started taking naps for the first time in my life at the age of 23.	Parnate was probably the best antidepressant i have taken. It is strong, but lifted me out of a deep dark place in my life.I took the first course for a few months, and 2 years later took a second course, again for a few months.The second time i took it, i found it wasn't as good as the first - drowsiness was a new side-effect, which i really don;t like. I've never had problems with the food interactions, not sure why. Ate 3 day old lasagna with blue cheese, not even a headache. I DON'T recommend this to anyone, but if you really miss cheese maybe take a little, and if no headache, work your way up?...

5	Severe depression	None	Parnate has saved my life.  I have tried many medicines for depression but none worked like Parnate does.  Once you understand the food restriction you will do well.  It helped that I didn't drink, and I don't eat pigs feet.  I do miss taking OT for colds.  But compaired to depression I will live thru a cold.  My doctor agrees that Parnate has made the difference between day and night for me in how I view life.	F	65	30  years	12/6/2008Email
4	Depression	Dry mouth, some difficulty sleeping.	This isn't the miracle drug for me that it was for others, but it was able to give me a little lift where SSRIs weren't.  It's tough not being able to eat cheese, but overall it's worth it.  (Can still eat mozzarella and American cheese.) I take 0.5 mg ambien for sleeping but can only take 5x/week to prevent dependence so the weekends can be a little tough for sleeping.	F	53	2  years	11/19/2008

I take 3 tablets a day (10 mgs.) a day. To help with the insomnia, I first tried ambien, which didn't work for me for some reason. My doctor put me on Klonopin 1 or 2 as needed to help with anxiety and sleeplesness (But only at bed time!). I feel that the combination of these two medications is life saver! Also, I've lost 15 lbs. since starting the pills:) I actually want to get out of bed and do things now!:) Highly recommended!!	F	31	3  weeks	9/24/2008

My doctor would like to switch from Ambien to Klonepinand was addicted to that drug three years ago. He says different anti-depressantswork with  vs against klonepin. Any comments? I have no cravings for sugar or carbsas I did with the newer anti-depressants. The weight simply came off. I find it a strong, but lifesaving drug. concerned about the pulse and ambien.

4	atypical bipolar depression, PTSD	Insomnia, muddy thinking?, "flatness", memory problems?, initial weight gain, frustration w/dietary restrictions, had to correct nutritional deficiencies due to change in diet from mostly vegetarian.	After 17 years on mostly lithium and Zoloft with no hospitalizations, I suffered some personal losses and consequent severe depression in 2004. For 2 years I tried other meds and had bad doctors, wound up on Parnate for "atypical" reasons. Insomnia was helped by a dx of sleep apnea, and had lots of therapy. I hate the food restrictions but don't know whether it's worth getting off Parnate and going back to an SSRI/SNRI with all the risks involved and possibly losing some of what I've worked so hard to recover. I welcome comments.	F	42	1.5  years	8/31/2008Email
5	depression	low blood pressure and sleepiness(these happen sometimes after my final dose wears off- it happens to a lesser degree now that I've been on parnate for a year)	Great antidepressant! IMO should be prescribed much more often.I feel much happier w/this than every ssri I took.  It also lessons social anxiety for me.  It doesn't (for me) have the awful sexual side effects that ssris had. It hasn't caused any weight gain.	F	40	1  years	8/30/2008
3	clinical depression	horrible taste in mouth all the time	Started Tranylcypromine (UK name)30mg/daily  2 months ago, still waiting for it to kick in. I agree with the comments about being 'dull'. A friend said I looked sadder than usual. I suppose he meant the same thing. Being very cautious about food, lost loads of weight as a result! Being your own cook/baker does help, you know everything in your shopping basket. Wouldn't describe it in the ecstatic terms some reveiews have used, unless of course, when it does kick in...

5	Depression	Insomnia	Lifesaving drug.  Nothing else (tricyclics, SSRIs) has anything like it efficacy.  Although it is viewed as 'old fashioned' I think it should be used more.  The side effects, though real, are exaggerated and harmless.This is one of those drugs that actually works.	M	50	25  years	7/23/2008Email
5	Severe Atypical depression	If I take Parnate after 4pm, I get a strange and agitated sleep.  This is helped by taking 1/4 a clonazepam (or of course by not forgetting to take the tablet!).  Also, sometimes I get anxiety if I take the tablets (im on 40mg) too close together, or without food.  But all of these pale in comparison to the depression I had!!  Dry mouth sometimes.	This drug quite literally saved my life.  I had been on 13 different antidepressants, in various combinations, for three years.  None of them worked, hence my diagnosis of severe atypical treatment resistant depression (whew, what a title!).  The "atypical" bit came about because i put on weight (lots of it) rather than lost it, my depression was MUCH worse at night rather than during the day, and I wasnt particularly melancholic.  As a last resort I researched drugs myself and read about parnate.  THe Dr initially refused to put me on it, but relented after significant pressure from me.  Within one week most of my "depression" had gone (though the aftereffects of living with depression for 3 years without remission took a lot longer to overcome), and I was back to normal.  I was initially on 20mgs (the max dose in new zealand where i live), and it stopped working after about 3 months.  THe dr put me up to 40, and i was fine for 3 years.  Then dr asked me to go down	F	30	5  years	6/9/2008
5	Treatment resistant depression	This drug has had the longest efficacy (2+ years) of anything I've taken.  The dietary restrictions are really not so bad--so long as you eat most of your meals at home.  Restaurants tend to put cheese in everything!  I've had some problems with insomnia and urinary retention, but the relief from depression is worth almost any side-effect.	A couple of points:(1) One very interesting strategy that my doctor has suggested, which has worked four times when Parnate started to "poop out".  At his suggestion, I have tapered off very rapidly (3-4 days) gone without the drug for a week, and quickly tapered up to the old dose (60 mg/day.  I have never heard of this idea before, but it has worked extremely well for me.  (Noting that everyone is different, and one should do this only under MD direction.)(2) At age 63, I wonder if I should be increasing the dose.  I've read that dopamine falls off rapidly with age, and I think that in my case the dopamine increase may be a major feature of the drug. I will consult my MD on this.	M	63	2  years	5/23/2008

I'll admit it improved my mood somewhat, but I was waking as early as 3am and feeling very restless (at first the medication made me drowsy but the longer I was on it the earlier I would wake up).

While my mood is better and my anger issues are nearly non-existent now, I'm finding I'm still a bit hypomanic and the Abilify creates extreme restlessness in me.  While my house has never looked better and I'm getting lots of project done, I find I can't sit still for longer than 10 minutes and by the end of the day my feet ache for being on them so long running around in the house and doing all my projects.	Together with Depakote.  Doc now prescribing propranolol for agitation/restlessness/irritability - would rather prescribe additional med for side effect than change primary meds...and I agree with his decision.

After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital.

Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness.

We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds.

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email
1	depression/anxiety	severe muscle weakness, tremors that have yet to stop 2 months in, not sleeping, pacing		M	44	5  days5mg 1X D	9/19/2011
1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
