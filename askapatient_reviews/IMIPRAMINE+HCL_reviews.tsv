3	Panic disorder, depression	Unusual tiredness, dry mouth, feelings of fainting, floaters, can't get up fast, really muddled thinking, weight gain, crave sweets, had to be put on strong laxative because of constipation		F	17	1  years50mg	10/13/2012
4	panic attacks/anxiety	Dry mouth, trouble urinating, twitching of muscles (especially at night).		F	47	2  months50 mg	7/7/2012
1	urinary incontinence	doctor prescribed 50 mg per day, with no gradual introduction of drug; noticed immediately increased agitation; anxiety; dry mouth; bitter taste in mouth; impulsive behavior; suicidal thoughts; memory loss; ended up in emergency room for suicidal rant, worsened by drinking alcohol		F	67	3.5  weeks25 mg 2X D	3/18/2012Email
4	Depression	Dry nose and sinus, drowsiness, sleeping in, difficulty getting out of bed.	Helped my depression tremendously. Makes me feel calm and relaxed, and not prone to lose my temper or become frustrated. Stops self-punishing thoughts and repetitive, anxious rumination. The only side-effect which really makes it hard to take is the dry sinus: my nose and sinuses become very sore, dry and itchy, and it drives me mad! May be because I also drink a bit of coffee etc., but I never noticed this problem before I started this drug. In spite of this, it's still the best AD I've ever tried.	M	38	4  years50 mg 1X D	3/17/2012
2	Pain relief, hip and back	Dry mouth, trouble sleeping, restlessness, one episode of diarrhea, headache.It did relieve about 80% of the pain which was great, but not hypersensitive skin. I'm going back to my dr to seek an alternative as I doubt I could work full time with these aside effects and believe the risks associated with this drug are too great.		F	32	1  days10	3/5/2012Email
5	Major Depression and ADD	Dry mouth, Strange taste on mouth, more willingness to smoking, episodic memory fog and muscle weakness.	Great drug. It helped me with the depression and the excessive sleeping. My concentration is a little better, but I still need to take ritalin together to treat ADD.The muscle weakness, fogged episodic memory and loss of libido helps me to relax.

1	Panic disorder	I started Imipramine about 6 weeks ago ans began with 25 mg a day for 7 days then upped it to 50 mg for the rest of the duration per doc's orders. After 4 weeks I was getting excited and not the good kind then 5 weeks I had more panic attacks back to back then I ever had before in my life. Then week 6 I wanted to die, I called my Doc and told them I couldnt leave the house I was so bad I couldnt sleep and I had around a dozen panic attacks per day. Scared me so bad that I really thought I was going to be hospitalized. Luckily I began to taper off 4 days before my emergency visit with the Doc and today Im back in Zoloft, this time I will deal with the sexual side effects b/c being in panic mode 24/7 is not cool and makes you wish you were dead. Now since Ive been weeing off of Imipramine I have had these terrible headaches but eveyone is different and the reason I was prescribed Imipramine is b/c I "failed" about 7 other anti-depressants. But this one is by far the worst I have ever and I mean ever had to deal with. Now with the help of 5mg of Xanax and my zoloft on the rise and EFT techniques and CBT therapy and Faith in God I am just starting to see the light, also I quit drinking and using tobacco 3 years ago all on my own and that was like taking a piss compared to the Imipramine reaction I experienced. But Im not a D-bag and I know everyone reacts differently to each Anti-depressant so that is just my story with this med. Im an OIF Veteran and struggling everyda		M	27	6  weeks50mg	1/7/2012Email
2	Urinary Incontinence,Stomach issues	Heavy sweating w/bursts of heat so bad people next to me feel it explode into a heat wave, can't sleep, fast heartbeat, sugar cravings, constant headache	Has helped with my restless legs, but not given to me for that.  Sweating is insane, can only sleep at a very shallow level if at all.  I am exhausted and fatigued all day and not functioning.  Had to temporarily stop P/T because I am just so tired.  Trying to get hold of doc.	F	48	30  days 1X D	1/6/2012Email

1	Trouble swallowing food	Can no longer ejoculate	I took it for swallowing difficulty.  I still cannot swallow food or beverages, but now I cannot ejoculate.  I am getting off of this drug now,	M	49	30  days25mg 1X D	10/23/2011
1	Depression	Racing heart, suicidal thoughts, rage, nervous feeling, hyperarousal, adrenaline surges	This antidepressant made me SO MUCH MORE DEPRESSED.  I guess because I have paradoxical reactions to all psych meds. I had psychotic symptoms as well as manic symptoms.  It made me suicidal, very rageful too.  I also felt hyperaroused (and was misdiagnosed as having PTSD), extremely anxious, could not sleep well while on it, had adrenaline surges which made me angry for no reason. Withdrawal has been very painful too both physically and psychologically, but I am having windows where I feel like myself again and it gives me hope.	F	34	3  months75 mg 1X D	9/26/2011
5	SEVERE LEG PAIN FROM NERVE IN BACK	THIS MEDICINE STOPS THE PAIN CYCLE OF LEG NERVE PAIN & EVENTUALLY EASES SHARP PAIN DURING THE DAY. IT ACTUALLY SAVED MY LIFE BECAUSE THE PAIN WAS SO SEVERE.  A DOCTOR IN LAS VEGAS PUT ME ON IMPARMINE I HAVE A LITTLE PAIN BUT NOT SERIOUS LIKE BEFORE I CAN FUNCTION ALL DAY WITH OUT MUCH TROUBLE THE MEDICINE LELAXES THE LEGS & STOPS THE PAIN NIGHTLY	I WOULD RECOMEND ANYONE SUFFERING FROM SEVERE NERVE PAIN IN THE LEGS DUE TO A BACK INJURY BE PUT ON THIS MEDICINE IT IS VERY VAULABLE TO STOP THE PAIN CYCLE & FUNCTION THE NEXT DAY	F	69	10  years50 1X D	6/4/2011Email
1	Narcolepsy	Nightmares and Night Terrors	I started taking this drug to augment other medications I take for Narcolepsy - my daytime wakefulness is well controlled but I need a sleep aid.  I have never had nightmares; I've had bad dreams but I would never have categorized them as nightmares.  In the six weeks I've been taking Imipramine I've woken up almost nightly from the most vivid and tragic dreams drenched in sweat, out of breath, thrashing, and sobbing.  This morning I woke at 1am from a horrible dream to find that I was beating myself in the face and head with my fists.  The prescribing sleep medicine specialist dismissed my concerns and I will be seeing another doctor today - bruised face and all.  Side effects be damned - I will NEVER take another, single Imipramine pill ever again!	F	37	6  weeks100mg 1X D	2/3/2011Email
5	Major Depression/Anxiety	dry mouth, low-to-no libido, insane sweet tooth, excessive sweating in summer,	Had terrible anxiety/panic attacks and depression for 8 months after my daughter was born. A GP had prescribed Elavil and Xanax, but that put me into a drug induced fog. I stopped the Elavil but continued the Xanax.  Another GP told me to stop the Xanax, so I tried to do so but was unable to.  I then got brave enough to see a psychiatrist who put me on Imipramine (25mg/day) and weened me off the Xanax.  He gradually increased the dosage. It took about 10 weeks, but all of a sudden the black cloud lifted.  Since then, i've been at a 250mg maintenance dose.  About 13 years ago, my doctor tried switching me to Prozac. I gradually stopped he Imipramine while taking 20mg/day of Prozac.  Once the Imipramine was stopped altogether, I felt like I couldn't sleep and had awful dreams that I would think about all day until I had new ones the following night.  I spiraled back down very quickly. My doctor stopped the Prozac and put me back on Imipramine and ramped me up to 300mg/day.  it took me about 10 months to get back to "normal". Imipramine is a miracle for me and well worth the side effects.	M	54	27  years250mg 1X D	1/20/2011

4	mild anxiety, depression	Excessive sweating, weight gain	My only complaints are weight gain and absurd amount of sweating.  I sweat buckets at the least feeling of heat or when I'm under pressure.  Tried many times to reduce dose and quit but anxiety always comes back.  This drug works really well for my anxiety, I just HATE the sweating.	M	47	3  years25 mg 1X D	10/21/2010
4	panic attacks and agoraphobia	initially dry mouth, hard stools, some tremors in one arm.  chew gum or suck on a candy with dry mouth, and stool softener works well when needed.  just live with the tremor.	my father took imipramine before me for 30+ years, and i have taken it for 33 years.  my dad went off it due to his skin getting very dark after years of use.  his skin lightened after going off the medication and switching to zoloft.  i have used the meds for panic disorder and agoraphobia.  i have consulted with psychiatrists over the years to determine if there is a better med.  all the docs have said stick with what works, and i am doing so.

4	Insomnia	Hair loss but I had some before I started these meds and 1 week of worse depression but I held on knowing it would get better.	I take 100 trazodone, 50 mg Imipramine, .50 xanax and 8 mg Rozerem every night. I wake up usually 2 to 3 times a night but usually get 5 hours straight sleep. Also I read in my oxygen magazine 1000 mg of calcium and 500 of magnesium would help too. It does seem to help.	F	37	2  years50 mg 1X D	7/5/2010Email
1	i had the jitters real bad	dry mouth,slow pee, when i had sex and climaxed man did it hurt in a weird place under my testis . Gave me the jitters and bad bad anxiety.	imipramine did not work for me ..Good luck	M	35	2  months150mg 1X D	4/20/2010
5	Migraines	None	Helps control vascular headaches. Reduced occurrences of headaches from one per week to less than three per year. I periodically try to reduce dosage to 50 mg per day, but eventually the headaches begin to return. 75 mg per day dosage controls the headaches without additional medication.	M	66	24  years25 mg 3X D	4/13/2010
1	depression, urinary frequency	Seemed to make me jittery, which is odd for an antidepresant	People react differently to all ADs. My doc hoped this would help me sleep, relieve depression and anxiety, lessen my trips to the bathroom, but "None of the above." I gather it does work for many people. If you want a TCA (tricyclic anti-depressant) be aware that Wal-Mart, Target, etc have several for $4 per month, while imipramine costs a lot more.	M	52	1  months20mg 1X D	3/3/2010
5	Major Depression/Anxiety	Dry Mouth, Weight gain, Head rush when standing up quickly, Constipation.	This drug has helped me to have quality of life. I first took it when I was 23 for Major depression and Anxiety. The weight gain and Dry mouth are the worst side effects, however I tried taking Zoloft and Prozac. Zoloft helped but not like this drug, and while taking Zoloft I experienced sexual dysfunction. Prozac gave me the worst headaches. I was able to be drug free for about six years and then had a relapse, so I started taking it again. Hope this helps someone who's looking for some direction. God Bless	M	49	22  years	12/26/2009
1	mild depression and restless leg s	dry  mouth, dizzyness,  can hardly urinate, bad taste in mouth, destroys sex life, severe loss of memory lasting about 2 hours resulting in trip to emergency room W/EKG, BRAIN SCAN, BLOOD WORK<  all checked out normal.ER Doctor said this is a dangerous drug. Constipation.  I also had bad head shocks a couple times a week, usually in the evening.  I stoped this medication after taking it for about three months at 50 mg each night.  I tappered off by dropping to 25mg for about a week and then to 12mg for a coupled af days stopping about a week ago. I feel much better. Some side effects are still with me but think in a week or so they should be gone.  On the plus side it cured, while taking it, my restless leg syndrome and dryed up a post nasel drip that i've had for a long time and all signs of my mild depression.  But the side effects we're not worth it. IF nessessery I'll try something else.		M	73	90  days	7/11/2009
2	Anxiety/OCD/Depression	Dry mouth, insomnia, forgetfullness, frustration, anxiety, and constipation	Worked OK on a low dose (25mg) initialy for sleeping and depression. But anxiety was always present and as my dosage increased to 100mg  so did the other side effects until taking the drug became unbearable. I amost "lost my mind" and forgot how to speak my language and associate with others.	M	36	4  months	6/7/2009
5	eurinesis initially; mood disorder	dry mouth	My son has been taking this for 9 years since age 7.  Initially he took it for bed-wetting but when I tried to wean him off, his previous "melt-downs" returned.  I had thought this was a stage he was outgrowing.  He had intensive implosive melt-downs prior to going on this drug.  I realized that it was the same drug that cured my father from debilitating long-term depression and put two and two together.  At age 11, my son stopped taking it cold-turkey without my knowledge.  He suffered two days of nighttime hallucinations--very scary stuff.  After that, he toyed with going off it again in middle school but decided that the anxiety he felt without it was worse than taking the drug.  He only has dry mouth as a side effect.  He has a really high iq and tests in the 99th percentile so I guess it didn't hurt his brain development.  He does have a small stature and is skinny.  I don't know if the medicine stunted his growth in any way.  I would be interested in any comments from other long-term youth users of this drug to see if they had normal growth.  He is 5 ft 8 inches which is a lot smaller than my husband and my brothers.	M	16	9  years	5/31/2009

4	Depression and bladder problems	Dry mouth , constipation , sweet-tooth , dizzyness , blurry vision.	I wish I never had to depend on pills to funtion in life in general. I started out taking about 50mgs of imipramine and now i'm taking 150mgs of it a day. I also take Seroquel and i'm now taking 450mgs of that a fay. ( that was something i failed to mention in my Seroquel rating ) Anyway , the main reson the psychiatrist put me on imipramine because i was experiencing urinary incontinence when i was asleep. My bladder is much better now and i only wet the bed when i'm constipated. I don't feel as depressed as i used to feel and i can't recall when i  started taking imipramine.	M	34	 	3/28/2009Email
2	Depression	Severe constipation, Increased heartrate, sleepiness, weight gain, dry mouth, "foggy" head.	I began taking 25mg a night for depression and within a couple weeks increased the dosage to 75mg.  It put me right to sleep each evening, but I felt tired and foggy headed all day the following day.  My resting heart rate increased to 100bpm for the first month and has almost gone back to normal after a couple months of being on Imipramine.  It has been effective in treating the depression, however the side effects are too terrible to remain on the drug.  The most severe side effect I've experienced is constipation.  I have not been able to go to the bathroom for over two weeks, even with the use of laxatives, enimas, and stool softeners.  I have begun to wean off this medication and hope the problem is resolved shortly.  I will be going back on Paxil which has been most effective in treating my anxiety and depression.	F	27	3  months	2/12/2009
5	Panic Attacks/Agoraphobia	Dry Mouth, Constipation, hand tremors, weight gain, sleepiness, irregular heartbeat.   Side effects stayed with me the entire time I was on drug.	After suffering with totally dibilitating and constant panic attacks and agoraphobia for several years, imipramine incredibly helped to a point I could get out of the house and work again.   But, after 5 years I had a life threatening cardiac reaction and was immediately taken off of it, leaving me totally dibilitated again.  Nothing since has helped like  this drug did.  Too  bad it had the side effects it had.	F	32	5  years	1/28/2009
2	Relieve pain of nerve damage	Insomnia, severe headache, abdominal pain, dry mouth.	Commenced Imipramine 10mg for relief of pain for nerve damage caused by a parasite in the abdominal area.  Tried it for two nights and had although I felt drowsy I just could not get to sleep.  Had a severe headache and stomach pain, dry mouth with strong metallic taste.  After speaking with the Doctor he suggested lowering the dose to 5mg.  I know I do not have a great tolerance for some medications so I think it is just a totally individual thing with your reaction to medications.	F	38	2  days	12/11/2008
5	Panic Disorder	Dry mouth	I was having severe panic attacks and this medication saved my life.  It worked very well for me.  I took it for about 3 years after my divorce. Since then I only need it when in a very stressful situation.	F	61	25  years	12/9/2008
2	Depression and anxiety	dry mouth, minor pain during urination or ejaculation, constipation	My doctor has me on a nightly dose of 25mg of Imipramine to treat me for mild depression and anxiety. Does this amount seem too low? It's been 2 weeks now, so maybe it's too early to determine any real mood improvement other than a few side effects. Also, he put me on 4mg of Pherphenazine, 5 mg of Diazapam, and 10 mg of Proponolol. Should I wait longer before asking for a higher dosage or does it take more time for Imipramine to 'kick in'?	M	35	2  weeks	12/7/2008Email
5	depression and anxiety	dry mouth, slow urination in the morning	Nine years ago I was prescribed zoloft first then celexa. Both had side effects that I couldn't tolerate.  A friend told me about Tofranil and that it helped her more than anything.  I asked my doctor and he told me it is one of the older tricylic meds but was usually effective.   I took 50 mgs. of imipramine hcl (generic Tofranil) daily for about 8 years and tried to go off.  After a couple of months, I began to have extreme anxiety.  I'm back on imipramine 75 mgs a day and plan to continue as long as necessary-maybe for life.  Dry mouth is a small price to pay for feeling normal. I believe doctors try the more expensive meds first because imipramine hcl is very inexpensive.	F	54	9  years	12/5/2008
5	Depression	Dry mouth, hesitancy with urination, some constipation, decreased memory, often searching for the name or word I want, very new, STRONG craving for sweets (never cared for sweets prior to this) with 10 lb weight gain and increased difficulty achieving orgasm.	With all those side effects you'd think I would have stopped the drug by now, but this medicine saved my life. Been on/off various medications since age 16 yo.   Been on SSRIs, Effexor, Wellbutrin, then 5 years ago finally tried on Imipramine and it is like a miracle.  No longer depressed.  Now able to have normal highs and lows like everybody else. No relapse yet.  Would be very nervous trying to lower dose or doing a trial off the med.	M	34	5  years	11/7/2008
4	Overactive bladder	Dry mouth, insomnia.	I took 10mg at bedtime for about 2 weeks I think...However, it did not make me drowsy, but it seemed to keep me awake.  The frequent bathroom trips at night did decrease though.	F	46	2  weeks	6/5/2008
5	Migraines	dry mouth, funny taste in my mouth	I have been taking this medication every day for 18 years.  I was experiencing extreme visual problems such as temporary blindness, double vision, etc... and had been through tons of doctors, procedures, tests... Tofranil was prescribed to me for what they suspected was migraines in the occipital lobe of my brain, although I never experienced headaches.  I got better immediately and have been maintained on 75mg a day since.  I was young, in graduate school and thought I was loosing my mind.  This medicine saved my life. One strange thing I noticed right away. I get a very funny taste in my mouth if I am late taking a dose or miss a dose.  Now I take the PM brand so it does not happen near as much.	F	43	18  years	3/19/2008
5	Depression, anxiety, eating disorde	dry mouth, constipation, fast heart beat, developed some speech problems which got better when lowered dosage to 125mg, no sex drive,	I found imipramine to be one of the many tried anti-depressants that worked.  I was once on 300mg a day through some bad times but have been on 150mg since 2003 and now for the last month am on 125mg. Found i developed speech problems and would say the wrong words and clutter my speech.  This has improved now i am on 125mg.  Having headaches tho and some down moments but determined to not increase dose again. Trying to get past the withdrawral symptons.	F	28	6  days	2/19/2008
2	depression, insomnia	unusually high levels of energy, dizziness, brain fog	My main problem was that it made me extremely carsick whenever I went anywhere. Also had problems remembering simple, daily things. While it made me hyperactive and extremely cheerful, it didn't appear to help my sleeping.	F	23	3  months	2/2/2008
5	agoraphobia and social anxiety	dry mouth(for first few months, went away afterwards), constipation, brain fog, derealization, leg tremors and increased sweating	I couldn't get out of my house at times, and i couldn't travel father then 15 miles without having a panic attack. So I couldn't go on trips or very far away from my house. But since ive taken this its all completely cured for me. If you have these problems, then this could help you.	M	17	8  months	1/3/2008Email
4	Post Partum Depression; Anxiety	Dry Mouth; Insomnia; Craving for sweets	I started out on 25mg, then 1 month later the dr increased it to 50mg, then 1 month later 100mg, and just recentlty, I was increased to 150mg. I take it at night. Thanks to this web page, I learned something from you all...I didn'y know why I was craving sweets like, cake, cookies, candy, etc. I didn't know that. I am doing well on it, but I still feel anxiety still and have insomnia. Thank you all for your input!!	F	30	4  months	12/6/2007
1	depression	dangerous lowering of blood pressure, fainting	I took it about a week and noticed dizziness, but no big deal. Then, for 3 days straight, I fainted every time I stood up or sat up.	F	16	10  days	12/2/2007
5	insomnia	morning grogginess	My daughter took this from second grade to fifth grade.  It saved her life.  She had developed a major fear of sleep and by the time I could finally get a doctor to believe me, the problem had become so acute she had developed night terrors and just this horrible, horrible sleeplessness.  Anyone who tells you that if a child is tired enough they will just go to sleep has never had a child who is an insomniac.  There may have been some side effects from this medicine but honestly she was so exhausted after months of next to no sleep--certainly no stage 3 or 4 sleep--that any side effects were nothing compared to the benefits.  She was suicidal before, not from depression but from exhaustion.  Doctors do not recognize the seriousness of sleeplessness, and certainly not in children.  Patting a kid's hand and leaving the room does not work.  Someone wanted to know how to get off this drug.  I cut her tablets in half then in fourths then in eigths...not kidding, bit by bit and it worked fin	F	8	4  years	8/8/2007
5	Occipital neuralgia	Weight gain, approx 20 pounds in 6 months. At first this medication  made it difficult to sleep, but I adjusted within a week of taking it. Now it doesn't help or hinder my sleep. The weight gain is very frustrating. I have to spend 2 hours a day at the gym to keep from gaining more.	I take a small dose (25mg) for a nerve disorder (which is exacerbated by stress). I can see that this would be an effective drug for combating stress, since it greatly helps my nerve disorder, which had been debilitating. The weight gain has been so annoying that I'd like to ween myself off this medication, but I don't know if I'll be able to. A side note: I have ADD, and this does NOTHING to help it. I can't take other medication (like ritalin) for the ADD because it would interact with the imipramine, and my concentration level is at an all-time low.	F	28	7  months	5/23/2007
1	depression	depression	Generic did not work. Switched back to Tofranil. Reported to FDA, nothing done.	M	35	3  months	5/21/2007
3	depression	laziness. Increased foot pain?	I wrote the comments on 11-13-06. I found out I couldn't take 1 imipramine at work or it would make me hazy. I went to the Psychiatrist & told him I was having severe mood swings & he suggested Lexapro at 10mg or up to 40 mg of imipramine. I was taking lexapro every other day and the psychologist said it wouldn't work that way plus I started taking 40 mg.of imipramine. When I saw the psychiatrist again he suggested getting off the lexapro because of the possibility of weight gain and it "stops working after a while" and increasing the imipramine to 50 mg. He also contradicted the psychologist saying the lexapro would work that way because it stays in your system. I got laid off because work was slow and all I've done for a few days is go on the computer and lay on the couch, but I don't have the severe mood swings. The trouble with taking 2 different meds is you don't know what is doing what, and it's always a "hit or miss" proposition, either the stuff work	M	56	7  months	5/20/2007
5	insomnia	A Dry mouth makes me thirsty often, but that also helps me remember to drink more water.	If  take none, I sleep from 11pm until 3-4am.  I can take 50mg and wake up about 5am or take 75mg to wake up 6:30am or take 100 MG and sleep in until 7 or 8am.	M	57	17  years	5/16/2007
4	depression	waking up to reality, and I haven't slept for four days	I've been on it a month. My doctor told me to take up to 150mg a day so I took 150mg a day...as an american I know more is better.  Everything started off great...got lots of work done, started going to the gym three hours a day, lost 20lbs.  I've found though that 150mg is way too much to start off on as now I have a toxic level.  I eat practically nothing and I have not slept for four days.  I should have tried it on the dog first	M	29	1  months	4/14/2007
5	Panic Disorder	drowsiness, dry mouth and fast heart rate	This drug restored the quality of my life. I take 50mg at night.I was always a confident independent high achiever-I developed panic disorder literally over night. I was completely disabled by it. Forget the mind over matter stuff, i tried all the therapy going -this disease is a biological imbalance hence the instant "cure" thanks to imipramine. Within days of starting it, I was back to normal.The side effects sre nothing compared to constant debilitating panic attacks. I tried Prozac for 2 days and it made my panic disorder 100 times worse-nightmare. Imipramine saved me from a living hell.	F	41	10  years	3/14/2007Email
2	Abdominal Wall Pain	Frequent urination, painful clittoral enlargement, fellings of hopelessness, dry mouth, difficulty sleeping, difficulty breathing.	The initial symptoms are just as bad as the side effects. Whenever you get a doctor that immediately diagnoses and assigns you with a mediation, watch out. I've had abdominal wall pain for almost a year, and I've seen a number of doctors who all believed that I had something different, and each time I was assigned a different medication. They all thought I was misdiagnosed by the previous doctor, yet none of them tested me for anything. "Take this and let's wait and see." People are not lab experiments. Most doctors should realize that they are playing with people's lives, and after so long it gets to be pretty irritating to keep trying new medications that in many ways make the situation worse.	F	18	5  days	1/27/2007
5	Tramatic brain injury- stroke	My doctor is older and he perscibed this for the very reasons everyone is chating about. helps controll bladder.I needed the weight gain(seems to have recently slowed?)Treatment for depression and for sleeping.	I pray the weight gain slows...I was 30-50 lbs under weight.I have gained the perfect amount(about 40-45)The funny thing is I dont see it anywhere but on the # on the scale?

2	IBS	I do not understand why my GI doc has put me on such medication.  I took it last night, and did not sleep at all, and he said it would remove the pain and bloating.  I am concern the side affects and the way I am feeling today--muscle tight and like I am rushed.  Why would this doc I saw for 20 min put me on such a controveral mediation.	I really hope I do not have to take this for long.  I am going to take to my general doctor.	F	41	1  days	1/3/2007
5	PTSD, Panic & Anxiety, Depression	Dry mouth, irregular heart beat, feel sedated but can easily wake up from it.  I take dosage at night.	I've been on imipramine since 1985 (nearly 22 years).  A few times I have tried to wean myself (self-imposed) off this medication only for it to back fire in severe anxiety attacks with physical pain.  While taking imipramine, I feel like myself and normal.  I would much rather take imipramine than an of the newer, less studied drugs.  I've been able to function normally.  I held a day job for over 20 years with no attendance problems and performing that job in terms "greatly exceeding standards".  I'm also on 15 mg of clorazepate (anti-axiety).  I've been on 75 mg of imipramine for many years but now feel that the tearfulness, chemical taste, and pin and needles feel on my arms indicate that the depression is still present or may have increased.  I'm looking at increasing the dosage to about 125mg (under doctors care).  I have never abused this drug.  I have no suicidal thoughts and have been treated by my primary care physician. I also see a psychologist on a regular basis	F	47	22  years	1/1/2007
4	depression	waking up after a few hours.	I was on 25mg of elavil (amitryptaline) and I was having recurring negative mood swings. The psychiatrist gave me 10mg imipramine, the smallest dose available, and said I could take up to 3 a day. At first I wasn't that happy with it, but now that I'm up to 3 a day it seems pretty good. I work 2nd shift and I find that I'm sleeping less on the imipramine which is good because I can get up earlier and get more done during the day. I like the fact that they are only 10mg because if I'm feeling blue at work I can take one without it effecting my performance. I'm beginning to make a habit of that though, and it may be because I was a substance abuser and the idea of that appeals to someone with an addictive personality. There is some loss of libido which concerns me but I'm not in a relationship so I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.		56	24  days	11/13/2006
4	depression, anxiety	sore throat, weak legs, can't do a proper wee!	This drugs works real nice for depression & panic attacks.If the side-effects aren't too bad for you then you willbe happy!	M	31	2  months	10/30/2006
5	Mild Depression	I'll have five minutes of dry mouth; doesn't matter.	I had been on 25mg a day for a few weeks and had a scary episode with urinary blockage. Then after I took it for a couple of months where I felt happy, I suddenly stopped and was hit with a Major panic attack. I am now taking 10mg and may stop. I Hate taking drugs. I feel like I'm chained to them. But it really works great for me, even in very low doses. I guess I should just live with mild depression and get little enjoyment from anything.

1	Post Prostactomy incontinence	Headaches, stomach cramps, constipation, muscle cramps, insomnia and indigestion.	50mg dose reduced to 25mg some improvement but for what little improvrmrnt in incontinence there was the side effects proved to be more detrimental than its benefits. I've flushed the remainder of my 90 day supply.	M	63	6  days	6/18/2006

4	Major depression	Dry mouth, urinary retention, blurred vision, "foggy" mental state, reduced libido, hunger at the end of the day that requires lots of exercise to counter.	I've tried about 15 other antidepressants to avoid the side effects, but (a) they're all less effective, and (b) their side effects are generally worse.  Every doctor should be required to take a drug for 6 months before being licensed toprescribe it.	M	51	20  years	1/21/2006

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out!

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
