5	GAD/Hypochondiasis	No side effects to describe	This has been a wonder drug for me.  My chest pains and back pain disappear in 15 minutes of taking the medication.  When I run out I experience what I thought was a heart attack, or worse lung cancer.  Now I realize that my anxiety gets out of control very easily and I use clonazepam effectively to control symptoms.	M	34	8  years4mg 2X D	1/14/2013Email
5	Tremors due to anxiety	Drowsiness. This drug really takes away my a tremors. Tried other meds first. Clonazepam is the only medication that works for me. I havent built up a tolerance either. Everyone is different. I take it every night. Its strange because I remeber a lot more than I use to. It helps me focus more. My memory has improved. This medication works wonders with me. And yes I take it as prescribed.		F	38	2  months0.5	10/12/2012Email
5	extreme anxiety, agoraphobia	lethargic early in the day, flat effect in speech, lack of inhibition	I increased the amount to 2 times a day and it reduces agoraphobia and constant angst. I am very happy with it. It helps my therapy progress faster by reducing fear of memories. Sometimes I forget to take it until the anxiety interferes with going out or doing things.	F	63	1  years.5MG 2X D	9/13/2012History
4	Panic and Anxiety	When first taking it and lasts for about 15-20 min - dizziness, out-of-body experience maybe, imbalance, tiredness, spaced out. It doesn't last for long though, it goes away and you begin to just feel calm, maybe a bit drowsy still.	It definitely helps when I'm feeling the onset of major anxiety or a panic attack and I need help calming myself down. It's not a cure, I use it along with therapy and tools to help myself relieve my anxiety and panic. It's just an aid to help me get through what's going on.	F	25	9  months.25 MG 1X AN	9/10/2012Email
5	Generalized Anxiety Disorder	Sleepy, clumsy, slight headaches, euphoria.	I have never had serious anxiety issues until about seven months ago. For whatever reason my anxiety steadily increased to the point where I had this incredible daily fear that I had something physically wrong and I was dying. I never used to go to the doctor for anything (years i didn't go to the doctor) and suddenly I was calling every week to set up an appointment with an ailment I was sure was life threatening. I convinced my doctor to give me a referral to a cardiologist because of personal fears that something was going on with my heart. I met with an endocronologist over fears that my glands were not functioning correctly and I had an inbalance. I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack, and I had two seperate severe panic attacks. I had numerous blood tests. 2 EKG's, an echocardiogram, chest x-rays for lung cancer. I honestly had fears that I had cancer, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, kidney failure, bone cancer, deep vein thrombosis, pancreatitis, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, and the list goes on and on. All completely ridiculous, but my fear was completely real and I couldn't escape it.After finally realizing these daily fears and my constant anxiety wasn't rational or normal I attempted to control it through diet, excercise and meditation. Months of failed attempts to make anything better I finally set-up another appointment with my doctor to discuss my anxiety issues. After a long conversation she explained that I had GAD, I need co	M	35	3  days.250 2X D	8/18/2012Email
5	back neck spasms	Wonderful.  Helps tremendously  with my anxiety which I had never been treated for.  Ran out once and couldn't get refill for 10 days and suffered horrible withdrawal.  It was nightmarish, frightening.  Will try not to ever run out again.		F	60	10  years10mg	8/9/2012
5	Anxiety	Drowsiness, dizzyness. Almost feels like I am drunk at times, especially when I stand up to walk after a period of sitting.	Helped my anxiety tremendously. Relaxed me and helped me sleep. Decided to stop taking it after learning different techniques to help cope with anxiety from my psychologist. No withdrawal symptoms.	F	22	2  months.5mg 2X D	8/6/2012
4	anxiety,panic disorders and depress		Well clonazepam did help me. Till one day a doctor said that it was time to detox. So I went not knowing any better. I had no idea how my life was going to change, for the worst. The detox center had me go cold turkey and so three days later all hell broke loose. When i say all hell, I literally mean it. The next 2yrs were pure HELL. I was in and out of hopitals the situation got so bad, I had rather someone take my legs off as long as I was better. I am traumatized from the hell I had to live. Till this day when I talk about I still cry like a baby. So plz if u decide to come off any benzos, do it in a way that u feel comfortable. First talk to ur Dr. and make sure its done very slowly. Plz I just dont want anyone else to go through what I went through! Also remember most of these Dr.s are overworked and dont care, so real quick they'll wright a prescription for benzo's. Always ask all questions u might have. THIS IS UR LIFE, LIVE IT!	F	40	21  years1mg 2X D	7/23/2012Email

My dose was .5 twice a day and I took .5 once a day for eight days and .25 once a day for nine days then I stopped. I don't remember anything for those two and a half weeks.

5	severe anxiety	none at all and I have been taking it for 2-3 months. I would recommend this medication to anyone suffering from severe anxiety. It is a life-saver.	This medicine is a mini miracle for me. I have had no problems with it at all. I know some are complaining about withdrawal symptoms but,from what I have heard that only happens to people who take higher dosages. I have never really experienced any of that. I have abruptly stopped medications with no problems. ( I know you shouldn't do that and don't recommend anyone else do it. I was young then lol.)	F	22	2  months1/2 mg 1X D	4/24/2012
1	sleep, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome	No side effect for 11 years, except for daily burning pain that started after I stopped the medication for 5 days. Started weaning off of it and have had many withdrawal symptoms for 8 months and counting.	It seemed like a miracle drug, that's why I took it for 11 years. Have now been weaning off of it for 8 months. Withdrawal symptoms I've experienced: insomnia, panic attacks, agoraphobia, myoclonic jerks, tachycardia, depression, dizziness, tinnitus, joint pain, derealization, hypersensitivity, crippling exhaustion and weakness.	F	31	11  years.25 -.75mg 1X D	4/17/2012
4	Sleeping and Anxiety	Definitely helps with onset of sleep and panic or anxiety attacks. I no longer have restless leg syndrome.  I seem to be more scatter-brained and have vivid dreams but not sure if it is caused by trazodone (which I take 75mg or less at bedtime) or the clonazepam (which I take .5-.75 at night with the trazodone).	Yes, it's relaxing.  I don't like taking pills of any kind, really.  I wish that it was not so addictive, although the pharmacist said it is the benzo with less addicting properties.	F	38	1  years.25 4X D	4/11/2012Email
5	PTSD, panic attacks	The only side effect I have noticed is itching. I have had panic attacks since a young girl. Sex abuse when I was 3 or 4. Over the years it took its toll and 10 years ago I had a melt down and was put on clonazepam. Finally I felt like I could do things without the fear of attacks constantly looming over me. However, I am getting rather tired of the itching. Has anyone had this side effect?	Panic ruins your life. My tolerance has not increased over 10 years. Same dosage for 10 years. Itching is the only side effect I have suffered. Would like to hear if others have experienced itching.	F	59	10  years1 mg 1X D	2/23/2012Email
5	anxiety/panic attacks and ic	Withdrawal can happen if you stop abruptly but other than that no side effects for me.	Love it. I function so much better on this than I do off of it. If you easily get addicted to drugs maybe you shouldn't take it long term but I have gone off this drug several times without many side effects. If you have interstitial cystitis I recommend you ask your doctor for some during flares. For me it helped with my frequency and urgency.	F	27	1  years.5mg 2X D	2/10/2012Email
1	LACK OF JUDGMENT	Every side effect in the book especially once I hit tolerance, which we all do. I don't even have time to write them all down.At first this drug seems great. Over time your health goes downhill and you get interdose withdrawal symptoms. This medication is an absolute nightmare to come off.	For those of you who want more info, email me. I just got off, and know how terrible it is. Check out benzo.org.uk THE ASHTON MANUAL (IT WILL SAVE YOU. I PROMISE). Also be sure to Google BENZO WITHDRAWAL and check out Youtube Videos (SEARCH BENZO WITHDRAWAL OR BENZO HELL). Good luck to everyone trying to get off this crap.

4	Anxiety	Use is on and off, minimum effective dose, I keep it low. Main issue is paresthesia and fasciculations as I wean off the drug, some I Sonia. Also use to reduce rls like symptoms, stretching muscles while asleep while injured..  Hinders healing. That's current reason along with anxiety around not being able to stop stretching at night.	The drug works.   I have been off for months and months at a time, use the lowest dose u can use and wean off. Not everyone can do this depending on your anxiety. My best drug is exercise when not injured. That really works!	M	63	30  days.125 mg 1X D	12/26/2011

3	anxiety	Severe depression /anxiety while weening off	Benzos like this,lorazepam,alprazolam, (Klonopin,Ativan,Xanax etc..) do work, and can help a lot, but I would advise, BE CAREFUL!!  If you choose to go on a benzo, do it VERY SHORT TERM! Your brain will change chemistry fairly quickly, and soon you are "dependant", and you will become tolerant to the drug. You may need a higher and higher dose over time to acheive the same results. If you are tempted to do this (on your own).DON'T!!!!!!!! Going off benzos cold turkey can be a NIGHTMARE , that words can't describe.(not to mention dangerous).. Been there done that...its not pretty..YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO THERE!!My new doc says it is going to take 18 months to ween off this stuff.	M	46	3  years2.5 2X O	11/1/2011Email
1	PTSD, severe anxiety, depression	increased drowsiness,Increased anxiety and depression immediately. severe thoughts of suicide, constant and increasing sadness. hands and fingers twitching,	PTSD and anxiety symptoms caused by daughters death. Was previously diagnosed with depression and placed  on cymbalta and welbutrin  with good results for years. Lorazipam was added for anxiety and PTSD. Worked well for several months then had no effect. Was then placed on Clonazepam  felt OK for first couple of days then went into extreme tailspin. at urging of my wife I quit taking and almost instantly began to feel better. Will be calling my Psychiatrist ASAP.	M	46	2  weeks1 mg 3X D	10/16/2011Email
5	Anxiety	No side effects at all.	I was on Buspar previous to taking Clonazepam. At first, I thought it was helping me but I came to realize that I wasn't.  My anxiety was making me feel as though my heart was pounding so fast, it was going to bust right through my chest.  The first time I took my Clonazepam, I had relief.  I am still have to care about things and be concerned about them, but I do not feel drowsy or anything like that.  It has just taken the fear away and that horrible feeling like my heart is going to bust right out of my chest.  I don't take it everyday and when I do take it, I only take 1/2 of my .5mg dose.  My prescription says to take 1/2 to 1 tablet a day, as needed.  Unlike Buspar, I do not have to take it every day (and the Buspar, like I said before, didn't help me.  I gave it a chance and I think because my doctor actually listened and gave me something that I was trying to give it a fair chance, to no avail.).  With all of the problems that life brings us sometimes, in this day and age, this drug has been a blessing to me.  I am grateful for it.	F	57	2  months.25-.5 2X D	10/14/2011Email
2	anxiety, panic attacks	drowsiness, exhaustion, poor quality sleep, vivid disturbing dreams, chest pains, muscle weakness	i was prescribed this drug for sleep and anxiety because i am going through a stressful life situation and because anxiety/phobias run in my family. i am hyper-sensitive to drugs so i take a very low dose, even half of .25mg a few nights a week. it does help with panic and puts me to sleep but i have disturbing dreams and then awake in the middle of the night unable to sleep properly afterward. the next day i feel very "off," as though there are strong drug toxins in my system and i don't feel naturally rested. i struggle through the day unsuccessfully able to nap and praying that i won't need the drug the following night. i have taken only one other benzo (valium) and it gave me the same feeling, only worse. i have no idea how other people take this drug with no real side effects. in my experience, the side effects are almost worse than the anxiety and loss of sleep because of it. i wish i never had doctors who casually prescribe benzos. i'm not an addictive person, but because i have access to this drug it's so much easier to reach for it when i'm anxious. i wouldn't recommend clonazepam because i believe the "cure" is worse than the malady, but sometimes just knowing i have it on hand helps me to be strong and face life and my anxiety without it.

1	I was so drugged I don't remember!	Everything on the side effects list "plus" many that are mentioned in other comments on this site.	Clonazepam is horrendous.  It has taken me almost 3 years to decrease from 3mg to .5mg..  I am trying to get by on .25 and can't seem to totally discontinue.  The diagnoses as found in my medical records is: OCD, Dissociative Identity Disorder, MPD, Bipolar Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Depression, Anxiety, Mixed State (psychiatry), Dysphoric Manic State, Dissociative Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Delusional Disorder, Paranoia Disorder, Major Affective Disorder, Depression with Psychosis plus, Psychomotor Retardation.  Because of the prescribed drugs, I developed very difficult medical issues such as Gerd, Sleep Apnea, and Incontinence. The FDA needs to be aware of comments made on Ask a Patient, perhaps people could get the help they need instead of being thrown into the legal drug system.  Good news: although drugged, I awakened in mid 2007 with a clear mind, researched the drugs, began my decent and am alive once more.  I reluctantly take one medication, a .25 clonazepam and it is still horrendous and very controlling.  I want to be totally free of clonazepam, life has passed me by (over 30 years gone). I have color in my life once more, and I love living.

I have really seen no negative side-effects except the possible weight loss and lack of appetite. However, I have also been going through extreme stress during the last 4 months and feel like I have stayed more calm and rational than I would have before I started taking the drug.

I have had my hair fall out in clumps in the first months off. I am 15 months off and am in so much pain still. Do not take this medication. Work out your problems with therapy or find a natural way to treat your anxiety or depression. You will like this medication at first but it will cause you to be apathetic and make you feel like a zombie and you won't even see your health deteriorate before your eyes because it twists your thoughts and behaviors.

I realize this drug is addictive, however, for me taking this is much better than the night terrors I have and also for those around me so they don't get jolted out of bed with my screams.No other medicine has helped with my combination of symptoms and I rarely feel the need to take on a daily basis.The night terrors for me have become fairly predictable as I see something on TV or see a car accident that triggers them.  I know then I need to take the medication for a while.I also am sure to take a drug holiday and wean off the drug.  Never just quit the drug.	F	48	5  years1 mg 2X D	4/25/2011Email
4	Anxiety	Chest pain, slight headaches, sluggish feeling, body aches, depression, feeling of lonliness, crying spells, loss of appitite.	Clonazepam is a good drug. I dont like taking meds, but this calms my anxiety. I take this drug as needed, Which is maybe 1 per week. Great for sleeping, but if you are going to use this drug for sleeping, it is highly reccommended that you take this drug around 8pm. This way, when you wake up, you dont have that sluggish feeling. If you do wake up feeling sluggish, try taking it a little earlier than 8pm. It does work really well when it is not abused but the side effects are what I hate. Not all side effects are the same. This is what holds true for me. Good Luck taking this med. Ask your doctor how to get off this drug if you are trying to ween yourself from it.	F	27	1  months05mg 1X AN	4/18/2011Email

5	Insomnia/Anxiety	Sleepiness, dizziness (mild), difficulty urinating (mild)	This can be a great medicine if taken short term or sporadically.  It relaxes you and will definitely help you sleep well.  If you take it for more than a week or two in a row, you will start building up a tolerance and will need to wean yourself off of it.  I don't recommend going cold turkey after taking it for a long time, as you will have strong side effects.  This is similar to Xanax, but milder and longer-lasting.

5		None	I have severe anxiety (Agorophbia) for 41 years from being druged at a party back in 1969, I'm now 58 years old.I've tried, hypnosis, books, head doctors, herbs, etc, don't waste your time or money on these things for many years, like I did. This is a REAL ILLNESS contrary to what people tell you. The doctors will give you some paxel or celexa and send you home to get rid of you. Unless you have this illness, nobody undestands.I'm not a pill popper and don't even take asperin unless absolutly necessary. After over forty years I had my doctor prescribe me Clonazepam and it has changed my world. I feel like I did back when I was fifteen before I was druged back in 1969.I use this stuff in moderation, and if by some chance I get addicted to it, so be it.This has completely changed my life. I feel like a normal person again. I will literally kiss  Gods feet for finally waking up to this medication.If you have any of these phobia issue, I bet it will work for you too.Good Luck,	M	58	2  days1 MG 1X W	3/7/2011

I can give you day to day, withdrawal as I have done it so many times now, I can't count. 1st day, really no change, maybe a headache, thoughts: I can do this. 2nd day, restless, headache, a little weird feeling when I stand up, thoughts: I can do this. 3rd day, (where I am at right now, going off again because moved to diff state and it is a controlled substance here and Drs will not prescribe it) Bad headache, light hurts my eyes, I am agitated, panicky, anxious, thoughts: I can't do this much longer. 4th day, tomorrow, which just makes the anxiety worse to think of, I will have a major light problem with my eyes, everything will look to "shiny" and bright, what I have termed 'metal mouth' will start, the taste in my mouth like I have been sucking on metal. Thoughts: God help me. Day 5, I will have metal mouth full blown, salivate excessively, my eyes will not allow me to see anything normally, as it should be, panic attacks are constant, anxiety levels will skyrocket. By day 7 I will not sleep, urinate excessively and have diarrhea. After that, it only gets worse.	F	44	15  years1mg 1X D	3/2/2011Email
1	Social Anxiety	I've tried to forget the terrible side effects from this drug.  There are too many to mention and too many to identify.  The worst side effects come from withdrawal and they continue well past detox.	When you start Clonazepam you might think it is your guardian angel but at some point you will come to realize that it is actually the devil in disguise.  This drug has absolutely heinous and hellish withdrawal symptoms.  Clonazepam is pure poison and should be banned.	M	54	30  days.5 3X D	2/27/2011
1	Bi-Polar disorder - mania	Feeling tired, confused, short and long term memory loss, nausea, intolerance to caffine (making me wretch or vomit for upto 4-5hours after coffee), unable to concentrate on things like films or books or games, lethologica (google it), clumsiness, stomach ache on my left side, change in bowel habits, problems with urination, mental depression, massive reduction in erections. I used to go to gym 3 times a week and run 3 times a week, but stopped it all and became fat after about 1 week of this medication.	I was only ever euphoric, full of energy, creative, slightly unpredictable and had an overwhelming sense of well-being whilst in a manic phase. I was only twice ever in trouble with the police in 20 yrs! And both times they understood the situation and were very understanding and I never got in trouble from them or charged with anything, they helped.. This stuff should only ever be given to uncontrollable maniacs IMO, any other use does not justify the side effects. I am still Bi-Polar, but treat it now with Lamotrigine (75mg a day). They only gave me the Clonazepam to help me relax on an evening if I felt anxious and to help me sleep well. But then said I had to to take it every night and increased the amount from 0.5mg to 1.5mg over a few weeks. I hate them! I've been weaning myself off Clonazepam  over the last 7 days, I have had terrible headaches and some migraines that last most of the day and sometimes wake me up during the night. I've stopped sleeping my normal 8 hours and now only get a fitful 3-4 hours sleep. I'm restless, anxious, but now when I get anxious its worse then before and I wretch from it. Luckily some of my old self has come back, I feel a bit more alert every day, have been motivated enough to go for a run today and feel positive about the future for the 1st time in several months. If you do decide to come off it seek medical advise or at least check out the forums of other users coming off it. My symptoms of withdrawal are fairly common.

5	Sleep		This drug worked perfectly for me.  I had a new job and I would wake up at night thinking about it.  If I had trouble falling asleep at night I would take .5 mg at bed time.  Sometimes I could fall asleep fine without taking anything but would wake up at 3:00 AM thinking about my job.  When that happened, I would take .25 mg and would usually fall back to sleep within 20-30 minutes and wake up at my regular time feeling refreshed.  No residual effects.I never got dependent on it as I almost never needed it on the weekends and after about 2 months I was comfortable with the new job and had no trouble sleeping even without the drug.  I kept the unused portion of the prescription for occasional use.  Highly recommended.	M	42	30  days.25 -.5 mg 1X D	2/17/2011Email
1	Taking clonazepam for sleeping	I took clonazemam for sleeping for about 10 years. It helped me sleep better and to get to sleep but I would never take this drug again. I was in the hospital for a kidney transplant and I had told the Dr's that I wanted to quit taking the drug. I found out later that they stopped it all at once at the time of the operation. Three days later in the hospital my legs started twiching and this strange tingling started to move up my whole body. I was shaking and trying to dig the hair out of my head. I could not stop the anxiety atack. They finally decided that it was because of not taking clonazepam. They started me back on it and I was better within an hour. This must be the most addicting pill out there. Am slowly trying to stop taking it now.		M	70	10  years.5 mg 1X D	2/1/2011
1	anxiety and bi-polar disorder	this drug is incredibly addictive. my boyfriend and i have both been on it. i took it for 6 months and he's been takng it for around 6 years.we r both bi-polar. it's like poking an angry bull. i stopped taking it as i kept adding more and more pills per day because i didn't think it was working. however my boyfriend sometimes doesn't know when t stop. his speech is slurred and he is constantly forgetting what's going on and trips over things. this is prescibed by a doctor who supposedly curred his opiate addiction with suboxin. i guess i should be happy he doesn't crush it and shoot it ontop of heroin anymore....my bosses husband died from his klonopin addiction. he was 45. do we really need a drug this addictive being given to people with anxiety who may be suicidal??? you'd think our advanced medical industry could come up with something better. side effects: loneliness, stupidity, physical pain, addiction, sedation, and death.	i wasn't always such a bitch.

1	Leg jerks at night	Addicted. Have insomnia, inner head and body tremors, electric shock like feelings in body, mostly while trying to sleep.	I am going to try to get off of it, though I have been told it is a horrible experiance.	M	60	6  years2 MG 1X D	1/12/2011
5	Restless Leg Syn.	none except I sleep really good for the first time in 5 years	I read all the horror stories and wonder if I should continue but getting a good nights sleep with no side effects (groggy or depressed etc) I think its a wonder pill.  I have tried other things for the RLS that just don't work.   I used to laugh about people with RLS thinking it was a made up symptom...its not.  Anyway, I can tell when I will not be sleeping well and take the pill 30 min. before bed.  Sleep great, and wake up refreshed.  I would never take it during the day though.  Sorry for all those that have to take it just to function normally.	M	58	30  days.5 mg-1 mg 1X D	12/31/2010Email
5	insomnia, possible bi-polar	IMPORTANT: This medication will sometimes, often-times take you into a deep sleep where you may have very vivid dreams; for me, this happens rarely, but are very realistic.	IMPORTANT: reports of addiction may be true.  I have found that I can choose one or two tablets to sleep, and my choice is usually correct. I have tried coming off Clonazepam several times and what I find is that I am not "addicted" to them, but return to the exact, same situation I had before starting...racing mind, inability to stop having "conversations" over and over, mentally "re-doing" all my mistakes and how I should have done different.  So, in a way, I am "addicted" in that I cannot sleep without them, but I have no withdrawal symptoms as others have listed here.  NOTE:  I have tried taking them in the day for continued "stabilization" and find they make me very drowsy; I would caution those prescribed Clonazepam for daytime use to be aware of drowsiness.As to the bi-polar issue, I am much less volatile than before BUT I do not take any other medication.  It is possible that I could be more "normal" with other medication included, but, overall, I am satisfied with my personality.  It is, for me, Less Medication Is Better Medication.Hope this helped someone.	M	60	3  years1 mg 2X D	12/26/2010
1	Anxiety attack	Headache, feeling of not caring about anything, heart palpitations, dizziness, fuzzy thinking, bad dreams.  After 16 days the effects of the drug was worse than the original attack.  It took me 30 days to wean off of it	The withdrawals were horrific and worse than the original attack.  I was on such a low dose but I still had to cut that little pill in half, then a quarter, then an 8th and then finally off.  The withrdrawals continued even after the 8th.  Withdrawals were severe headache, anxiety worse than before, ringing in my ears (which I had not had before), cold sweats, heart palpitations, nausea, blurry vision.  I am still suffering from the vision difference but not every day now ( I have been off it now for 3 weeks).  I am having the cold sweats every once in a while still and a few anxiety moments which I am using prayer and reading God's word to get through.  I know there will be an end to this soon and I will be back to normal.  I will never take another mind altering drug for as long as I live!!!	F	48	46  days.5 2X D	12/17/2010Email
4	For Agoraphobia and disambiguation	- The only main side-effect I have noticed is that if you are a very active person and work out and such, It cause some disturbances for the stomach, due to its strong muscle relaxant properties. As well as skeletal muscle relaxation. And maybe dry mouth and yawning. Initially tho, it was hard to even walk on 1.25 Mg, but after about a month or so, It goes away people! Especially if used every day, at the same time and not abused. I have successfully tapered from 6mg, in 2mg 3x daily to just the 1.25mg.	Clonazepam has a very long half-life compared to other potent Nitro benzos such as Xanax, Nitrazepam, and Temazepam. So for all of the people complaining about feeling slugish the next day when waking up or sleeping through the next day, you all should switch from this medication. CLONAZEPAM SHOULD NEVER! EVER be prescribed for sleeping. There are much better benzo choices for insomnia. Take temazepam as a prime example, and if your doctor refuses to switch you to that, Try Bromazepam, or even Xanax, they all have short half-lives, meaning they leave your system with in the day.So you go to sleep at 9-10 pm, you take a temazepam (30 mg = 1 mg clonazepam), maybe you feel sluggish at around 8 a.m when you wake up. Drink a cup of tea or small cup of coffee and you wont AT ALL feel sluggish for the rest of the day. And I take this medication in the morning when I wake up... Because like I mentioned before it helps my mood and helps my anger to a great extent!	M	23	5  years1.25 1X D	12/12/2010Email
