5	chronic insomnia	Most wonderful drug I have ever taken for my insomnia. It worked when nothing else did. Had slightly dry mouth. Otherwise, slept incredibly well & felt like it gave my life back. Would take it again in a heartbeat if needed.		F	36	6  months10 mg	3/11/2013Email
5	Insomniac	I had double vision in one eye once for one hour after taking Ambien daily for a week.	This drug is a life saver.  I cut the pills into fourths and take 1/4 nightly.  Then I skip Friday nights and switch to Unisom sleep melts for a night or 2 to break any potential addiction.  I take 1/2 tablet only if I really need to catch up on extra sleep.  I have an extremely stressful job as a dentist and with any high stress job, you may notice memory loss with or without Ambien, because the brain is only capable of retaining a limited amount of storage.  I write everything down and back it up on my computer to save my brain cells.  Since I take such a low dose, I have successfully averted all side effects.  Ambien works for me and 1 other friend of mine who takes 1/2 tablet...she does notice eating things and not remembering but note she takes more than I .	F	49	2  years10 1X D	3/10/2013

NO MEMORY!		F	62	3  days8 0r 10?	3/6/2013
1	Insomnia	My wife took this briefly. Last dosage was 24 hours ago, and she is still having dreams that are very real to her.Last nights incident was very scary, she was crazed about playing this game, it was a role playing one for teamwork building T work. She was walking all around (stumbling actually) our house looking for the people she needed to get signitures from. When I made her aware of what was going on, after glimpsing insanity in her eyes, she broke down and started crying uncontrollably.All day long, she has been losing balance, dropping things and having realistic daydreams. The confusion is alarming, and, she is experiencing memory loss as well.This drug is a NIGHTMARE!!!!		F	62	3  days	3/4/2013Email
1	Insomnia	Worked great at first! But then I would be getting up every 1 1/2 hr and take another one an not remember.Then all the crazy stuff started happening would get up and not remember eating, driving, sex, going to the neighbors. It's the scariest feeling not remembering that you did something.This drug should not be prescribed! I still can't sleep but I would rather it be that way then taking that crap!.

5	insomnia	Everyone reacts differently to meds. Ambien is my savior. Its the first and last prescription sleep aid I will ever have. No complaints- no crazy dreams or shopping sprees. Sometimes I even stay up an hour or 2 after taking it and im fine. As soon as I lay down, I fall right asleep. No problems here. Love ambien!		F	25	6  months5mg	2/14/2013
1	insomnia	This is a horrible drug that can RUIN your life as you know it.  The pharmeceutical companies benefit - you do NOT.  The only true complainers about this med being taken off the market are addicts - don't believe me?  Read the posts.	After almost ruining my career, marriage and general reputation, I quit Ambien 2 years ago.  I had been mercilessly plagued with chronic insomia for years and knew that hell that brings.... Oh, haha, you ate some food and don't remember it? Order something online and forget? Have great sex and your partner likes you more?  How about not remembering driving and getting a DUI?  How about going to your neighbor's house and screwing the husband there?  How about taking a nap and leaving your kids at school to where the police are called?  That could easily be you!! I know a small percentage of persons have no problem with Ambien, but it is the devils drug.  The ones that complain are freaking ADDICTS that can't get any other good crap online anymore.  And to the gentleman that wondered about memory loss?  I would constatnly forget the names of office mates and even my own phone number...... The Drug gods are reaping blood money.  Ambien can and will kill you.  Ther are non-narcotic sleep aids out there - knock off wanting to get high and utilize them.  I take an anti-psychoic that knocks me out for 6-8 hours with no other side effects...	F	49	 20mg 1X D	2/14/2013
3	Insomnia	Ambien always seems to work unless I have a filling late evening meal before going to bed. My biggest concern is whether Ambien is tied to my almost ridiculous memory loss. I go through every average day trying desperately to remember simple facts and tasks. I essentially have no memory left. I don't like it and want to get off of Ambien. It's a little scary for my wife sometimes because I've got to stay lucid & coherent to work a demanding job. I would love to hear if other people experience such memory loss throughout the work day.

1	sleeplessness	Ambien was prescribed for my brother, late in 2011, after a bitter divorce left him sressed.My brother complained of extremely vivid dreams and hallucinations while on it.  My brother discontinued it's use and relied on otc medication to help him sleep. Late 2012, he was again given Ambien to help him sleep. He hadn't been on it very long when we found him deceased as a result of self inflicted injuries. I'm convinced the Ambien must have caused more hallucinations that resulted in his death. If I can reach one person, it's worth it. Please stay away from this medication!		M	47	10  days	2/12/2013
3	Insomnia	I'm an insomniac. I've taken ambien a few times a month on and off for years. When I wake up I feel fine but I've done a lot of questionable things on it and stopped using it entirely now. I've gone on Internet shopping sprees, had sleepy sex and said really outrageous nonsensical things to my boyfriend, and raided the fridge on it before I've fallen asleep. I have no recollection until seeing the email receipt, empty fridge or hearing my boyfriends story.  I can kind of laugh about these ambien episodes because I'm with a loved one- but I can see it being extremely dangerous for someone alone or amongst people that might take advantage of the state they are in. I've been taking a natural thing called VHP which seems to help me sleep without any of the crazy side effects. Definitely proceed with caution with ambien.		F	34	1  days	1/28/2013
4	Insomnia	Ambien works for me. I need to sleep. Ambien puts me to sleep. Side effects are some "spaciness" the next day, blackouts at night after taking. I actually ordered a pair of shoes off of eBay, another night a DVD from Amazon and have absolutely no memory of the purchases. My rule now is NO Internet after 11 pm.		F	48	2  years10 mg	1/27/2013
2	Sleep	This medication is a hypnotic agent, meaning it induces a state of amnesia. I took Ambien for two years because I could not fall asleep at night. It did help me fall asleep. However I NEVER felt rested the next day. I just couldn't figure out why I was SO incredibly tired all the time because I always thought I got a restful night's sleep. HERE'S AMBIEN'S DIRTY SECRET: Because this med is a hypnotic, you "feel" like you got good sleep because your brain literally doesn't remember - IT INDUCES AMNESIA- You end up assuming you got good sleep because you FORGET in the AM that you didn't! I have stopped taking it after two years of nightly use and replaced with a Melatonin/5-HTP supplement for the past 3 days. I HAVE NEVER felt so rested! I can tell such a difference. Turns out I wasn't sleeping well at all- I just didn't remember in the morning.		F	31	2  years	1/23/2013
4	sleep aid	First week or so I'd feel drugged/drowsy for the first part of the day.  That gradually decreased as the days went on though.	Have taken ambien on 2 separate occassions for 30-90 day spans of time.  Taken to help me get myself back on a regular sleep schedule.	F	42	60  days10 mg 1X D	1/11/2013Email
1	Lifelong sleep issues	Amnesia, overdose	Every once in a while I post about the dangers.  I am a terrible sleeper and have cycled through meds. I was never a fan of Ambien but every 9 months or so I would take it for 2 weeks.  2 years ago, I had an amnesiac episode where evidently in the middle of the night I took 10 pills.  I did not realize I did this for three days and suffered through the most horrendous anxiety that really made me understand why people kill themselves.  I found out what had happened and was able to go into my local hospital for a few days to be treated and calm down.  I always took the med responsibly. I would go right to bed.  Everyone needs to be aware that even if you have never had an issue before, it does not mean this can not happen to you.  I find Ambien to be such a toxic and dangerous drug,  I would never touch this pill again... ever.	M	43	2  weeks10mgs 1X D	1/5/2013
1	my dad- suicide	He only took randomly. As needed. Very against medication, but bad back and stress he couldnt sleep good. Happily married, happy family. Merry Christmas. Don't take ambien. I think it had a LOT to do with it. Bc my dad was not depressed or suisidal and if he was he would NOT have done it the way he did it. The meds had his brain workin funny.		M	55	1  daysnot sure	1/5/2013
5	nightmares and inability to sleep	No side effects, but had to take other meds to control the nightmares.		F	28	4  years10	12/23/2012
4	insomnia and headaches at night	Amnesia... I ordered items over telephone and don't remember.  I have done this several times and by looking at my phone it happens within the 1st hour of taking it.  Also, I have actually walked outside at night and brought an item back into the house and don't even remember.  That's the only issue I have experienced.  I have found however that if you take 1/2 pill you will sleep all night versus when I take a whole pill I wake up about 4 hours later.  SO...  1/2 pill works great for sleep!	I have been taking this drug for many years and have found that 1/2 pill works better than 1 whole pill to sleep ALL night.  For some reason when I take a whole pill I wake up 4 hours later and can't get back to sleep.   I am just very concerned about the Amnesia though.	F	50	6  years10 1X D	12/18/2012Email
1	Could not sleep through the night.	Back and neck pain and tightness,  After visiting the chiropractor and message therapist with no relief, I miraculously made the connection that it was the Ambien and not stress that was causing my pain.  I have been off the med. for less than a week and feel great.  The back pain is completely gone.			46	6  weeks10mg 1X D	10/29/2012
5	Insomnia	No side effects.  I have been on it long term, although I do stop taking it occasionally.  It has been a blessing for me. Always wake up feeling refreshed.		F	36	6  years10mg	10/28/2012
3	No sleep	Next day fatigue, bloating, stomach pain, memory loss, racing heart, no sleep without it!	Ambien is good for short term only. It does do the job, but side effects are bad. Went off for a while, all side effects went away. Trying to stay off.	F	62	6  days12.5mg 1X AN	10/23/2012Email
1	Lack of sleep	Memory loss, confusion, hallucinations, headache. Thought I was asleep, actually made multiple phone calls and ended up driving on freeway. Remember bits a pieces of night such as the feeling as though I wasn't behind wheel of my car but knew I was on the freeway. White lines were lifting up and going multiple directions, seeing double, vivid colors, dog moving on my ph picture and only GOD knows what else. I cry now every time I think about danger I put myself and others in. So now I have anxiety and panic when I sleep or take meds- which my doc gv me clonazepam- on Day 2. Ambien should be removed off market and def not prescribed to anyone!		F	28	1  days10mg	10/7/2012
5	no rem sleep. rare sleep	Had cereal once that I didn't remember fixing myself but also hadn't eaten supper. This drug is the reason I actually sleep. I feel rested and happy.		F	48	1  years10	9/27/2012
4	Insomnia	Severe lack of inhibition-out of character behaviour. Occasional hallucinations. Headaches and chronic memory loss and diminished cognitive functioning during the day.	I wish I had never taken this drug. Yes it was very effective for my insomnia. But now I have very bad anterograde amnesia.  When I was on ambien I couldn't remember things I"d done the night before after taking it and I would do crazy things after taking it too. But this problem is far beyond that. I have SEVERE SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS. I can't form new memories and I have trouble recalling information that I *used* to know. Please let me know if you have also experienced this and whether the problem goes away. I am desperate for more information.	F		4  years10mg 1X D	9/21/2012Email
5	Insomnia	Hunger in the middle of the night (not sleep-eating, I knew what I was doing) and hallucinations if I didn't go to bed right away	I was having a pretty bad bout of insomnia and finally decided I needed to see the doctor about it. When I heard he was giving me Ambien, I freaked out. I had heard many scary things about it from other users. I was terrified to take it, but I figured not sleeping was worse, so I tried it. I slept so well that night. I didn't even remember drifting off. I felt so rested. I would notice that if I took it and stayed up doing anything, like reading, I would eventually start seeing things. One night the lights in my house looked like they were moving around and floating through the room, like orbs. It never scared me, though, because I knew it was the Ambien doing it and I was the one stupid enough to stay up after taking it when the label said to take it right when going to sleep. I also noticed that if I happened to wake up some nights, I'd get intense urges to eat anything crunchy, like cereals. But the sleep I got was so good. Eventually, the 10 MG I was taking started to poop out on me around the three month mark. My doctor did not want to increase my dosage any higher, so he just discontinued the Ambien altogether and put me on Lunesta, which was way more expensive. I was worried about stopping the Ambien cold turkey after three months and he said it shouldn't be a problem. I have been off the Ambien for going on three days now, and I have not experienced anything unpleasant.	M	27	3  months10 MG 1X D	9/13/2012Email

1	sleep disorder		this drug should be taken off the market. it is very dangerous. my x-husband commited suicide while taking this drug. his doctore called in 60 pills and between tuesday and friday he had take 19 because he couldnt go to sleep. people forget how many they take because of all the side effects. take this drug off the market.

1	To fall asleep	Kept me up all night.		M		1  days	8/18/2012
1	post surgery sleep aid	depression, memory loss, erratic behavior, anxiety, fatigue, OCD behavior, apathy, irritability, paranoia	Anyone taking this should start tapering off now. I went cold turkey, a complete nightmare. 2 years of destroying everything I worked hard for!!!	M	36	2  years10 mg 1X D	7/27/2012
1	to sleep	can't sleep, keeps me up for 24 plus hours. I need to sleep , not stay awake. This is my secound drug for sleeping and nothing is working.		F	45	3  days5mg 1X D	7/2/2012Email
5	Insomnia	Blackouts	If taken correctly you will should go to bed and go to sleep. I know that if I take it and do not go to bed right away then after a certain point I will not remember anything. I have never taken it and drove. Once I am in bed I am in bed. If I drink before I take it then my black out periods are more frequent. But you just have to know this is the way it works. Other than staying up when I know I shouldnt and maybe not remembering everything from the night before is the only thing that has happened. But I know this is because of the ambien. Its something I accept. I do not recommend drinking with it though. You do much more crazy stuff. I am sure my partner enjoys the crazy sex he gets from time to time off of it I just wish I could remember some of it. But sometimes I am glad I can't.	F	42	5  years10mg 1X D	6/21/2012
1	To help sleep after surgery	Hallucinations, confusion	My mother was given Ambien in the hospital after hip surgery after falling in rehab after knee surgery.   She is totally not here ....talking to walls, babbling, seeing things, talking to people not there, thinking she is standing and falling while laying in bed....and what is more is that she hasnt been able to sleep now for three days.  I demanded to see all the meds she had been given and then the hospitalization doctor, case woker and nurse were all surprised to see she had been given Ambien!  Surprised???? She has been out of it for two days now!  This drug is bad! She has never had dementia or anything like this until she has had these surgeries and been put on all of these medications.  Please watch for these side effects.	F	82	2  days 1X D	6/18/2012Email
1	My mom couldnt sleep	falling, hallucinations, depression, screaming at night, hands shaking and eventually death.	Ambien killed my mom	F	69	12  months5 1X D	6/16/2012Email
4	Chronic insomnia	Sometimes a little bit groggy in the morning, or some light headaches, but usually I experience no side effects at all.	This drug has been a life-saver to me in many respects.  My quality of life was really going downhill after more than a year of getting only 2-4 hours of sleep per night.  My doctor prescribed Ambien, and my insomnia went away with the first pill.  Took 5 mg/night for a few months, then cut back to 2.5, which I've been taking ever since.  I only take 5 mg now if I'm having a really rough time falling asleep.  The only downside to the drug (that others have talked about extensively), is that it's hard to get off it.  I've been on it for five years, and just about every time I try to stop taking it, I have a rough night or two and end up getting right back on it.  For me, it's mostly a psychological addiction.	M	33	5  years2.5 - 5 mg 1X D	6/14/2012
5	Insomnia	Having conversations with my husband that I have no memory of...but otherwise, this medicine has been a blessing as I have had life long insomnia. I take it only as prescribed and I do not leave my bed after taking it.		F	39	3  years10 MG	6/13/2012
5	Insomnia	I took this a few years ago and did not follow the warnings and had all the side effect that have been mentioned. Now I follow them exactly as prescribed and immediately get into bed. I may watch TV for 20 mins or so but them its off to sleep I go. My sleep has been fantastic !!! I have always had trouble sleeping waking every 90 mins or so, which lad to feeling very tired and out of sorts. Now I wake refreshed and ready to tackle the day!	Ambien is not right for every one, but if the doctor gives it to you, follow his/her guidance. Never take more than prescribed or drink alcohol with it.As soon as you take it go right to bed and relax and let the meds work. If you have a spouse, girlfriend/boyfriend or partner and tell them about the possible side effects so he/she can be there to support you!	F	49	6  weeks12.5 1X D	6/12/2012Email
5	Sleep aid	None	Has helped me sleep immensely. I have cardiac PVCs/PACs and Ambien helps me get to sleep.	M	42	1.6  years10 MG 1X D	6/12/2012
3	Sleeping disorder	Some mild hallucination		M	18	4  days10 MG	6/6/2012Email
1	Insomnia	Helped with sleeping, but caused major depression, fuzzy thoughts, inability to concentrate, suicidal thoughts, self injury	I had been having trouble sleeping for about a year.  Drs found I had borderline apnea, not bad enough to get a cpap or do anything else.  Dr prescribed ambien.  Worked great for about a week, then the side effects started in.  I had had chronic depression as a teenager, this was worse.  I started planning my suicide, and started cutting myself, which I had not done in 20 years.  I drove away my wife and several friends, and ruined my job by not doing pretty much anything useful for a month.  Fortunately a friend with her own history of depression recognized what was going on, helped me to see it and got me off the meds.  A few days later I was mostly back to normal, and set about repairing the relationships I damaged.  Unfortunately it was too late to fix my job and I ended up being let go.  I don't doubt that that friend saved my life.  I was progressing so rapidly through the depression that I expect I would have taken my own life within the next few weeks.	M	37	6  weeks 1X D	6/6/2012Email
1	Insomnia	Not remembering anything I had done after taking it. Drove twice after taking it and "going to bed."  God only knows what else I've done while on it.	Do not take this medicine. You will become addicted.	F	26	4  years10 MG 1X D	6/3/2012

4	Difficulty staying asleep	3D VISION. does anybody else experience this or only me? PLease tell me there are more of you out there,		M	42	1  years10MG 1X D	5/30/2012
3	insomnia	short term memory loss, no longer works past 4 hours	after about 3 years it only worked for 4 hours and I wake suddenly. I tried the sustained release but I still slept a little over 4 hours. I tried taking half and then the other half when I woke which worked another 6 months or so. Now I take it in conjunction with other meds that cause drowsiness and only to fall asleep if the others don't work.	F	62	6  years10  mg 1X D	5/24/2012
3	Sleep issues/insomnia	very high blood pressure, digestive issues/stomach problems, mood swings, breathing issues	I took this in the past, and it made me itchy, so stopped taking it. This time I had to take it on a vacation. I took it for 2 days 2.5 mg, then when I got to my vacation destination, I was taking 5mg for 7 days. This time I was not itchy, but it did mess with my breathing a little (I have asthma). When I got back, I discovered it made my blood pressure go up to 168/112. Needless to say I stopped taking it, and my blood pressure came down. At the same time I started to take 5mg, I was having stomach upset and pain on vacation, along with gas and bloating. I read another blog where people have had all kinds of problems with Ambien such as acid reflux, nausea and vomiting, etc. So not sure what to think. This is my third day off Ambien, and am still having stomach problems, so i'm going to give it another day, and go to the doctor to make sure it's not something else. I was fine before Ambien.

5	Insomnia	Take this drug for sleep not to get high and all those other people saying don't take this it ruins lives.		M	20	4  years10	5/19/2012
5	Insomnia	A little nausea and some wild dreams	Ambien works fantastic as long as you don't take it over 4 days in a row or long-term. It is a short-term quick fix for insomnia. As with all sleep meds you will develop a tolerance if you take it on a regular basis. Go to bed immediately after taking ambien for it to work properly. If you don't, you might sleep eat, drive, call, etc. Improper use is why this medication gets a very bad name. If used correctly, it will work and for all of us true insomniacs, it is a miracle drug.	F	46	4  days10 MG 1X D	5/14/2012Email
4	Insomnia	Doesn't always work.	Good for 4 hours.  Sometimes only 2.  As a teen, thought it was great to only need 4 hours sleep a night.  Worked 2 jobs, had lots of time for fun, school, everything!  Maybe its even normal for some of us (4 hours), I still don't know...but I know that whenever I sleep for over 8 hours (it sometimes happens!), then I drag, and am feeling tired all the next day.  On the other hand, 1 or 2 hours isn't fun, either.  I tried other prescriptions off and on during this time and felt with some of them like I didn't sleep at all...which is extremely stressful....!  Also tried the hormone melatonin.  It may work for one night, maybe even 2, but, being a hormone, would be unlikely that it could work any longer than that.	M	64	4  years10 mg 1X D	5/11/2012
1	for sleep after surgery	nursing staff were weird dressed weird	My mom recently had terminal cancer never sleeps under stress and still scared & still in hospt.Upon my requist 4 her to rest, ambien was given. The next morning mom was NOT MOM. She said staff was mean, dressed funnyWeird, ABUSIVE, Nor would give her , her meds, had been placed in a chair & left 4 long time, no nurse checked on her 4 three hrs. Could not get to remote. In mean time she got up to go to bed & fell. I asked how long on floor & who picked u up(no one i crawled). Mind u she has iv's, cathiter ect. So i asked who hung cath. bag ( nurse). I go see my mom and she is NOT MY MOM never crys throughout all her illness. She was freaking out VERY EMOTINALLLL. Mind you this was only her 2nd night in Kendred rehab. I believed EVERY WORD SHE SAID. Come to find out it was the medication AMBIEN. SO in meantime several days later she still believes all that she told me happened to her is true. And I tried to explain to her it was the medication . She knows I do not Lye to her about anything . Still 3 days later she thinks that I am trying to sugercoat & take up 4 the staff just to keep her from comming home. TOTALLY UN TRUE So what I am saying it was ALL DO TO THE MEDICATION AMBIEN. And  IM PRAYING EVERYONE SEES THIS POST REMARK ABOUT THIS DRUG AND DOES NOT LET THEIR LOVED ONES BE GIVEN IT AND PREY IT IS TAKEN OFFFFFF THE MARKET. I give this drug a 0000000 rating .

4	insomnia	Knock-out fatigued after about 12 years of taking Ambien. So dead tired, it started to greatly affect how I was living my life.	Quit sleeping after my Mother died, 15 yrs. ago. Doctored for about 2 years now trying to find out what was wrong w/me, that I just couldn't function anymore after about 2 p.m. All blood tests would come back normal, so no answer could be offered.  Then just recently I read an article about Ambien, saying it was very dangerous, like smoking, which I gave up 40 years ago, and that it could cause great fatigue during the day. That was it. I am now going to an acupuncturist to help me start sleeping normally, and it seems to be working for me.  I originally started out taking 1/4 of a 10 mg. to just get me to sleep, and if I woke up in the middle of the night, I would take another 1/4, so I never had any of the weird things going on. But I was now up to 1/2 of a 10 mg., and not knowing where it would stop.  The first 2 nights off, even from that small of a mg., was hell. Just to lay there awake all night, and feel like a zombie all the next day. And I was so addicted to it right from the start, that I hope I will never have to take it again. That was when I started w/acupuncture.	F	67	14  years1/2-10 mg. 1X D	5/5/2012Email
1	insomnia	Anxiety, paranoia, extreme mood swings	I took this drug 5 years ago when I was having trouble sleeping with infants in house.  Couldn't figure out why I couldn't handle everyday life events anymore.  I was finally sleeping, right?.  Finally read about it on here.  I had turned from a normal, tired new father into a complete psychopath.  It was Ambien.  I flushed 45 pills!  Felt like a new person in days.  Stay far away form this stuff.  It made me nuts	M	40	45  days10 MG 1X D	5/4/2012
2	Insomnia	Upset stomach, nausea, groggy feeling upon wakening	After tappering off Xanax for insomnia, I needed something temporarily to help with insomnia and my doctor prescribed Ambien.  He prescribed 10 mg, but most of the time this dosage doesn't work at all and I end up taking one or two more.  I feel nauseous, have an extremely painful stomach, and feel very groggy.  This happens on every dosage and just gets worse the more I increase.  At this point, I'm thinking I'd rather deal with no sleep than these side effects, as they are really taking away from my quality of life.	F	28	2  months10-30 mg 1X D	4/17/2012Email

5	insomnia	hallucinations, especially when taking while on adderall or other stimulants. doing things i don't remember	Ambien is an extremely good treatment for insomnia, so long as you aren't on stimulants or drinking too much caffiene. if you stay up on it even just a short time, you may hallucinate or do things you don't recall doing at all. However, as a sleep aid, it's wonderful. It may be addicting, though. I kind of just had to stop taking it because my insurance no longer covered a full month's worth, but i don't really need it anymore anyway.	F	24	5  years10 mg 1X D	3/27/2012Email
4	Trouble staying asleep	Memory loss	In general I am very happy with Zolpidem. Often I would be in bed, unable to stop my brain thinking about work. Zolpidem makes me fall asleep quickly. The funny but a bit weird thing is that my hubby tells me about us having long conversations that I have zero recollection of having. He calls it "wifey being in La-La land". We make jokes about it but it reminds me of how strong this drug is. Please take with care.	F	42	2  years10 1X D	3/26/2012

5	sleep disorder	am 17 started ambien when I was 14 . there wonderful. gotta be carful not to take them til you go to sleep when I first took them I got really dizzy stuff look like I was in a scary movie.  they kinda gave me a sicafrangat zone saw things heard things made me feel like I was in a room full of pll wen I wasn't.  people told me that it would give real tragic dreams such as bloody scary stuff I always had them so I couldn't tell y'all if they made them worse. there very addicting I can't go with out them or ill be up for days . NEVER take more than 2 . they make you do crazy stuff when yuu wake up your memeber nothing .i woke up with crazy stuff.  other than that after awhile you tend to get used to them.  most side affects are do to me having to take 2 anxiety pills 2 depresson pills and my ambein.  so now I can't sleep with out all 5 or 6 .

4	Insomnia due to varying work shifts	When i first started taking them they worked great. There were some small hallucinations but i just they were funny. After a while it did the opposite for me. Take one and i am still up 6 hours later. Caused a few manic episodes that ended in crying and vomitting. Now i try to only take when i know i need it, but i have to take one and a half gor it work now.		F	24	8  months10mg	3/17/2012Email

5	insomnia and anxiety	The only side effect I had was it made me feel weird. When the ambien kicked in it felt weird to eat and touch anything. And everything just seemed to slow down to slow motion. Other then that this drug saves my life. Without it I would still be up for days at a time		F	21	1  days50 MG	3/3/2012Email
5	Knee pain and insomnia	NONE THAT I AM AWARE OF	Usually take 5mg, fall asleep, wake up 4-5 hours later, go right back to sleep, feel refreshed and alert in the mornings.  Am a college professor and do my best work in the mornings.  When I go off for a few days when I am between prescriptions, I simply go back to the way it was before Ambien ... my mind is too busy to go to sleep and I wake up throughout the night.  So, when I begin to get tired after a few days of that, I get another prescription and enjoy being able to go to sleep and return to enjoying an energized life.  I do wish there was more animal research and neurological fMRI studies being done on long term use of Ambien because I think it is a great pill.  People often ask if I have been tested for sleep apnea and I have not.	M	67	7  years5-10 mg 1X D	3/2/2012Email

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff.

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.	F	36	7  days2 MG 1X D	7/15/2010Email
2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
4	BIPOLAR 2	Severe Hiccups, lasted for 3 days.  Nausea, severe burping, felt like I was going to throw up, lasted for a week.  Slight mania, abbreviated sleep cycles, still having these.  I feel the side effects are worth it because of how well it keeps me from short cycling, which causes way more problems in my life than a little Nausea		M	36	8  weeks15 MG 1X D	6/2/2010
2	Bi-Polar	Lethargic, Weight Gain and Depression has gotten worse.  I want to be taken off this medication.  Having indecisiveness (more than usual) and my OCD has increased.  Not seeing many benefits after being on Abilify for 2 months.  Feeling sadness daily and lack of energy.  Seems to slow me down to a sad halt.		F	53	2  months10MG 1X D	5/29/2010
2	bipolar 2	sleepiness or death tired during the afternoon even after 9 months of taking this med also i'm waking up in the middle of the night; also i decided because of the drowsiness i would go off of this cold turkey- bad decision because he had sweats, nausea and severe headache.....	the doctor wants me to stay on this but the daytime drowsiness is ruining my life and the nighttime waking is too much	F	50	9  months2mg 1X D	5/29/2010

2	Anxiety	Hallucinations, seeing spots (colored), toothaches (the whole right side of my mouth) I know this because when I stopped taking, it was way improved. Headaches, angry outbursts, very very tired 24/7.	Did help the anxiety. However, I couldn't tolerate the side effects I listed. It seemed each day was worse than the day before.	F	35	1  months	6/7/2009
1	Depression	Insanity. I know that sounds wierd, crazy or whatever, but that is the closest word I know to describe it. For three days I went into a world where I couldn't understand what was going on aroung me. I would start to speak, the words were clear in my head, but gibberish would come out. I was terrified for much of the time, curled in a ball, feeling I was about to die at any second.	This drug is now advertised as an add on supplement to anti-depressants. This is crazy! It's an anti-psychotic! It has a side affect profile that if fully revealed to patients would sent them running for the nearest exit.	M	28	4  days	6/7/2009
1	wrongly diagnosed	So, I am posting this message mainly to help others with their emotional/psychological struggles.  I would like to give people who have been put on anti-psychotics some pointers and guidance that might help.  I was on abilify for six years and regret it completely.	Honestly, Abilify works wonders for some people and for many others I can make matters worse.  I have a strong desire to help others so they hopefully don't have to go through what I went through to get to a state of well being.  Everything is anonymous!!  E-mail me if you would like some help with your situation.  Especially if you feel like you are just stuck.	M	23	6  years	6/7/2009Email

4	Bipolar II	Love this medication.  I finally feel like me again and can handle things.  However, I am EXTREMELY hungry.  Does this go away?  Also experiencing severe muscle aching.  I don't want to go off the Abilify, but can't take the hunger pain.		F	43	4  days	5/30/2009Email
4	Major depression w/ psychosis	Something similar to restless leg syndrome, fidgeting	I've now been diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features along with some other things.  Abilify was prescribed to me because my initial diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder. The two disorders are somewhat similar.  Abilify has more or less completely eliminated my psychotic symptoms and I do well on this medication.  I have not experienced any negative side effects in the past 2 years.  For the first 6 months I had restless legs and some fidgeting problems where it was hard to sit still.  Those symptoms passed and I feel pretty much fine at this point.  I also take Effexor XR, Lamictal and Librium.	F	31	2.5  years	5/29/2009
4	Depression & Paranoia	I've been taking 2 mg Abilify for 2 weeks now, along with my usual 40 mg Prozac and 900 mg Lithium. I feel like I'm on speed or something with abilify! I have no appetite (a good thing-could lose a few lbs), I feel restless, but I feel like I see things differently now. I also have a "full" sensation in my head and a little shakiness. I'm scared, because I keep reading all these bad things about Abilify, but I feel soooo much more alert & interactive now. If only the restlessness would go away, this is a miracle med for me. How long until these side effects taper off?		F	28	14  days	5/28/2009
3	Bipolar Disorder (rapid cycling)	Weight gain (about 20-30 pounds in a six months...without changing eating habits), extreme tiredness, lethargy, shaking/tremors, increased levels of insulin (blood sugar).	It helped my manic episodes and leveled out my mood. However, I don't feel it was worth the weight gain and increased blood sugar levels, which contributed to reoccurring, prolonged (and quite painful) yeast infections.	F	20	6  months	5/23/2009
1	bi polar	This was the worst medicine ever. I tried it for 6 weeks, starting at 2mg, and by the end of the time taking 15mg. My body would not stop moving. I couldnt read a book or watch TV. I found myself taking too many sleeping pills (and i never take sleeping pills) to counteract the movement so that i could fall asleep. This medicine should be used as a torture technique!!. The the doctor gave me sleep meds, and blood pressure medication to help with the Abilify side effects.(the blood pressure meds were supposed to make me stop moving...) So she had me on three medications! (NOt to mention this medicine is extremely overpriced!) You couldn'tpay me to take this medicine again. I am on Lamictal 25mg (a very low dose) and its a miracle. I bet this medicine will be pulled soon. It was just like a poison! Be very careful trying this medication.		M	39	6  weeks	5/19/2009
2	depression and ptsd	inner restlessness and desire to drink or eat	i took this for about two monts along with wellbutrin and at first had a hard time staying awake during the day.  after that passed i began wanting to drink so badly it was driving me nuts.  i began to drink to control the restlessness i felt because i was climbing the walls in my house just trying to get away from myself.  i quit taking it a week again and with just the wellbutrin i feel much better.	F	29	7  weeks	5/18/2009
5	Depression	Feeling a little "speedy" mentally, waking up early (4am), weight gain (about 10-15lbs) in 2mos.  Sometimes I feel overtired and not able to sleep enough to catch up.	I was depressed and Cymbalta was not helping---I could not motivate myself to do anything, even just taking a shower was hard.  Went back to Effexor XR (150mg) which had helped before with 5mg of Abilify and I could almost immediately feel the difference.  Wish I felt a little more energy physically, but I do feel a lot better.	F	48	2  months	5/16/2009
3	psychosis/spirit possession	weight gain, perhaps constipation, perhaps insomnia	I've been taking Abilify for 3 years and liked it the most of all the anti-psychotics I tried. Resperidol made me gain a lot of weight quickly. And Haldol was abominabal - I ate constanly and got ridid muscles, but that was also from all the anti-psychotics I tried. The key for me was finding the right DOSAGE, which was much lower than my doctor put me on originally. 5mg Abilify was just right, but I've been gaining more and more weight over the years and want to go off it due to this serious problem. It did however, protect me from the spirit invasion or what others call "voices" or "hallucinations". The risk of psychosis is one problem by going off of it, but so is diabetes and obesity, as well as other side effects from staying on it. I have weighed the consequences and made my choice. I will add that I'm perturbed with my doctor for not monitoring my weight while I've been on this drug. I think he doesn't want to see that it causes obesity.	F	46	3  years	5/13/2009Email
5	Bipolar Disorder	None that I know of	It has saved my life.	F	42	2  years	5/12/2009
4	Schizofrenia/Severe Anxiety Mix	Extreme dizziness & Muscle Tremors.	It works well, don't get me wrong. I switched from Invega. I'm on only 10mg and will probably switch to 25mg by next fill up. Totally helps with the anxiety and works well as an antidepressant. I've been able to focus more, but i'm also on Vyvanse for ADHD. I've had no suicidal thoughts what-so-ever. 10mg is a bit low, in my opinion anyway. Also, if you take any anti-psychotics, through my experience, for a month straight, the side effects generally seem to wear a bit off.	M	15	1  weeks	5/8/2009
1	Depresstion	Facial tics - blinking, tongue thrusts to the point where I had sores in my mouth, muscle stiffness, joint pain.  Uncontrollable muscle movements, twitching, jerking. Fatigue.	This medication was the worst thing that I ever took.  I had "parkinson syndrome" from it.  The facial tics & tongue thrusts lasted over a year.  I had to take Vitamin E for the past 18 months to get rid of them.  I still have blinking tics.  My daughter's doctor wanted her to try it(in small doses) but I refused. This was a horrible experience for me.	F	44	6  months	5/8/2009Email
4	bi-polar depression	Week 1: very slight weight gain -- about 2 lbs. that seems to have leveled off; a few days of extreme fatigue. Overall: slightly irritated stomach (I believe this makes me eat more, and is responsible for the weight gain), lighter sleeping, more sleep disturbances. I used to sleep like a log. Now I sleep like a cat. I miss my old sleep.	I was on abilify once before. The doc took me off due to my "speedy" response. But I have ADD, and I really liked the abilify. New doc is a-ok with my response, so long as it works for me. I'm also on Adderall and Welbutrin. Since starting this drug, I actually feel like doing things rather than just thinking about doing them and then thinking that I'll never finish and then getting depressed and hating myself. I'm more social. Self esteem is better too. Disruptive and ruminative thoughts are way down. Overall, I like.	F	33	16  days	5/7/2009
5	Bipolar 2	Initially stiffness and emotionless face, subsided within weeks.	This drug is a God-send to my 9 year old without it he would likely be in the hospital.  Almost totally normal with it.	M		15  months	5/6/2009
1	depression	facial tics where my left side of my face moved with my inability to stop it, my legs felt like they were filled with lead and I didnt want to work out anymore, my feet tingled and my toes hurt this was the creepiest drug I have ever taken	I felt happy but the side effects were so horrible it wasnt worth being happy (and that says a lot) I'm on wellbutrin and pristiq and this medication was a nightmare. My psych really pushed for me to take it and I had to really stand up for myself to say no. Dont let the commercial fool you and keep trying other drugs cuz abilify is poison	F		2  months	5/6/2009
3	anxiety, bi polar, chest pain	i can barely do anything...i just want to sleep until it hurts.  while sleeping i feel as if i am on a trampoline, i just toss and turn and bounce.  today(day 4) i feel jittery.	i was put on abilify because i was having panic attacks and feeling as if i was having heart attacks.  tight chest and trouble breathing, er visits.  doc thinks its in my mind and that im bipolar.  i cant believe that chest pain so severs is mental.  i havent had a bad attack yet but i feel as if i will collapse, i hope this tired dead-battery feeling goes away or i cant take it, i have a 2 month old.

4	Bipolar Disorder	weight gain, inner restlessness.	I've been on lamictal, seroquel, and geodon since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder two months ago.  Each of those medicines gave me horrible side effects.  Abilify is the only medicine that has helped.  I am calmer, do not have my angry and irritable outbursts.  I'm also a self-injurer and haven't done anything since a couple days being on this medicine.  The downfall, I've been on this medicine for 2 weeks and I've gained 12lbs.	F	23	2  weeks	5/3/2009
2	Bipolar 2	Insomnia, wide awake every hour or two; impulsivity, shopping, eating, speaking; 15lb weight gain in 1 month; became nearly inarticulate, could not convey my thoughts or feelings very well at all; hypomania	I took Ability for a month as an adjunct Zoloft 100mg, which has stopped working.  In term of relief from the depression, the Ability worked wonderfully.  Because of the side effects, I dropped from my initial dose of 5mg to 2mg, and the depressive symptoms/suicidality returned nearly immediately.  After bumping back up to 4-4.5mg, the side effects returned.  This med may be tolerable for others but the side effects were intolerable for me.	F	36	1  months	5/2/2009
5	Bi Polar Disorder, Psychosis	Weight Gain (15 lbs in 6 months)	My daughter is doing EXTREMELY well on Abilify. Her rapid cycling is nearly zero. Her psychosis is also tremendously better. The change is almost as if she is a different kid. She went from extreme  mania episodes that cycled at times within minutes. To near stable in her moods in just days after beginning this medication. Her doctor wants to change her to Geodon due to the weight gain. Weight was never an issue for her until she started taking Abilify. But I think with the improvement in her mental stability a little weight gain is not that significant. I love this medication. She was on 5mg per day up to 7.5 per day after 2 months. It's effectiveness wore off at about 2 months in. No problems since upped to 7.5mg a day. She has no trouble sleeping. I didnt realize how her mania was affecting her sleep until starting this medicine and she is actually tired when it's time for bed. No complaints from me.	F	7	6  months	4/26/2009Email
2	Bipolar	Severe akathesia!  The restlessness drove me up a wall.  I also experienced word loss, short-term memory loss, stiff muscles and joints, tremors in my left hand (I'm left-handed), raised body temperature, weight gain (15 pounds in 4 months), no sex drive, increased breast size with milk coming out of them, fatigue during the day and sleeplessness at night. I took Abilify before I want to bed.  I have tried almost every dose: 30mg, 20mg, 10mg, 5mg and 2mg.  At 5mg and above I experienced euphoria that made me feel like I could probably jump off of a building for fun and be o.k.  At doses below 5mg I still experienced all of the side effects (except for the euphoria)and became extremely irritable and hostile, but otherwise I had no emotions.	To be fair, my paranoia went away. This was the only medication I was taking.	F	45	4  years	4/23/2009
2	Bipolar Disorder	Brain fog, Stiff muscles, inability to ever sit still or relax,	Abilify caused me to not be able to relax my muscles and I was always uncomfortable.  I had a hard time sleeping at night.  Wasn't what I expected. I had to go off of it becuase my grades in school started to drop.	F	23	2  weeks	4/17/2009
5	Mixed bipolar		I have been on Abilify for 2 years with no side effects. It has stabalized my mood along with Tegretal and Pristiq. While my antidepressant often stops working or has to be adjusted in the dose, the Abilify 10 mg has worked for me. I take all my meds at bedtime and sleep well, have no appetite increase or weight gain(terrible wt. gain on Depakote that I have since  lost), no nausea, dizziness, or vivid dreams. For me it's a life saver and I'm able to continue to work at a high functioning capacity.	F	60	2  years	4/16/2009
4	Suicidal thoughts	My mouth is dry and i've noticed i'm not hungry but my muscles ached terribly for the first two weeks.	I'm glad I didn't listen to the scary potential side effects. On abilify I feel even but I still feel emotions only I dont think about how much I hate myself anymore. I'm surprised at how this has worked so far.	F	35	2  months	4/16/2009
3	depression, over fatigue & stress	at first my husband take zyprexa but his doctor changed it to abilify due to gaining his weight. after a week i notice that my husband became restless and move or walk like a robot, though he can sleep he always tell me that he tired very easy as well his muscles. his craving more than before so his cholesterol became higher. so i decided to stop taking abilify and i noticed that my husband movement became normal.

3	Bipolar ##, PMDD	rash on my face, feet and toes swelled, headaches, bruises, my whole body was sensitve to touch and ached all over	started at 5 mg and went to 15mg. Helped with my moods	F	12	30  days	4/12/2009
5	mind racing, bi polar	none	completely made me a different person, I felt normal after 20 years of struggling with depression and paranoia. I also use this with celexa which works for me too	M	37	1  months	4/7/2009
3	Resistant Depression/Anxiety	15 lbs weight gain.  Restlessness.  Chronic insomnia.  Night binging (and subsequent purging to curb weight gain).	Ironically, this drug (5 mg to 2 mg with 150 mg of Wellbutrin XR and 20 mg of Adderral XR) helped my self-confidence in social situations by minimizing my anxiety and shutting off my self-critic -- despite shattering my self-image (as a result of relentless weight gain).  At my best, I didn't care.  I shopped nonstop -- because I was constantly gaining weight (in reality) and my clothes no longer fit me.  In my case, my doctor did not listen to my threshold for weight gain.  In two years, I gained 20 lbs with various antidepressants.  Desperate to gain some resemblance of myself back, I began purging.  In the eight months that I have been (on/off) the Abilify, I have vacillated from hypomanic (on) to hopelessly depressed (off).  In fact, the spiraling phase upon quitting the drug (without compliance) has translated to increased anxiety (and dependence on Xanax) and debilitating depression. I do not recommend this drug to young women whose self-image is inextricably related to their appearance in anyway.	F	33	8  months	4/1/2009
3	Depression	Speedy manic feeling, shakiness, feeling like I couldn't sit still, a little nausea in the beginning, craving for sweets at night, WEIGHT GAIN.	I was already taking Prozac for depression but still having depression symptoms, so the Dr. prescribed Abilify to supplement the Prozac. In the beginning, this medicine really helped to pull me out of the funk that I was in.  I felt energized, productive, and like my overall attitude was very much improved.  After a couple or 3 weeks, however, I noticed that I was gaining weight at an alarming rate.  In the 2 months that I took this drug, (at a low dose of 1mg/day) I gained over 15 lbs!  I also felt strangely like shopping and spending money all of the time, almost like I was having a manic episode. All in all, I felt much less depressed, but stopped taking for fear of becoming REALLY overweight. Note: after I stopped this drug, I felt more depressed than ever and almost suicidal.  If you stop, you should probably taper off gradually!	F	45	2  months	3/29/2009Email
5	pediatric anxiety/possible bipolar	nausea & headache for the first few days. Also, tired during the day for 1st week. otherwise, none.	This medication has worked wonderfully for my daughter. She has been on it 3 weeks and for the first time in her life I heard she had a "wonderful" week at school. The side effects are most definately tolerable and my daughter says this medication changed her life. Parents-don't be afraid to try it. I know everything on this site sounds bad, but it has been a Godsend to my family.	F	8	3  weeks	3/20/2009
3	Post Tramatic Syndrome & OCD	I wake up several times in the night and am not able to go back to sleep usually for an hour or so.  I have never had this problem in the past.  I have also been very restless and am not able to stay focused on one task for two long.  I have to be doing something that is keeping me very busy.  I have also noticed increased anxiety with this medication.		M	36	1  months	3/15/2009
2	adjunct to depression therapy	I am incredibly sleepy. I can not function in this state.		F	23	2  days	3/12/2009
4	psychotic episode	filling a little dizzy the first day	after 2 years from  my first episode I had to change from solian to abilify due to sides effects(waight gain ).So far it helps me	F	40	6  days	3/5/2009
5	manic/psychotic episode	restlessness at first, waking up several times in night	Switched to it from risperidone, 4 months after a manic/psychotic episode. I was depressed on the risperidone but depression lifted on aripiprazole (an antidepressant was also added). Didn't have the demotivation and lethargy I experienced on risperidone.	M	24	9  months	2/24/2009
3	autism  bipolar	painful erection of penis	My 6 year old son never had a problem with erections until taking Abilify.  Then it happened all the time and was very painful.  The doctors would not believe me that this was happening - even though it is rare side effect.  His behaviour settled down on the abilify; but we have not seen an increase in bad behaviour since taking him off the med.	M	6	3  months	2/21/2009
1	Bi-Polar	Could not sit still.  Felt confused.  When I say I couldn't sit still I mean it.  This drug had me jittery, and it was the worst feeling I have ever had in my life.  Sit down to watch TV, standing up thirty seconds later.  To come off the drug was worse then the side effects of the drug while taking it.	Be very careful of this drug, it is very powerful, and it takes a good month to get it out of your system.	M	38	4  months	2/21/2009
1	Depression	I went from being moderately depressed, to feeling suicidalwithin 2 weeks. Acute anxiety and paranoia followed.	This is a very dangerous drug.	F	41	16  days	2/20/2009
4	Depression	Insomnia	I started taking this b/c my regular depression just wasn't doing the job. Now I take 2mg of abilify and 150mg of Effexor XR and I haven't felt this good in months. Absolutely no side effects from the abilify except difficulty staying asleep during the night. That's why I gave it a 4. It did exactly what it was supposed to do! Thank goodness!!!!	F	31	20  days	2/13/2009
4	Bipolar and Schizophrenia	None that I can directly attribute to Abilify	I have been taking Abilify for over 2 years now. As a result, I can no longer remember what it felt like to not be on it or what it actually does for me when I take it. It is just another drug that I pop twice a day. 15mg twice a day for a total of 30mg. I do know that my hallucinations are very minimal from what they used to be. But I still hear voices and see things on occasion that are very disturbing.	M	36	2  years	2/5/2009
1	depression	weight gain	I gained 35lbs in 6 months... it helped with my mood swings but when my psych told me it was why I was gaining weight, I went off it.... i hate it =( Now I'm left almost 40lbs overweight	F	22	6  months	2/5/2009
3	depression	weight gain = 60 lbs in 1 yr, craving sweets, developed pre-diabetic condition, BANKRUPTED ME AS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE	I've suffered with intractable depression for decades and have been on just about every medication ever made.  After years of working with an extremely competent, caring psychiatrist, he placed me on a 2 drug combination of 60mg/daily of Cymbalta and 15 mg/every other day of Abilify and, for the first time in a very long time, I do not experience the terrible lows which with I previously struggled.  Now, if I could just lose the weight I gained.....I'd feel much, much better.  Please do not construe this medication combination as a CURE.  I AM better; BUT, I still struggle with depression...just not as often.	F	50	4  years	2/3/2009
5	Depression	No perceptable side effects. This medicine stabelized me and provided some lift. I am taking it along with anafrinil and cymbalta.		M	46	2  weeks	2/1/2009
5	depression/bipolar	weight gain	I gained some weight and told doc, he took me off and put me on Lamictal which just made me very cranky, angry, hated everyone. ( I took lamictal for 4 weeks then when off of it). Am now back on abilify and much better	F	38	2  weeks	2/1/2009Email
1	bi polar-anxiety	my side effects were jaw discomfert, ticks all over body mostly face,worse anxiety,worse depression,loss of vision,head aches,mixed thinking,suicidal thoughts,loss sence of reality,and first six months in this med only slept 30 mins a night,and the first two months on this med i went from a weight of 250 to 180 and rarly ate anything.	when i was 8yrs old i was diagnost with bi polar and by age 18  i was put on this med  by my old doctor who misdiagnost me with bi polar and after my 21st birthday i got a second opinion of my illness and they told me that i have an anxiety disorder and ptsd i have now been of this med for around 5 months and most of the side effects have worsend but my mental state has been entirely diffrent i feel like my self again and im accualy in a great place	M	21	3  years	1/30/2009
1	Aspergers, depression, anxiety	My 10-year old son was put on abilify to quell his anxiety and depression.  He has gained over 40# in 3-months, he beats his head, calls himself stupid and begs to go to God where the pain will be gone.  We are in the process of weening him off this drug for good.	Scary...We were told it did not promote weight gain in children..yet our son gained 40#.  Did nothing about his depression and anxiety and actually made him more manic and out of sorts...Did not work for our child.	M	10	4  months	1/30/2009Email
4	Bipolar II	Mild insomnia	Despite the insomnia, this drug has given me more energy and helped with both depression and anxiety.	M	40	1  months	1/28/2009
1	Bipolar	After two days on this stuff, I've got a terrible headache that won't quit and I feel like I need to vomit.	I'll give it a few more days until I see my doctor next week, but I'm not sure if this is worth it.  Hopefully the side effects wear off.	F	39	2  days	1/26/2009
1	Bipolar II, insomnia	This is one of the worst medications I have ever taken.  I took 1 2.5 mg tab and started experiencing extreme anxiety and insomnia.  This developed into a hypomanic state and I have been lucky to get 3 hours of sleep a day.  I had to start taking Seroquel (which I also hate because it leaves me hung over) and I was able to sleep 6 hours.  Now, I have to take Seroquel to get any sort of sleep.  Also, benzos did not counteract any of my anxiety.		F	34	2  days	1/21/2009
4	head banging	slight weight gain (now taking 1 mg per day with 25 mg Zoloft)When on 10 mg (in error)had severe muscle stiffness and zombie effect.	This has helped enormously-feel less anxiety, more cheerful and outgoing, can speak more slowly and clearly-and head banging only once mildly in 9 months (full moon). I have developmental disabilities and, probably, autism.	F	63	9  months	1/18/2009
3	Severe Depression	Last year, I was started on 2mg and was very irritable...my doctor increased me to 4mg a day and the irritable feelings went away.  However I have gained 50 lbs in one year.	Abilify in conjunction with fluexotine has helped my depression.  However the weight gain is very discouraging...I am trying to lose the weight but it is very hard to on this medicine.	F	23	1  years	1/18/2009
1	halucinations, anxiety	My 10 year old daughter has been on abillify for a year and she had gained weight.  Also, her inner cheeks were sore as if she had began to bite them (unknowingly).  She complains of stomach aches sometimes.  Lately her cheeks, chin, and lips have swollen as a result, I am weening her off.  I am looking for a natural alternative with minimum side effects because my daughter asked me why must she keep suffering.		F	10	370  days	1/16/2009Email
4	Depression	Restlessness, can't sleep very well	I'm taking Cymbalta and Wellbutrin and still was in a fog or in low gear all the time.  My psy thought Abilify would be a good catalyst for the two and it has worked great.  No more fog, I want to do more and wake up getting going.  The only issue is waking up too early; sometimes 3 and 4 am.	M	50	30  days	1/15/2009

				F M	 	 	    
1	bipolar 2 -- hypomania	For the first 5 days I was incredibly organized and productive but this soon flipped (like taking amphetamines, really) into panic and confusion. By three days into the second week (with dosage doubled) I felt like I was crawling out of my own skin, could no longer think clearly, and was very confused and full of anger and frustration towards others, even though rationally I was aware that it was me, and not them, with the problem. I believe one has to take medication for a month or so for one's body to adjust and for side effects to fade, but after ten days I had to stop because I was so agitated and confused. I soon returned to my old self. A horrible experience, really.	Like taking amphetamines, with quick flip from productivity to confusion and anxiety.	F	54	10  days	1/14/2009
4	Bipolar	First two days I was very irritated and quite edgy.  However, I am starting to get used to it and it seems to be working great.  Tried lithiam, depakote which worked great except for the terrible hair loss, so hoping this will stop the loss		F	44	7  days	1/11/2009
1		this is for those who have experienced the horrifying effects of abilify. abilify ruined my life for quite sometime. the worst of my symptoms came on after a month of taking it (extreme anxiety, racing thoughts, nervousness, obsessing)  and then when i came off of it the withdrawals were horrifying (suicidal and homicidal ideations, profound thoughts of suicide, pacing, nervousness, almost psychosis). drug management has never had any negative side effects for me. infact medications had been quite a sense of relief for my diagnosis.  abilify worked oppositely as it is supposed to for me.  i warn all of you to always be of understanding about the side effects medications you are taking. if i would have educated my self on the side effects i might not have been in the horrifying mess that i was in.....and i am still dealing with the grief of the aftermath.	read,read, read and understand the side effects of being on and coming off this medicine.	F	35	31  days	1/8/2009
4	Minor depression, anxiety, and ADHD	Minor akathisia the first day. This subsided with clonazepam. Main side-effects are drowsiness, nausea, mild muscle weakness. Basically flu-like symptoms. For nausea, TRY GINGER PILLS!! Works perfect!	Feel less of a mental fog. Less depressed. A tiny bit more anxious, but wasn't expecting it to do much for anxiety. I have clonazepam for that. ADHD improved in only 3 days for sure. I realize 4 days is not enough time to gauge effects. I'll try to update later when I've been on it for longer.	M	34	4  days	1/5/2009Email
1	Bipolar	Nervousness, legs have to move all the time like RLS, glasses feel weird on my face take on and off and bother my nose never did before, agiatated, sleeplessness and tired and sleepy all day.	I stopped taking Abilify after a month as I would rather be sane and feel normal than live like this.  Wife noticed anger and agitation were heightened and sleep interupted every hour to hour and a half. Woke up at 3-4 AM every day and could not fall back asleep. Need to try something different as can't take these side affects as worse than the symptoms for me.	M	47	1  days	1/4/2009
5	schizoaffective, deppressed	Some restlessness and anxiety	I've found Abilify to be a great maintenance drug, helping to reduce or eliminate paranoia, inner chatter/voices, intrusive images and visions.	F	33	1  years	12/30/2008Email
1	Bi-Polar I w/psychosis	Feeling of unease, legs had to move constantly,could not sleep. sick to my stomach. Just felt horrible, drained all day. Also woke up in unusual places.	I tried this "NEW" medicine for my Bi-Polar w/psychosis. Just horrible.	F	41	3  weeks	12/30/2008Email
4	bipolar	35 pounds of wieght gain, some sleepiness	I like being on abilify.  It helps me a lot with my rapid mood swings.  THey are almost non existent now with the exception of slight depression from time to time.  WHen I try to go off it, I either swing high or really really low.  With out abilify, my depressions are debilitating and i cry at the drop of a hat. It really helps me maintain a normal functional life.  Its when I don't take my meds that I have a problem.

4	Schizoaffective, BPD	Tardive Dyskinesia - severe twitching of both eyes, weight gain	It has really helped me function, giving me the ability to hold a job.  Unfortunately, I've only had a job 7 months at longest, but at least I can work.  Bad part is, the severe eye twitching.  I stopped taking it for 2 months and I relapsed.  I did accupuncture to treat the twitching and it went away, but I had to go back on Abilify to treat my mental illness.  I'll just have to live with the twitching.  God help me.	F	34	1.5  years	12/27/2008
1	depression	Stomach ache, extreme nausea, exhaustion, dizzy, irritable	I don't like this drug. Added it to limictal. Limictal gave me stomach ache this drug added the nausea etc... Taking 10mg. Been on it 3 days.  I'm too sick to care about being depressed.  Getting off it now!	F	44	3  days	12/25/2008
2	depression	There was exteme restlessness for a while.  The drug did nothing to decrease my depression.  Then, I kept getting super stiff, very uncomfortable muscles.  I kept telling my doctor, but he kept telling me that stiff or rigid muscles were not a possible side effect of the drug.  I quit taking it and have sinse read that stiff muscles may be a side effect and may be part of a potentially life threatening condition.  I stopped taking it two years ago and it may be that the medical community was not aware of the stiff muscle side effect then.	If you have any bad side effects from this drug and your doctor tells you the side effect is not on the list of side effects associated with this drug, it may be that the medical community is not yet aware of the side effect.  Find a doctor who will listen to you.  It seems that drugs like Abilify get prescribed before anyone really knows how well or poorly they will affect humans.  I am worried about the long term problems I may be vulnerable to after having taken this drug.	F	36	180  days	12/22/2008

5	bipolar management/anxiety	slight weight gain, active dream cycle	This is a great pill. I am calm, think more clearly, and any "hot temper" I had is gone. I gained a few pounds, but will adjust my diet, no biggie.	F	33	3  months	12/8/2008
4	PTSD (complex)	Exercise regularly? Be careful. I thought I was just tired but muscle weakness was the issue and I hurt myself trying to do my usual routine. Also, extreme drowsiness at first but it went away (reduced bendaryl as well). First few days were difficult but to my suprise it got a lot better. First few days: no "zest for life", drowsy, salivation (lots).	Really helped me function. My concentration at work was poor, and I was constantly being triggered. Also, many compulsions toward self-harm. All these disappeared or became manageable. I hope this will be short term but it's good to know I can use this med if necessary.	F	47	7  days	12/8/2008
4	Depression with psychosis	insomnia	no weight gain, better affect, better ability to speek,  take 20 mg	M	19	1  years	12/5/2008
2	GAD	extreme tiredness during the day, sleeplessness at night  5 mg at night.	I think it helped with anxiety, however, it made me so tired.  I didn't want to go to work each day because I was so tired.  The day dragged by and would wake up each day at 5 am.  Seemed like the tiredness took away the anxiety	M	31	2  weeks	12/5/2008
1	Anxiety	Extreme akathisia, severe restlessness. I became extremely restless and couldn't sit still, sleep, lay done or stop moving. It was scary. I kept moving and couldn't sit still and I felt all jittery. The akathisia was scary and it lasted the entire time. I got off this drug after a couple days of akathisia and even when I went off it, the akathisia stayed for weeks and it eventually died down. I was only in high school when I experienced the akathisia and had to miss a lot of school.	Akathisia, severe itnernal restlessness on this drug is very severe and it's a scary, terrifying feeling.	F		 	11/27/2008
5	panic, anxiety and rage attacks	I went on a course of Zyprexa before but it made me gain 10 kg. I switched to Abilify and it keeps me balanced without having my mood all over the place. no more panic attacks. the downside is that I cannot miss one dose or else I go on harsh cold turkey and have rampant anxiety.

4	BiPolar some Psycho.	Mimics Parkinson's Disease. Endless shaking on my right side, something is wrong with my "gait", balance very poor...Seeing a neurologist tomorrow.

1	For Mother	rapid deterioration in her brain!! Took my mother in to Crises Center begining of October, they put her on Abilify I immedietly noticed her symptoms worsening and despite my repeated attempts and concerns to dr's, nurses and social workers she was released. Took her to another hospital for tests 2 weeks after discharge. She was fine. 2 weeks later took her back to crises center only to find out this..She has had constant restlessness, halucinations, paranoid thoughts, mania, depression and many other mood swings and symtoms.

5	bipolar	loss of appetite. only need about 7 or 8 hrs of sleep but still feel well rested and have plenty of energy.	i love this med!! was on geodon and had TERRIBLE reaction. was immediately taken off and put on 10 mg of abilify. i feel great...don't even feel like i'm on medication and for the 1st time in years i feel like the old me =)	F	27	2  weeks	11/6/2008
2	Bipolar, rapid cycling, mixed state	Loss of fine motor control due to shaking, especially hands, also some hair loss	I am very sensitive to medication, especially anti-psychotics, and can only tolerate small amounts; but I need them to level out my mood swings and break escalating episodes. Abilify did not work for me. The side effects have NOT gone away in the 6 months since I have stopped taking it. As an artist it's a real problem to be unable to draw a line that isn't wibbly.	F	47	30  days	10/31/2008
5	pediatric bipolar	tired at night, and sometimes upset stomach.  That's it!	Cost is huge, even with insurance. It is SO worth it b/c it has made 90% of our daughters symptoms go away. She is able to function normally; she has lots of friends, plays sports and aside from  a little irritability at night; she is a typical 9 year old.	F	9	2  months	10/29/2008
2	bipolar depression	inner restless, urge to move, couldn't sit still even to read	I think this med could have helped had I not been so restless.  It also made me want to eat and smoke ALL the time to quell the restlessness.	F	35	5  days	10/27/2008Email
4	psychosis/ocd	inner restlessness, tremors	This medicine did wonders for my voices and delusions but the side effects (tremors, inner restlessness) were too much to handle and I stopped taking this med and now I'm taking seroquel.	M	19	2  months	10/21/2008
3	Bi-polar and anxiety	Tiredness, food cravings, WEIGHT GAIN whenever the dose is increased.	I started on 5mg now I am on 30mg due to this medication not having an positive effect on my bi-polar and anxiety levels.	F	16	4  years	10/21/2008
1	Depression/anxiety	Significant restlessness (akathasia). It is a horrible feeling. So I stopped taking it.		M	32	8  days	10/18/2008
1	Bipolar II/ Mood disorder	Extreme Akathisia! it was horrible! jittery all the time, I couldnt sit still, I had to move constantly, shaking all over and I couldnt sleep at all. It is the worst thing I have ever experienced! Plus I gained 5lbs in 1 week! Crying all the time, I bawled like a baby watching the Price is Right yesterday, bc a man won a car! Crazy!! This stuff is awful!	Its been 2 days since I quit taking it, and I am still shaky and unable to sleep. Yesterday I had to take 2 valiums, 1 and a half restoril, and 100mg of benadyl(recommend by my doc.) to try to calm me down and I was still in high gear. And after all those meds. to calm me down I was still hypomanic/ very hyper. I felt like I could have ran a marathon! I would def. not recommed trying Abilify, unless you want to feel like your going crazy....	F	22	6  days	10/18/2008Email
5	Bipolar disorder	Heightened libido, and that's all. I'm on 5mg qd.	Abilify has a half life of 3 days and so tends to build up in the system, and so pdocs inadvertently rx it at too high a dose. At too high a dose, it causes agitation, extreme restlessness, anxiety, etc. This has led to a lot of people begging off of it w/o giving it a fair trail. This is the best bipolar med I've ever been on, and I've been at this now for 6 years. It's looking more and more like I'm cured. I take 5mg coupled w/ 3mg of Invega and 100mg of Desipramine. I am happy, productive and participate fully in life.	M	70	3  months	10/16/2008Email
2	Bipolar	Great at first, little sleepy, had some headaches but got used to it. Was only taking 2mg, moved up to 5mg and came down with a rash all over my arms and legs. Friends said my face looked puffy. Stopped taking it, rash went away within a week, started it up on 2mg again and my eye's swelled shut. I also retained water on this med, gained 7 pounds over a month	Loved how this drug made me feel at 2mg but the rash and puffiness just wasn't worth the trouble	F	30	30  days	10/15/2008Email
3	depression	No side effects for the first 10 weeks. Around the 10th week I experienced two side effects that appeared almost simultaneously. The first side effect involved swelling of my parotid gland. This is a salivary gland that is located just in front of your ear and near the upper jaw. The day after I noticed this side effect, I began to experience acne-like clusters on my forehead and scalp. I'm usually pimple free, so the abilify seemed to be the likely cause.	Due to the side effects mentioned, I discontinued use. This was disappointing because the medication did seem to lessen my depression and it helped me increase energy and concentration.	F	47	10  weeks	10/14/2008
2	Compulsive Skin Picking	Severe facial acne, clumsiness, muscle weakness, severe fatigue	Due to this medication for the first time in 10 years I was able to stop my skin picking.  Then two months into the regime severe acne broke out on my face.  7 months later and I'm still dealing with it.  The side affects aside I did have some unexpected results that I really liked.  Although I wasn't taking the medication for my ADHD I found while on the medication I was extremely punctual and capable of tearing myself away from something I was focusing intensly on.  I've been off the medication for several months now and have gone back to being chronically late and having periods of hyperfocus where I can't do anything else but the task in front of me.  I wouldn't take it again, but some of the results were very impressive.	F	24	3  months	10/11/2008
3	Bipolar Type I	Loss of appetite, weight loss, dizziness, tiredness, difficulty with some motor and cognitive skills.	I do love this drug because I've lost a ton of weight really quickly.  I don't know if it will stay this way, but I can only eat small portions, if I can eat at all.  Mind you, I'm not taking this medication in conjunction with anything else that would make me gain weight.  I realize I've had some bizarre side effects, but the loss of motor control and dizziness have started to go away.	F	25	45  days	10/7/2008
2	bipolar/schitzophrenia	restless, no appetite or sex drive, unable to focus or concentrate on anything, diarrhea.	Hate it and when I called doc about side effects she INCREASED dosage. Hope it wears off soon. My son says I look "zoned out." If this is supposed to help my manic episodes, I'd rather be manic. Up to 20 mg in 4 weeks. Ugh.	F	45	4  weeks	10/4/2008
2	Bipolar 1	My 72 year old mother was diagnosed with Bipolar 1...taking Abilify she is losing her ability to walk and sleep..she is currently on 5 mg...I want to ween her off..I don't like how combative she has become...		F	72	5  weeks	9/30/2008Email
5	bipolar	None that I am aware of.	This drug (and I am only on 5mg now) gave me my life.  I was completely unstable, foggy, rocking, in the black, sleeping depressive fragile anxious way, and then this drug came along and made everything all right.  With therapy, I have resumed a normal life, work full time, and am basically doing well.  Taking Abilify was the turning point.	F	33	6  years	9/27/2008
3	Bipolar I	Loss of appetite (the very thought of most foods made me sick), sleepy, kind of depressed, a little weepy.	I don't think I've been on it long enough.  I'm only on 5 mg, but I'm also on Klonopin and Lamictal, so it may be a mixture of the three that's causing this.  I was really surprised with the loss of appetite.  Normally, I get up in the morning and can't wait to eat breakfast.  Lately, I wake up and just want coffee before I realize that I'm bored and have nothing I want to do at all.	F	24	14  days	9/24/2008
3	Bipolar	extremem restlessness, nervousness, I couldn't sleep, would toss and turn. WHen I did sleep I woke up hour on the hour. I felt  blah about everything. Increased appetite.I gained 10 pounds in one money. Trembling and shaking hands.	I started out on 5mg and upped to 10 mg. in two weeks. I started feeling better but then the side effects became too much. I literally couldn't stay still, no position was comfortable whether it be standing, sitting or laying down. Even after taking an Ambien I still couldn't sleep. I finally did after taking a clonazepam and Ambien together.	F	30	5  weeks	9/24/2008
5	Schizophrenia, poor cognition	Really bad anxiety, homicidal thoughts. Some tics.	Really excellent medication, main reason I had to switch from Risperidone was my thinking was really messed up. But having switched to this my thinking is clear as, no problems on the schizophrenic side either.Fantastic medication.	M		6  months	9/13/2008
1	OCD	Extreme restlessness. I couldn't rest or sit still. My arms and legs were shaking constantly, my feet and toes kept shaking, it was terrifying and painful. I had to be out of school for a week because I was unable to sit still, I kept moving and my feet and arms and legs felt like they had to keep moving. I was so scared, I thought the pain wouldn't ever end. It took weeks after getting off it before the restlessness stopped. It was scary.	The most frightening pill ever. I could not stop moving or sit still or lay down or rest. Abilify made my arms and legs feel like they had to constantly be moving and it felt so uncomfortable sitting still or laying down, I felt constantly restless. It was extremely terrifying and I was young and hadn't known the side effects the pill would give me. I was so scared the restlessness and pain was going to last forever. I could not lay down or sit still, I had to be moving every second and I couldn't rest. It was awful. Scary stuff.			 	9/13/2008
3	Bi-Polar	Akathisia.  The worse feeling I have ever felt.  Just the definition alone will make you understand, but if not it felt as there were people inside of me, trying to push out of me.  All around my entire inside, all pushing with the same resistance at the same time.  I would of rather taken a bullet to the head than deal with that feeling ever again.	It was difficult to tell whether it helped with my mood since I cycle so frequently.  I was in a good mood while I was taking it.  The side effects didn't start till I was upped from 5/mg to 10.  After that I was on 10 for approx 3 days when it started.  Quit taking it and the side effects went away immediately.	M	30	3  weeks	9/4/2008
3	Stuttering	I have been taking Abilify 5mg for 4 weeks now and I am feeling fatigue and disconnected from life all day. Very little emotions and no sex drive. Sleeping ok but still just tired all day.	I was prescribed the dung as an experiment to treat stuttering or speech disorder I have. I have had a reduction is my stuttering but I am not sure if it worth the side effects. The feeling tired all the time is the hardest side effect for me. I might be put on Geodon instead.	M	27	4  weeks	9/3/2008Email
2	paranoia, depression, anxiety	went on 10mg after risperidone, made me gain weight and my prolactin rose to drastic levels. have been on for 3 months and feel horrible, paranoia worse, didnt have it on respiridone, twitchy, edgy, sleeping all the time, feel ill, vomiting, stomach problems, strange light headed feeling	am fed up with it and disappointed, initially switched as it is the only drug over here without supposed weight gain(u.k)am seeing doctor tomorrow with view of stopping.	F	26	4  months	8/31/2008Email
2	BI-POLAR/COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR	weight gain (size 10 to a 14 in 1-2 months) Constant hunger, Night sweats, emotionally detached, sadness, depression (over weight gain) No "zest for life"	I have quit "over-spending" & other compulsive behavior but never leave the house: (	F	30	2  months	8/31/2008
5	Bipolar	Extreme restlessness but take cogentin, now no problems.	I take 20mg and experienced extreme restlessness, however, my pdoc prescribed cogentin and I've not had any problems with restlessness since.  Abilify really helps my bipolar mania/depression.	F	46	6  months	8/25/2008
4	Depression	Interrupted sleep, weight gain at higher doses (which isn't coming off by lowering the dose), more energy, decreased sexual desire and ability	This drug has been great for me. I'm only on 5 mg to augment Effexor 225mg, but it gives me more energy and really helps elevate my mood. It's been a lifesaver. I had some weight gain and irritability at 7 and 10 mg, but none at 5. I just wish the weight would come off just by going down in dosage, but it's not. My only big complaint is the cost. Even with my (not so great) insurance its very very expensive, but I'm working with my Dr. to make it more affordable	F	22	4  months	8/22/2008
4	bi-polar	Nothing serious. A little light headed and "floaty" maybe, slightly nauseous. (after 2 weeks of 5mg dose)	Definitely agitated, not hyper, but a noticeable "high" feeling.	M	34	14  days	8/18/2008
1	Bipolar	I took ONE 2mg tablet- Pdoc assured me that I would have no side effects on such a miniscule dosage.NOT- I was so nauseous I had to seek anti-nausea meds from my primary doctor. My head pounded for 12 hours and tylenol nor advil would stop the pain.	Mood wise- I could feel a difference. I was very Calm. However the nausea and headache were enough to not ever take this again.	F	38	1  days	8/17/2008
2	Bipolar,ptsd,bordline psnality d/o	So dizzy! Feel like passing out whether sitting, standing, or walking. Also hearing things now and vision not right either. Yuck. However, i'm not crying anymore. Hmmm...	Also on Topamax, Wellbutrin, Lamictal(450mg), Ativan as PRN, and just tapered off Effexor 37.5 when I started the Abilify. Don't know what s/effect is from what anymore!! Hungry, tired, sore, anxious, poor judgement. Used to be on 10mg Abilify and couldn't sit still or concentrate on anything. Drank and smoked way too much! Once off of it, all negative behaviors stopped. 2 years later we decided to try a smaller dose (2mg) and things are different, but not good.	F	37	10  days	8/10/2008Email
5	Depression	Day 1 - Very sleepy, felt drugged. No serious side effects since the first day. A little bit of night-time waking, but not really insomnia. Sometimes I struggle a little bit in conversation. It seems that I occasionally take a little longer to find the right word when speaking.	My doctor suggested that we augment my Wellbutrin with a low dose of Abilify (2mg). After the first day I felt less sleepy & each day began to feel like a had more energy and desire to get up and do things. I'm taking the abilify in the morning now and not feeling drugged at all. Day 6 - 14, I've continued to feel less depressed and my energy seems to be returning.I've been on Wellbutrin 300mg for over 12 months with some stabilization of my mood, but my depression never really went away with just the Wellbutrin. The Abilify seems to be doing the trick.	F	47	14  days	8/8/2008
1	bipolar NOS	severe akathisia - extreme restlessness to the point of interfering with my life and sleep - this only on 10-15 mg. Went off the 10 mg cold turkey.  Will not take again.	It's hard to tell if it stabilized my mood or not.  I was told I have rapid cycling mixed episodes.  I won't take it anymore though because the akathisia (look it up on wikipedia) was like TORTURE.	F	34	20  days	8/8/2008
4	Depression AND Anxiety disorder	No Side effercts	Found it brilliant was on another type before this and it made me put up 3 stone. No side effects experienced from this and im in great humour.	F	24	1  years	8/7/2008
2	bipolar disorder? / schizophrenia?	EXHAUSTION - extreme hunger- dry patches on skin- unexplained bruising- thinning hair	I have been on this med for over 4 years, and have hated every minute of it. I can't move when i finally wake up after sleeping 12+ hours a night and have gained over 50 lbs.	F	21	4  years	8/7/2008Email
3	depression, ocd, panic disorder	Feel "blah", disconnected. Unable able to get restful sleep, like i am aware of everything around me.  I toss and turn all night long.  Slight dizziness, extreme hunger and thirst.	Within an hour of taking the first pill i felt like someone had shut of a switch in my brain and my thoughts just stopped racing, which was great!!  I am just so tired, I have always had vivid dreams and have had no trouble falling asleep, anywhere.  I'm not sure i like the way i feel. Maybe i'm just used to being on high alert all the time, but i feel so "just here".  My husband keeps telling me this will pass.  I had been on 40mg of prozac for 11yrs and was taken of cold turkey 2 weeks ago, that went very bad.  So now i am on 20 prozac and the abilify.  Just don't know if i can hang in there!!!

1	Dad (82)was taking it for dementia	This drug killed him! He threw up all night and next day,was unable to swallow,his dementia got much worse, and over a month long period he lost 40 pounds! The stupid doctor said he was psychotic but we found out later dementia can have a paranoid component. Dad was never bipolar! He went downhill and quit eating, etc., and finally died--night and day difference for the worse after the pill. We found out later this drug should not be used for people with dementia. Parade magazine has been ads sayi\ng don't use in the elderly and esp. those with dementia! Don't take this if you're older or have dementia.		M	82	1  days	7/21/2008Email
1	BiPolar - Mixed	Debilitating -- Exhaustion -- Fatigue -- NOT able to get out of bed.	This is the WORST drug I've ever been on -- and I've been on a lot.	F	58	1  weeks	7/21/2008
1	Depression	Just after thirty minutes of taking the drug (I took it in the morning), I literally fainted on my living room floor, and slept for six hours before waking up again. It made me feel like a zombie, dizzy, and it certainly didn't help me at all. The next day I took it, I saw spots all over, and I felt as if I was going blind. It scared me so much.	Never will I take this drug again.	F	15	2  days	7/18/2008
2	Depression	Restlessness, leg aches, foot pain, inability to "get comfortable," unable to concentrate on one task long enough to finish it, always hungry, skin breakouts, confusion (driving has become scary), light bothers my eyes, and my vision is blurry -- like there's a layer of gel on my eyes that I can't get off.  I keep moving things closer and closer to me so that I can see them.	I took 2 mg for two weeks and 5 mg for 1 week. I'm also taking Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, and Topamax -- all because I'm so depressed that I see no point in any aspect of living. Add in the Abilify side effects, especially the muscle pain, confusion, and vision problems, and I'd rather not live than continue taking that drug. Think I'll inquire w/ my doctor about Cytomel or Ritalin to augment the antidepressants.	F	37	3  weeks	7/15/2008

I COULDN'T FUNCTION AT ALL	F	36	3  months	7/8/2008
5	Bipolar II	Acne, occasional fatigue and leg cramps in the first couple of weeks, has since gone away - still have occasional pimples.	Love this medicine. It's the only Bipolar med that has helped me along with Topamax. I have tried almost every med out there and everything had so many side effects or just made me loopy or made me pass out all day. This combo has kept me stable with little to no side effects. I'm so thankful for Abilify.	F	29	1  years	7/6/2008Email
1	Yes	Tardive dyskinesis, weight gain, terrible mental health ( mental fog, slow thinking, poor coordination, excessive sleep)  not able to function to my full potential...just a walking zombie....like being in a vegetative state.	Presribed by doctor and forced to take by the doctor for her diagnosis for schizophrenia....the new doctor i saw after her expressed concerns about the previous docs diagnosis....for i never exhibited any of the symptoms except for depression...	F	26	3  years	6/28/2008
2	major depression and gen. anxiety	the first night i had a bit of nausea and kept waking up in the middle of the night, and then second night i also had nausea and i ended up passing out in the hallway.  it felt like there wasn't enough blood in my head, and then i collapsed and hit my head, and a few minutes later i threw up.	i can't say anything about its psychological benefits because i only took 2 small doses (2.5mg), and i stopped taking it due to the bad side effects.  mostly i'm terrified of taking new meds now, as i already had an intense fear of getting sick and was weary of side effects from anything.	F	17	2  days	6/21/2008
5	schizoaffective or biploar	none	This drug made many improvements in my day to day life.  I was constantly suicidal, hearing voices, and overall extremly depressed, etc... prior to starting this medication.  Now if I can find someone willing to hire a schizo, I'd be all set.	M	36	2  years	6/16/2008Email
4	depression	significant weight gain; impotence	abilify was especially helpful with motivation.  overall, depression was greatly reduced.  gradual weight gain and sexual dysfunction made me stop taking it, however.	M	47	1  years	6/13/2008

2	Bipolar - rapid cycling	jittery and sleepy all of the time.  Extremely irritable	I began taking this drug to help with my rapid cyclng.  Abilify only made my life more difficult due to the unability to sit still for more than 15 seconds.	F	35	3  years	6/6/2008
3	bipolar	Initially I was VERY restless and had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Eventually that wore off. Weight gain.	I'm on the fence as to I feel about it. The weight gain bothers me the most. It served its purpose at the time it was needed but now we are going to discontinue it.	F	37	1  years	5/27/2008Email
2	Depression	My Dr. added this Rx to my Effexor (150mg) and Wellbutrin (300mg) because I was still having problems with my depression.  I'm gaining weight (which I definitely don't need since I already have a weight problem), my knees are killing me, I feel very fatigued, I'm not sleeping all that great, and I can't seem to feel "good" anymore--not even for a day. I'm going to ask to be taken off of this drug.  I have never done this before and I've dealt with depression off and on for the past 10 years.  The side effects are just not worth it to me.		F	48	3  weeks	5/27/2008
2	PTSD - Anger Management Issues	Extreme Restlessness, Unable to concentrate/focus (this is a big problem for me as a go to school), Night Sweats, Weight Gain, Blurred Vision.	Abilify is supposedly the better substitute to Geodon according to my Doctor. However, I never felt anything different other than than my nausea went away. I always have this feeling of restlessness and the need to move every minute. It has also become difficult for me to study for school because I cannot focus my attention to my readings! My dreams have also become vivid and I wake up all sweaty. Since I started taking Abilify, I couldn't stop eating! I already gained 10lbs in the last 3 days. Definitely not worth it!

3	depression-CFS	constipation, I've gained 20 pounds.. but I took a vacation and I have been able to gain wieght easily in the past.	It seems to really numb me out. I take 15mg abilify-120mg cymbalta-90mg adderall + slepping pills. I think the abilify take the highs and lows out of the adderall. Bummer on the highs but good on the lows. I would rate it higher if I had more exerience with this drug	M	37	30  days	4/19/2008
5	PTSD; depression; rapid cycling	Some blurred vision; muscle stiffness and fatigue	I am extremely medication resistant and after trying virtually ever psych drug on the market with no success, Abilify has been a life saver.  It works for me on a low dose (4mg) and has improved and stabilized my moods and quality of sleep. A great drug if it works for you.  Try lowering dosage or starting on a really low dose if side effects are too much.	M	45	4  weeks	4/16/2008
3	OCD	extreme restlessness	this medciation is REALLY helping my ocd, but the restlessness is almost unbearable, especially since i have a desk job. i'm going to talk to my psych about maybe taking something to combat the side effect.	M	24	1  months	4/12/2008
4	Bipolar: depression, phycosis	night sweats, weight gain, bloating, restlessness, insomnia, hypo manic and a little grouchy	i have been on 10mg for about three weeks. at five mg the first week i felt great. i had been having psychotic thoughts and depression. now i am hypo manic which is much better than being depressed. i can't sleep well or sit still but i get my housework done. I have started having night sweats and insomnia on week 3. the psychotic thoughts have not totally been taken care of but i do not want to increase my dosage yet. it's hard to be around other people when i have these thoughts.

1	bipolar/depression	extreme restlessness, unable to concentrate, nausea, headache.	I was on 10mg and the only thing it helped was that I stopped getting mad... but the sideeffects were definetly not worth it!	F	22	10  days	4/4/2008Email
4	Bipolar, antisocial disorder	Not able to eat much, bowel movements inconsistant, weird taste in mouth	Mu Daughter has been taking this med. in the morning, along with Pamilor at night(I assume to counter effect some of the nasties that can go along with Abilify) So far, her mood and behavor are MUCH better, relationships with friends and family are more stable. She is on 5mg right now with an expected increase next week to 7.5mg. I think that will do it. She seems to be aware of other human beings now and the distruction of the house (mostly unintentional) has improved soooo much.	F	13	1  weeks	4/3/2008Email
2	Anxiety, Depression, Bulimia	Extreme hunger!!!! Restlessness, tremors, insomnia.	Obviously I hated being hungry all the time. Not the right medicine for me.	F	18	4  days	4/3/2008
3	Childhood Onset Bipolar Disorder	Parkinsonian symptoms including elbow flexion, mask face, dysfunctional posture, some stiffness in arms, initially somnolence, but this eventually passed	My 7 year old son was started on Abilify as soon as he was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder.  He improved remarkably after the first dose, and within 6-7 days his symptoms were improved by 80-90%.  However, he also immediately developed what is called in medical lingo akinesia, which is abnormal movement and posture, delayed spontanuity in gesture, and abnormal posture.  Most of these side effects made him look like a Parkinson's patient.  The pych was against giving a drug to counter these side-effects becuase he felt it was not a "clean solution."  Later however, we did put him on Congentin which immediately took care of these side effects.  In a nut shell, we tried various other drugs and none worked as well as Abilify so we are now going back to it hoping the side-effects don't re-emerge.  He has been on numerous anti-pychotics since, and the side-effects are slowly diminishing with each new one.	M	7	6  weeks	3/25/2008
3	bipolar II - Depression - anorxia	killer headache - pain in my jaw - nausea - dizziness	Can't really say yet if I like this medicine.  I've only been on it for four days - 5mg.  Seems as though a lot of people have gained weight. Hopefully that won't happen to me - right now I am nauseous so I don't want to eat; which is good sort of - I've had an eating disorder for many, many years.  Now I am worried about gaining weight.  If I do - I am off this drug. Thanks for the heads up - because my Doc prescribed this med as opposed to seroquel.  I am hoping that these side effects go away.	F	50	4  days	3/25/2008
1	SUPPOSED BI POLAR AND DEPRESSION	I cant fall asleep or stay asleep when the abilify was added to the effexor a week ago. Anxious and Xanax wont take the edge off	AS I sit here crying at 5 am becasue I once again am sleep deprived, have gained weight from it and keep getting told its okay I want to scream its not!!  I am goging to have my dr remove me from this drug.  Its as some have said not worht the side effects.  I lived through the nausa but the no sleep other than 3 hours a night is wearingme out.

5	Complex PTSD	thinking becomes dull, thick.  Dizziness, a little tardive dyskinesia.	Used this drug for a year or so, then was able to ween off of it. Now it works well when  I cannot slow my brain down in any other way.  Sometimes I only need it for 3 days, sometimes for a month. I can always ween off of it again and have months that I am ok.  Many times, it has kept me from having to go back to the hospital.  I am grateful to have it.	M	51	3  years	3/16/2008
5	BIPOLAR II - PTSD	mania, jaw clenching, consitpation, increased appetite for sweets, jittery, sleepy after taking, anxiety,	it has IMPROVED my mood 100%. Very LOW dose 2.5mg. Started at 10mg, then 5mg every other day, then 2.5 mgs. That works best. Perhaps these folks on higher doses need to lessen dose until it is manageable. I am on EFFEXOR+Abilify 2.5-was suicidal b4 for 2 years.  Now in less than a week I was up, productive, working, getting things done I hadn't in months. Will monitor for weight gain--I already gained weight on Effexor! No need for more weight.	F	46	14  days	3/11/2008

4	Bipolar w/psychotic features	always hungry; some weight gain (would be more if I ate when I was hungry); not sure how to describe this, but the blahs; physical restlessness	My doctor is thinking about switching me to geodon because of my constant hunger, but is concerned about the extrapyramidal effects with that medication; I'm not sure how well this works for depression either.

1	Bipolar	Fatigue, depression	I was taking 15mgs and could never stay awake. I would sleep for almost 12 hours and still fall asleep at work and in class. I had to drink 4-5 energy drinks a day just to make it and I STILL had difficulty staying awake.	F	22	1  months	2/23/2008

I've only taken one dose and am reluctant to take another before first speaking to my doctor about my exteme side-effects.	Skin "crawling" and cannot get comfortable.	F	30	1  days	2/12/2008
5	bi polar	sleepy	you doctor may not tell you this but if you are over weight or insulin resistant this medicine may cause you to become diabetic I am insulin resistant and for that reason I had to wean myself off of this the benefits were not worth having a future of diabetes	F	28	9  months	2/11/2008

4	Bipolar	none	Abilify has been a great help for me. I've been on it for two years now and I haven't had another bad episode since. I am beginning to become depressed again but we are going to take my dosage up.I definently recommend this medication.	M	18	2  years	1/31/2008
1	DEPRESSION	WEIGHT GAIN AND SEVERE HUNGERANXIETY UNABLE TO BE COMFORTABLE IN MY OWN SKINJUST FEEL HORRIBLE-uNTIL I FOUND THIS PAGE, I THOUGHT IT WAS MY ZOLOFT NOT WORKING ANYMORE-I CUT DOWN MY DOSE OF 30MGS TO HALF THAT AND I FEEL SOMEWHAT BETTER. i SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION AND SEVERE PMS-THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP WITH THE PMS BUT THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE JUST NOT WORTH IT TO ME		F	49	6  months	1/31/2008
1	Was switched from Rispiradol.	Our 16 year old son had gained a tremendous amount of weight taking Rispiradol and the Dr. switched him to Abilify.  "Will do the same as Rispirasol for your son without the weight gain", the Doctor told us. Well, he STILL continued to gain weight (always hungry) (has gained 70 pounds in 9 months, and he was always small framed until beginning the Rispiradol). He became extremely restless and he would pace and not be able to sit still for more than 8 minutes at a time. His lying and disrespect intensified.  It was as if we no longer knew our son.Now, two weeks after stopping the Abilify, our old son is re-emerging.  It is a welcomed sight.	We will never allow him to be put on abilify again.	M	16	2  months	1/22/2008
2	Anxiety & Depression	Strange restlessness; especially in arms and legs. No chair felt right. First few weeks: couldn't sit still !! Increase in anxiety & depression. Slight increase in weight which subsided after 5 weeks.	Quicker orgasms!	F	40	6  weeks	1/17/2008Email
3	depression	20lb. weight gain,sleep disrupted, fatique.	New info about weight gain caused by increased appetite will be published soon. My therapist knows someone who works for the co. and he said my psychopharmacologist didn't have the info because it hasn't been published yet. I was waking up several hours earlier than normal and went back to my regular schedule as soon as I stopped.	F	50	4  months	1/11/2008
1	supposed bipolar	my son was 17 yrs old.He was on abilify for9 months with some progress with social issues.he gained 50 lbs.he went to bed at 10.30 and passed away in his sleep.this was the only med he was on.autopsy report could not determin a definate cause.we believe it had to be from the med.		M	17	9  months	1/9/2008Email
4	Bi-Polar, ADHD	My seven year old son has been on this med for two weeks. He complains about a little pain, I am thinking muscle pain, he has had a sore inside his cheek that we treated with clove oil and hydrogen peroxide (went away), he has been a little sad on this med, a little whiny, but considering all he has been through, it seems like he is finally able to feel emotions whereas before he seemed very out of touch with reality and non-emotional (his dad abandoned him and we are in the middle of divorce, and my son has hardly registered emotionally, which might have been a blessing in disguise all this time, and I think part of his whininess is just his ability to finally feel the things he had not been able to feel before).	Now the good stuff, we tried this med first (physician sample), then Risperdal (actual prescription). The Risperdal had no effect on him, he was still racing around like a lunatic, and after seeing him on this drug, we decided this drug was far better. He can focus at school, listens to the teacher, was able to be included in his school Christmas pageant, the violence against others (classmates, his dad, myself) has stopped, and he is able to sit still for long periods, complete class work and homework, no longer destroys the house like he did before, the school is considering allowing him to rejoin his classmates in social activities (recess and PE, which he was held out of for most of the school year because of fighting and violence), and this saved him from being suspended for the second time. My son likes the drug, wants to take it, and gets a lot of satisfaction from being able to complete tasks and follow directions. He was in so much trouble before, and meds were a last resort f	M	7	2  weeks	1/7/2008Email
3	depression,  adhd, anxiety	2mg every 2-4 days, per shrink.  I have noticed that I have been happier the first day after taking it, each time, but then I get more moody or anxious as the pill wears off so I take another one which is about 2-3 days later.  I sleep fine but not as hard anymore as I used to and I find myself more bored.  I am more friendly to people though - most of the time.	I am still on the fence on this drug.  I am not sure if it is because I am "thinking" it is working in a good way - or if it really is.  This is one drug I am still waiting to see miracles happen but, honestly, I doubt it'll ever happen.  I will continue to take the samples I received from the shrink and go from there.....	F	38	30  days	1/3/2008
2	BI POLAR I	Tired, less energy, lathargic, mouth is dry, jittery, cold sweats, etc.	If i take it in the day I feel tired all day, I take it at night around 8 eiother was around lunch I am so tired and sleep 3 hours and around 8-10 at night, when I take it at night I am almost on the verge of passing out and it gives me quite a rush and keeps me up. I was very energetic before, now I feel like not even moving. LOL if you can tell I had just tookin my meds or I would not even be typing this. Also I am ever so restless legs, getting comfortable etc.	M	34	4  weeks	12/26/2007Email
3		Massive increase in hunger and weight gain.  No other side effects	Abilify worked great to stop mood swings and sense of "What's the point?" and fearful thoughts.  The doctor said the medication would make me lose weight but it didn't so I decided to stop it	F		2  months	12/25/2007
1	Bilpolar	RESTLESS!! Doctor said technical term is "akastasia" pardon spelling. Wasnt even comfortable to drive. I have driven cross country etc. before this experience. Couldnt sit still, stand or ANYTHING for 5 mins. Thought I would crawl out of my skin. Was making me feel almost suicidal! TOOK TWO full weeks or more off my 15mg dose to feel "normal" again.	I was on this med for occasional manic episodes and rapid speech.....it made me feel completely whacked out. Have never felt so uncontrollably "odd" like that before. Was honestly a terrifying experience!	F	30	4  weeks	12/19/2007
3	Bipolar	Extreme nausea like I've never had, unusually tired, constipation, and restlessness	Helps keep my mind clear though...good for that, but the nausea makes me too sick to move much	F	30	24  days	12/15/2007
4	Bipolar/OCD	Grogginess in the morning	This drug has worked absolutely fantastic for me, I was so manic, my mind was always racing..."I have to buy this", "I have to do that"; And now I feel so peaceful.	F	23	6  months	12/14/2007
1	Bi Polar disorder	Even more depressed, irritated, can't concentrate, bladder problems, shaky legs and hands, swollen extremities, can't laugh (I love laughing- now seems like I have to retrain myself how to do it), painful joints/stiffness>(doesn't subside at all!), severely panicky, crying a lot, very sad, can't stop thinking about how horrible I feel mentally and physically. I'm even more paranoid/worried about what other's think about me than I was before taking Abilify. 	Not for me. I'm glad to see that it works for some people. I was open minded and looking for help and whatever medicine works/worked, would be willing to try for sure..but not this one!	F	46	2  days	12/14/2007
5	complex PTSD	Thinking is thick and slow	I take abilify when my brain starts to go out of control and won't stop.  It is step 4 in a 5 step management process.  (Step 5 is back to the hospital.)  I've tried most other atypical anti-psychotics and for me abilify is the gentlest and sturdiest way to get my brain to stop.  Usually stay on it for a month after an episode and then go off of it and am ok for a few months.	F	51	3  years	12/11/2007
3	bipolar and OCD	motor impairment, slight weight gain, EXTREME fatigue, EXTEREME thirst, akathisia (need to move; I can't sit still anymore), and I believe I am experiencing Tardive dyskinesia	This medication was okay at first, or at least better than risperdal (which overall made me gain well over 100 pounds, but abilify was not that drastic). It had greatly reduced my obsessive and intrusive thoughts but now it's just an annoyance. Most of my meds, including this one, have slowed down my entire body (thinking, reaction time, speech, etc.) which is the reason I have a learning disability. I'm SO tired! I do have sleep apnea but abilify just makes it worse. Tardive dyskinesia is a problem, too (involuntary movements such as: grimacing, tongue protrusion, rapid eye blinking, finger movements as if playing a guitar or piano, etc.) Tardive dyskinesia happens with antipsychotics like abilify and I do every single thing I listed there. It's also potentially irreversable. I'm just not the same as I once was.	M	20	2  years	12/11/2007
4	stress disorder	restlessness tremors BOREDOM pacing vivid/scary dreams	i had to cut my dosage in half (15 mg to 7.5 mg) and the side effects lessoned..... it works but side effects are annoying	F	14	1  months	12/8/2007
5	Schizoaffective- Bipolar Type	Was tired when I first started taking it but that subsided.  Now after being on it for 4 years I'm starting to have Extra Pyramidal Symptoms in my Eyes (unusual eye movements).  So I've had to lower my dose.	This drug saved my life.  I was literally at rock bottom when I found abilify four years ago and it brought me out of the deepest darkness imaginable.  It stopped my hallucinations, controlled my bipolar symptoms, and allowed me to get to the point of being able to go back to school.  I'm terrified that I'll have to stop taking it because of the EPS.	F	22	4  years	11/27/2007
3	Bipolar/Hypomania	Hypomania, insomnia, blurred vision, nervousness, paraniod thoughts after 3 weeks of usage, unable to relax, confusion (could have been from lack of sleep).	The first week was great, very motivated on 10 MG.  Week 2 began feeling confused, blurred vision, light sensitivity, nerviousness, yet still unable to stop moving.  Third week 15mg, had to start taking Temazepam to get to sleep, still only 2-3 hrs of sleep a night.  Still unable to stop moving.  Finally called doc and weaned off in 3 days.  Wonderful motivator, but unable to focus and sleep.  The sleep deprivation and vision issues made this drug debilitating.  Seemed to make my hypomania worse.  Weaning off had delusional thoughts for a day or so.  Defintely do not cold turkey off this med.	F	34	3  weeks	11/27/2007Email

4	Major depression	Vivid dreams, waking up in the middle of the night, blurred vision (but I'm on a cocktail of meds so I don't know if this is all due to the Abilify or the others)	I've had chronic depression my entire life.  I was recently (last month) suicidal, and a few days after my psychiatrist prescribed 2.5mg a day, I was out of the suicidal haze and began to feel better.  After adding Lamictal (in addition to the Lexapro I was already on), I feel a LOT better.	F	21	1.5  months	11/8/2007

1	Bipolar II	EXTREME mania, severe throat swelling starting within 24 hrs of first 2 mg dose, sweating, uncontrollable tremors, twitching, headache, tiredness, blurred vision, nausea, agitation, dizziness. I ended up in the hospital after 4 days on the drug. I was severely dehydrated.	I would NOT take this drug. Even if you are having few side effects now I would say it's extremely dangerous and not worth the risk. Especially do not give this drug to children! There are bound to be long term effects that are irreversible. I will have to see if my muscle aches, tremors and twitching will subside permanently. Not a good experience!	M	25	4  days	10/13/2007Email
5	Bipolar	constipation, incresed energy, suppressed appetite.	i love it! on 5mg for past 2 weeks. I used to sleep 10 hrs a day before meds, and now I'm wide awake after 5 hrs. I have so much energy right now. I had taken Depakote, which was awful, I slept 12+ hrs a day, and still felt drowsy. Lost 5 lbs in past 2 weeks.	F	28	2  weeks	10/12/2007
3	Paranoid schizophrenia	For a short while, I experienced akathesia, but this has now gone.	Abilify has stopped auditory hallucinations, which is a great blessing. Sleep is interrupted, but I find that useful for reading and studying assorted Christian publications and the Bible early in the morning when all is quiet.  My appetite is enormous, so am constantly struggling with the temptation to gluttony and "making a god of the belly". So the challenge is self-control to avoid putting on more weight. I can thoroughly recommend the book "Strength for His People - A Ministry for Families of the Mentally Ill" by Dr Steven Waterhouse, Pastor of Westcliff Bible Church in Amarillo, Texas since 1985, (published by Westcliff Press - www.webtheology.com; e-mail is westcliff@amaonline.com; Ph: (806)359-6362). His brother Mark, suffers from schizophrenia and he wrote the book  in honour of him and to help ordinary people who may also suffer from this awful condition, and as a guide and consolation to families who may be the primary carer.(125 pages; Bibliography has 1	F	53	69  days	10/10/2007Email
1	Depression	RESTLESSNESS RESTLESSNESS RESTLESSNESS, dizziness, tiredness, nausea, anxiety/panic, flu-like symptoms	My psychiatrist prescribed this medication for me to help the Prozac work more effectively, she said. I HATE this medication, and after three days of taking it I WILL NOT take anymore. I could cry- I've never felt in such a way in all my life. It was like the walls were closing in. EVERYTHING was too boring to hold my attention! All I could think of, and I mean ALL DAY, was how GOOD it would feel to just run around my neighborhood screaming at the top of my lungs. It was IMPOSSIBLE to get comfortable, and I felt panicky, as if I were going to suddenly run out of oxygen. It was horrible. I've never experienced such crippling side effects before from any medicine like this.	M	18	3  days	10/8/2007
5	Bipolar Disorder	Fatigue, but it's fine since I take it at night and it helps me sleep.	EXCELLENT! So far, so good! I have more energy and motivation than I have ever had. I also have little to NO obsessive thoughts, practically NO racing thoughts, and my mood has been greatly improved. I can't say enought about how great this medication has been for me. I actually feel normal!!	F	34	9  days	10/3/2007
2	Bipolar II	Jittery, manic frenzy, sleeplessness	If this doesn't make you want to jump out of your skin, I don't know what will. I felt like I could scale the walls.	F	24	7  days	9/21/2007
2	Bipolar I Disorder	Tremors, insomnia, headaches, agitation, increased energy	This seems like a medication that might work for major depression, but I just don't see how it works for Bipolar Disorder.  It's so stimulating I had to take it as early as possible in the morning to avoid sleeplessness at night and it caused me to shake and have WAY too much energy during the day.	M	22	2  months	9/21/2007
4	Anxiety/Depression/Paranoia	Some blurred vision and dizziness when driving.	Everything seems to be working well and I feel Abilify has helped me tremendously!	F	30	1  months	9/19/2007
3	Anger/Rage/Paranoid Thoughts	Extreme tiredness/exhaustion.  Blurred vision and body aches.	It has made me calmer and I feel a little aloof so I'm not worrying about things as much.  I don't know if the side effects are worth it though.  I'll give it another week and see.	F	30	2  weeks	8/23/2007
5	bipolar w/ anxiety, hallucinations	some tummy upset when starting the meds but otherwise none so far.	Abilify was a miracle for my 8 yr old. After 4 years of searching for something that would help with his panic attacks, terror, anxiety, audio and visual hallucinations and frustration/aggression as well as his hyperactivity he was ultimately prescribed abilify 7.25 mg.  This was a miracle drug for us and alone has solved all of his issues. I'm so happy my son feels as he says "calm and happy" and isn't afraid of simple things like rain and leaving the house. He has been on it for 2 months now and the change is so dramatic. I'm one of those who tried so hard not to put my son on medication but he is a different child now, happy and no longer unable to function. As another mother here said, it gave him his life back.

2	rapid cycling bi-polar disorder	have gained 10 lbs in 4months, urinate frequently,no sex drive, blurred vision, makes me intensely hungry after i take it.unusually tired	I'm on lamictal and klonopin and have been on both of those for almost 10yrs, drs have been trying to add something for a boost as the lamictal makes me a little blah feeling. I have tried everything and just started the abilify 4 months ago and i felt like it worked great at first then the longer i take it the worse my side effects have gotten, i thought something new was wrong with me since it worked well in the beginning it seemed but have been so tired its ridiculous. i'm glad i went back and researched my meds just in case and found all my problems are side effects of this med.	F	34	4  months	8/22/2007
5	BPII, BPD	In the beginning I had some "wooziness," but that passed quickly.  Overall, I've had no real side-effects.	It has helped tremendously with my moods and I am able to take it during the day, which is a great thing (I don't tolerate medications well, and most tend to make me very sleepy).	F	26	3  months	8/15/2007Email
5	BIpoalr disorder	The main side effect is not being able to sleep for very long, but I also have more energy and get more things done.	I have taken almost every depression drug out there, and thought that I was just supposed to feel detached or apathetic. Abilify has been a miracle for me. I have a sense of humor again, lots of energy and the negative critical side of me is GONE.	M	35	30  days	8/12/2007Email
2	OCPD, anxiety, mild depression	Listlessness, lethargy, fatigue, reduced libido, ambivalence, lip sore (?), weight gain (?).	I was feeling highly motivated for two weeks before starting on Abilify. I started 5 mg for 5 days, then ramped to 10 mg for another 2+ weeks. All of the side effects started out barely noticeable. Over the last 5 days or so, the side effects have intensified. [Note: Taking 30 units Lantis(insulin)/dy for Type 2 diabetes; My BMI is 38;  I'm also on 40-80mg/dy Prozac for depression/aggression, the last 10 yrs., w/ no side effects.] I suspect Abilify is slowly turning me into the PillsBury Dough Boy. So, I'm not waiting another 2 weeks to get the shrink's opinion. I'm stopping taking this Rx cold turkey-right now. Of course I'll call the shrink to let him know I'm stopping this med.. All side effects w/ no noticeable benefits for me (unless you like feeling like a human marshmallow). Of course, your experience may or maynot be positive, unlike mine.	M	53	3  weeks	8/11/2007
4	Bipolar 2	VIVID DREAMS (things I think about during the day, i dream about at night.  These dreams feel very real)  K.O. component (I fall asleep within an hour of taking abilify)	I take Abilify with LAMICTAL(mood stabilizer) & Remeron.  I have nothing bad to say about abilify except it doesnt give me the desired effect i'm looking for which is the semi-resurrection of my mania so i am able to be an intellect and have a personality.	M	24	2  months	7/21/2007
3	Schizoaffective	I'm on lots of meds, so I'm not sure what side effects are caused by abilify; I haven't noticed any.	Abilify helped things make more sense. It helped a lot with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. I stoped wearing sweatshirts in the summer shortly after the drug was started but didn't realize until later that the abilify was why. I would recommend this drug.	F	19	2  months	7/21/2007Email
1	supposed bipolar disorder	Mental "fog," totally detached from everything, and severe--and continuing, even after 18 months off Abilify--movement problems akin to Restless Leg Syndrome.	Despite 30mg being the maximum dosage, my psychiatrist had me on 45mg, and did not listen when I told him about the side effects.  So, after about a year on Abilify (as well as Seroquel and Lamictal) I took myself off the two neuroleptics.  And yet I still have moment problems, increasing when tired or stressed, all this time later.	F	26	1  years	7/21/2007
2	Aspergers Syndrome, Tourette's	Intense sleepiness for first day, then after second dose, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, intense akathesia. Four days after discontinuing, the akathesia is subsiding, and the insomnia is lessening, but still present. Also: intense feelings of hunger.	This drug was supposed to calm me, help me to focus, control repetitive behaviors and tics. It did the opposite. It made it very difficult for me to sit still and write or type.	M	45	3  days	7/9/2007
1	Bipolar 2	Tremors in arms hands.  Two right fingers don't function normally. Restless legs.	The restless leg thing was bad.  I felt like a hyper 5 year old.  Tremors in arms and hands almost as bad as Katherine Hepburn.  Two fingers on right hand don't function normally.  Since I throw freight as a package handler, I'm useless at work.  Also have the urinating issue, I wait until I HAVE TO GO, otherwise not much happens - unlike normal.  Took 10 mg without Cymbalta, then with it again.  I have stopped takeing Abilify on 6/30.  It is now 7/5 and side effects haven't stopped.  Tremor has actually worsened.	M	36	5  days	7/5/2007Email
2	Bipolar II Disorder	Constant mouth ulcers, toothaches, muscle pain	It helped control my disorder better than most medications, with a minimum of other side effects, but the mouth ulcers are too much when you can't even eat a decent cheeseburger without being in pain.  The toothache was from a still-growing wisdom tooth that only seems to come in when I've taken it.  My mother has reported similar symptoms, so I figure it's just a hereditary thing.	M	28	3  weeks	7/3/2007
1	depression, irritabiity	extreme nausea, I took 1/2 of this pill and vomited all night, dry heaves, you name it.  It was the most horrific experience, I will never,.. ever recommend this med, please beware!  I was also prescribed a 30mg tablet a day, and in doing more research found out that is the highest dose!  I think this nurse practitioner is a quack!		F	49	1  days	7/3/2007
4	Psychosis from PTSD	weight gain (despite claims that it doesn't cause weight gain)	Abilify has helped me think more clearly, rationally and aside from the weight gain, I've had no side effects at all.  I take the Abilify in the morning, as it tends to be a bit stimulating.	M	46	3  years	6/11/2007Email
5	schizophrenia	this drug is going to be similiar to the drug named BIFEPRUNOX(chemical name)coming out soon maybe end of 07 or 1st quarter of 08 it has a good side effect profile NO WEIGHT GAINNO INCREASE IN PROLACTIN LEVELSNO ADVERSE EFFECT ON BLOOD LIPIDS NO ADVERSE AFFECTS ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS NO QTc PROLONGATION	i will be taking my ABILIFY at 15mg until this drug called BIFEPRUNOX becomes availableI hope soon!

5	BP w/psychotic episodes; autism	My son has been on this med for two years and his only side effect has been minimal weight gain (about 20 lbs. in two years).	This medication worked very well for my son - stopped his visual and auditory hallucinations completely, decreased his motor tics, reduced OCD-like behaviors, and greatly reduced his aggression. This medication gave my son his life back; he is now able to function & communicate well and he is excelling academically.	M	12	2  years	5/17/2007
3	schizo/bipolar/depression	This medicince by far is the most effective when treating symptomsit has low impact on weight gain.  i recommend this drug if you have experienced weight gain with other anti physcotics such as seroquel and  zyprexa, i believe those drugs are linked to DIABETES, WEIGHT GAIN, and OVER EATING AND UNCONTROLLABLE HUNGER the dosing is very easy with abilify starting dose 15mg and that is the recommended dose you stay on according to my shrink abilify has not been found affective at higher does due to extreme side effects	this medicine made my eyes roll in back of my head once	M	32	14  years	5/14/2007
4	bipolar 1 disorder/mood instability	extreme tiredness, upset stomach, blurred vision, cold sweats, tremors (uncontrollable shaking) in hands.	I have been on and off this medication for 4 years and today is my first day back on it in 8 months. I feel very ill but I remember from all my past experiences that it takes a few weeks for your body to get used to and to respond(I just want to make that clear to the people that quit taking it after one day). I am taking 15mg but I'm pretty sure I'm going to start cutting my pill in half to lessen the side effects. Abilify has been highly effective in treating my irritability and mood swings, making me a pleasure, rather than a monster, to be around. Personally, I would rather have an upset stomach for a few days and be happy than to be constantly angry for the rest of my life. I took abilify with effexor a few years back and it sent me to the ER because I was shaking so badly I couldn't stand up. I am told it is dangerous to mix abilify with anything. Hopefully the side effects go away soon!	F	19	4  years	5/1/2007Email
5	bipolar/schizo-affectiver	As I went slowly up from 2.5mg to 15mg,- I experienced poor night vision;loud noises startled me at night;muscular aches and pains; always want to eat; tired all day but can't sleep through the night; restless, but tired.  Agitation, anger and anxiety came back if I didn't increase my dosage in about 4days.  I just began 15mg today. DR. said may go all the way to 30mg if we need to in the future.	Now, the good stuff--I'm calmer around people.  My anger is much reduced.  Oversensitivity is reduced. I'm able to cope with daily frustrations.  I'm no longer so irritable and impatient with people.  General anxiety, and nervousness to be around people is gone.  Bipolar mood swings are completely minimized and I recover from any emotional upset faster.  AWESOME drug for me personally!	F	38	1  months	4/25/2007
4	bipolar depression	weight gain (it was lithium's helper) spasming jaw, chattering teeth, tiredness, "wired, but tired"	This drug has kept me from falling any deeper into depressions. Both times it has rescued me from hospitalizations.  However, I do not like having to take two other drugs just so I can continue taking this one without the side effects.  Have to take cogentin and inderal both for the jaws and limb jerks.  Don't like that.	F	50	15  days	4/25/2007
3	Schizophrenia	increased sex drive, some tiredness, restlessness	Aripiprazole has being used to decrease the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and it has being effective at doing so. In my case, the side effects close to outweigh the benefits of this drug.	M	32	2  months	4/23/2007Email
1	Cyclothymia	Intense pain with muscle stiffness.  I might be diagnosed with Lupus now.  I never had these problems before I took Abilify.	I still have to have more blood tests to determine what is going on with the muscle and joint pain that I am experiencing.  I took 2.5 mgs. of Abilify for about a month and then felt like I was coming down with the flu.  It turns out that it was a rare side effect from this medicine, so I stopped taking it.  I am still in pain and it has been over 2 months since my last dose.  I am convinced that whatever my blood work says that I have it came from taking this medicine.	F	44	30  days	4/23/2007Email
5	schizophrenia	vivid dreaming, insomnia for the first four months	I lost 87lds on this drug and it gave my life back to me. No voices, no paranoia, no psychosis!!!	F	47	3  days	4/19/2007
1	bipolar disoder II, depression	I was vomiting the whole night after taking the first pill, the next day I was feeling sick that the only thing that I could do is just lying down in my bed; wasn't able to eat. I was feeling really sick, no drug made me fell that way	I took this medicine just for 1 day, and it was enough for me to decide that I wasn't taking it anymore. I was feeling really sick, just the same as when I was pregnant and having severe toxicosis , no drug made me fell that way. I'm going back to Depakote.	F	21	1  days	4/10/2007
2	schizoaffective, bipolar type	About three weeks after I started taking it, my entire body started gradually swelling up like a balloon, and I had this uncontrollable, horrible burning sensation in my legs and ankles. It got to the point where the swelling was so bad that I could barely move. I couldn't button my shirts anymore, my feet wouldn't fit into my shoes, and I had to go up a whole bra size (band AND cup). I found out, though, that only about two percent of the subjects in the clinical trials had this problem (and it's often an allergic reaction), so I must be special. ;-} Oddly enough, when I went off this, I got onto Risperdal, only to have the exact same reaction.	I was REALLY disappointed that my reaction was so bad, because it otherwise worked very well. I felt better than I could remember feeling in about 20 years. My mood swings went from every several minutes to ... not at ALL. I felt stable for the first time in a VERY long time, like I was finally on solid ground. The really WEIRD thing, though, was that for the first four days, I couldn't feel ANYTHING -- it was like someone had flipped a switch inside me and turned me off. After that, it took about another week to level out completely, but once I did, I felt GREAT.	F	28	5  weeks	4/5/2007Email
4	bi p[olar disorder	Tired. Very tired at first; now I don't even notice unless I stop taking it...then I'm a real c*nt to deal with and I am very irritable and angry.	When I started taking Abilify with Zoloft, I was very tired all day.  I felt like I had a wet blanket wrapped around my head, then they lessened the dose to 5 mg a day, and I'm fine.  It's subtle, I can't tell any effect at all from it unless I stop taking it.  Then it is like an immediate PMS.	F	37	1  years	4/1/2007Email
1	bi polar disorder	Started out on 5mg daily and over a period of 2 months was "upped" to 20mg.  By the middle of the third month, I developed the most horrible feeling, like wanting to jump out of my own skin, could NOT get comfortable, caused restless leg syndrome to go totally bonkers, made me pace and feel horribly panicky ALL THE TIME!  I had never in my life felt such an awful feeling!  Raging insomnia accompanied the whole ordeal, as well as vision trouble, completely unable to write a sentence or write my own name, for that matter due to hand tremors (which I still have sometimes to this day), constant feeling that the "dying to get out of my own skin or run screaming like a madwoman" feeling would NEVER go away.  It finally did, but golly did it ever take time.  That's the only thing that will help with the akathisia (acathesia)...time.  It took the same amount of time that I was on the drug, about 3 and a half months, for the feeling to finally start going away.	In all honesty, through bi polar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, severe panic disorder, visual and auditory psychosis at times, depression, etc., the ONLY time I ever truly even considered suicide was during the akathisia (acathesia) ordeal I went through, all due to the Abilify.  You don't know what utter hell and torment is until you've gone through the nightmare of akathesia, which for me was completely due to taking Abilify!  If it works for you, great, but be warned...try to stay on the smallest dosage that works for you...upping the dosage over a period of time can have this horrible effect on you too and I wouldn't wish the feeling Abilify caused me on my worst enemy!

2	psychosis, appearantly.	so restless i couldn't stop moving but exhausted at the same time, dizzyness, headaches.	i only lasted a week.  it did nothing to help me.	F	17	1  weeks	3/26/2007
5	BP 1/possible schizoaffective/PTSD	vertigo,(room tumbling end over end) one episode lasted two days, the other lasted one week, other than that no side effects. cannot be certain this medicine was to blame	abilfy helped me come down out of the sky, gave me very crisp feelings and perceptions of reality.  It dimmed out the white noise in my head, and for the very first time i can remember felt no noise in my head, just peacefulness.  Being numb from years of emotional shutdown, i actually had feelings surface for the first time, and had to start sorting through them and dealing with them.  sometimes it was painful at first because the pain was acute, but Id much rather feel now than be numb.  Ativan in combination helps deal with the tremendous anxiety.  Also take seroquel for sleep, and lamictal for the depression.  Overall, a good mix for me.  I would never want to go back to the worst moments of this illness before Dx and treatment, and for that I am grateful.	F	37	17  months	3/25/2007
5	bipolar1/ schizo	Restlessness   Severe at times.  strangeley, tiredness can acompany this or exist independently of it.  I feel agitated but clear headed.  i will accept the trade-off but feel that I must do something about side-effect.  Benzo helps. I forsee weight gain because I am hungry again.	I am only in the first week, but needed to speak of the progress I have made.  At just 5 mgs. I notice a substantial reduction in the chatter in my brain and I am better able to perceive and respond appropriately to social scenes, leaving me less sacred of people.  Paranoia is under control. i have been on several meds in my 20 year struggle with bipolar 1/schizo. disorder.  i am just coming off a psychotic break that lasted very long on and off.  I am what they call a quick responder when a med works for me.  So far wellbutrin (which i still take) Lamictal (which was like a god-send and then pooped-out, and now Abilify has improved drasticaly the picture in just 5 days.  Last night I could concentrate long enough to put a desk from Ikea together and I even cleaned my room.  Now i still have the memories of some terrible behavior and the knowlege of such negative poop-out tendencies of meds.  But for today I am grateful.  More later.  John. R.B. CA.

1	anti pyschotic, not needed	this drug made me walk like a zombie, slur my speech, I couldn't use my hands and fingers - it was like I had a small stroke, I couldn't lay or sit down - relaxing was very unconfortable, very nervous, loss of concentration.	I din't need anti-psychotics and was prescribed and administered them illegally.  I tried geodon, respirdal, and zyprexa too.  The abilify was by far the worst!  I was only taking 15mg., and I still had horrendous side effects!  This is a terribly dangerous drug.  I see no worth in any anti-psychotic or anti-depressant drugs, these drugs really mess with your mind and body. If you are having psychotic, bi-polar, depression, or whatever, and desire to take something.  Only take small dosages of anything, 10mg. or less.  These drugs can cause more harm than the disease!		41	18  days	3/12/2007
1	bogus court ordered "delusional"	Chattering teeth, leg shaking	I am forced to take the medication	M	42	6  months	2/24/2007
3	social anxiety,  ADD	Mood lift, more energy (too much at 1 mg), got very restless, felt calmer around people, woke up earlier with energy, became to restless and had to stop taking Abilify.	I would recommend this to anyone needing an AP. I just got too restless and would lose my train of thought in mid- sentence.  Not for me!  Abilify may work really well with you.  Try it out; you'll know very soon if its for you or not.	M	32	21  days	2/22/2007
1	bi-polar	very tired, headache, pressure above eyes	taking 200 mg lamictal, took 1 mg abilify for one day, just that small amount had a negative effect.  i'm exhausted.  i was told things would go the other way, but i don't like this drug in description or feeling, so i'm not going to take it tomorrow.	F	40	1  days	2/22/2007
3	Non-Specified Psychotic Disorder	My 17 year old has been taking abilify for 3 months.  The sleepiness disrupts his daily functioning terribly.  He leaves school early every day, sleeps several hours and gets about 8-9 hours of sleep every night.  He never feels well rested, but has no problem falling asleep.  He also experiences some muscular discomfort and dehydration.	We are currently weaning off of it.  He would rather deal with his symptoms then the side effects.  Doc has prescribed Luvox..hard to find info on it.  Not sure what we are going to do.  The abilify decreased his symptoms by about 90% on 10 mg. per day.	M	17	3  months	2/13/2007
5	Bipolar 2	weight gain/sweet cravings	Abilify has done wonders for controlling my aggression and irritability.  I am already taking Topamax and I have noticed  a slow weight gain from craving sweets since on Abilify (1.5 years) and Dostinex (3yrs).  I am going to try to give up sugar and junk to see if the weight comes off.  I am also coming off the Dostinex too to see if it is effecting my weight. I really need the Abilify.  I could tell a tremendous difference in my anxiety level when I went from 10mg - 15mg.  I take 15 mg. of Abilify every morning.	F	41	1.5  years	2/7/2007

1	schizoaffective and OCD	terrible shaking, teeth chatter, neck pain, inability to stay in my seat, kept falling asleep, waking up in middle of night, lip quivering, lights bothered my eyes really bad, loud sounds bothered me bad.	I wish it had worked.  It really helped a lot with my illness.  But the side effects were impossible to handle.  I couldn't so much as eat dinner or read a book in any normal sense.  I wanted to just crawl out of my skin.  However, I must add that I take Paxil as well.  However, Paxil has never caused me any problems.my friend (same condition) also takes paxil and abilify.  both of us agreed that once we tried Abilify that mania was brought on.  For the record, Paxil has never done that to either of us until we had Abilify.	M	32	2  weeks	2/4/2007
4	Autism and Tourettes Syndrome	I was on Abilify for about 5 years and then had to go off of it.  I lost a great deal of weight when I went off of it, but my behaviors got worse. I could not think clearly. I recently went back on the Abilify and I have gained a great deal of weight in a very short period of time. Not happy about that.  Also, my appetite has increased slightly, and it makes me extremely tired.	This truly gets rid of tics (from Tourette's) and controls alot of the behaviors from Autism, but the side effects are just awful. There really is no drug out there that works as well, and that is a shame. Wish someone would develop a drug that didn't have so many side effects.	F	15	 	12/24/2006
5	Bipolar I Disorder	None whatsoever.	Silenced the voices, no more paranoia,able to think clearly, able to SLEEP, no weight gain here.No drowsiness as experienced with Seroquel.	F	42	4  months	12/23/2006
1	Bipolar I disorder - manic episodes	Severe eye tremors, double vision, hypersomnia, anxiety attacks, muscle weakness, severe depression, cloudy thoughts, hypertension.	Side effects were very severe.  I had to stop Abilify and increase my dosage of Lamictal.  The side effects completely abated after three days except for eye tremors which lasted about a week, hypertension lasted about another two weeks and then just plummet to normal.  Side effects first noticed at 10mg and then instantly severe at 15mg.	M	24	8  weeks	12/18/2006
5	Paranoid schizophrenia	The only side effects I noticed are a weight gain (40 lbs) and a slight case of insomnia (which could be the result of life stresses and not the medication).  The weight gain could be a result of the Risperdal I was taking in combination with the Abilify, not sure,  but stopped the Risperdal to see if I could lose a few pounds and remained stable on just the Ability (Don't tell my doctor). I have stopped gaining weight. I take the maximum dosage too, 30 MG. 	Since I started taking Abilify, I have the impetus to get up and out.  No other medication has had this effect. No delusions, hallucinations, voices or paranoia.  This is a great drug.	F	56	2  years	12/11/2006Email
2	Bipolar 2 hypomania	I cannot bear the side effects this drug has!  I Have no ability to THINK clearly on this med.  I am confused and retarded physically and mentally.  I am on disability, thank God! The only reason I am taking it currently is becasue I have been RX'd large doses of Prednisone )or a physical problem I have)which within 2 days made me totally manic! As fun as feeling hypomanic is, I didn't want to go over the top! So I reluctantly started taking abilify again during the steroidal treatment. I am in the taper down phase now of prednisone and abilify. I am looking forward to being on Trileptal alone again for treating my Bipolar disorder.	Since 1998 I had taken depakote and prozac, but then after gaining 80 lbs, I changed Doctors.  The new P-doc prx'd Abilify. I was unstable and had a lot of mixed states. I became all messed up---retarded, confused, irritable, sleep problems, inability to function in the medical field as a Sr. Veterinary Technician.  I needed meds to make me sleep and needed meds to wake me up...it was TERRIBLE.  My job performance was ridiculous.  The only reason I wasn't fired is that my boss and I had an understanding---and I was very very open about my BP. My Pdoc kept tweaking up the abilify and I got worse and worse. Finally, I decided he was a quack and I slowly tapered off ALL meds.  I became much better!  I was off meds for 18 mos before I cycled again and went back to the pdco to get treatment again.  I was relived he didn't force me to take abilify again until recently while I was taking steroids for another medical problem.  It knocks the heck out of any manic attack!  That is the one thing	F	42	6  months	12/10/2006
1	Bipolar Disorder II	Literally, I could not pee !  This drug was proscribed to "boost" the effects of other antidepressants, but did nothing at all aside from aggravate me.	Never would I take this medication again.....although, I have been told that I am like 1% of the 1% that have been recorded with this particular side effect.	M	38	1  months	11/13/2006
3	bipolar diagnosis after 25 yr lupus	extreme weight gain combination of depekote and ablilify  and trazadone for sleep severe depression and then slight stroke eight years ago. Lupus flair ups causes pain and not able to sleep i do not think i should have to take ablify medication for all these years, but want to decrease to 15 mg instead of 30 mg.  i went off the drug 18 months ago and ended up anxiety and panic striken and had to go to a week of health care around the clock to get back on medecine and then they added depekote because i was dizzy. during that stay at the help center i evened  out but they added a sleeping pill. I have no desire to do anything and if i let my mind get busy i start a lot of projects that make other family member crazy so it is best for me to  take several naps a day and stay calm. I eat compulsivley with out stopping to think about chewing and walk to the kithen to get a bite of food and would go back often if someone did not remind me not too.I do things in a hurry and shower half heart	has any one taken abilify as long as i have? over 2 years maybe three.and has any one mixed depekote that i have never had a seizure but they think this will control my bipolar actions. I think after my stroke and losing smell for 8 years.I visited a chiropractor last year and got my smell back, made my life a little better.  But i also take plaqenell, generic when my lupus flairs up and i have not had to take it the last three months. but someone said that they take celebrex for their lupus and i have always taken plaqeunell for the last 20 years when i have a flair up and i usually take it for three months untill symptoms subside. but i think when i went off the ablify on my own because of weight gain and being tired all the time is when it was really a bad week.  I was not rational at all and very anxious. enough that i wanted to go to institution and not ever come back home.  Said i would never go off the med again unless under a doctor that understood lupus and i was under 24	F	65	3  days	11/8/2006

My tics used to be severe and constant, now they are rare and minor.  I can't believe I finally found the drug. It's worth the side effects for me. I can now get back to being social and enjoy college life.Only downside is if you dont have Insurance it cost about 750 bucks per month.	M	21	30  days	10/11/2006Email
4	severe depression	Insomnia, tiredness	I have been on Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal and Lexapro for severe depression for a little over a year. Recently, I went off the Abilify for two weeks in an effort to decrease my medication (under my Psychiatrist's supervision, because I want to get pregnant) and immediately became depressed and suicidal. Now I have been back on the Abilify for a week and I feel 'normal' again. The main problem that I am experiencing is insomnia at night and lack of energy during the day. Overall, it has really helped to balance my severe depression.	F	29	1  years	10/1/2006
