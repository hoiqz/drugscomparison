4	Sinus Infection	Rather deep neck and shoulder pain; minor nausea	Nausea doesn't happen if I take on a full stomach, but the pain only seems to get better the more water I drink.  Could the pain be from a form of dehydration?	F	47	10  days 2X D	8/24/2012Email
4	Boil/Abscess Post Lancing	Abdominal pain, right upper quadrant pain (gallbladder area), Indigestion/heartburn immediately after swallowing it (have to take liquid form because of dysphagia) loose stools, increased appetite, irritable, frontal headaches and sinus pressure/pain, I have Tourette Syndrome and it's increasing my tics, some itching/rashes, hard to walk (legs feel like they are made of led!) but it's working. I had a huge boil under my armpit that had to be drained (lanced) and packed with gauze and I was put on this to make sure it didn't get reinfected. Whenever I eat, smoke, drink etc, my tongue and mouth burns like it's on fire. I was told by the pharmacist "dyspepsia" is a side effect. It's doing the job but it's been rough at times, though not as rough as last time I was on it since this time I make sure I take it WITH FOOD!	Worked for the infection (so far), NASTY taste when taking the liquid form. Chalky, gritty, crunchy, awful taste.	M	27	10  days10 ML 3X D	3/26/2012Email
5	Bronchitis (actually took 500mg)	Brief nausea occassionally. Nothing I couldn't handle. I am allergic to tons of meds and very sensitive to others. I had no problems with this one.	Not only cured the bronchitis, but also cleared a UTI.	F	60	10  days500 mg 2X D	12/15/2011
1	UTI	UNBELIEVABLE anxiety, Depression so bad that I felt like I was the only one in the world without even a rock to talk to. Obsessive Compulsive behavior (repeatedly checked myself for some disease) Depersonalization and Derealization. If i looked into a mirror i NEARLY did not recognize myself even though i knew it was me. The same goes for when I looked at my mom. Crying uncontrollably. Mood swings from being extremely depressed to content and within minutes, it repeated, and it did this ALL DAY for a month until i sought psychological medications. This medication nearly made me drive my parents car into a telephone pole when I stormed out of the house bc they couldnt understand what I was going through and this med was driving me nearly insane!!!!	Please, I am warning you. This medication is not even worth trying to see if it cures or fixes your ailments. It has been 4 years since I took this medication and I am still fighting depression and anxiety and some depersonalization/derealization OCD issues. This medication ruined family relationships, lost the love of my life, lost my career with law enforcement. This medication is 110% POISON and let us all here and now for-warn you; DO NOT TAKE THIS. ASK FOR SOMETHING ELSE! Dont be sorry! GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL!	M	25	7  days25mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email
4	Bladder Infection	Moderate diarrhea about an hour after taking each pill even if taken with food and a full glass of water.  Black hairy tongue.  Great relief from bladder infection felt after one day.	The Augmentin probably caused a worsening of my gastritis symptoms which caused the diarrhea to be so bad.  I guess the black hairy tongue is an adverse reaction but nothing to worry about (an overgrowth of bacteria).	F	44	10  days500-125 3X D	8/7/2011Email
2	ear infection	Started taking Augmentin for an ear infection and had no side effects until the last day taking this drug, I then began to experience severe itching and nausea. The nausea has subsided but the itching has persisted. I went back to the doctor to find out what was going on with me, she had really no explanation and gave me an anti itch cream and Claratin for daytime (they dont work) and 1/2 a tablet of Hydroxyzine, which works but I can only take it at night. If it were not for this constant itching, I would have only had the one time issue with diarrhea, which was remedied by taking Augmentin on a full stomach as reccommended. I am now taking probiotics on my own to see if that will help with the constant itching		F	39	8  days 2X D	6/26/2011Email
1	sinus infection	This medicine has been awful -- took one with food last night at about 6 PM. By 9 PM my head was over the toilet, had to sleep on the bathroom floor as I needed to be able to vomit in 15 minute intervals (whether there was anything really left to throw up or not) until about 3 AM. It was at about 5 AM that the diarrhea started. All I could do today was sleep -- muscle aches and stomach was still lurching. I'm glad some people have been helped by this drug but I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital I felt so bad. Not sure I'll even be ready to go back to work tomorrow, still feel awful. The sinus infection causes headaches and am still coughing crap up from the drainage but would much rather have those symptoms than feel like my innards have been nuked!		F	53	1  days30 2X D	3/9/2011Email
1	Sinus Infection	Terrible cramps in my stomach, gassy feeling in stomach, frequent going #2.	I am on my third dose of this drug and it made me feel worse than the infection I am being treated for. Don't know how much longer I will continue to take it.	F	27	10  days 2X D	2/18/2011
4	gum irritation	Diahrrea from the very beginning and an extremely itchy rash 2 days after finishing last pill.		F	65	7  days500 2X D	6/29/2010
2	bronchitis	Queasiness, drowsiness, confusion, weight gain, constantly tired, loose stool, anxiety, slight neck pain.	It cleared up my bronchitis in 3 days, so that was good.  But the side effects were very unpleasant.  I've been sleeping 12 hours a day, and eating a lot of food with the HUGE pill to combat the gastrointestinal side effects, as my doctor recommended doing so.  I can handle the queasiness, but not coupled with grogginess and excessive sleeping. I had enough and stopped taking it after the 7th day (prescribed 10 day cycle).	M	28	7  days875 MG 2X D	5/3/2010
4	Diverticulitis	None, or at least none compared to some of the other truly vile antibiotics I've been given for this (flagyl and ciprofloxacin).   Compared to those, augmentin is a walk in the park.  I'm very happy with it.		F	59	4  days 2X D	4/6/2010
2	Inner Ear Infection	Upset stomach chronic joint pain in both feet and knee all day and night can barely walk	Have had amoxicillin before (you need to take pro biotic yogurt)However I believe the issue in most cases like me is an allergic reaction to the Clavulanic acid	M	44	7  days	8/29/2009
1	bacterial infection from surgery	severe diarrhea ( 10 to 15 BMa day, and its been this way for 8 days now. it started after my last dose) and loss of appetite. been surviving on fluids.	I would not recommend this drug even to my enemies. IT IS HORRIBLE.	F	27	2  weeks	8/26/2009
1	Tooth Abscess	Stomach ache, burning skin, diarrhea during the course of it, THREE WEEKS after being off of it, still having severe diarrhea, mucus in diarrhea, blood in diarrhea, swollen small and large intestines, breathing problems, throbbing liver, nausea, extreme backache, horrible stomach cramps.	I will never, ever take this medication again.  Cramps in stomach are so bad, it feels like labor pain.For anyone who has ever had a tooth abscess that was pretty serious, you know that it is agony in your mouth.  I would TAKE THAT PAIN ANY DAY rather than be going through what I am going through now.	F	21	5  days	7/27/2009Email
1	sinus infection	INSANE DIARRHEA, infected with clostridium difficile!	i had been sick for a week and i proceeded to get sick for 2 more weeks with insane diarrhea. i had been infected with c. difficile. i had to go to the hospital due to dehyrdation. worst time of my life. BEWARE!	F	16	7  days	3/29/2009
4		none		M	42	10  days	3/12/2009
5	sinus infection	Mild gastro issues, but it was very tolerable.	Cleared my infection, and I had much less reaction to it than other antibiotics.	F	27	7  days	12/6/2008
1	Skin Staph Infection	The first pill was no problem. After taking the second dose I became dizzy, my skin started turning red, itchy, hives, etc... very bad! Turns out I was allergic (not to the amoxicillin but the clavomax). D/C and began course of other antibiotics (erythromycin) and benadryl! That did the trick, but the effects from the allergic reaction lasted for weeks. I was a zombie, and my skin peeled starting from my finger and toe nails and ending after a week with my knees/elbows. just like pulling a glove off backwards!	Be wary of allergies, make sure that you take the second dose during the day, don't go to bed until you've cleared the 3rd dose! Your body has to be exposed once, then the reaction will come after second exposure! I still can take amoxicillin all by itself, and I'm glad of that!	F	34	1  days	10/16/2007
1	possible strep	My doctor suspected I had strep: rash on my face, fever, swollen lymph nodes. I took 2 augmentin one in the morning one at night. I had a very peculiar burning sensation in my stomach all night and didn't sleep well. I was shocked the next morning when I looked in the mirror: one eye was almost swollen shut and the rash was much more pronounced and itchy	My doctor told me to stop taking augmentin and put me on zithromax	F	54	1  days	2/6/2007
5	Urine infection	My mum was prescribed this (Not sure which Augmentin, but other name is Co-amoxiclav)  Diarrhoea, continual vomiting, itchy skin and eventually Jaundice.	Symptoms were getting worse, even though she had stopped taking the drug.  The Doctor referred her to the liver unit, suspecting cancer!  She was so bad, I thought she was going to pass away!
