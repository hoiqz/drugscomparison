4	Schizo-affective disorder / Bipolar	After starting the monthly injection of Invega Sustenna, I experienced weight gain (10 lbs.), increased urination; increase Prolactin levels, dry mouth, and severe EPS (Extrapyramidal Symptoms) or the uncontrollable urge to move. My injection site is in the shoulder and burns during the injection, which is usually sore and tender the day after. In the beginning, the soreness lasted up to a week.	All medications have side effects; Invega is no different. But, Invega has helped tremendously with my psychotic symptoms, paranoia, and hallucinations.  I feel ten times better once Ive had the injection. I still experience intrusive homicidal thoughts and the occasional desire to act out in rage when Im over stimulated by being around people. My interest in sex has taken a big downfall. EPS (Extrapyramidal Symptoms) are the worst without an additional medication to treat this side effect: I would lay down for two minutes then get up and walk the rooms of my apartment because I couldnt keep still: I had to move. With all this said, I still recommend the drug.  I wish I had known about it years ago during my struggles with all Seroquel.	M	28	7  months234 1X M	12/11/2012Email

3	Paranoid Schizophrenia	I took invega sustenna for paranoid schizophrenia because I had annoying side effects with other medications and I also developed paranoia on some days and did not want to take my meds. Invega sustenna was an easier option because it is administered monthly instead of daily. I had some weight gain but it was not as bad as the fat gained from other medications. (just a few vanity pounds)I was disatisfied with some of the side effects though. I had elevated prolactin levels which caused me to lactate. It was uncomfortable and embarrassing. I also had strange reactions with the injection site on my arms. The injection site would remain tender for a week and become very swollen. The medication also slightly burned upon injection. I went to two different doctors to get consultations about the injection site because I wanted to make sure it was not being injected incorrectly or i was having an allergic reaction. Both doctors agreed it was most likely because my muscles were tense during the		F	21	8  monthssustenna 1X M	10/21/2012

1	schizophrenia	For 4 days I experienced complete loss of the abilities to eat, drink, sip, swallow, move any limbs. Could not speak. Could not urinate nor have bowel movement. I believe because of constipation Invega became lodged in my system; built-up and nearly killed me. My family took me to the hospital.	Invega is basically time-released risperidone. Because of what happened to me I believe this drug is too risky to use.	M	34	8  months6 MG 1X D	9/24/2012Email
1	Bipolar	Mouth puckers, toes curl and spasms.. It is painful and debilitating. It comes on slowly. It was diagnosed as Tardive Dyskinesia by a neurologist. You are not warned of these possible side effects and was told later it only happens in a small per centage of patients. It happened to me	Invega can cause Tardive dyskinesia a mostly irreversible neurological disorder of involuntary movements caused by long term use of antipsychotic drugs. No cure. Worse that being bipolar for me..	F	62	2  years6mg 1X D	9/22/2012
5	Bipolar Disorder/Social Phobia	weight loss (40lbs), urinating more frequent	This medicine works the best in keeping my mood stable.  I no longer experience any symptoms of bipolar disorder and social phobia.  The only thing that I don't like about this Invega is that I have to urinate more frequently.  Also, it has help me lose almost 40lbs.  All of the medications that I have taken in the past such as lithium, seroquel, and depakote made me gain weight (50lbs).  Invega has changed my life!

3	Schizo-affective disorder	suicidal idealization, depression, no energy, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, loss of pleasure, I experienced all this from Risperdal Consta too, Invega is a metabolite of that, I noticed no difference between the medications apart from injection site bruising and swelling, and the great bonus that it is given monthly (so that I can get on with my attempt to lead a normal life)	I'm on Invega Sustenna with the additional anti-psychotic Abilify, plus 2 anti depressants Effexor and Reboxetine to keep me level headed, emotionally speaking. Without the oral meds I have 0 motivation and 0 faith in people or society, my 'happy pills' make me friendlier, and more willing to put up with people's boring bullshit and antagonistic behaviours around me, I'm still sick of being the scapegoat however and things always being 'my problem'.  I think also I have PTSD from involuntary treatment and hospitalisations, my life was ruined, THE EVIDENCE THEY USED TO COMMIT ME WAS A FABRICATION FROM A DISGRUNTLED NEIGHBOUR, who I was nothing but generous and kind towards.. I need some serious counselling or real help if I'm ever going to lead even a fraction of a normal life ever again.  The drugs made me gain weight and become lazy, I've lost 2 loves because of this, plus the stigma of being 'a drug addict'.. prescription pills but drugs all the same.

3	bipolar manic	a little dry mouth, some tensing of the right foot	Turns me more into a vulcan...not a good thing, though.  Thoughts are still a little racy and I have long discussions about esoteric subjects with the girlfriend (like math, which is not good for things like programming which require more philosophical and out-of-the-box thinking).Paranoid thoughts can be better countered through technical speak and empirical analysis with a psychiatrist.

1	Invega sustenna	INVEGA SUSTENNA is HELL ON EARTH. This has been the most horrible experience of my life. If you can imagine having a massive dose of chemical called invega injected into your butt and released in huge ammounts every day imagine something that ruins your gonads and FRYS YOUR BRAIN. This has caused me weight gain and muscle cramps as well as constant paranoia about what it has done to my gonads. The makers of this drug should be charged with developing it in long agting form. This is not a schizofrenic medication this is torture...andd i think everyone who maikes it and perscribes it already knows that. These shots will ruin many peoples lives.	Do not ever take invega sustenna. DO NOT TAKE this drug. The makers say it lasts for a month but it lasts for 2 years. Do not be fooled into reieving it if you are in a psychiatric setting take your damn invega because if they mandate these shots you are screwed.

4	Bipolar II	loss of sex drive, elevated prolactin (caused lactation, no periods), osteopenia in my hip due to the low estrogen levels resulting from the elevated prolactin.	If you are female, taking Invega, and are missing your periods/lactating you need to have a bone density scan every 2 years because of the risk of osteoporosis. That said, the trade-off is worth it for me - I have been stable for 4 years, was able to go off lithium - it took care of my psychosis and hypomania. I take Provigil to counteract the drowsiness. I also take Well-Butrin and Lamictal. Adding Invega made a huge difference.	F	41	4  years6 mg 1X D	6/7/2011

I WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT IF IT CAUSES WEIGHT GAIN BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO UNDO THE 20LBS SEROQUEL GAVE ME & I'M ON THE ATKINS DIET SINCE THESE DRUGS MESS WITH YOUR BLOOD SUGAR & METABOLISM. THIS DIET CORRECTS BLOOD SUGAR SPIKES AND THE INSULIN ISSUE WHICH CAUSES WEIGHT GAIN. MY DR SAID INVEGA HASN'T CAUSED WEIGHT GAIN IN HER OTHER PATIENTS & SHOULD WORK FOR ME. BUT WOULD IT BE BETTER TO STOP THE AS MED UNTIL I LOSE THE WEIGHT SINCE I'M NOT BIPOLAR, SCITZOPHENIC OR ANYTHING. I'M ON IT FOR PTSD, PANIC DISORDER OCDC & SLEEP! BUT IN 3 DAYS I SLEPT 9HR TOTAL!

3	Bipolar I	weight gain, drowsiness, sexual dysfunction	For one year, I took 6 mg. of Invega per day; after a year, I reduced my dosage to 3 mg. per day. It helped me think more clearly and reduced symptoms of bipolar depression. I had no manic episodes in the two years I took it.However, it made me very sleepy, even at the 3 mg. dose. I also gained quite a bit of weight. My doctor prescribed Nuvigil to counteract the sleepiness, but then my insurance company wouldn't pay for the Nuvigil anymore, and so my doctor decided to try discontinuing the Invega. The week I stopped taking Invega, I lost 6 pounds, and I continue to lose weight. All of a sudden, my interest in and response to sex has returned. My husband is thrilled and wants me never to take the Invega again. However, I now have trouble sleeping at night, I feel more depressed, and I find it harder to organize my day productively.	F	55	2  years3-6 MG 1X D	10/19/2010
3	Schizoaffective Disorder	Lactation, increased appetite(leading to slight weight gain), lethargy. I was on this drug only a few days, so I can't really tell you how much it helped with my schizoaffective disorder.	The instant I found out about this drug, I begged my doctor to put me on it, and she did. I started taking it for a few days. The minute I told my doctor the side effects Invega was giving me, she took me off the med and put me on Saphris instead. Right now, I'm on my second day, and by 10/16/10, I have to take 10mg instead of 5mg.	F	20	3  days3mg 1X D	10/14/2010

4	Schizoaffective	Weight gain, lactation	Invega worked wonders for me on my psychosis.  I stayed on it for a year and tried (with my dr's guidance) to stop taking it.  When I got off of Invega I lost a considerable amount of weight.  Unfortunatly, my psychosis came back after a few months and I had to get back on an antipsychotic.  The Invega immediately helped my mind to work properly again, but the weight quickly came back (10 lbs in less than two weeks).  I know some of that was due to my eating, but I was HUNGRY all the time.  But at the same time I was exercising several times a week to try to stop the weight gain.  I got fed up and stopped taking the Invega (on my own... not the best) and the hunger went away and I dropped the 10 lbs just as fast as I put it on.  But my psychosis came back with a vengeance and I am still trying to find the best antipsychotic for me (crossing my fingers on Geodon right now...three weeks in, no weight gain, no restlessness, and my mind is working again), but I do know that if I have to, I can go back to Invega to get stabalized, I would just have to figure out how to deal with the weight issues.

2	Bipolar/Mania	Depression with feelings of rage and irritability especially when hungry. Helplessness and feelings of inadequacy at times with more rapid-cycling. Also noticed my son making uncontrollable hand movements with his thumbs.	My son was prescribed Invega because risperidone had worked to control his rage and anger better than any other antipsychoic. His doctor wanted the effects of risperidone to last longer so this was the natural choice. Zyprexa and Seroquel were awful both bringing a dark, depressing cloud over his moods. Invega does a good job of controlling his mania and he has more periods of normalcy; however, unlike risperidone, it causes depression and irritabity that he did not experience with risperidone. I also noticed more rapid cycling with this drug and a very strong hunger-induced rage. Once he ate, he was better, but it would start up again after a few hours. I did not notice this on the riperidone, so today I made a decision to take him off of Invega and switch him back to risperidone. I would rather have the periods of mania over the uncontrollable depression, crying and anger with Invega.	M	10	1  months3 MG 1X D	7/11/2010Email
4	Bipolar Schizoaffective disorder	Weight gain especially around the middle, joint and muscle stiffness, missing or late periods	I just came off Geodon so I welcomed Invega. Risperdol caused me to lactate, (no fun in that) on top of the side effects I had with Invega. I have to say it has kept my moods stable at only 3mg, so I have room to move up if needed. No more paranoia or tactile hal. I would recommend this drug to anyone with bipolar. Again the side effects are there but I have yet to find one that has no miserable side effects at all. These are mild I think considering the benefit of the drug.	F	39	8  months3mg 1X D	5/11/2010Email
3	psychotic depression/ paranoia	The most troubling side effect was the complete erectile dysfunction/loss of feeling in that area.  I noticed a small amount of mental slowing, which was bearable.  I never got angry about anything while on it (not sure if this one's a benefit or side effect	Since I hate all drugs that take away my ability to get a hard-on (aka erectile dysfunction for all the asperger's people), I stopped taking this one after about a month.  On the positive, I believe it reduced my anxiety/paranoia/delusional thinking a small amount....not that those were huge problems for me.  Like someone else said, it is risperidone with an extra hydroxyl group.	M	27	30  days6mg 1X D	5/7/2010
2	Bipolar	Extreme intolerance to cold and heat, rapid cycling with mixed episodes became more severe, depression worsened, panic/anxiety attacks have worsened as well.	My doctor replaced Risperdal with Invega. After a week of taking 6mg a day I was experiencing alot of mania...manic rages as well. I have been experiencing rapid cycling...a lot mixed episodes between mania and depression. I have had a lot of suicidal thoughts as well. My doctor ironically raised the dosage from 6 to 12 mgs a day...??? So I took 12 mgs this morning and I have already had 2 major panic attacks within a 3 hr period. All of these symptoms were sudden and did not happen until I began taking Invega. I feel like I am back to square one with my treatment.	F	38	15  days6mg 1X D	4/13/2010
1	Bipolar Disorder	This drug made me feel like I was constantly disconnected from everything. My wife would even try to provoke fights just to get a rise out of me, to no avail. My extremely healthy sex drive has completely gone away, no desire or feeling in the region. Extremely bad nightmares would occur almost nightly. Extreme lethargy, and wanting to sleep or just lie down almost all the time. I ended up taking myself off the medication because the side effects were just too much.		M	25	1  months3-6mg 1X D	3/22/2010
4	Paranoid Schizophrenia	involuntary eye twitching, weight gain, decreased libido	I guess it helped to take away my paranoid feelings and delusional thinking. My parents say it has helped me a lot.	M	31	1  years6 mg 1X D	3/21/2010
4	Bipolar disorder	Modest weight gain, acne, poor bladder control, spontaneous sleep spells in mornings, missed periods, increased prolactin levels, drowsiness with intense physical activity, decreased to no sex drive, memory loss, slowed speech	Modest weight gain (8 lbs since going up from 6 to 12 mg), spontaneous drowsiness in mornings after getting up, missed periods, increased prolactin levels, increased sleepiness (almost to the point of falling asleep) with intense physical activity.  I go to the gym regularly to keep the weight at bay although I noticed I was the chubbiest one at my high school reunion after being on the medication for about a year. It takes me forever, if at all, to get an orgasm, and I barely have a sex drive although I have had sex more in the past 6 months than all my life (can't accuse me for not trying!).  I started smoking pot and was doing it every week for the high, but had 1 manic attack after smoking 2 days in a row even on medication.  However, despite all this I prefer Invega to Geodon, which made me really foggy.  I'm also currently taking 100 mg of Lamotrigine and 750 mg of Depakote.	F	24	 12 mg 1X D	3/12/2010History
4		Weight gain especially around the stomach area. No period at all during the medicine. Possibly low hormone levels. Sleepiness in the morning, hard time waking up.	I'm glad I found this med. because it has helped me a lot. I am not happy with the side effects though. I just found out that my hormone levels are low and I'm going to have to check my pituitary gland (I'm almost 100% sure it has to do with this med.) I haven't had my period since I started taking it and I know it's a side-effect b/c when I stop I get my period, when I start taking it again I miss my period. Wish there was something without all these side effects.	F	28	1  years6mg 1X D	3/11/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Insatiable appetite (gained 20 lbs in 4 months), eye spasms rarely, lactation & other possible hormonal side effects.	I LOVE INVEGA. It cleared my thinking, taken away the paranoia, brought me out of depression & anger, and helped me interact with people like a new person. I tried to go up to 6mg but I was gaining more weight. I am constantly hungry. But I will do anything to stay on this drug because it's helped me so much.	F	39	4  months3mg 1X D	3/5/2010
5	Schizoeffective Disorder	I started off with 6 mg the first couple of days and was bouncing off the walls so I reduced it down to 3mg, with aid from the doctor, and have been stable for 2 years.  Weight gain was gradual of 20 lbs over the 2 years. At 5'-2" and 160 lbs now, I feel like a piglet - the stomach keeps getting bigger.  I guess I need more exercise.	Since taking that horrible Zyprexa for a long time, Invega seemed like a God-send to me.  My thinking sharpened up and life was good again.   I finally got my sense of well being back!  I would say it is like a miracle drug!  I recommend working with the issues, if you have any with it, and adjust to the dosage that works best for you!  Low for me was better.

2	bipolar affective disorder	I have gained 30 pounds in 4 months.  My sleep quality has seriously deteriorated and I experience bad dreams.  I am more lethargic than ever and my depression has worsened. The side effects of Invega mean that it's not a particularly good tradeoff to avoid mania, but I guess for me it's been better than risperidol which gave me a real drugged feeling.	One positive thing to say is that I felt as though the fog had been lifted from me after I was taken off of risperidol and put on invega.	M	49	4  months9 mg 1X D	2/24/2010
4	Bipolar	Cognitive dulling, some troubles with finding/using words where I would prior have had no trouble, my ability to type the right letters took an instance dive (it was crazy how messed up it was) and didn't entirely improve - like my brain and fingers couldn't communicate properly, memory troubles (hard to pin down for certain, but I think Invega played a definite role), bye bye sex drive - and weird/no ejaculations, and it just sort of dampened my personality - more than just taking away the mania, it just made me sorta ho-hum	Despite the side effects - the most troublesome for me/my occupation being cognitive dulling (though losing my previously strong libido sucked too) - I'm glad I tried this med. It worked fast and helped to get my mania in check and keep my mood more stable.  It helped with my paranoia issues too.  I started at 3mg and went to 9mg, which is where I stayed for most of the time I was on it.  The bump to 6mg brought the most noticeable therapeutic benefit jump.  All the side effects appeared at the 3mg level and pretty much right away - though perhaps the memory thing was more apparent with time.  I'm really glad I'm now cleared to be off it, since I'm "stable" again, but I wouldn't hesitate to use it again for mania.	M	34	1  years9 1X D	2/16/2010
1	BIPOLAR	AKATHISIA: A neurologic side effect of antipsychotic medication, another neuroleptic induced movement disorder that is reversible by lowering the dose of the anitpsychotic or changing to another one that does not cause this terrible feeling subjectively of restlessness and objective evidence like pacing the units cant sit still, its horrible.	Would never take again, was up all night pace walking in my house.  My doctor thought i was crazy, and that it was my psychotic symptoms i was talking about.  The doctor said i was non compliant with my medicine, and refused to treat me.  This  happened because i refused to take my meds because of getting akathisia.	F	28	3  days	1/21/2010
2	schizoaffective	terrible dreams, weight issues, depressed, no sexual drive	i'm taking the shot.  I'm not sure how much longer I can take this crappy feeling.  I take it with wellbutrin to kinda wake me up a bit which works, but I don't know.  The dreams are the worst part.	M	36	4  months	1/3/2010
1	Supposed psychosis	Muscle spasms in my face and marked memory loss, so has everyone else I know who took Invega.	Myself and all my friends who take Invega or Risperdal have a grimace that keeps returning to our faces at intervals, as well as Alzheimers-type memory loss.  Oh, and a general impatient, miserable feeling from it.  To the creators of all these psychiatric poisons-- May the cat eat you and may the Devil eat the cat!	M	24	80  days	12/29/2009
2	Bipolar	Eye movements which were out of my control during the first week at night as well as light flashes.  Extreme weight gain (I am 5-6 and 125 lbs and after 2 weeks I am 140!).  Lethargic.  Very mellow.  Not enthusiastic with my toddlers.  Worn out.	I consulted with my psychiatrist and will go off of this medication.  Weight gain is too depressing.	F	36	2  weeks	12/14/2009
4	Psychotic depression	Terrible puffiness in the face. I didn't gain that much weight, but my face is swollen.	It keeps the voices and unreal thoughts at bay, but my depression is as bad as ever. I have tried Paxil, Trileptal, Wellbutrin, and Lamictal for the depression and nothing works. I also have anxiety and social phobia, but I can't say that's caused by the Invega--at any rate, it doesn't treat it. But, as I said, I at least am not swimming in confusion.	M	32	2  years	10/29/2009
5	Bipolar disorder	Some reaction to extreme heat.  When I exercise I have to watch out for overheating.  I swim and it helps tremendously with any stiffness that may be caused by the drug. I took risperdal and had significant side effects lack or muscular control, lack of sweating (heating and cooling problems) and drowsiness.  The effects of Invega are very rare and tolerable for the benefit of the drug's effectiveness in balancing my mood disorder.	I have taken the drug two years.  When I started at about 6 mgs we upped it to 9 after a month.  I went up to 12mg but that was too much.  So, it took about three months to get a balance. This drug has been a miracle drug for me. I take it in combination with Citalopram an antidepresant. I also have vistiral as an anxiety drug as needed.  I sleep wonderfully at night. However, sometimes I go to bed as early as 8:00 PM if I am working hard, busy.  So for me the drowsiness increases with my physical activity. I am hoping more exercise will help with the drowsiness at night so early.	F	43	2  years	10/28/2009
5	Bipolar I w/psychotic features	Hypomanic episodes & extrapyrimidal eye movements the first 2 weeks. They were easily managed with Klonopin & Benedryl. Only lost 1 1/2 night's sleep.  Now, at the end of 4th week, the only side effect is weight gain. But it is an easy choice to continue taking this med, even with some weight gain, because of how it has changed my life.	This drug is simply FABULOUS! It completely cleared my thinking & allowed my personality & feelings to come through without all the anger, irritability & intensity I have always experienced. I have no drugged feeling at all. I struggle with Borderline Personality Disorder & this drug has allowed me to manage my emotions and interpersonal relationships like never before. The only other time I've felt this kind of peace was when I took Risperdal. Thank you to the makers of this drug. It has revolutionized my life and positively affected my friends, family & co-workers. Absolute miracle for me!!!	F	39	1  months	10/22/2009Email
1	bipolar	Do not like Invega, same as Risperidone.	Risperidone is the same as Invega but Risperidone is much cheaper because its generic.  I hate Invega, weight gain, chance of diabetes, and very expensive, sexual dysfunction with increase of prolactin levels.	M	29	2  years	10/9/2009
2	Paranoid Schizophrenia/Bipolar	Besides extreme weight gain (40lbs in 6 months) and increased appetite, I did not experience any other side effects. Did not enjoy being (borderline) overweight- being fat made me miserable, especially since I've suffered from food and body image problems/eating disorders for most of my life as well.	Not a bad drug, but I'm not sure I really needed to be on it in the first place.. since I've been off it, I've had no psychotic symptoms delusions/depression/mania at all. I have also lost most of the weight I gained (35lbs) on the drug, thank god. Would never go back on it again.	F	24	10  months	8/27/2009

4	Depression, BPD	Missing periods	I have been taking this med for about a month and a half. It works fabulous for my depression, best med ever to do this. However, my periods are missing. But that's the only side effect.	F	18	1.5  months	5/7/2009

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.	F	41	5  months15mg 1X D	1/2/2012Email
3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
