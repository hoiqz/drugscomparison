2	BIRTH CONTROL	I was on Yaz for 2 years but started to experience vein swelling and pain in my legs. Along with permanent spider and Varicose veins in my legs!!! At only 23, so upsetting:( Anyway I switched to Lessina, and now 6 months in I am plagued with erythema nodosum (red swollen painful lumps in legs) which is an immune response I'm having to Lessia. So I'll now be geting off Lessina :(		F	24	6  months 1X D	5/29/2010
