5	to prevent pregnancy	I love this birth control. I have been taking it since last march and it works perfectly. I have regularly periods, cramps only last 1 day maybe the half of day 2. I've always had crazy mood swings so the pill doesn't Really affect me there and I haven't gotten pregnant. Yay to Trivora!		F	19	1  years28	5/7/2013
2	prevent pregnancy	I originally was on depo provera and was loving it but however needed to have a period, first switched to trinessa which I was experiencing nausia, lower back pain, bad cramps, exhaustion and mild sore boobs. Then my family physician switched me to trivora ( had been on it when I was about 18 or 19 and had no problem with it). Well my nausia had got really bad, I would over heat, many time I ate, I would get nausiated and sick to my stomach, my boobs hurt constantly, had constipation, lower back pain, really horrible abdominal cramps, first month had long period and 2nd month had spottin first day then light light period for 2 maybe three days, and also have horrible headaches, seriosuly making me think I am pregnant and also been asked more than a few time if I am indeed pregnant. Don't really know if all this is from trivora but none of these are going away. I'm talking to my birth control doctor this month to see if I should switch.		F	22	3  months28	9/9/2012

1		Started going to a new dr. and he felt that the dose contained in my previous pills was too high. I have tried everything from the patch, depo (which gave me a light period for 6 months straight) and various brands of pills. Since staring trivora I have basically turned into a basket case. I have been experiencing bouts of depression, anxiety, and severe mood swings where I find myself gettig very angry for no apparent reason. All of this is accompanied by sporadic crying fits that I cannot seem to control. It is comforting to know that other people were having similar experiences... I will be calling my dr. on Monday to get a different pill!		F	31	9  months	8/11/2012Email

2	To not get pregnant.	Yeast infection, irritability, more anxious,nausea, sleeplessness, headaches, emotional, loss of appetite.  Less acne.		F	32	10  weeks?	4/27/2012
3	removal of IUD	I had my IUD removed for some time now. After removal I gave my self time to get back to norm. But I don't like the feeling of worrying about when my period coming when I ovulate or being in the heat of the moment. My doctor originally prescribed DEPO. I took the prescription home never got it processed that was November. I went back to the doctor feb. For STI panel and hand him bk. Prescription stating DEPO want be for me when he suggested the pill....now I'm not good at time nor swallowing but for now it ain't bad. A little nausea, bowl movement, increase hunger, irritable and moody..naw I can't say it is so bad as of now. Moving forward I just hope it suit the purpose. I will not allow my hormones to get out of wack.		F	32	8  days50	3/4/2012Email
1	Birth Control	EXTREME weight gain. I was on the Depo shot for about two years. That worked great for me but I was terrified of needles and had to stop getting it because it was stressing me out. I switched to the pill. I hate it. I gained so much weight. 20 lbs. And I cannot, for the life of me, lose it. It was so rapid I thought there was something wrong.		F	21	2  years 1X D	1/8/2012
1	Birth Control	Mood swings, NO SEX DRIVE!	I have been on this pill for several years and have had no sex drive. I thought it was just stress in life but after doing some research I am finding this is a major side effect. It's ruining my new marriage and is not good. I also have terrible mood swings for no reason. I am not depressed but get angry easily which I am typically not that type of person. Will discontinue immediately.

1	birth control	constant headaches, nauseau, late cycle, weight gain, appetitie increased, never feel full, low sex drive, cranky and emotional		F	38	45  days 1X D	10/3/2011Email
3	Preventing pregnancy	Increased sex drive (yay), increased appetite, weight gain, irritability, constant fatigue	I wouldn't mind taking this if it weren't for the weight gain. It is very hard for me to maintain my weight due to physical reasons, and just when I was finally satisfied with my weight I was set back due to this pill. It beats getting preggers though. I can deal with everything else. I just wish it didn't make me CONSTANTLY HUNGRY or tired.I hope the symptoms don't increase over time; I've only been taking it for 16 days.	F	22	16  days 1X D	9/21/2011
5		Had to post after reading all of the negative comments.  Ive been on trivora for years,  I have no spotting,  i have 2 day periods, no weight gain, great sex drive, no achene, no thinning hair.  Very light cramps,  and typical modswings 2 days before starting.  And best of all im not pregnant.  It been great.  No complaints!			34	6  days 1X D	9/16/2011
1	Couldn't afford name brand	I had the most AWFUL incessant itching in my breasts with Trivora.		F	37	60  days 1X D	2/2/2011
2	Birth Control	I am usually a very calm and collected person and this drug has made me become just the opposite of that.  I feel like crying all the time for no reason.  Minor problems seem like much bigger issues to me so I stress out very often.  Somewhat depressed and my sex drive has decreased significantly.  I originally was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo which gave me very little side effects.  I switched because of money issues and also I had felt Ortho-Tri-Cyclen Lo had made me gain some weight.  Now I think i'd rather have a few extra pounds instead of the emotional insecurity this pill has caused.  I'm switching back at the end of this month.  It's worth to pay some extra money for Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo.		F	26	6  months 1X D	1/6/2011
1	Birth Control	nausea, fatigue, breast tenderness, increased appetite, low sex drive	I started taking trivora about eight months ago and since then I have had absolutely no sex drive, an hour after i take my pill i have horrible nausea, i'm always exhausted, my breasts almost always hurt, and I'm never full. I also noticed my discharge is much heavier and thicker and has an awful smell that i have never had before. I do not have any sexual diseases so the smell does not make sense. I have problems sleeping and am always depressed. My periods are shorter, but they also come late in the month and give me that worry of a pregnancy. This is not the birth control for me and I feel that looking at the comments, most people in my age frame have the same problems. I understand that it is one of the cheapest birth controls out there, but I'm starting to realize that for a little more money a month all of these problems could go away.	F	21	8  months 1X D	11/22/2010
1	Birth Control	monthly "yeast infections," no labido, increased anxiety and depression, sore breasts, crazy mood swings, bloating and water retention.	I dont have insurance and this is what my doctor prescribed me, so I have to tough it out one more month until I can get my insurance back and see my doctor. I was on Enpresse which was also not a good fit(again no health insurance=no ability to change) for awhile but SAFEWAY likes to switch back and forth between the pills because they will only carry what is cheaper. So in the last year I have been on Enpresse, then Trivora, then Enpresse again, and now Trivora. Seriously. Anyways, I have had monthly "yeast infections" and by that I mean my discharge becomes the consistency of Elmers Glue which happens around my 3rd week, and that is about the time my mood swings and sex drive take a dive also. Its so consistent my boyfriend can count the days before my period just by the side effects. I cry all the time, feel horrible about myself because not only does my self esteem take a dive,I gain about 3lbs in water weight which disapear when my period starts. I have not experienced permanent weight gain because I have been on the pill so long, I am sure that happened a few years ago. I would not reccommend this pill to anyone and I would certainly not recommend filling any perscriptions at Safeway.	F	22	1  years 1X D	11/16/2010
3	birth control	weight gain	I seemed to have gained a lot of weight lately. Has anyone else had this problem? I am 43 and have been taking this for 5 years. It seems that in the last 2 years I've put on more and more weight.	F	43	5  years 1X D	10/27/2010Email
3	Birth Control	none so far	I'm starting to worry...came on to see what other people had to say because I've been feeling so unbelievably sluggish and tired the past 2 days and was wondering if the new birth control I'm on is the reason?Has anyone else experienced feeling tired this early on? I'm only on my 2nd day!I'm praying the side effects don't get worse!	F	22	2  daysunsure 1X D	10/23/2010Email
1	Prevent pregnancy	nausea, tiredness, worthlessness, and major depression	I haven't been on trivora for that long, i was originally on Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo and I loved it.  I was on it since I was in highschool, and recently swithched.  I had to change when we got new insurance!  i wouldn't recommend this pill to anybody! I feel irratable all the time, cry for no reason, and i feel so depressed that i feel like doing something bad.  I'm so glad that there's other girls on here that are experiencing the same side effects as me!   As soon as I had my period it was like I had relief of all the symptoms.  Then i started taking it again, and i started feeling depressed again.  I quit taking it immediately!  i can't wait for things to get back normal!	F	25	9  months28 1X D	9/28/2010
3	birth control	nausea, breast tenderness, increase appetite, tiredness, moody	I had taken this years ago over a period of two years, then ceased all birth control methods for about a year. The side effects seem to have increased now.	F	28	28  days 1X D	9/15/2010
4	BC	when i first started taking it i had headaches and my weight didnt change but i went off it for a month too see if my mood swings would change (witch they didnt) and I GAINED WEIGHT.. so i got back on it and my weight hasnt changed. overall no problems.	i think its a pretty decent birth control. i have heard worse stuff about others.	F	17	8  months 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Birth control	-cleared up back acne-increased breast size-lightened period SUBSTANTIALLY-shortened period to 4 days-depression-random irrated fits-paranoia-insecurity	While Trivora helped me with several physical issues such as severe back acne I had been struggling with for 5 years and lightening my normally extremely heavy periods it had its down sides. The medication substantially hurt my mood and I developed some extreme paranoia and small details that I never would notice had me in tears. The moods cannot be predicted either, they are not only during my period week, they continue through-out the month. I have been trying to wait it out for the full 3 months recommended, but now that I am onto the first week of my 3rd month, I am positive I will be switching when the time comes.	F	19	28  days 1X D	6/17/2010
5	elimate PMS and reduce migraines	no side effects	I took Trivora primarly to reduce PMS and migraines and when sexually active as a form of B/C. Last year I went off B/C to give my body a rest and see if my PMS and migraines would come back. Keep in mind I would skip the placebo and not have a period to avoid PMS and migraines. I would allow myself to have a period twice a year.During this year my migraines have returned, especially in the last six months and in the last two months my PMS is worse than ever in my life. Possibly I am entering periomenopause. I am going back on Trivora after my period this month since it was so helpful for many years. Too early for horomone replacement therapy.	F	43	7  years 1X D	6/7/2010
4	Birthcontrol & cysts on ovaries	bad acne a week before period, beautiful skin the rest of the month. Heavy flow on time of period, spotting before period. very moody, an have depression issues.	i like taking trivora. it keeps the cysts away, which are very painful to have on your ovaries. It gives me nice skin, and helps with back acne alot.	F	15	2  years 1X D	6/6/2010
1	regulate the cycle, clear acne	cramps, severe stomach cramping, vaginal discomfort and severe pain, headaches, pain in the calf, sudden shortness of breath, unusual tiredness, irritability, mood swings, depression, lost appetite, weight loss(i was already 100 pounds, and my mother now thinks im anorexic), nausa, and it hasn't helped acne, which is one of the main reasons i was taking it.	sure, trivora helped the cramps during my period, but not during the rest of the month, i've been getting them worse than ever, but in my legs especially. i can't eat anymore without wanting to throw up, and i've lost 6 pounds within the first month. with all of the side effects, i hate taking this medication and i plan on going off it and trying my 3rd birth control pill.	F	15	1  months 1X D	5/27/2010
4	having sex	i think im more moody and more mean, i sometimes get headaches but im not sure if the pill is the reason why. i do feel nauseated sometimes. when i take my pill i feel as if its harder for me to breath and raises my heart rate?..witch i think maybe because of stress and anxiety	i barely have side effects.	F	16	6  months 1X D	5/9/2010
4	Birth Control	None to mild.	I have been very, very happy with Trivora. No side effects to speak of. I do feel very sick if I miss a pill and have to take 2 at a time...now I just try to do that on a full stomach. Perhaps a slight weight loss ~3lbs...I say that because recently went off Trivora and gained a few pounds. I went off Trivora to get pregnant and got pregnant within 3 months.	F	42	5  years 1X D	5/6/2010
3	Birth Control	Weight gain? Gagging/Nausea, extended period, breast growth	My periods do not start on the 'placebo' week (it starts monday I start sat) I use to have heavy bleeding for 2-3 days, now I have medium to heavy bleeding 7-8 days. Cramps and headaches still occur week prior to period. Breast have gone from large C to small DD. Possible weight gain from this.Worse symptom I have which just recently started -after about 11 months on it- is I am gagging all the time, and not as a reaction to something I could just be walking through my house and then I will gag and cough and nearly throw up. And oh if I am to smell something or think of a food which may make me feel sick I am ready to throw up in a quick second.	F	20	13  months 1X D	3/12/2010
1	birthcontrol	anxiety, depression, increased appetite	switched because of insurance...worst mistake ever...ive never had a problem with anxiety or depression but this has been the month from hell...anxiety constantly for reasons i normally wouldnt be stressed about...want to cry and do nothing... want to eat everything and my face is breaking out a little more than usual...this sucks...switching to cesia next week yay	F	20	1  months 1X D	3/5/2010
1	Regulate periods + Contraceptive	Tired all the time, irritable for just about no reason. majorly depressed, very emotional. breast tenderness and wonderful weight gain even with appetite loss.	I have been on Trivora 28 for about 18 day now. I don't like it at all. My breasts are so sore it hurts to even wash in the shower, put on a bra, etc. All I want to do is sleep and be lazy. I have no motivation to do very much of anything.	F	16	18  days 1X D	2/23/2010
5	Birth Control	None	I've been taking Trivora for approx. 5 years and haven't experienced any negative symptoms (no weight gain, cramping, abnormal emotional lows or anything of the sort), thankfully. I should also say that it seems to treat acne, and has given me lighter periods with minimal-no cramping.  Every now and then I'll use Trivora back to back as well, with no problems (ie, missing a period completely by skipping over the placebo week and going straight to the first pill in the next packet).  Overall I recommend Trivora.	F	21	5  years	12/21/2009
5	birth control	mild acne	I have had no large side effects from this BC. I was on Ortho-Tri before and it made me feel very depressed.Then I was on Yaz and I had terrible spotting every month as well as mood swings. Next, I was on a random mono-phasic BC that caused me to have spotting but my mood was balanced again. Finally, I found Tri-Vora. This BC is a perfect balance for me. I have light 2 day periods and no mood swings. To those of you who are experiencing troubles, I would suggest talking to your doctor about the pro's and con's of every birth control you have ever taken. Let them help you find one that is good for you! Keep trying if you are not satisfied!	F	21	2  years	11/20/2009
2	prevent pregnancy	Bloating/weight gain, breakouts and increased moodiness	I've been on this for two months (new job/new insurance and can't get Ortho Tricyclen LO anymore). I've had two horrible breakouts and despite having just run a half marathon and working out/eating right religiously, I'm quickly gaining weight. I also blow up over stupid stuff during weeks 1/2 of the pills. My poor husband, thankfully he's patient.	F	28	2  months	11/14/2009
1	Prevent Pregnancy	Extreme weight gain, complete loss of libido, breakthrough bleeding, thinning hair	I switched to this about 3 years ago due to health insurance coverage.  I gained about 50 pounds in a year that could not be explained by my primary physician, endo and gyno.  All 3 denied that I could gain that much weight from a BCP.  Completely lost libido, hair started thinning and have 2 periods a month due to a week of breakthrough bleeding in the middle of the month.  TERRIBLE!!!	F	26	3  years	10/16/2009
4	birth control	I dont know if it was the trivora. But i get yeast infections quite often, like monthly, low sex drive, tired alot, very emotional.	I have taken Trivora for about 10 years. I started out at age 16 taking Ortho Novum. Havent had any bad problems that i know of because of the Pill. but who knows.	F	35	10  years	10/2/2009Email
5	Birth Control	None whatsoever!	I've been taking Trivora for 8 years and never once have had a problem.	F	27	8  years	9/14/2009
3	Avoid Pregnancy	Nausea first month awful, nausea when lying in bed, pain when inserting tampon, low sex drive, vaginal tearing, out of control emotions.	Im not sure if this is because of Trivora but every time I try to have intercourse I rip at the back of my vagina, went to gyno, she said everything with me is fine (not an STD etc). Hoping to switch birth controls soon.	F	19	1  years	9/2/2009
3	BC	Discharge, spotting a week before period, period went from 4 days to 7 days.	I experience no mood swings or weight gain however I began spotting a week before my scheduled period.  Discharge continually increased.  Am stopping taking this pill	F	27	4  months	7/9/2009
1	Birth Conrol	Fast Weight Gain, Loss of Sex Drive, Mood Swings	I was on Trivora for about 6 weeks when I noticed my clothes no longer fit right. I was worried and started working out & dieting religiously. 3 months later I'm 22 pounds heavier and I can't lose any of the weight. I've been off Trivora for 8 days now and I would never recommend this pill to another person. I spoke with my pharmacist and she said that she's only heard bad things about this one too.	F	30	4  months	7/6/2009
2	prevent pregnancy	very emotional, anxiety and easily irritated	I have been taking Trivora for about two years now and the side effects are getting worse. I feel like a changed person and I get very emotional and irritated with the small little things. I also get anxiety and cry for no reason. I do like the pill because of the short lighter periods  but I think it is time to switch.	F	21	2  years	6/26/2009
2	regulate cycle	very emotional, feelings of hopelessness, break-thru bleeding for the entire month, bloating	I was on these pill a few years ago, and I remember having feelings of sadness.  I felt a little better after reading the responses on this website, this makes me feel less alone.  I don't think I can continue taking these pills.	F	33	2  months	6/22/2009
3	Regulate my cycle	I totally lost my sex drive. I had absolutely no desire to do anything.  I just asked to change my birth control- I start a new one today, we'll see how this works out.	Other than losing sex drive, I didn't start my cycle on the day of the "period pills". I didn't start for almost a week after I started a new set, so I did wonder if I could be pregnant.  All my other birth control pills, I normally started a day or two after taking the period pills.	F	31	60  days	6/3/2009Email
5	pregnancy prevention.	during the first month of taking it i got moody. but that was definitely temporary and my mood actually got a lot better after the first month or two. i get slightly bloated during the third week of each pack. my sex drive is up and down, but mostly increased.	i love trivora!. i have very light periods and my mind is completely at ease about pregnancy.	F	18	8  months	4/5/2009
2	birth control	acne, mood swings, cramps, fatigue	I have not had acne breakouts since my early 20s, and now I am all of a sudden getting bad breakouts on my neck and jaw line.  I have also experienced mood swings and mild depression.  Additionally, I am experiencing cramping.  On the positive side, I guess, my appetite seems slightly suppressed so I have experienced a slight weight loss.  The acne is the least tolerable side effect as prior to taking Trivora I had a clear complexion.	F	31	4  months	3/30/2009
2	regulate cycle	horrible nausea. i feel like i could throw up at any time although i havnt and dont think i will. it is very uncomfortable feeling. no other side effects so far	with in hours of taking the first pill i just felt wrong in the tummy. i am hoping that it will pass so but if not im calling my doctor back.	F	31	5  days	3/20/2009
1	Birth control	cramps,breast tenderness, nausea, and extremely moody.	I thought I was the only one that had these problems with this pill. My doc put me on these because it is what my insurance covers. I had been on others before and Orthro Tri made me crazy. I have tried it all. I was fine at first. It has been the last 2 years where I have felt like I have lost my mind. It is the same time every single month! When I finish up the white pills and go to the pink. I blow up at everything! My husband and I just had a fight about something stupid and I came on here to look up information. I am calling my doctor and switching. I can;t stand feeling insane!!	F	29	4  years	2/18/2009
1	BC Pill	Anxiety, Depression, WEIGHT GAIN (although the gynecologist acted like that was impossible BULL SHIT!) Fatigue, Nausea	Stop believing the hype the pharmaceutical companies pump out to you. BC pills are far from healthy and are not the same as the hormones circulating in your body. I had to go through hell to find that out. The Doctors are clueless and the pharmaceutical companies laugh all the way to the bank. Condoms and some common sense go a long way when compared to this shit....	F	25	1  years	2/6/2009
2	birth control	loss of sex drive, weaker orgasms, fatigue, irritability	I just feel like I am not the same person. My insurance company stopped carrying the name brand Tri-Levelen and automatically switched me to Trivora. I took them for 3 months thinking that this was pregnancy related side effect but the side effects are only getting worse not better. I have called my insurance company to see if I can make a switch!	F	29	3  months	1/23/2009
2	prevent pregnancy	acne,decrease in appetite(which explains the weight loss), depression, mood swing, decrease libido' but on the plus side no cramps and shorter periods!!!	Wow all this time I was trying to figure out what was wrong with me and thought that it was after pregnancy effects had something to do with the side effects but reading the other comments I finally found the culprit. This pill should be a last resort.	F	32	1  years	1/21/2009
2	BC, cycle regulation, acne	weight gain, bloating	I gained about 20 pounds during the nine months I took this pill even though I didn't change my eating habits or exercise routine. And no matter what I did, I could not get rid of it. It was really frustrating. I've been off it for almost a month now and while I haven't lost any of the weight yet, I do feel less bloated.	F	22	9  months	1/20/2009
1	BC	Absolutely horrible. Weight gain, fatigue, nausea, and depression	never again	F	22	1  years	1/12/2009
5	Birth Control	Leveled cravings and I actually started losing weight again while taking it	I finally found my lost libido!!!	F	34	2  years	1/5/2009
5	Birth Control	I havent had any side effects.	I have been on trivora for about 1 year now. And i have not had any side effects. My weight is the same, the sex drive is the same, and I dont have any mood swings. The only thing that I get is headaches when I am about to start my period.	F	20	1  years	11/29/2008
1	acne	EXTREME weight gain, depression, acne, mood swings	My sixteen year old daughter was put on Trivora to help clear up her acne. Within 6 months she gained 23 pounds, her acne became worse, and she fought mood swings and depression. She felt like her body was " just not right." We had her tested for other conditions not realizing it was related to the pill--but it all was. She is now off of it and is feeling much better. After the experience we have had, I would not recommend this pill to anyone.	F	16	6  days	11/21/2008
1		Do not take this B.C. It makes me crazy...I thought it would get better overtime, but my symptoms are worse. I am angry all the time, moody, I cry for no reason, and I am extremely bloated the week before my period. This is my last week taking Trivora. I will never take this again.	I never thought that I felt like this because of my birthcontrol until I took a month off and did not take the birth control. My sex drive came back, I had a normal appetite, and my mood swings were gone. This B.C. was not for me.	F	24	2  years	11/18/2008
2	My husband and I do not want kids	Weight gain, loss of sex drive...just feeling like im not attractive anymore just a fat blob. its supposed to help with fatigue and i get tired easier than usual.	the other BC i was on before did not make me gain this much weight, this is riduculous!! It would make more sense for the hormones to help you balance yourself out and not gain as much weight. i liked it better when i didnt take it.	F	21	4  months	11/6/2008
5	birth control	nausea, no sex drive, cramps	Bring Back Triphasil or Trilevlen generics sucks	F	34	4  days	11/5/2008
1	irregular periods	mood swings, severe depression, anxiety, headaches	I have been taking this BC for almost a full year now. I didn't notice severe symptoms for the first few months but they have progressively been getting worse and worse.  I have been dealing with the side effects and I dind't realize they could be directly connected to Trivora until i came across this website.  I have been very depressed and extremely emotional and irritable.  This usually happens the entire week before i get my period.  Does anyone have any suggestions for a better birth control without these horrible side effects?	F	25	1  years	11/4/2008
1	Was taken off Depo-Provera	Breast tenderness, no sex drive, headaches, cramping, stomach pains.	I am hopeful these side effects will go away. I don't wish this on anyone.	F	27	10  days	10/30/2008

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
