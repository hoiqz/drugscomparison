3	chronic migraine	I was actually on Tylenol #3 (same as #1, but with caffeine added). Nausea was the primary side effect, although I also experienced nausea from the migraine headaches I had. Took this med from the time I was about 5 or 6 years old until I was in my early twenties. I have never had a strong libido and I just found out that lack of libido is a side effect of this drug. I wonder if I am still experiencing lack of libido many years later because I took this drug for so long. No major side effects other than that.	I suffered from chronic, SEVERE migraine headaches (with aura) from the time I was an infant up to my early twenties (when they tapered off and finally stopped). If I took my dose at the EARLIEST sign of a migraine, then this stuff did a pretty good job of lessening the severity/duration, but would never eliminate the migraine completely. Worked pretty well, but not great.	F	38	20  years30mg 1X AN	4/4/2010Email
4	migraines	none	Unlike many people, I never had any problems taking this medicine. I could take this before sleeping and never experience nightmares, which are a frequent concern for some people. It's fairly weak though, and absolutely not suitable to stop pain stronger than a migraine headache such as an acute injury.	M	26	7  years	12/21/2009
3	post surgical pain	Nausea and vomiting	It worked for awhile to relieve pain but made me throw up after about a day.	F	36	1  days	10/20/2009
3	Chronic back pain	Dry mouth. Constipation. Sleepy. Make sure you drink extra water because this drug can cause constipation.	After trying several narcotics for back pain, this one seems to work better than most. It doesn't knock you out, but it can make you feel sleepy at times. But I can take it at work and still function. It helps ease the pain, but doesn't eliminate it.	F	50	1  months	6/10/2008
5	Menstrual Cramps	Constipation, fatigue	It took almost an hour for it to kick in, but it worked well all day. I did feel a little tired and was very constipated during the time that I took it. I also felt kind of happy when I took 2 or 3 at time.	F	17	4  days	2/15/2008
4	various pains	Constipation	Stronger pain relief when a plain tylenol doesn't cut it.  Also stops coughing when taking during a cold.	M	37	15  years	9/4/2007
4	Headaches	If taken late a night the caffeine makes it harder to sleep.	This is the best medicine if you have a light fever or a stronger than usual headache.  It is no where as strong as percocet but certainly does the job.  It also works very well with hangovers.	M	28	10  years	2/11/2007
3	major tooth and ear pain	it makes you a little sleepy...but its hard to sleep cuz you're still in so much pain!	I would recommend taking it with an advil or excedrine..till you can get in to see the dentist.	F	28	2  weeks	1/13/2007Email

1	induced abortion	no side effects	I was given this drug by Planned Parenthood to take home while having the induced abortion at home; pain is equal to childbirth contructions. The drug did nothing to me, though they said it would help.	F	20	1  days	5/10/2006
1	Dental pain	None.	My tooth still hurt after taking this pain medication it just didn't kill the pain. I'v taken tylenol 1 and 3 they still don't seem to work that well as narcotic pain killers.	M	23	1  weeks	11/5/2004Email
