1	AFib or possible PVCs	BP is very high (169/119) and just not feeling well.  Also, some strange feelings  in my head.	I know I've only been on this medicine for a couple of days but I have been on so many different medications for the past year and have exp. more side effects than the doctors expected.  The side-effects are documented and many times the doctors are suprise or they say "that's a possibility"; however, they never disclose these side-effects up front.  I will see how I feel within the next couple of days.  If my pressure continues to be high, I plan to stop taking this medicine regardlesss what the doctor says.	F	51	2  days200mg 2X D	11/4/2011Email
