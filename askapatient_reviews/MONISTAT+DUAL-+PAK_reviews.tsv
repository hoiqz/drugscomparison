5	First-Time Yeast Infection	None! :D	This product is awesome.  I used it before going to bed a few nights ago and it worked like a champ.  I have continued to use the topical treatment and will through the recommended 7 days to be sure this YI is kicked in the ass!  I have "sensitive" skin and had no adverse reaction (like the horror stories of pain/burning/etc I had read).  The topical treatment started working immediately and really soothed my cranky and tender skin.  Like others have mentioned, wear a panty liner if you are concerned about the discharge factor... I would definitely recommend this product!	F	22	 	9/17/2008
4	yeast infection	leaky leaky!	Some uncomfortable awareness of my vaginal area-- more than just the yeast infection, but no major pain like others have described.	F	25	1  days	9/26/2007
4	yeast infection	minor increase of itching/burning after inserting ovule and upon application of vuvular cream.  TONS of leakage on first night and a steady but very mild cramp.  however, it seems to be doing the trick and that makes it totally worth it.	i used the one day treatment because the itching was absolutely unbearable.  there was a period of about 15 minutes after insertion where the pain got a lot worse, but i figured it was a small price to pay and it passed.  24 hours later i have minor tenderness/burning, but nothing like before and the external cream helps.ADVICE: make sure you'll have a couple hours to yourself after insertion and keep pany liners on hand because there was a lot of messy leakage.
