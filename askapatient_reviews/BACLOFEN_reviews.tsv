3	Degenerative disc, stenosis, MS	Drowsiness, unsteady balance and more clumsy gait	I started on Baclofen to replace Valium, which gave me a hang over.  The muscle spasms in my legs would last for hours but have somewhat subsided since I started taking Baclofen.  Unfortunately I have developed regular foot cramping in both feet and electric shock sensations in both legs that Baclofen does not seem to help.	M	42	10  months10 mg 3X D	3/7/2013Email
4	Cerebral Palsy	Been on this as long as I can remember, main side effect is tiredness		F	29	20  years10mg 3X D	1/21/2013
1	Cerebral Palsy	Anxiety, digestive problems, stiffness, dry peeling skin, join pain, burning sensation in skin all over body, swelling of hands, arms and legs and feet. Urinary incontanence,  two kidney stones. I think I have all the Rare/Severe side affects.	I took Baclofen for 10 years, starting with 60 mg/day. I worked up to that dose under a Dr's guidance. It worked well for muscle spastiscity for about 5 years, then things started to go bad. At first, I had such weakness in my legs that I couldn't move, so I cut back to 40 mg/day. Then stiffness,and anxiety along with incontinance. I had no idea that all this was from the Baclofen! I just thought it was because I was aging. This past May things EXPLODED. I woke up swollen, (I blamed it on hot weather before) my hands were pink and swollen so much that I can't use my thumbs, and my fingers are stiff. I cut myself down to 30 mg/day and was working on weaning myself off the stuff, but things got so bad that at 20 mg/day, that I just stopped the drug. I felt so awful; anyway, I can't say I noticed a difference. The left side of my body is more swollen that the right, and my current Dr. is thinking Lymphedema, but my symptoms don't add up. I don't have the money to be throughly checked out. I'm currently taking Prilosec because I take 1200 to 1600 mg Advil/day, and Oxazepam 15 mg at night. Oh, yeah, I'm also on 25 mg atenolol for the rapid heart beat from Baclofen. I posted this in case there are others suffering as I am because I've been searching the web without much success. I just wanted others to know they're not the only ones.	F	61	 10 3X D	12/2/2012
1	Muscles tension	I have gotten really loopy, and emotional. I have insane vivid dreams, so vivid I wake up hysterical crying and it really doesn't even help the muscle Tension In my back just makes me feel like I need to go to the loony been		F	19	3  days10mg	10/30/2012
2	migraines	headache, bad foot cramps at night, decreased inhibition, loss of balance, blurry vision	at first I took full dose (20 mg. 3 times a day) and it made me feel out of it and clumsy but helped migraines stop. At a lower dose (5 to 10 mg. once a day) helps headaches and sleeping but after a week or so I begin to get terrible foot cramps at night and increased headaches when it wore off until I take more. Also blurry vision and loss of inhibition.	F	63	5  months20 mg. 3X D	9/13/2012
4	Bladder spasms	Helped tremendously with my flow of urine. I had a weak stream due to spasms and chronic IC. My only concern is that the effects may be waning somewhat but overall has helped a great deal.		F	35	1  months10mg x 3	9/4/2012
5	Degenerative Disks, Pain, & Spasms	I don't remember.		F	35	6  years50 MG	6/22/2012
5	Nerve Pain/Fibromyalgia	None, maybe slight somnolence		M	44	1  months10	5/23/2012
5	Spinal Cord damage from tumor	Was tired in the beginning but that went away in about 2 weeks. Less of an appetite and lost about 5 pounds but that stabilized.	This has worked extremely well for my muscle rigidity that was caused by the removal of a spinal cord tumor in 2010. I have less pain and can walk longer distances. Its effect started to diminish after about 2 months and my doctor increased my dose from 10 mg 3 times a day to 20 mg 3 times a day, which he said is the normal dose. I like that I don't gain weight on it and it sure helps me sleep without pain, and go through the day feeling good.	F	64	3  months20 mg 3X D	4/4/2012Email
1	Neck pain, Muscle spasms	Worse muscle spasms, worse neck pain, terrible anxiety, increased heart rate, high blood pressure, worse right eye pain, dizziness, confusion.		M	33	10  days10 3X D	11/22/2010
5	Fibromyalgia, Reverse T3	NONE!	This medicine has literally been a life saver for me. Though I am starting to see some breakthrough muscle spasms now, I see that others are taking much more than me. Will talk to Doc about increasing, then I think I will be good to go. And believe me when I say it's a lifesaver, I have not taken any drugs for over 20 years, so to take this was a big step for me. And I am very sensitive, so the fact that I did well with it and no side effects is really big.	F	53	3  months10 mgs 3X D	2/19/2010Email
3	Tinnitus and severe tension	Ticks and flinched a lot. Got really speedy on it. Had bizarre bonkers dreams. didn't feel i was myself	it worked incredibly for my tinnitus and i actually functioned well for a week, but i felt it had too many side affects and too strong to continue, wish is a shame, so back in bed a lot with anxiety and tinnitus loud.	M	41	1  weeks	12/8/2009
5	Headaches, Back surgery	None, Except Pain Relief!	After taking soma for about 5 years, and never getting relief my. I found a new doctor and she switched me to Baclofen and it started working right away on everything! WOW....what a relief!!!	F	36	1.5  weeks	10/16/2009Email
5	Muscle spasms (everywhere)	Have had no adverse side effects.	This medication has been a real Godsend for me,I get muscle spasms (charlie horses) every where, hands feet, legs and arms and back and in my neck! They are extremely painfull, and the muscles will just not release and relax when they spasm. With Baclofen the spasms are completely gone, and for the most part as long as I take it every 8 hours I have no spasms at all!   I take 25mg every 8 hours, except at 10 PM at night I take 30mg. It also has helped relieve some of my Chronic Pain!	M	58	2  years	9/3/2009
5	back muscle spasm	at first it made me drowsy but after about a week I was fine.		F	40	5  months	5/14/2009
5	Left leg muscle jerks/spasms	Initially I was very tired and almost stopped taking it after a few days because of this.  I then started taking half the recommended dose and ramped up from there over a couple of weeks and the drowsiness was much more tolerable.  I still get tired, but not nearly as bad as during the first couple of weeks I was on it.	I love this drug - it has given me my life back!  My severe leg spasms/jerks have mostly cleared up now.  It seems like it took a good month to get the full benefit of being on the drug, so stay with it if you have muscle spasms/jerks and have been put on Baclofen.	F	41	45  days	2/22/2009
5	MS	None	Works great for muscle spasms. Before I started the medication, I could not stretch my legs without cramps but now I never get them. If I miss a dose I notice cramping in my legs within hours. This med is a life saver.	F	37	10  months	7/24/2008
5	spasticity, multiple sclerosis	drowsiness which diminished. No other adverse effects.	LOVE IT, LOVE IT. I had been OD'ing on Zanaflex with no relief. Baclofen has been a GODSEND. No effects and gives great relief from the spasms/spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis.	F	42	2  months	6/24/2008
4	Fibromyalgia / muscle spasms	None	This is the best spasm med out there. The others either make me extremely drowsy or don't work.  I wouldn't be able to function without baclofen. I take 20 mg up to 3 times a day.  Usually, I take it 2x a day and then take tizanidine at bedtime (makes me drowsy).	F	32	2  years	4/8/2008
5	Tension Headaches	No side effects	This drug has completely eliminated my tension headaches, and helps me get a full night of sleep. Never wake up feeling groggy like with Skelaxin. Love it!	F	24	2  months	2/20/2008
4	Low Back Muscle Spasms	None	It worked very well for about a year.  Then I seemed to build a tolerance to it and had to switch to Flexeril.  When that stops working I'll probably go back to Baclofen	F	62	1.5  years	1/16/2008
5	neck and back pain, alcoholism	headache and nausea if taken on an empty stomach	I am an addict and alcoholic, this drug works good to eliminate cravings. I did get serious withdrawl symtoms when quiting cold turkey. I take 100mgs a day. It works well for anxiety too. I also have chronic neck and back pain, it helps take the edge off.	F	40	5  years	11/3/2007
5	Cerebral Palsy	Just mild drowsiness when I first began		F	26	9  months	8/28/2007
4	muscle spasms, nerve injury	dizziness	This seems to work better than Flexeril.  I take only as neeeded.	F	48	2  days	8/4/2007
4	dystonia, muscle spasms	fatigue, bizarre dreams, trembling/tremor if I miss a dose,possibly nausea and abdominal pain but I'm not sure if this is related to the drug	I have noticed that when I increase the dose I get fatigued and very tired but after a couple weeks this side effect goes away.  I have some gastrointestinal problems (nausea and abdominal pain/irritable bowel syndrome and gastroparesis) that may be exacerbated by the baclofen.  If I miss a dose I get trembling and shaking all over almost like I'm shivering but I'm not cold.  Overall the baclofen has been the only drug that remarkably helps my dystonia.  I am better able to walk and I don't need to use my wheelchair as much.  I definitely get more twisting and spasms when it is time for my next dose or if I miss a dose so I know it helps quite a bit.  I took Baclofen for 3 years and stopped to get pregnant.  Now I am taking it again and it has been about a year.  I take 20mg 3 times a day and I have taken as much as 80mg/day without severe side effects.	F	30	4  years	6/18/2007Email
2	son is	Only on 5 mg so far and isn't working yet for muscle spasms		M	29	1  days	5/10/2007
4	Muscle spasms due to probable MS	Drowsiness when I first started taking it, but that diminished over about a month.  No side effects at all now.	Worked very well for controlling muscle spasms/spasticity in my legs and in my arms caused by probable MS. Started out with 10 mg twice a day, but have had to gradually increase dosage to 30 mg a day.	F	44	9  months	4/19/2007
2	muscle spasms, back injury	Sleep disorders. Strange vivid dreams wherein I was "not myself" or in my regular dream state. I'd wake up and think it was having a negative effect on my mind, so I discontinued it.		M	56	14  days	4/8/2007
5	neck spasms (suboccipitals, scm)	Don't take on empty stomach.	I take 10 mg every 3-1/2 hours. It is as effective as diazepam (valium), but w/out the drunk feeling. I know it works because if I dont take it on time- the spasticity really kicks in quickly. I went through a ton of pills before I found this one and its the only thing I need. It has improved the quality of my life.	M	44	2  months	2/11/2007
5	back spasms	The only side effect I noticed was that it elevated my mood considerably. I then did some research and found out that it can do this. I am bipolar so it was very noticeable to me.	It works well for the spasms and actually helps with depression to some degree. I take 30 mgs daily	M	49	2  days	9/22/2006Email
4	arm/hand tremors	none	has iliminated tremors temporarily if drug not taken for 2 days severe tremors come back	M	50	1  days	8/30/2006

4	MS	None	Don't notice anything happining except my RLS went away I'm thankful for that, would take it for that	M	69	8  months	2/1/2006Email
2	Muscle spasms, pain	Took 1/2 doses 3 times first day, all okay. Started feeling ill but took it in stride second day. Horrible headache/nausea commenced and continued for two more days. Missed two days of work getting it out of my system/getting back on solid food. I had awful headaches on this med. though it seemd to help my other problems. I was unable to take it.	It is too bad that I had such a reaction to it since it looked so promising.	M	43	2  days	11/18/2004
1	Nerve Damage		The first night I took 10mg I woke up and was seeing gigantic bugs crawling every where the drug did not do anything for my pain or muscle spasms.	M	36	1  times	10/24/2004
5	MS	None	Helps relax my muscles and stop spasms	F	47	2  years	10/18/2004
5	nerve pain, muscle spasms & cramps	none	Baclofen relaxes my muscles enough for me to sleep and carry out tasks. I have problems in my right arm and can now do more things than before, with no side effects. Has been a godsend for me.	F	26	3.5  years	4/28/2004
3	back spasms	worked somewhat well  but after  a  few  days i  started  having  sever  heartburn.  Discontinued  use.		M	39	5  days	3/22/2004
5	back spasm after MVA	none	just 5 mg 3x day relieved pain from a back spasm that no other meds, including narcotics, could. not enough physicians seem to know about this.  my PM doc is an expert on off-label uses of drugs in small doses.	F	50	3  months	12/9/2003
5	Chronic Back Pain	None	The only medication that releaved my back pain. Now I don't take any pain medication	F	51	3  years	8/31/2003
