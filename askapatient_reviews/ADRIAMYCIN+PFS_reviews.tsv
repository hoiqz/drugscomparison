5	Stage IIa Breast Cancer	Minor nausea the day of the treatment, hair loss, pain at the IV site, sore tongue, sore throat, excessive mucus in the throat and nose	Overall, the experience has been a lot easier than I expected. Compazine has completely alleviated any nausea, and other side effects are very minor. I knew the hair loss was coming - my hair started falling out after the second treatment.

4	breast cancer IIA node-positive	queasiness for 4-5 days (took Emend, Decadron & Zofran for 3 days to prevent nausea), 95% hair loss (not just on head), taste changes 2nd week, low WBC neutrophil count.	via IV with Cytoxan, 4 cycles @ 3 weeks -- won't know if they worked until cancer never recurs.  Manageable but no fun.  Was able to work most days, but at a slower pace.  Very important to eat a good anticancer diet, exercise as much as possible, drink a variety of fluids, spend time with positive people.	F	61	4  times60mg/m2 4X O	3/13/2010Email

5	breast cancer	A bit of fatigue, massive hair loss. Tongue coating at night.  I actually tolerated the dose-dense A/C treatments very well.  Anti-nausea meds worked perfectly. Had sternum and leg bone pain as a result of Neulasta shots.  Took Rx painkillers for that.	Took Adriamycin/Cytoxin in four doses over eight weeks as neo-adjuvant therapy in order to save my breast.  WOW!  I couldn't believe how much it shrunk my tumor.  No doubt would have killed any budding metasteses if there had been any.  Finished up with four doses of Taxol (the last was optional)	F	52	8  weeks	11/15/2006
