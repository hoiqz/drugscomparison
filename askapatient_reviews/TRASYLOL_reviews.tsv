1	Heart Bypass Surgery	kidney failure requiring dialysis 3 days a week, arterial fibrillation, anemia, and congestive heart failure	My daddy was given trasylol after his heart bypass surgery and now has kidney failure requiring dialysis 3 days a week. He NEVER had kidney problems before being given this drug. He was in good health aside from needing bypass surgery. Now, he also has arterial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. He has been in and out of the hospital for months now and I feel Trasylol has robbed him of his quality of life. I feel like Bayer Corp. is killing my father and I believe there are many who don't even know their problems are due to Trasylol. I know we didn't until someone told us to look it up. This drug is STILL on the market despite the proven harmful effects and FDA warnings and will probably injure many more people if nothing is done about it. Apparently health "care" is just an oxymoron and all that matters in this industry is big money. What a crock! Something must be done about this!	F	33	 	7/26/2007
1		The New England Journal of Medicine recently found the use of Trasylol doubled the risk of kidney failure, increased the chance of heart attack or heart failure by 55% and resulted in a 181% increase in the risk of stroke.		M	29	 	6/30/2006
