Having difficulty sitting at work.  Gait changes due to left knee pain.  Two weeks of physical therapy only to discover that the symptoms began after taking this med.  No energy for exercise, .

5	water retainage	None. By taking this drug my blood pressure is stable.  I urinate at least 6 times a day.  Without the drug I seldom urinate.  However, I do not have to go to the bathroom at night.		F	75	10  years20	8/20/2012Email
3	High Blood Pressure	Hair loss, heart palpitations, restless legs at night. The side-effects that concern me most:  if I miss a pill I start my period, even if its not time yet (28 day cycle). Through consuming more protein and fresh veggies, and exercising daily I got by bp down; so the doctor took me off HCTZ. While off the drug my menstrual flow became excessively heavy with lots a large clots. I am back on HCTZ because my bp has crept back up (hereditary), and I am experiencing all symptoms previously mentioned. I have spoken to different doctors in a few different states about my concerns and they all make comments along the lines that it's all in my mind. The last doctor I spoke with has told me he hasn't read anything "written" on the subject, so I must be mistaken.	I wouldn't recommend this drug. If you can lower your bp by diet and exercise, it is a much better choice to do it that way. If you consume at least 20 grams of lean protein at every meal it should have the same effect as a diuretic. I don't know why doctors won't tell you that.	F	41	8  years25mg 1X D	8/12/2012Email
3	HBP/Adema	I am experiencing many side affects - constipation, bloating/gas, no energy, tingling in hands/feet, muscle cramps if potassium not taken.	This drug has brought my BP and adema in my lower legs/ankles under control. I do not like taking any drugs, but I could not get my BP or swelling down. I am trying to take off some weight and exercise more so that I can get off of these meds - I really don't like how it's making me feel.	F	54	2  months25 MG 1X D	8/6/2012
1	High blood pressure	About three years ago started having extreme vertigo. Was followed by what doc diagnosed as severe panic attacks. Was sent for multiple test but no findings. Continued to get worse including facial numbness, tingling, temporary blindness, severe acid reflux, sleep apnea, insomnia, severe thirst, diarhea, blood sugar drops of 40 to 50 points in two minutes, symptoms similar to a stroke and MS. Actually went through 3 months of mri s and testing for auto immune diseases with all coming back negative. Have gained over 100 lbs and only eat 1500 calories a day because of stomach problems. Diagnosed with increased spinal pressure and had dose doubled three months ago and symptoms magnified tenfold. Thought I was going crazy or dying. Told doc I was going off the hctz and four days later symptoms are almost all gone with just some residual face numbness.  I feel like a new woman.  This med is EVIL!

1	HBP	Since I started taking hctz I've noticed the following. increased anxiety, chest tightness, upset stomach, diarreah, insomnia, and an increase in allergy symptoms. I looked up hctz and found out you shouldn't take it if you are allergic to sulfa drugs. I am and my doctor knows this. so does my pharmacy. I don't think I will be taking it any more, especially since its done nothing for my blood pressure just feel miserable		F	27	1  months	7/22/2012
1	high blood pressure	My doctor did blood work on me and found that I had excessive calcium in my blood.  This was not normal for me and can indicate a parathyroid tumor or side effect of this med.  Took me off the med and checked blood in one month.  Is was normal.	I actually did not know this was happening as I felt fine.  Did little to lower blood pressure tho.  Thank goodness I  have a great doctor who spotted this side effect or I would have been in serious trouble!!!	F	68	2  months12.5 mg 1X D	7/19/2012

1	High Blood Pressure	Hair loss, burning soles of feet, tingling in my legs, burning in left hand up to shoulder and back, stomach cramps, very  frequent urination, restless legs that wake me up at nights. I sit around the house and do nothing, which is very unusual for the type of person I used to be: spotless home and beautiful flower garden.  For some time now I have not had the motivation to do much, now I know why.	This drug should be taken off the market, never in my life have I felt so uncomfortable that it is hard to concentrate while doing anything, due to the discomfort in my feet and stomach.  I also get a flushed and warm feeling in my stomach and chest.  I never realized that my hair loss was caused by this medication, the top of my hair is very thin that you are able to see my scalp.  I got a mamogram last week just to ease my mind.  The thing that worry me most is the fact that I am having all these horrible symptoms and not able to quiet my mind, wondering is something terrible is wrong with me.  I did not wait for the doctor to tell me, over a week ago I stop taking it and still have the symptons, with just a little relief.  I cannot wait for it to go away completely. I am going for blood work in a few days.  This is a warning to go on a stricter diet so I would not have to consume these lethal medications.	F	60	1  years12.5 1X D	4/24/2012Email

1	For High Blood Pressure	The side effect that I experienced was significant hair loss that started 2 years after I started taking the drug at the 25MG dosage level. I have a friend that is taking 12.5 dosage and is also experiencing the same hair loss issue.	I switched from HCTZ to ZIAC, which is a combination drug that only has a 6.25 HCTZ dosage. After a month, my hair  loss is almost negligible.	F	59	3  years25 MG 1X D	3/10/2012
1	HBP	After a year I had intense facial numbness, hot feeling cheeks (I had to put ice packs on my face it was so hot), jaw pain. I went to ER and they said ear infection, I went to ENT he said sinus infection, MRI of my sinuses were clear, neurologist wanted to put me on anti-seizure medicine to trigenal neuralga (sp?) and mri of my brain came back normal. I stopped taking HTZ after reading so many comments. I have been off of it for about 1 and half weeks and everything is clearing up. My face has went from intense pain to mild discomfort (some itching) and extremely dry skin in the affected areas (cheeks, in front of ears, and around nose). My BP actually shot to 133/90 while suffering this allergy reaction. Off of the meds BP has dropped to normal at 115/78. Don't take this med for long amounts of time.		M	45	1.5  years 1X D	2/2/2012Email
3	HBP	Extreme thirst, severe leg/muscle pain and cramps. Back ache and painful knots. Itchy skin, sore throat, constipation like I've never experienced before. Joint pain, (knees, shoulders, feet, hands) and weakness.	I was taking a lower dose of HCTZ with little to no side effects, which helped keep my bp in check. Then my bp began to creep back up 170s+/100+ so they upped my dose. Ever since, I have been miserable. I'm only 33 and feel like I should be in my 80s. I try to hydrate often, but because I am a teacher, I don't get a lot of time to stop and take a drink, not to mention run to the bathroom. I am starting a potassium supplement and will try to increase my fluids to see if that will help. Otherwise, I'm going t request being taken off this med.It is very much adversely affecting my lifestyle as a mom of two little ones and as a runner (who hasn't had the energy or well-being to do so as much lately with all the pain)	F	33	7  months25mg 1X D	1/28/2012
2	Hypertension		After two weeks, am still on it hoping better therapeutic effects will emerge. The side effects have subsided somewhat - less of a foggy head feeling but still somewhat fatigued and still getting strange sensations in my chest/heart.	M	43	 25 mg 1X D	1/27/2012EmailHistory
1	moderate high blood pressure	Heart palpitations,extreme joint pains, hair loss, rash, dizziness, low libido		F	66	2  years12.5	1/26/2012
5	To lose weight	Muscle cramps	I did get muscle cramps but that just means your potassium is depleting, which is caused from dehydration, which is caused by taking a diuretic as this. So I started taking a potassium supplement, one a day, and the cramps went away.	F	44	30  days25mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
1	edema	Significant loss of appetite; turned off by odor/sight of food. Gastro-intestinal upheaval (had a totally normal digestive "system" before starting HCTZ); soft, discolored (yellow) stools (sometimes three per day); much gas. Aching stomach, overall "delicate" feeling in abdomen; distended gut. VERY tired feeling constantly; don't want to do ANY of my normal activities or even move out of a position (perhaps depressed?). Relative shortness of breath when I move about the house. Unilaterally took myself off the drug this AM; already feel change for the good just twelve hours later. I am a longtime (27 years)cardiac patient (bypasses, stents, the whole shootin' match) who recently had a pacemaker installed and an A-V node ablation. My BP was decent before I ever started HCTZ, and the pacemaker does a good job of keeping my heartrate between 70-130. The only improvement I have seen is a lessening of the edema in my ankles and a twenty-pound loss of weight in two weeks (	For me, the unpleasant side effects of HCTZ far outweigh the diuretic benefits. My very experienced senior cardiologist (with whom I've been for 27 years) didn't seem to think my side effects are/were a big deal when I related them to him last week, but I am not going to accept this quality of life.

4	High blood pressure	no side effect whats so ever...	So I started taking this medication about 5 month ago.. My high blood pressure was very over the top high... 2 digit number mess up as we speak..

I thank My Heavenly Father for that... and  the doc of course for  finally giving me something that my body was able to stick in with..I will mention that in the  first 2 month I was urinating a lot but then it slow down afterwards..So til this day I have  no side effect what's so ever..Sorry for those who has been taking this meds and it's not working for you..

2	High blood pressure	I am an active middle aged woman who was recently diagnosed with HBP. I guess it runs in my family. I was prescribed HCT.  Within two days of taking it, I almost passed out and wnt to the emergency room. Doctors tested me and I am apparently fine,  but low in potassium.  I seemed okay after that for a few weeks. Then my stomach began hurting and I thought I was getting a stomach virus, however there was no fe er and I never threw up.  This pain nausea has been with me for a week and a half now.  I am unable to eat, am having heart palpitations, I feel weak and anxious and can't function at work.  I had not thought that the drug could be causing this until I read this board. The tightness in my stomach is intense and debilitating. I am hoping this is a reaction to the drug and that stopin gigs use will help.		F	38	1  months 1X D	12/8/2011Email
1	Mild Hypertension	feeling off balance when walking or standing, shortness of breath, very fatigued, heart racing	This medication should be taken off the market and Drs should be aware of side effects and take them seriously when a patient tells you they are experiencing the exact symptoms that are listed as side effect instead of making you feel like a hypochondriac. my dr went so far as wanting to treat me with meds for anxiety. I have been in the emergency room, with these symptoms...extreme lightheadness, off balance , feelimng like I could faint, feeling like I can't breath, being woken out of a deep sleep feeling like I can't catch my breath, heart racing and extreme fatigue. I felt like there was something seriously wrong with me. I looked up the side effects 2 days ago and called my dr and asked him why if I was describing all these symptoms to him did he fail to mention that it could be the hydrochlorthiazide and his answer was that the side effects are rare. I told him I wasn't taking it anymore and within 2 days I feel so much better already. TAKE THIS DRUG OFF THE MARKET.  I have felt like something was wrong for more than a year. I am thankful to feel better but angry that I could have felt better so much sooner if my dr would have done his job!!!	F	44	1.5  years25 mg 1X D	12/8/2011Email
2	High Blood Pursue	I was just treating my HBP with Lisinopril 10mg along with diet & exercise. I started seeing that my blood pressure was creeping up a little so doctor had me add HCTZ to see if it could drop it down. Wasn't experiencing before, but now I'm noticing abominable pain, fluttering heartbeat, anxiety, loss of appetite, & a little constipation. Do far I haven't noticed a tremendous drop in BP & I'm not liking these side effects so I think I'm gonna stop taking it to see if these feelings leave.		M	34	10  days12.5 mg	11/24/2011Email
4	Kidney stones	Frequent urination (but that's what it's supposed to do), dizziness, especially on standing, mild nausea.	The nausea went away after a few days. Unfortunately, the dizziness persisted, after discussing it with my doctor it turned out that since my blood pressure was pretty low to begin with, this was lowering it even further. I'm still on it while we try to work something else out, because being dizzy like this is still better than the side effects of the meds I have to take if I get kidney stones, let alone the pain. So far, an ultrasound of my kidneys has confirmed that it seems effective at preventing any new stones from developing (and yes, I get them that frequently).Doctor also cautioned me that it could cover up symptoms of hyperparathyroidism, or cause calcium or potassium deficiencies, and that I needed to get tested for those. Fortunately, neither issue came up.	F	21	1  months25 mg 1X D	11/16/2011Email

2	HBP/ swelling	The first couple of months on this med were fine, but when I hit month three, I got this horrible non-itchy rash that started on my stomach and then spread slowly to my back, legs and arms.  It took several weeks but it was determined just through trial and error of the meds I was taking it was the hctz. So even though it worked for swelling, I ended up having adverse reactions		F	39	3  months12.5 1X D	10/14/2011
2	HBP	migraines, and severe leg and foot cramps	I took this for the first time yesterday and I noticed nothing different. I woke up this am and took it and I have had terrible lower leg and foot cramps all day. Also I normally have migranes so I take depacote daily to treat that and a mild seizure disorder. Well the migraine I have had today is nothing like I have ever experienced in my life. Very dull.. not the normal shooting pain with light sensitivity.. Not to mention the frequent urination. Shew I think i should have just stayed in the bathroom all day it was soo bad.  I also think it is messing with my eyes.. I have glasses that normally I can see perfect out of and today they seemed cloudy so I have not worn them. While typing this I noticed that everything seems a little cloudy	F	28	2  days25 MG 1X D	9/14/2011Email
2	HPB	I have been feeling tired and sluggish when doing my daily hour long exercise routine. I have sometimes stopped doing it and lay down to take a nap on the floor. I also feel depressed and have lost my desire to do things (even going to see my 3 year old Granddaughter!). I also had fever like blisters on my lower lip (same as a previous poster) from being in the sun and had to postpone a dentist appointment. My blood pressure has  gone from 148/ 96 to 121/86 which is the good part, but the side effects are not worth the results. I have read not to stop taking the drug without checking with the doctor, but I don't feel like going through the hassel of seeing him about it.  I have been reading on this forum that some of you say you are going to stop taking this drug immediately without checking with the doctor. Has anyone had severe results from doing that? I want to get off this stuff and get back to normal (HPB and all!).		M	64	3  months25 MG 1X D	9/14/2011Email

2	HBP	Shortness of Breath, heart flutters, chest pains and increased anxiety.	This did help lower my blood pressure at first, but began to experience episodes of shortness of breath.  Normal everyday activities became difficult.  My heart fluttered, I had tightness in my chest and my anxiety level increased.  Because of this my blood elevated.  This is a serious side effect not mentioned in the literature you receive.  I have been off it for 3 days now and am just beginning to feel better!	F	48	3  weeks25 MG 1X D	8/14/2011
2	HBP	migrane, pressure in right temple, stomache pain,nausia,	not sure if this is from taking excedrin migrane asprin every four hours.

No change in soaps, fragrances, cleaning supplies, etc.  Doctor decided that it was a reaction to the drug.  Stopped the med and now am on prednisone and a topical steroid cream to get over this rash.  As a side note- my blood pressure was still elevated when I was checked that day so it didn't work for me anyway.	F	34	10  days 1X D	7/8/2011

2	High Blood Pressure	Weight gain, heartbeat feels different/fast sometimes, hair seems to be thinning a bit (these are in addition to much more frequent urination, of course)	When I started on this about 3 weeks ago, I was weighed by my nurse practitioner at 232 lbs. I went back yesterday for my first check up and I was up to 238. She dismissed it, saying that a 5 (or 6) pound fluctuation is not that much for someone over 200 lbs. I think it is the medication though. I feel a little sluggish. It has helped my BP a little so far; was 158/98 when I started, was 148/91 at the first check. Still about 20 points from where I need to be. I am not that happy with the medication.	M	34	3  weeks25 mg 1X D	6/7/2011Email
1	high BP	Terrible rash (raised bright red bumps surrounded by red skin) on forearms, upper arms, and calves.	I started noticing red pimple-like bumps on my forearms about one and a half months after starting on this med.  As weather got warmer and I spent more time out in the sun, this rash became severe.  I got sharp, unbearable  jolts of itching on my forearms which almost felt like I was being bitten by fleas.  This is the only new med I've been put on in several years.  I decided to search online to see if these awful skin problems might be a side effect.  I typed in " drugs which cause sensitivity to sunlight", and GUESS which drug came up first in my search?  Yep, HCTZ!!  I removed all of the pills from my weekly pillholder, and do not plan to ever take this stuff again!  I do NOT recommend this medication...	F	60	2.5  months25 1X D	6/1/2011

I have shortness of breath while doing nothing at all. if i make a small movement i am excessivly over excerted. My feet are number and cramp up while i sleep. I do no like this drug and have discontinued using it. i am going to take an herbal approach to lowering my bp, So wish me luck and great health.	Stop taking this medication if u experince these side effects.	F	35	30  days12.5MG 1X D	2/18/2011
4	High Blood Pressure	None so far.  Actually feeling a lot better than I was before taking it.  Having tests next week to test BP and lipids. Will report back when I get them in to see how effective this drug really is.	I had a lot of nausea BEFORE I started taking this.  It disappeared within 2 days of starting this drug.  I have a family history of high blood pressure and early death due to heart disease.  I am not overweight and have no other medical problems.  If I had to choose between the possible side effects of this drug, and death... I think I'd be able to deal with the side effects, thank you very much!  :  )	F	38	2  weeks25mg 1X D	1/24/2011Email
3	Kidney stones and bp	Well, I have nausea, joint pain and abdominal pain but I am not sure if is the 50 mg of HCTZ. I have the fluttering heart too but I am on potassium pills and was told they may be doing it. I am confused and my doctors are just as bad.	I have never lost hair	M	37	2  years50 mg 1X D	1/20/2011
4	High Blood Pressure		My wellness exam came back yesterday, and this is after having been on IMPAX Hydrochlorothiazide for a couple of weeks now, and everything came back normal (I will provide an update with the exact numbers once I have them). I would actually rate this drug a '5' (Exceptional), except I'm not certain that it's addressed my HBP yet? I will find this out in a couple of weeks and then update the rating accordingly. I should also point out that I exercise 5-days a week (I run two miles each day), this is my only prescribed medication, I am not obese, although I don't really watch what I eat like I should.

2		lightheaded, dull headache, hungover feeling in the morning, chills, warmth feeling in chest and legs, some confusion at times.  Never fainted, but felt like it a few times.  Previous review mentioned "swimmy feeling".  That kind of nailed it.  This drug did a good job lowering my bp.  Took drug for 2 months hoping my body would adjust and it didn't.  Doctor didn't think that this drug could cause all that, but said it was time to take me off this med.  Told the doc to look at the side effects listed.  WTF.  Going to wait about 10 days to see if symptoms go away.  Give him a copy of all these reviews.  This drug probably works well for most individuals, but it can also create some issues.  All symptoms have co-incided with the time frame of taking this medication.  This is my first day off it, my head feels a little clearer.  Looks like it should take a few days to clear out of my system.		M	43	2  months25 1X D	12/24/2010

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.

3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
