1	malaria preventative	Vertigo, and extremely low blood pressure causing fainting.  First occurred in 2001 after a trip to Costa Rica.  Doctors ran extensive tests, including 2 EEGs, and decided I had a seizure disorder.  I refused medication for it, knowing I'd never had a seizure.  On a recent trip to Nicaragua, identical symptoms returned after my 3rd dose of Aralen.		F	45	5  weeks	1/27/2006Email
1	Precautionary for Costa Rica	I experienced at least 1 side effect symptom from each level of listed side effects; from common to rare.  Vision clouding, hearing loss, anxiety, panic, depression, dark taring stools.	I would never, ever take this medication again.  The protocol for prescription should require that all physicians obtain their patient's history to learn of any anxiety, panic, depression of their patients before prescribing.
