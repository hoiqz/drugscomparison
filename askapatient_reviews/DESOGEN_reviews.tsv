5	Birth control	Lost wait, extreme breast growth, little to no ache! I'm very impressed with this pill and I plan on continuing to use it. Only problem is mild nausea in the beginning but totally worth it for all the positive side effects!		F	16	6  months	3/4/2013
2	Avoid pregnancy	weight weight, 7lbslost libido  Lack of desire to do anythinglack of patience/irritability	Was switched from Yaz...my mind is not made up yet, seems as though symptoms change every month.	F	27	7  months0.150mg 1X D	3/4/2013

1	Birth control	Nausea vomiting severe headache clotting my arms went to sleep at night problems sleeping bleeding for 6 days blurred vision	Hate this pill. I am not taking it anymore. Calling gyn tomorrow. My 1st period was horrible. Vomiting blurred vision the headache that has eased but still there. I have a 3 year old and I can't have a constant headache. Dr switched me from ortho Novum 777 because I developed a cyst. I would rather take my chances with the ovarian cyst then the issues. All of this drug brought me after only 1 month	F	41	30  days 1X D	12/30/2012
1	Contraception/Acne	I was on Junel Fe for about a year and a half. My doctor changed my pill to apri, the generic of desogen because I complained about my acne. I was so excited to try this pill to get rid of the acne.. Around the 6th day I started to feel very weird, emotionally. I am ALWAYS an up beat person and never had problems with my emotions. It made me feel very weird, just negative thoughts and just in general not a great mood as I usually am .. I stopped taking this pill as soon as I noticed a change in my mood. I am going to go back on the Junel Fe. Birth control is different for everyone and this pill may not be perfect for everyone, it may work with others, but for me it didn't.		F	19	7  days30 mg	12/3/2012Email
3	Birth control	I've been taking desogen for 3 months now and I can't wait to change it next month. I'm hungry all the time and I can't control my emotions. I have no sex drive what so ever to the point I'm confused on why im even taking birth control pills lol. Doesn't really help with acne but helps alot with cramping . Not a long term pill but I guess its good to start with		F	22	3  months35	12/1/2012Email
2	contraception	omg this pill is horrible!!!! it made me gain like 20 pounds, and i swear at least 10 of those pounds when to my thighs... not cool. It did make  my boobs bigger, but its really not worth it. it also helps a little with acne. It has made me crazy the whole time I've been taking it. Mood swings, anywhere from anger to just full blown rage over the smallest things. It made me very unhappy with life in general. It pretty much changed my whole personality. I'm sad for no reason at all and have absolutely no energy. That's just not me, I've always been happy and upbeat. I also think thats what has been making me feel sick and dizzy too. It does seem to help with cramps, but only because i take only the active pills for the most part, if i take the nonactive ones i get a week of hell and stomach pains. As for sex drive... what sex drive? Even kissing grosses me out since taking this pill! It has just turned me into a very cold person and i hate that! Seriously reconsider taking this pill!!	for real this pill is horrible!	F	23	1.5  years 1X D	11/13/2012
5	Prevent Pregnancy	Nothing bad		F	17	4  months	10/25/2012
1	Contraceptive	- migraines at least twice per month- no sex drive- no noticeable clearing of skin- lethargy	After one month of taking Reclipsen (the generic of Desogen), I began getting frequent migraine headaches - something I used to only ever get after a VERY strenuous workout. My sex-drive disappeared while I was on this pill. It took 3-4 months after stopping this pill before my sex drive began coming back. Having no sex-drive in a relationship is an unacceptable side effect for a pill that is supposed to enable sex!I felt tired and lethargic while on this pill. Before taking Desogen my boyfriend and I regularly enjoyed nights out with friends. Following1-2 months after beginning this pill, I felt lethargic all day. I no longer had the same disposition while going out which lead to not wanting to spend nights out.I would never recommend this oral contraceptive based on my experience and other women's experiences.	F	22	5  months 1X D	10/22/2012
1	Contraceptive	I gained so much weight it isn't even funny. (I went from 135-160 lbs in less than 5months, and my weight had been 135 for almost 2 years) Not really even an increased appetite either. Infact I worked out more and ate healthier :( also It caused me to become incredibly irrational, argumentative and an over all negative person. I am exhausted all the time and have no desire to do anything on my days off. My body aches and this makes me so sad. I used to be a small, pretty, and over all happy person. This pill makes me hate my life in general. I need to find another pill or just get off this one!	DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL!	F	20	7  months 1X D	9/13/2012
1	birth control	complete lack of sex drive, extreme mood swings, irritability and anger	I used to be on a tri-phasic pill but the genius *sarcasm* doctor at planned parenthood said that someone my age shouldnt be on that type of pill and switch me to this horrible pill.  It completely killed my sex drive, I was very easily irritated and angered, and would have some pretty violent mood swings from being  depressed one minute angry the next and then incredibly happy.  Also, this pill did absolutely nothing to help with cramps/PMS which used to be helped by the other bc I was on.  In short I would not recommend this pill to anyone.	F	22	6  months 1X D	8/20/2012Email
3	Birth Control	Sex drive so low that Ryan Gosling couldn't even turn me on, bad dizziness in the first 2 weeks, mood swings, extremely emotional, thoughts of suicide, and slight weight gain.	I think the worst side effects of this pill are the lowered libido, and occasionally considering suicide (which isn't normal for me) but everything else is tolerable.	F	19	1  months 1X D	7/19/2012
1	prevent pregnacy	I developed Deep Vein Thrombosis in my arm at age 34 back in 2009. I  had to self administer injections of Lovenox into my stomach and be on Coumadin blood thinners for 9 months. I was on bed rest for a few weeks and I could not work the whole time. Desogen did clear my acne up. It did give me bad mood swings. I was tired a lot and had no energy.	I would not recommend this pill to anyone. Too bad this pill wasn't Yaz or Orcella because I could be getting a big settlement. Nobody will help me with a Desogen case.	F	36	6  months 1X D	7/19/2012Email
1	Birth control	Horrible depression and rage. I have been on the pill for 15 years but recently was switched to Desogen because the clinic no longer carried my other BC. I have never experience this before. I was telling a friend about how crazy I had been and she asked what BC I was on. I never even thought about it being my BC since I have never had these problems with previous BC. I just want to be myself again!		F	31	3  months1/day	7/10/2012
5	BC, Bad Cramps without it	None noticed	I have had a great time with Desogen. My skin cleared a bit, and my horrible cramps went away. I noticed no side affects at all. I used it to skip periods for three months straight and when I let myself have a period, my uteran lining came out in one piece which creeped me out, but that happens with lots of BC and was my own fault for skipping so many months. The generic, Apri was fine too, I took that back in college.	F	28	5  months 1X D	7/9/2012Email
1	Birth control	complete lack of sex drive, random mood swings, depression, anxiety, irritability, random weight gain... helped my acne though pretty quick..	for three years I have been on a tri-cyclin birth control and this is my first time being on a monocyclin.. I requested to be switched because my previous birth control was starting to make me break out rather than prevent my acne. within a week or so I was noticing a drastic change in my sex-drive and felt horrible for my boyfriend because I usually have a very high drive. I also found myself starting to despise my boyfriend who is one of the sweetest people I've ever known.. Everything he does makes me irritated and I feel like I'm constantly angry at him. Incredibly irritable - even small things would set me off.. Also getting very depressed where I don't feel like doing anything and my outlook of life is just bad.. Everything seems horrible. I didn't even think it could be my birth control until I read these reviews.. I'm so glad i looked it up.. gonna call my doctor right away and get switched.	F	21	30  days 1X D	6/23/2012
5		No side effects it is the best and all the other ones had awful side effects. Id just say take it at exacty the same time each day to be sure your 'side ' effects arent due to taking the pill at varied times!	I would recommend it to women who spot or are an emotional reck on other ones because I was on everything else and nothing worked until this	F	28	4  months 1X D	6/6/2012Email
1	Birth Control	Vomiting, extreme mood swings, weight gain, low sex drive.	I would never recommend it.	F	34	3  months 1X D	6/3/2012Email
1	Pregnancy prevention	Extreme mood swings, periods lasting at most two days, complete change of personality and out look of life, negative thoughts, angry outbursts, very severe headaches, fatigue, loss of breath. But mostly the extremely negative mood swings.	I felt that it was a very good birth control for me because I felt normal for the whole month but when my period came around and passed and I began taking the pills after the seven days something in my head felt like it clicked and I had very severe headaches, fatigue, lack of breath, and the most outstanding part of the side affects was the mood swings. Every month for a whole one to two weeks I would not be the same person, and there was a lot of drama within my family because of my sudden changes and also with the relationship with my boyfriend. I would never recommend this pill to someone if they were to have the same results as I did.	F	16	3  months 1X D	5/26/2012Email
1	avoid pregnancy	depression, mood swings, feelings of isolation, suicidal thoughts, chest pains, shortness of breath, and lengthening my period. would NOT recommend this pill.		F	21	5  days 1X D	5/6/2012
1	Acne, endometriosis, birth control.	After taking this pill for almost a year, I've realized how awful it affected me. It helped clear up my acne quickly, but oh man have I had the worst and craziest mood swings and anxiety!! I get super  irritated easily, can't control my emotions, get depressed and very tired throughout the day. I also want to eat  everything in sight. An awful thing as well is that I constantly bleed randomly throughout taking the pills when I should not be bleeding. I never stopped to consider that these symptoms were brought on from the birth control I was taking... But it definitely is. I would not recommend this pill to anyone!		F	23	1  years	4/18/2012
2	Clear up acne	Acne didn't clear up. Breast tenderness, anxiety and panic attacks, breasts got a little bigger that was the only plus. Super bad cramps on my period!! Mood swings like you wouldn't believe..depression.. also one of the worst yeast infections. Tiredness and dizziness. This pill is horrible!!!!!!		F	17	3  months	4/10/2012
2	To prevent pregnancy	Migranes, SEVER anxiety, nausea, vomiting, heart palpitations	I tried this pill a year ago and didn't like it so I'm not really sure why my doctor put me on it again but oh well. I took it for a total of 2 days this time and the side effects were the same and just as horrible as before. I had a severe migrane yesterday with nausea and anxiety and today I woke up in a panic attack with nausea and vomiting. I called my doctor and I'm switching tomorrow. Thank goodness. Again, everyone is different so maybe it will work for you but it just didn't work for me. Estrogen really messes with me in the first place so this wasn't really a surprise that it failed.	F	22	3  days30MG 1X D	4/10/2012Email
2	Prevent pregnancy	Suicidal ideation, lack of sex drive, continual cramping, excessive weight gain, depression	I wish I'd never taken this pill. I was on Ortho-Tricyclen Lo for almost a year before I got pregnant and miscarried. My doctor decided Desogen was a better replacement for the Ortho, and it worked great for preventing pregnancy. However, it did so because I found my husband's touch revolting...we only had sex an average of once every two months. And that was after I got tired of him badgering me for it. I was constantly angry and depressed over nothing. I cried all the time over nothing. Every day I drove I wanted to drive my car off the bridges and cliffs I passed. I thought about shooting myself. I never think like that, ONLY when I was on this pill. It got so bad my husband told me to stop taking it because risking pregnancy was better than risking my sanity/life. I've been fine ever since I got off that pill, it's just taken awhile to work the weight off. My suggestion would be if you try, stop taking it as soon as you start to feel any of those side effects during times other than menstruation. Good luck!	F	26	3  years 1X D	3/14/2012Email
1	Due to my Endometriosis	I've got Endometriosis and High Blood Pressure.  I'm a student so due to no insurance I went to my local health department and was given this to try.  I only took TWO pills but I noticed an immediate change in my body.  After a few hours of taking this med I was extremely tired.  I had absolutely no energy.  I also found myself extremely irritated with the sound of my brothers voice??  What's up with that..right?  At one point I even asked him to shut up.  That only led to an argument...which I'm sure I won. By day two my blood pressure (which by the way was doing so well due to my new exercise regiment that I no longer needed to take my pills) spiked to 143/99 and my pulse dropped to 55 beats per minute.  Needless to say I quickly popped two blood pressure pills.  I also noticed extreme bloating and edema in my legs.  This is a terrible drug!  I've decided to stop taking these pills IMMEDIATELY and call my doctor in the morning.  My advice to you....be very aware of your body and know	Pay attention to your body!	F	28	2  days28 day 1X D	3/5/2012
1	Birth Control	INSOMNIA and when it wasn't insomnia, complete and utter fatigue. So bad I couldn't function. Eating everything in sight. Bad moods, anxiety attacks	The only reason why I'm sticking with this pill to the end of the month is so I don't get irregular bleeding. It's absolutely terrible. This is the worst birth control pill I've ever been on. The worst is how it makes me feel. I'm either really really tired (falling asleep in my classes - I'm a college student) or I'm up pulling an all nighter for no reason. I have never felt this much of a lack of energy. It even kills me when I go to the gym, which is supposed to give you energy. This pill is affecting all my mental and physical problems. I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis recently and since I'm eating everything, my stomach hurts all the goddamn time. My anxiety is way worse. I'm having panic attacks for no reason and I can't breathe most of the time because my chest tightens up so bad. Honestly this is been the longest most painful month of my life. Someone get me off this pill!	F	21	3  weeks 1X D	2/23/2012Email
1	Birth Control / Acne	Depression, irritability, negative about life, mood swings, Weight gain, (I gained 10lbs in 2 months when I'm normally pretty steady with weight), bloating in stomach area, increased appetite, fatigue and lack of energy.  My acne cleared up like a charm though.	I attribute the higher amount of estrogen to the side effects I experienced.  I think the desogestrel progesterone is good for my skin, but bad bad bad for my moods and energy.	F	32	2  months 1X D	2/4/2012Email
2	Birth control/regulate period	Migraines, hair loss, cramps, loss of appetite, the only reason I've stuck with it this long is because my doctor gave me a 6 month supply		F	19	6  months	1/30/2012
1	Birth control	After only a few days of taking Desogen, I felt a slight increase in my breast size. They feel fuller. However, so does the rest of my body. I feel constantly bloated. I have a loss of appetite. I'm constantly sad, anxious and on the verge of tears. I keep over-reacting to things. Overall, I hate the way I feel about everything especially how it's made me feel about myself.		F	24	2  weeks.15mg 1X D	1/17/2012
4	I am taking Desogen for PCOS	great with weight loss. already down 20 lbs and only my 2nd month. HORRIBLE CRAMPS!! And an increase in migrain frequency.	I have been on Apri 30mg (desogen) BCP for a little less then 2 months. I like it mainly because it is reversing the 2 worst symptoms of PCOS the weight gain and the acne. I am already down 20lbs and have 2 weeks left on my 2nd pack. Acne is doing well too. I still break out but only the week before i get my period. The downfall of Apri...is the HORRID, EXCRUSIATING cramping. for about a week or so (like 2-3 days over a week) before my period came last month and about 2 days over a week this month.. The cramps are the worst i have ever experienced. Dizzy, nausious, sharp pains on my sides where my ovaries are and in my back. I mean ill granted 2 weeks out of the month im in bad pain but for me its worth it if the medication is helping me lose weight and making my face clear. I dot have any intentions of stoping this medication. Also the other bad thing is the week before my period comes, I get a bad migrain about every day untill my peroid is over.	F	25	2  months30mg 1X D	12/23/2011Email
3		some acne, shorter and lighter periods,	I didn't gain any weight at all and I did not have any mood swings, if anything it made me feel more balanced emotionally. The only problem I have with it is that I started getting acne on my chest.. which I never did before. I switched to this off of another BC to give me lighter periods, which it definitely did. I sometimes only have it 2 days. My libido stayed the same and didn't have any 'dryness' at all. My doctor gave me enough for a year so I can't really change now. Other than the acne I'm overall happy with it.	F	21	6  months 1X D	11/8/2011Email
1	heavy periods/bad cramps	crazy beyond crazy mood swings, chest pain, headaches, bloating, constipation. I have already started spotting. I eat healthy and exercise and have a great bmi but I know I will gain weight if I continue taking this because all I want to do is sleep. I never feel like this and I would rather deal with debilitating cramps than this misery. It has been a miserable two weeks and I called my doctor right away to get off of it.		F	21	14  days 1X D	10/17/2011
3	Regulate periods and prevent pregna	Appetite loss, breast swelling, extreme cramping, headaches, tiredness, mood swings, emotional	My period came twice in thirty days and was irratic and I had horrible cramping which I have never expirienced before.	F	25	30  days30 1X D	10/14/2011Email
2	preventing babies	ACNE galore, tiredness, moodiness, NO SEX DRIVE AT ALL, headaches, munchies	I'm a very healthy 19 year old, and I've never had anything like this before. I took acne medicine for years and now that its back I'm pretty irritated. Also, I'm accustomed to my crazy sex drive, but now its not there at all. My boyfriend has noticed and I've been wanting to.rip his head off at any instant even when he is nothing but sweet as can be. Honestly, being pregnant would be better than this. Getting off of it soon.	F	19	1  months 1X D	10/10/2011Email
3	prevent pregnancy	extreme hair loss	I've always had very thick hair and once I started desogen it started falling out in fairly decent clumps, I find it all over the house and it falls out in the shower. I've never had this problem before this pill or on any other pill, and I am only 22 years old. My hair is now very thin. I plan on changing because of this reason alone. I thought adventually it would stop once my hormones adjusted, but it didnt and its been 11 months now.	F	22	11  months30mg 1X D	9/15/2011Email
5	pregnancy prevention	The second week of the first pack was rough - feeling fatigued, fuzzy-headed, and general wanting to murder someone. Then it went away and since then, I've felt good, normal, and NOT PREGNANT (yay!).	I didn't gain weight - in fact, I lost it, but that was more to do with regular sleep / exercise than pills. I did not suffer from worsened period symptoms, nausea, headaches, bone problems, or moodiness. In fact, I kind of mellowed out a little, but again, that was more from lifestyle changes than the chemicals in the pills...the fact that the pill affected me so little that I could function normally is a good sign. It's also allowed me to help regulate my daily routine and make my periods happen on time. (They used to always be really late.)	F	21	3  months.15 mg 1X D	9/5/2011
1	Prevent pregnancy	EXTREME mood swings! I feel annoyed, sad and wanting to cry all the time for no reason. Also, the pill made me very anxious. When i stop taking it, everything goes away, so it's definitely what is causing all that! I'm still taking Desogen because i'm waiting for my doctors appointment to get a different one because i don't want to get pregnant, but i would NOT recommend this pill to anyone.		F	20	  1X D	8/30/2011Email
3	contraception, endometriosis	Less acne, shorter and less painful periods, sore and swollen breasts, nausea & (rarely) vomiting with first couple pills of each pack, lower sex drive, increase in depressed feelings, lethargy, and anxiety.	I've been on Desogen then Ortho-Cept then Apri (all the same med, just different brands) for 4.5 years on and off. It helped manage my endometriosis and I never got pregnant. I never got any headaches or gained any weight whatsoever. Appetite has reamined static. Overall this was a good pill for me, despite the lower sex drive and increased depression/lethargy, which I'm sure all pills will give me anyway. However, over the last 7 months I've had spotting & acne starting midway through the pack and continuing until my period. The Dr. told me this is due to the estrogen dose not being high enough, so I'm (rather nervously) starting Sprintec. Why the dose needs to be so high is a mystery to me; I'm 5'7 and 116 pounds. Remember that all pills will affect women differently, and will affect you differently depending on your stage in life. What works now might not work later and vice versa, so try to give your pill a fair chance and consider other factors that might be causing your "side effects".	F	22	4.5  years 1X D	8/24/2011
4	Birth Control and PCOS	loss of libido, but that's it!	My skin is great, and I've lost 25lbs!  There is a slight loss of libido, but its worth it.  I've tried just about every other bc out there and none ever agreed with me until now.	F	28	4  months 1X D	8/20/2011
3	Contraceptive	On the pill: Pros- weight loss, breast size went up slightly, short periods. Cons- loss of libido, hair is falling out and thinning out, I have never had migraines before and now experience them about once a month. I've always been a bit emotional and this bc has pretty much numbed that. Side effects immediately after stopping desogen:Pros- noneCons- I'm a complete nut case. I never really thought about what it meant to supplement your hormones and now I know. I've never been so negative in my life and ending birth control has really screwed me up. I'm never taking a hormonal bc again. I just want my hormones to balance out naturally and be done with this already.	It's great if you don't mind not having any emotions, sex drive, losing your hair, losing your appetite. Basically, it's really not that bad if you don't mind being a zombie.In the process of becoming a real human again! lol, but seriously.

1	relieve endometriosis pain	I loved this up until very recently when discovered low dose pills such as this lower bone density. After cracking ribs from a cough my bones were tested and diagnosed with ostopenia-osteoporosis. Im not even post menopausal yet and now my future is at great risk of bone fractures.  Have no other risk factors other than this pill. Drug co. have known studies prove it lowers bone density, especially in younger women/teens yet there is still no warning on the label. Mircette/Kariva/Desogen/Azzurrette are known as the worst offenders.		F	45	11  years.15 1X M	8/18/2011Email
1	to prevent pregnancy	MAJOR migraines, mood swings, wanting to cry for no reason, always tired and im usually a morning person, cant stand being around certain people, and really bad cramps and went three weeks with a period.	I wouldnt suggest taking this birth control unless u like having migraines, mood swings, and alot of other crap going wrong with your self.	F	25	4  months0.15mg 1X D	8/17/2011Email
5	ACNE, pregnancy prevention	cleared my skin	I had painful cystic acne on my chin, it looked like boils. nothing would cure it except this birth control pill. i have tried others and this is by far the best for acne.	F	23	4  years1 1X D	7/22/2011
1	Birth Control	Headaches, nuasea, Sudden severe onset of depression, crying fits, over reacting, suicidal thoughts, violence and panic	I have suffered from mild to moderate depression in the past, but before I started I was free from any episodes for over a year and a half. I experience a HARD case within day 3-4. Serious mental health issues. I experienced headaches from day 1, though relatively mild, if not for  the sudden mental instability, I would try and see if it improved, but I cannot deal with this insanity. I do not think this is a drug for those who have dealt with mental health issues. I have taken BC pills over 4 years ago and got off them due to horrible mood swings (ortho-tri cyclen), but recently had a pregnancy scare (condoms kept slipping off for no appearent reason) and decided to see if a different BC pill would work. The way I feel right now, I'll run the risk of pregnancy, becuase this stuff is far worse then having a baby. I am swearing off hormonal birth control. (I was taking Solia version of this drug)	F	22	8  days0.15 1X D	7/15/2011
3	Regulate Period	Nausa, decrease in appetite, stomach aches, major fatigue, dizziness.	Even thought k haven't been taking it long it's been the worst 7 days I haven't been eating I don't have an appetite to eat anything if I do its cracker or something I already weight 120lbs I'm not trying to LOSE weight. It makes me feel horrible I'm debating on wheather I should stop taking the pill	F	19	7  days.15 MG 1X D	7/14/2011Email
1	Prevention of Pregnancy	Migraines lasting days, extreme breast tenderness, depression and anxiety attacks, acne cleared and then returned	When I began taking Desogen I felt very sick to my stomach and the migraines started almost right away lasting three days each time, several times a month. I decided to give it 3 months to see if it would clear up, which it did, and my occasional pimple disappeared. However at about 7 months on the pill the migraines returned, the pimples became more frequent, and I feel very tired, depressed and paranoid. I believe this pill is negatively affecting my relationship with my husband when it was suppossed to help us not worry about another pregnancy. I would not recommend to anyone.	F	31	9  months 1X D	6/22/2011
4	Birth control, acne caused by Ortho	Cleared my skin...for 6 months.Never got pregnant! (most important)	Was a godsend at first. Cleared the cystic acne from Ortho Tri-Cyclen and Ortho Cyclen, improved my mood, and had NO side effects. Then 6 months in, my cystic acne came back and so did the crying fits. I'm switching to Zovia because its higher dose. Hope it works out. Overall, a great pill, just didn't take with my body chemistry. (Pay attention to the length of time people take this BC, ignore the stupid "5 days" reviews. Not nearly enough time to allow a birth control to adjust.	F	21	6  months 1X D	6/2/2011
5	Acne	Birth control pills affect everyone differently but for me this has been a great choice.  It has kept my face looking beautiful (about 3 pimples in 6 months) and my periods lighter.  I have no negative side effects to report.		F	27	6  months 1X D	5/25/2011
5	Birth Control	None	I switched to Desogen after having awful periods on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo (bleeding for 10-14 days one month then 2-3 days the next even after 6 months of being on it). I absolutely love Desogen. I haven't had any side effects. My skin is just as clear as it's even been and my periods have much less cramping and they're shorter and lighter than with my previous pill. This birth control really worked for me.

2	Birth Control	Mild acne and skin irritation, incredible mood swings!, cramps throughout the month.	This review is for Reclipsen, a generic form of Desogen. I switched to Reclipsen a little over 3 months ago when the birth control I was taking, Levora, was causing me breakthrough bleeding. My doctor recommended it because the progestin was different and she thought my body might like it better.  For the first month everything was wonderful, I was extremely please with this pill, I had absolutely no side effects. Unfortunately the next month is when the acne/ skin irritation- which I have always had clear skin- kicked in and I started to feel a little moody; getting weepy for no reason. The third full month I was definitely more moody, but it wasn't until the first week of this month that I really noticed how terrible it was effecting me. I seriously feel emotionally unstable and my partner has told me he thinks it is from the pill and I absolutely agree. Needless to say, today is the last day I will be taking this birth control pill.. or any birth control pills for that matter. I am done.	F	22	4  months.15/.03 mg 1X D	4/2/2011
5	Contraception	None	I have taken Desogen for at least 12 years and have never had a single issue with it -- no cramping, breakthrough bleeding, headaches, or other physical symptoms. I take 3 months at a time without a break for a period and have done so for as long as I have taken these pills.	F	43	10  years.15 MG 1X D	3/26/2011Email
1	birth control	Extreme brest tenderness. I went up two cup sizes and Had to ice them every night because they hurt so much. Also, I have always been a positive, happy person. This pill made me feel suicidal. I would not recommend this pill.		F	33	1  months 1X D	3/22/2011
1	Birth control	Since I have been using desogen my face has broken out the worst it has ever been. Also I am having major pains during intercorse which never happened before I started my prescription. I DO NOT recommend this to anyone.		F	21	3.5  weeks 1X D	3/20/2011
1	To Regulate Period	Nausea, Breast Tenderness, HORRIBLE body aches, complete exhaustion, migraines lasting for days, spotting between periods, hot flashes	I've tried three other brands of birth control pills and I can easily say this was the absolute worst. No way ANY pill should make someone feel as horrible as this one did with me. After being sicker than I've been in my whole life, I'm currently waiting on test results to determine if Apri caused damage to my liver. I wouldn't recommend this pill to anyone.	F	26	3  months 1X D	3/17/2011Email
4	birth control and acne	terrible acne for the 1st 2 months w/ a ton of scaring (hyperpigmentation) and some decrease in sex drive	** this is for the generic form of desogen, APRI* I started using Apri again after being off it for a year b/c my face started breaking out again from being off the pill. I am fair-med skin (tans in summer) and have combo skin (more oily in summer, more dry in winter) and prone to breakouts. For the first 2 months, my face was TERRIBLE, the worst its ever been, the breakouts were almost unbearable. I would have up to 6 lg. blemishes, including cystic acne. I wanted to cry and give up but after reading some reviews and talking with my doctor, they said that it takes a few months for you body to get use to the hormones. Now after 3 months, my face is pretty much clear, except for scaring from those 2 months which i've been using clinique even better dark spot corrector for and they are definitely fading. During the 3rd pill pack i only got a few small blemishes that were totally bearable. I also started using Proactiv during the first pill pack b/c my acne was soooo soooo terrible and so i think that has definitely helped clear up my face a ton too. I also switched my makeup to bareminerals (i was soo desperate to clear up my face from apri). After 3 months of using the combo of apri, proactiv, and bareminerals, my face is pretty much clear except for the scaring(hyperpigmentation) that is fading. So FYI your face make break out for the first few months but stick it out and you will see your face clear up after that!!!	F	22	90  days 1X D	3/11/2011
4	Birth control	Mild headaches before menstruation (but I experienced that anyway), mild contact irritation (which again I experienced prior). Slight increase in cup size.	I was on Microgestin FE 1-20 (Loestrin) for almost a year and in the last few months I experienced spotting and breakthrough bleeding between periods. I have since been switched over to Reclipsen (the Desogen generic) which has taken care of the breakthrough bleeding. I haven't really experienced any noticeable side effects besides my breast size increasing slightly. Since I started any birth control my libido has been lowered, being on Reclipsen hasn't changed that.	F	21	3  months 1X D	3/1/2011
1	pregnancy prevention	severe depression, nausea, weight loss, fatigue, mood swings	Don't go near it if you have a history of depression, even mild depression. My moods were always stable, I was always a happy person until I started Desogen. My depression got so severe on this that there were days where I physically could not get out of bed. My weight dropped to 110lbs (I'm almost 5'7"!), I looked so ill. The weight loss was a side effect of the chronic nausea Desogen caused... I took it as recommended. But I couldn't keep ANYTHING down, and would sometimes start gagging just from the smell of food. I stayed on it for a while because after 4 years of birth control, I just assumed that my depression was being caused by something else. Once I was desperate and ready to try anything to feel happier, my boyfriend suggested going off the pill. I did, and within days was feeling better... within weeks everything changed. I haven't had a depressed moment SINCE, and have gained all my weight back so I look healthy again. I'm done putting hormones in my body! This stuff is horrible.	F	20	1  years 1X D	3/1/2011

				F M	 	 	    
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.

2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!	M	37	21  days10 1X D	2/24/2011Email
5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
