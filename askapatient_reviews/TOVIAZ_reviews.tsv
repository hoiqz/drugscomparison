3	overactive bladder	The med worked for overactive bladder, but also constricted the urethra, resulting in decreased rate of urinary discharge and requiring much more time.  With a cytoscopy or cath, the urethra opens up, and discharge rate is normal again.		F	51	2  years 1X D	5/14/2011
4	Bladder - IC		My urologist recommended I try this over Enabelex, and I'm so glad I did. It does have much fewer side effects than Enablex. Doesn't dry me out as much all over, but really keeps me from having to get up to pee as much at night (the main reason I take it). Only downside is there is no generic.
