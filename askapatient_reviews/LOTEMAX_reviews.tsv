2	Dry eyes	Opthalmologist prescribed Lotemax to treat dry eyes which are side effect of epithelial basement membrane dystrophy.  After a few days I started experiencing sore throat and hoarse voice. Did not connect it to the eye drops. Thought it was an allergy or maybe a lingering virus.  Only after accidentally missing a few doses and starting again did I realize it was the Lotemax.  Stopped taking it and sore throat and hoarseness stopped immediately. Doc said he never heard of that side effect.	Side effect was completely reversible and not fatal but be warned that eye drops can have serious side effects.	F	50	2  months1 drop 1X D	1/24/2011
