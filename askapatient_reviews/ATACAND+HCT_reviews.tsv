1	High Blood Pressure	Severe weight gain, discolored toenails.	For years I have been attempting to lose weight.  When I stopped taking Atacand, the weight began to slowly come off and the discoloration on my toe nails went away.  Atacand was the only medication that I was able to take to lower my blood pressure for I live in a high elevation... I'm not too sure if it's worth the weight gain...or the discolored toenails that I thought to be a fungus.	F	57	7  years 1X D	6/28/2011Email
5	hypertension	None known.	I started taking this prescription after checking on this site to find out if anyone else had been having problems with Diovan.  It wasn't really lowering my blood pressure, so I saw the side-effects I had been experiencing.  My doctor tried me on Benacar, but that caused leg pain after a few days.  Someone on the Benacar site mentioned Atacand and how well it worked.  I tried it and had been taking it for several years without any noticeable side-effects.  And it lowered my blood pressure.  I stopped taking it for almost three weeks when my insurance plan lowered the amount they would pay towards non-generic meds.  I took Cozaar for a short time and it was a very bad experience.  I had back and joint pain, my eyes twitched, feet swelled and itched and my taste was off.	F	60	 32mg 1X D	4/18/2011Email
4	HBP due to PKD	Hair loss and sore hand joints		M	39	2  years32 1X D	1/21/2011
3	High Blood Pressure	I have had no side effects.	Started out on 16 mg.  later the 32 mg.  No real lowering of BP on either one. The diuretic makes me get up almost hourly at night.   I DO wish it would work, as I want to continue due to no side effects.  It is rather expensive.	F	67	2  months	11/10/2009Email
3	hypertension	inadequate reduction of diastolic BP; headache.  I now take ATACAND 32 mg and HCTZ 25 mg and this is working well.		F	55	1  years	12/21/2007
5	hypertension	none	very effective and no side effects	F	67	2  years	6/11/2007Email
5	High blood pressure	After taking Atacand HCT 16/6.25 (half of 32/12.5), my joint pain caused by Benicar 20/12.5 has gone away.  My BP becomes much more stable during my daily activities. I don't feel any side effects now.  I'll report if there is a side effect developed in the future.	My doctor gave me Atacand HCT 32mg/12.5mg.  I take half of this drug (16/6.25mg)and my BP is average 120/75. In the past while I took Benicar HCT 20mg/12.5mg (for about 11 months), my BP was about 130/80. My feeling is that Atacand is a better drug for me.	M	67	7  days	6/4/2007
5	HBP	None.	After 1-1/2 months still no side effects.	M	50	7  weeks	2/4/2007
5	Hypertenstion	Minimal side effects, possibly some diarhhea, but not sure if that is related	This medicine has been pretty effective at controlling my blood pressure. I was was previously taking Diovan HCT, which was doing well, but with an insurance change I had to switch to Atacand HCT which is a similar drug. It seemed to take a few days to really take effect.

5	HBP	After one week on Atacand HCT 16/12.5 my experience remains excellent.  Side effects from Diovan 80/12.5 have gone away completely.  Afternoon fatigue, Blurred vision, Orthostatic Dizziness, ED, and Thinning Hair.	Highly recommend.  It's great to be back.	M	50	1  weeks	12/25/2006
5	HBP	Just began today after 1.5 years on Diovan HCT 80/12.5.  Must say this drug worked immediately at stabilizing my BP with no side effects other than energy to spare.	Will note side effects or health concerns as the months progress.	M	50	1  days	12/17/2006
