1	High uric acid levels	Took one pill - after a few hours, turned pink all over like a lobster, with a rash over most of my body. Went to wee in the night - fainted/collapsed for the first time in my life, and was out for 15-20min, accoring to my wife. Taken to hospital and received intravenous steroids (cortisone) which helped a bit; now at home just taking piriton - the rash is still really bad after 4 days. I have NEVER had an allergic reaction before to any food or medicine.	I was first given allopurinol some months ago in conjunction with chemotherapy for leukaemia, to remove uric acid from the breakdown of cancer calls. I also had a bad rash then, which I thought was down to the chemo (it was a possible side effect). This time, not having had any chemo for 4 months, I'm sure the result was caused by the allopurinol. My wife thought I was dead. I won't be taking it again.	M	64	1  days100 1X D	1/21/2013
5	for gout pain	no side effects for me. It doesn't work immediately, but slowly reduces attacks as uric acid diminishes in the blood.	I inherited gout from my Dad's side. Started at age 30 , and I'm now 56.. If i miss my allopurinol for over a week, it can be felt in my lower joints, so I have learned by experience to not miss.  It is too painful.  I take 150 mg/a day. If the uric acid is allowed, thru not taking meds, to build up in the system, it will take a long time (from my experience, up to 3 months) to reduce back again to normal. I also have found out that the gout is way worse when overweight. Damn, isn't that just the way it goes with about every disease?Bottom line, don't ignore this this sleeping giant for too long. I got cocky 3 yrs ago and thought I could ignore taking the allopurinol for a few months. I ended up with excruciatingly painful swollen knees off and on for about 6 months, and my legs literally atrophied from lack of motion, because I was on crutches.  Today I am completely pain free, due to allopurinol.	M	56	20  years150 1X D	1/16/2013
5	gout	none	Prior to starting to take allopurinol for gout in my foot, I was looking into having my shoulder operated on because of sharp pain in my shoulder that I'd been having for a number of years. The problem with my shoulder disappeared and I could once again throw a football without fear.  I have not been taking allopurinol for a couple of weeks and the shoulder problems just started to re-occur.	M	56	1  years20 MG 1X D	11/7/2012Email
5	UC (Ulcerative Colitis)	None due to the Allopurinol itself. However, I take it as a XO inhibitor, to change the metabolism of Azathioprine. The Allop+AZA combo causes mild anemia (11.5-12.0 Hgb).	Allopurinol increases by about 3x-4x the level of an Azathioprine metabolite that helps keep UC in remission (6TGN), and reduces manifold the levels of another AZA metabolite that is toxic to the liver (6MMPN). A combo with Allop (75mg) + AZA (50mg) has kept my severe pancolitis in remission, and brought down the level of 6MMPN from >10,000 to s not affecting my liver in the least).

1	gout	Dry eyes. Red around rims and lids eye doctor said I had ulcers on my eyelids. Very sensitive to light. Very vivid nightmares. My  mom wakes up every time she sleeps in a panik. She says she is really seeing all this. She is full control of her mind but this is scaring her. She also has an itchy rash under her skin. I havent read all your comments yet. But if any feels they are having bad dreams they have never had before or visons in thier sleep please email me		F	86	6  months300mg	7/15/2012Email

3	gout	Tired, easy brusing, dizzy, headaces, teeth ache, frequent urination, abdominal pain.	Am taking 100 mg am and pm but will change to just pm. Still taking and have reduced uric acid to below 8.0.  Got relief from right and left knucle but not the left big toe. Would like to stop but don't want more gout attacks.  It apparently also reduces the risk for kidney stones?  Also intend to try cherry juice.	M	73	1  months100mg 2X D	6/3/2012Email
1	for high uric acid level	My husband took this drug for two weeks,then suffered the most horrible severe allergic reaction and was hospitalized for a month.  He has to walk with a walker now due to this drug.  He legs are  suffering from nerve damage. He has kidney disease and this drug was building up in his diabetic kidneys.  He has not walked properly since.  It is really awful as it has affected his life and mine.		M	66	2  weeks300 mg	4/20/2012Email
2	Gout	Itching, Welts swelled up in random locations, headaches, nausea, every joint in my body hurts now instead of just my ankle. This stuff is awful I have not had an attack in three years and the only thing I was doing was eating a bag of black cherries per every two weeks and bought enough bags to freeze for when not in season and this winter I didn't  buy before the last shipment to the grocery store and low And behold 65 days no cherries and the gout is in full effect. Took allupurinol to try and make it till June but forget that I am headed to grocery store getn some cherry juice and going to choke it down it really does work and no side effects these damn doctors need to get educated on the issues they are diagnosing I was advised on cherries from my chiropractor go figure the one doctor insurance companies don't want to pay for the ones that help without the use of drugs!		M	37	6  days300	3/18/2012Email
5	Gout	Not aware of any been taking fo 40 years  eat what I want  a few beers a month and no major flare ups . Few lapses in prescription seems high stress can trigger attacks without. No attacks with daily doses		M	63	10  years300 mg	2/7/2012
1	High Uric Acid Gout	I got really depressed. I'd start crying for no reason.I got gout 3 times and my feet and knees hurt the whole time I was on it.  A month after I had been off it all my pain went away but my Uric Acid Levels are still high.		M	35	90  days300 1X D	1/31/2012Email
5	gout	No side effects. Have been gout free for nine months. Prior to allopurinol I was having gout attacks every three to four months.		M	34	9  months300 mg	12/16/2011Email
3	High Uric Acid Levels	fluctuating weight, rash, severe kidney stone build up (uric acid stones)	I had severe attacks associated with uric acid levels when diagnosed.  I was told the usual, stop the red meat, smoking, drinking and trigger food etc, problem was and is that I am a non drinker, smoker and had been a vegetarian for a couple years prior to first diagnosis and remained so for another 2 years afterwards while they mucked with diet.  Instead of gout symptoms I occasionally got the weight/rash issues and when I went in for a blocked urethra this year I was informed of the discovery of 6 additional stones in my right and 4 in the left kidney and all of them well over the 11mm range, all uric acid stones.  My system has not been flushing but harboring it for several years.  Allopurinol has lost effectiveness and I am still now in the process of surgery for removal.  Strongly suggest if you have been on this for several years to get an ultrasound on the kidneys and verify your body has not turned to working around the drug as mine has.

1	ucerative colitis	Week, painfully tired, headaches. most days I sleep once or twice during the day and get tiered a few hours latter or wake up tired.	I'm taking it for ucerative colitis. It was added to 25 mg of Mercaptopurine which is a 6mp imune saprussant to make it work better to get of prednisone. No one listed here says they are taking it for UC so I wonder if I'm a Ginni pig. Has anyone took it for IBD?	M	53	1  months100mg 1X D	9/12/2011Email
1	high uric acid caused by triamteren	legs became swollen,red and hot like sunburn. Some pitting on leg and peeling skin. Also nausea and chills.	This was supposed to reduce the level of uric acid caused by triamterene but really messed up my legs. Slowly getting better since I am off it. Using a regimen of cherry juice that seems to be helping.	F	81	21  days100 mg 1X D	7/14/2011Email
1	Gout	No gout attacks. However this drug had caused fertility issues and decreased sperm count to almost 0. Causes infertility and can also cause testicular failure. Would not recommend to any guy who possibly may want to have children.		M	45	10  years100mg 1X D	7/8/2011Email
5	Gout	None	I've taken this drug for years with no flare up's that is after about the first three weeks. I tried to get off the drug once because others had told me that they had success doing so. I had a flare up about four weeks after giving it up. Now that I have been reminded how painful the flare up's can be I will never stop taking again.	M	29	11  years 1X D	6/27/2011Email
1	gout	muscle pains - ankles, knees, shoulders, handscould not sleep or eatToo many side affects	Several people have taken this drug and went into a coma.  It shuts down the organs.  Please be careful.	M	73	3  days100mg 1X D	6/10/2011Email

1	Crystals in the kidney	Severe dry eyes and extreme sensitivity to light... optimoligist and nephroligist do not believe allopurinol is the cause but i disagree	if ANYONE also experienced these side effects please email me, i would ike to know what you did to treat it	F	22	1.5  years200 1X D	4/22/2011Email

3	gout	fatigue, anxiety	I don't think it is effective as cholchicine	M	55	2  years100 mg 1X D	3/27/2011Email
3	Gout	I have been suffering from Gout since I was 23 now 43. I have, I think foolishly, been predudice against taking tablets every day - feeling this is a slippery slope. After a bad 2010 with many attacks I have bitten the bullet and started 7 days ago. I have constant pain in both toes but not as bad as a full blown attack, which usually effects just one toe at a time. I have read the comments and it seems a little unbelievable that the Uric Acid crystals 'melt' but I am going to persist with the Allopurinol.	I have been feeling very tired.  I have had a couple of very bad tummy upsets this week.  I will monitor and update again in a week. Any feed back from others is gratefully received - a trouble shared is a trouble halved an all that!	M	43	7  days300 1X D	1/28/2011Email
4	Gout	None so far		F	68	10  days200 mG 1X D	1/11/2011
5	gout	none that I can be certain are related to Allopurinol.	I had several very painful attacks in the mid 1990's, then none until around 2007 or so. It is the worst pain I've ever felt, so unless a side effect were life-threatening, I would take AP. I haven't had an attack since the one around 2007.	M	64	3  years150 MG 1X D	1/7/2011
3	gout	Right off I noticed that I was tired all the time and at times feeling confused. About every 2 weeks I will get painful welts on my face and scalp. Slight loss of hair on head, eye lids are red around the edges. Back pain on my lower right side and both left and right sides at times. I do on occassion drink some beer but have cut down to almost nothing. Gout symtoms have almost completly gone with an occasional scare.	I was putting of taking allopurinol for about five years but took the plunge after my last plolonged attack on multiple joints, ank;le, knee, wrist all on the left side. The pain was so bad I think that if there was an ax handy I would have used it on my ankle. My aim is to get my blood checked and if I like the numbers, get of this stuff, but I think it has helped thus far. Oh yeah I think the stuff does play a little with my mind. Maybe just cut my dose in half and stay on it?	M	58	90  days100 1X D	12/21/2010
1	Gout	severe allergic skin rash complete with burning, itching.  "One of the most severe rashes she's seen."  Immediately given prednisone and am still taking it.  After 3 days, rash is starting to wane but still irritable.		F	70	12  days 1X D	12/17/2010
2	gout	I have had severe fatigue, extreme forgetfulness, itchy rashes with welts on my hind legs and chest, stomach cramps, burning sensation in legs, tightness in ribcage and significant weight loss.	If i don't take the medicine, I have severe gout attacks. One such attack in June 2010 kept me bedridden for 2 days and necessitated a trip to the doctor. If I take the medication, the side effects occur. Either way I've been feeling seriously under the weather due to gout since June 2010.	M	53	3  months100 1X D	11/19/2010
1	gout	dizzyness,rashes all over,sallowen lymb nods.poped red eyelid,low grade fever to high-fever to low temp in three days,nerve system damaged,vombting,above all skin,head,everywhere itching all over.even prednisone cream couldn't stopped along /w hydroxyzine.

5	Gout	Diarrhoea possibly caused by allupurinol		M	45	8  years300mg 1X D	11/11/2010
5	Uric Acid control	I started using it as result of gout onset. No side effects at all.	Although I take the medicine daily, and it keeps my uric acid in normal levels, I still get a gout flare-up randomly, once or twice a year.	M	55	10  years10 mg 1X D	11/10/2010
2		slight hair loss, lethargic,low resistance to infections now got flu for first time in 12 years conjunctivitis twice in one month	have had gout 5 times in 8 months,so not sure if its helping me at all and am very concerned about the long term effects it might be doing to my body if I continue to take it!Thinking of either alternating the dose or cutting the tablet in half!!	F	62	4  months100MG 1X D	10/10/2010Email
2	gout	gout symptoms went away but had migraines one to three times a day, lowered libido, general malaise, slight depression, occasional confusion with simple questions	all side effects stopped within 24 hours of not taking the medication but gout symptoms are returning so will need to find alternative medication since change in diet does nothing	M	59	3  months300mg 1X D	10/6/2010
3	Gout	Frequent urination.  Urgent urination.  Can't explain the different sensation felt during urination almost like pressure build up or something slowing the flow.  Still pain in my foot at the joints.  No wood...yes Erectile Dysfunction.		M	37	30  days100 mg 1X D	10/3/2010Email
5	Gout	Slight tendency to diarrhoea. I was informed about this by my doctor. Beats the pain by a mile!	Took several months to work fully. Have been completely pain free for sevaral years now	M	66	5  years300 1X D	9/9/2010Email
5	I had gout in my Ankles, toes, knee	As stated in previous reviews allopurinol did bring back Gout as you have to take allopurinol when you havn't got gout, but you have to stay with the plan and keep taking your daily dossage. I seem to have blurry vision and feel tired a lot at first.	1 year down the line I havn't had any gout attacks in nearly 9 months but I do take 1 x 1000mg co liver oil tablet and 1 x selenium tablet daily as a extra precaution. For both cost only 15 a years supply from ebay for both. Both cod liver and selenuim which is a trace element , both are good for the joints in the body so can only help.	M	31	1  years300mg 1X D	9/8/2010Email
1	gout	Complete fatigue, intense joint pain and suicidal 5-month, acute gout attack in both feet that encompassed the entire foot and extended half way up the calfs in both legs. Relentless red/purple swelling in the feet, no sleep for months and thoughts of suicide due to lack of sleep and unbearable pain. The doctors said that this was the worst gout they have ever seen and published photos of my left foot (the worst of the two feet). I have friends that take this drug and they are doing fine. I must be allergic to it. I have a pain tolerance that you wish you had and 5 months of Allopurinol screwed me up forever. The damage done to the connective tissue in my feet may never heal. Poison...at least for me. If you have gout make sure you go to a specialist. Most docs are morons when it comes to gout and will push you down a slippery slope. I am taking Uloric now and it seems to be the real thing....urate level at 6.3 mg/dl in 3 weeks.	Make sure you have colchicine and indomethecin that you can take if a severe attack happens...I did not even know of these drugs and when the intense attack happened I was not prepared. By the time I was prescribed these drugs (3 months into the bout) they did not even touch the pain. One good thing....I am now completely immune to pain of any kind. That gout bout burned out any pain receptors.	M	50	7  months300 mg 1X D	8/22/2010
2	gout on a weekly basis	I stopped taking the drug and my gout went away. ??? go figure.		M	56	 300mg 1X D	7/27/2010
4	Gout	None	Warning: When you start taking this drug you will have gout symptoms for 1-3 weeks b/c the medicine melts uric acid crystals in your joints. Once the crystals are gone you will have no pain and can even go off the meds, but the crystals will accumulate again and you'll have to go through the whole cycle again. Keep on it and stop eating trigger foods - you'll be cured.	M	43	1  years200 1X D	7/24/2010
5	Gout	Tired initially for first 1 month or so and then body fully adjusted to it. Also had 3-4 to be expected attacks initially as a direct result of Allopurinol cleaning uric acid deposits. Since then my 1 year long non stop Gout pain has 100% disappeared.I rate Allopurinol higher than so called God! I will take it for rest of my life with pleasure. 	From some of the comments here I see that some are absolutely clueless about AlloPurinol. Give Allopurionl a chance! You can't undo decades of blood uric acid build by taking AlloP for just few weeks or months! Tough it out initially and you will be rewarded. AlloP for life for me! ALLOPURINOL I bow to you literally!!!!!!!!!!!!	M	36	7  months300mg 1X D	7/18/2010
5	uric acid relief  37 years so far.	i click legs knees and feet.  no pain to mention	genuine reply	M	78	37  years 1X D	7/17/2010
4	Gout	None	Definately reduced my uric acid level but I can still get gout if I don't drink enough water	M	56	18  months300 1X D	6/24/2010
5	early gout onset	none	I diagnosed my first gout attack and had it confirmed by hospital er blood test.  I pressed my doctor for a uric acid remedy because I realized through some research that gout is self sustaining.  The more joint damage the more attacks.  He prescribed allopurinol. It works. I have had no attacks and have not suffered the joint damage that would make me over-sensitive to uric acid levels. I eat whatever I want.(within reason) My mother and a friend were poorly handled and only given anti inflammatory.  I recomended allopurinol and it has helped greatly but their joint damage still allows for occasional attacks.  allopurinol, don't wait!	M	55	12  years150 1X D	5/7/2010
4	Gout	Light diziness, but somewhat more energetic!	Hallelajah, Praise Jesus!!!	M	51	14  days 1X D	4/29/2010
5	gout	Never knew there were side effects until recent articles. Hence, I have to say I had none.	I have had high uric acid levels most of my adult life. One morning some 20 years ago I woke up with a classic big toe gout attack. Following treatment for pain, I started taking allopurinol.  I take one tablet each morning. I have had no symptoms since starting it.	M	80	20  years300mg 1X D	4/14/2010
1	gout	After 2 months, pain and swelling in the knees, which had never had any gout symptoms before, swelling in both great toe joints which started the great toes deviating laterally, putting pressure on the other toes.	I stopped taking the allopurinol and the symptoms resolved.	M	62	3  months300 1X D	2/24/2010
5	gout	ED (yes it can cause it), cataract, tired, headaches, high billyrubin,	after reading some of the comments I will share some of mine...drink more water, cut back on the alcohol, cut back on the red meat.  I heard cherries or cherry juice helps.  as for being tired take it at night...less chance of being tired.  if need to see if taking smaller doses twice a day better then one big one.	M	39	 200mg 1X D	2/17/2010History

2	gout	dizziness, foggy head, could not focus or do my job. had to stop taking it.	It's a great drug for gout if you can take it; most people can. I had to switch to uloric which is working for me.  go to gout-pal.com for great advice on gout. They are not selling anything just a bunch of fellow gout sufferers with great advice.	M	44	2  weeks	1/30/2010
5	Gout	No side effects	Great drug for controlling gout. Have tried another which I realised after a while was making me feel down but then changed to allopurinol and have had no side effects at all... or gout attacks.	M	35	9  years	1/23/2010
5	Gout attacks	No side effects at all.	Allopurinol is a GODSEND! I have been taking it for years and I have been Gout free since the 1st day I took it!	M	47	5  days	1/16/2010
5	Hyperuricemia (>9)	No side effect.	I am taking allopurinol 300 mg/day; uric acid (4-5) and creatinine (1.2-1.4) checked twice a year, remained fairly constant since the beginning of this treatment.	M	65	15  years	1/4/2010Email
2	gout	i have taken allopurinol for a number of years for gout but have been off it for a while now.  The side affects were kidney pain, lethergy and weight gain.	I was taken off this because of surgery and not gone back.  I eat lots of vegies and take black cherry juice now.  No side affects.  Cherry juice if good for bursitis as well as gout.  You can take pills or liquid.  I cured bursitis in less than a week one time.	M	55	10  years	1/4/2010Email
3		I have become very tired and my joints are almost always arthritic and painful, especially knees, ankles and both elbows. I have not been able to exercise with my usual intensity and am therefore gaining weight. I now have eternally "itchy" sides and stomach but no real serious rash. I get dry eyes and my vision seems to be getting worse.	I have been taking the med for 3 months and experienced gout in strange places (at least for me)for the first 3 weeks but it was never as serious as bouts in the past. I used to get gout in my feet once or twice per year but it was always many weeks before it went away. I may have to give up Allopurinol to see if the joint pain will subside.	M	49	3  months	12/31/2009
5	Gout	No side effects	I am on it and know peoal who are on it, no side effects.I can now play soccer, go to gym, and no aches or pains any any joints or anywhere.Headaches first few days but are gone,	M	40	2  weeks	12/19/2009
3	gout in ankles and toes	While taking the medicine it was a fairly mild set of effects. Some tiredness and minor aches. Once I stopped taking it, things changed. Now I have extreme joint pain in hips, knees, and shoulders to a lesser degree. No gout attacks, but more of a nerve type joint pain. Unsure if it is the drug or another problem onset.	I had thought I was developing some form of arthritis but it coincides with stopping the Allopurinol, which I took for years. Coincidence? Must see my Doctor and see what a blood test reveals. Note: It DID cure the gout while I took it. Once the gout attacks initially ceased I never had another episode.	M	56	16  years	12/18/2009
3	gout and IgA nephropathy	First two weeks after starting (and first two weeks after increasing dose from 100 to 200 mg) I have had headaches, nausea, diarrhea.  Throughout all the time I have taken it, tinnitus and mild dizziness.  I hate the dizziness!	I have kidney disease and gout.  I would not take the allopurinol for just the gout--the side effects are too unpleasant and I would rather deal with 2-3 gout attacks a year than deal with the tinnitus and dizziness.  But my kidney doc says the high levels of uric acid are not good for my kidneys, so what to do??  I am sticking with it in the hopes that I will eventually feel better.  I am encouraged by the long-time users on this site who have no reported problems.	F	61	4  months	12/15/2009
5	Gout / High Uric Acid	300mg/day. No major issues and no more gout! Possibly feel more tired during the day.  Will follow advice of other users and try taking it at end of day instead of at breakfast.		M	38	4  months	11/24/2009Email
2	Gout	Sore joints, constant minor gout attacks since taking medicine, upset stomach. very drowsy.	I was told by fellow gout sufferer that this was great medicine. I have to say I'm very disappointed after taking it for 2 months. I've had constant gout attacks since the 3rd week and several joints have severe pain that I've never had before.	M	55	2  months	11/17/2009Email
3	Gout	Experienced extreme gout attacks in foot and knee for about 4 weeks after starting Allipurinol then gradually subsided. Now no attacks at all. Only real side effect is small blistery spots over my hands and arms that are very itchy.		M	56	3  months	11/1/2009

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011
1	manic depression , anxiety	every day had horrible trembles, would wake up from the pills every night , causing me to none stop throw up, not funn at all	DONT DO IT	M	18	7  days30 mg 1X D	1/19/2011
1	Bipolar disorder	No side effects while on the Abilify. But ever since I stopped(4 years ago) I still have dizziness upon standing up and seizures randomly throughout everyday. I cant afford a lawyer or I would sew. SERIOUS BRAIN DAMAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!	I wish i could sew them and make it to where these companies can not sell their poison to another child teen or adult. All they want is money they dont care what the pills do to you.	M	19	6  months10mg 2X D	1/12/2011
1	addition to an anti-depressant	Oh my god it was terrible. A day or two after starting it I got sooooo dizzy I couldn't even stand I just wanted to lay down and die. Worst feeling ever-it made me not able to think clearly, and keep my train of thought. I got off of it within 1-2 weeks	Spare yourself and don't try it	F	18	2  weeks 1X D	1/9/2011
2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email
2	depression/ insomnia	temperature change ever so often, have been feeling like im going to faint the room feels like its spinning. helped with the depression, but did nothing for the insomnia toss and turn all night feels like my joints in my legs hurt. hip just started hurting. makes me feel weird.   i think i gained weight but everybody says i look the same.	if i had a choice i would not take it, i would try and get prescribed some thing else that's just for me it may work for other people a different way.

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.	F	35	4  weeks15 MG 1X D	8/29/2010Email
5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it.

5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.

5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
4	BIPOLAR 2	Severe Hiccups, lasted for 3 days.  Nausea, severe burping, felt like I was going to throw up, lasted for a week.  Slight mania, abbreviated sleep cycles, still having these.  I feel the side effects are worth it because of how well it keeps me from short cycling, which causes way more problems in my life than a little Nausea		M	36	8  weeks15 MG 1X D	6/2/2010
2	Bi-Polar	Lethargic, Weight Gain and Depression has gotten worse.  I want to be taken off this medication.  Having indecisiveness (more than usual) and my OCD has increased.  Not seeing many benefits after being on Abilify for 2 months.  Feeling sadness daily and lack of energy.  Seems to slow me down to a sad halt.		F	53	2  months10MG 1X D	5/29/2010
2	bipolar 2	sleepiness or death tired during the afternoon even after 9 months of taking this med also i'm waking up in the middle of the night; also i decided because of the drowsiness i would go off of this cold turkey- bad decision because he had sweats, nausea and severe headache.....	the doctor wants me to stay on this but the daytime drowsiness is ruining my life and the nighttime waking is too much	F	50	9  months2mg 1X D	5/29/2010
4	bipolar	very beginning days i had a bizarre hyperactive yet peaceful at the same time cleaning mode (well the house needed it since i had been depressed before i flipped into hypo/ mania) mild restless legs, waking up middle night every other night it seems	it seems to be calming me down somewhat from my up following a depression episode...i may need to incr to 7 or 10mg  as i still am having repetitive thoughts / constant urges to shop but has lessend drastically than before beginning taking it.  i have been able to focus somewhat more than before began this drug....was in thoughts randomly shooting off in 50 thousand directions so i have actually lost a little weight 7 pounds being able to focus and be consistent on walking/jog 4 times a week, which pleasantly for me seems opposite to the majority of other posters here...
