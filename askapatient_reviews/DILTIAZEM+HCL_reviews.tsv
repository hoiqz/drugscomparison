3	atrial fib	My husband was taken off nitro patches and put on this drug.  We don't know if this is the drug that has been causig low-grade constant headaches orr if it's a combo of this plus xarelto and aricept, or if the cause is one of the these other drugs.  Has anyone else had headaches from this drug?  Also, ringing in the ears and low energy.		M	73	4  months120mg 1X D	2/9/2013Email

3	fast heart rate with swollen glands	Hot Face Flushing& VERY COLD stinging sensations in lower trunk and my thighs kept me from sleep. Low grade fever persisted even though a throat culture was negative. After 3 wks. itchy and had light rash, began shallow quick breathing for a few minutes a day. Felt wired! So far, not good management of HighBP,since it causes fever which raises BP and I still feel unwell.  But,it dropped heart rate 96 points. (I don't have heart disease.) I hope there aren't Sulfites in these tabs,as I'm allergic to Sulfites.	My doctor introduces new BP meds when I'm sick with bronchitis, the flu etc. Of course, BP is higher when one has inflammation and fever!  So I suffer double.  Plus BP meds can CAUSE a fever so who knows if med is working?  I tried to go upto 120 mg. tabs 2XDAY of Diltiazem for 4 days for even better BP control. I had mild headaches. I GOT TOO DIZZY! I couldn't take a dish out of a sink and put it in a cabinet. (I might try a 90mg. tab 1xDay and skip the bedtime dose, just to have BPlowered somewhat.)

4	atrial flutter, atrialfib,tachacard	I felt for a while a bit down, not actually depressed, it has been the true drug for the firewall I need, as I can break out to a 210 heart rate on a dime even with this pacemaker in. I have post open heart surgical nerve and rhythm damage and am grateful for this drug keeping me going. it is much better than other calcium channel blockers as one I took had me nosedive into this dark place which scared my big mind and upset me that I wasnt forewarned about the horrific side effects of some of these drugs. I take some nerve meds so I find it is best to take cardizem at nighttime and it has the least noticeable affects then. I tried to take a lower dose for a bit 120cd and went into atrial fib at the store..208 rate and counting..I just cant stand having an abnormal heart rate..so I will take the pill if it works.	I would try different doses if your having problems as there is no one drug that anyone could agree on and I would also experiment as to the time of day you take it. I like later at bedtime and it seems to be much more tolerable. I of course would always prefer no drug...but thats not going to happen	F	53	3  years	5/20/2007
