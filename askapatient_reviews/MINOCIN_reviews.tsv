				F M	 	 	    
1	Acne	Lupus like symptoms. extreme swelling that moved throughout the body- swollen knees, elbows hands,ankles. that would get worse with movement rash under skin that would come and go in different. areas, extreme fatigue. blisters on bottom of feet.		M	18	10  days80mg 1X D	9/28/2012
4	acne	upset stomach, nausea	cleared the acne!	F	23	30  days50mg 2X D	8/14/2010
4	moderate acne	Itching on neck and the middle of my back.  Headaches.	Although I was on Minocycline for a short period of time it was beginning to clear up my acne.  However, the side effects indicated that I was allergic to the medicine.  I would definitely recommend this medicine to those that know they aren't alergic to it.	F	22	5  days 1X D	6/16/2010
1	acne	weight loss (water weight), ringing in the ears, weakness, yeast infection, possible LUPUS!	I took it a few years ago when I had a bad breakout. Got rid of my acne, but when I started to feel weak I went right off. Honestly I don't think anybody should go on this drug or anything in the oral acne treatment category. People should be warned of the possible life changing side effects of ORAL acne medication. I went back on another low level acne treatment called solodyn despite my resistance. I gave in anyway to cure another bad breakout (due to stress). After three to four long months I finally saw results. My acne got worse before it got better though. Unfortunately, as soon as my skin cleared up I got a BAD case of ringworm. Turns out the solodyn changed my immune system and I couldn't get rid of the nasty fungus until I went off the med. After taking a blood test my lab report came back positive for antibodies. Now I have to go back for more tests to see if I have drug induced lupus. I'm writing about solodyn b/c it is in the same class as minocycline. Everyone should be aware of the risks involved with all oral acne antibiotics. If I had a choice I would rather live with the occasional acne than have lupus.	F	23	4  months 1X D	2/12/2010
5	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Occasional yeast infections	This drug has worked amazingly well for my rheumatoid arthritis. I was taking the chemotherapy drug methotrexate and after beginning to take Minocin every second day  I was eventually able to stop taking the methotrexate completely. That was almost a year ago and my Rheumatologist says my disease is in clinical remission! The only downside is that when you're taking minocin you have to also take probiotics and eat a lot of probiotic foods so that you don't get yeast overgrowth. Compared to the pain and disability that arthritis often causes, eating probiotic foods is not a high price to pay. Minocin gave me my life back!	F	43	2  years	11/11/2009
1	Acne	Initially, none.  Within a few days, I began to experience headaches, a tickle in my throat, dizziness and oddly enough, I had a weird feeling that I was depressed (could totally be a coincidence).After two weeks on this med, I am done.  I guess I'll suffer with pimples instead  =/		F	44	14  days	3/24/2009Email
2	tooth ache	dizziness, headache, depersonalization, i felt ill	i was perscribed minocycline for acne but i never took it. i had a toothache and the dentist said to start taking this because it would kill the bacterial infection i had. i took it for 3 days, 100 mg at morning and 100 mg at night, and the swelling on my tooth went down but i had to stop using it because it made me feel like a zombie and like i was on my death bed. im not suprised that it puts people in the hospital. it also turned the whites of my eyes a little bit yellow. it's yucky	F	19	3  days	1/17/2009
3	Acne	None while taking the drug. Flare up every time I tried to stop taking it. Possible hyperpigmentation.	I loved taking this drug as my skin cleared up completely and I had no side effects. However, I become a slave to it, every time I tried to stop taking it a had a flare up and had to take another course of tablets. 2 years later I become worried about the long-term side effects I decided to stop it for good. Had a flare up again but eventually it cleared. More worryingly every time I have a cut or scratch it scars quite badly and the scar won't fade for ages. Same thing with bruises, for example, I bumped into some furniture and the bruise in my leg wouldn't go for ages, even after weeks when the purple/blue cleared I still had a a greyish mark. Eventually it cleared. Beware, the doctors don't tell you about the risks, I asked my doctor more then once about the consequences of taking this drug for a long period of time. Do some research on the web before taking it. I'll only take it again if there's no other option.	F	30	2  years	10/12/2008
3	acne	none!	I took this medicine for about 5 months for my acne. It worked pretty good at first, it kept it under control, but didn't really get rid of it fully. My doctor ended up switching me from this medicine to another antibiotic. I only took 100 MG then had it reduced to 50 MG after three months. I had absolutely NO SIDE EFFECTS at all, and I'm not a very "tough" person, I've had my share of odd reactions from medicine. I recommend this for people with mild to slightly moderate acne.	F	18	5  months	9/5/2008
1	rosacea	nausea, dizziness chemical hepatitus	this medication should not be handed out by dermatologists. I was incredibly ill with a virus according to my PCP, because the minicin did something odd to my immune system. I recovered quickly once off the drug, but this is not a drug to take lightly. I'm happier having the rosacea.	F	51	7  days	8/24/2008
2	Rosace flair-up	Extreme headache pain, primarily on the left side of my head, pressure and pain behind my left eye with swelling of the tissue around the eye, and blurred vision.	It did seem to help calm my rosace flair; however I was not made aware that the Minocin could cause these side-effects.  I was in so much pain from the side effects that it drove me to see a primary care doc for what I thought (and so did the Dr.)was a sinus infection.  I was treated with Augmentin 875 for 18 days which caused a whole other set of side-effects - fatigue, insomina, more headache, numbness and tremor in my left hand.  In short, my health has taken a downward spiral all because of meds. I've since stopped all antiobiotics and am trying to flush this junk out of my body. I used to be in really good health for my age and I want it back.  I will try a more natural approach if I have another flair up.  If anyone else has experienced similar side-effects, please e-mail me.	F	59	3  weeks	7/23/2008Email
5	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Limited jaundice which corrected after dose reduction, some limited dizziness at original dosage	I've been taking minocin for three years with continued improvements except for a flare up here and there.  My sed rate was still a little high but that was due to unrelated hypertension which is now corrected with diet and meds. Highly recommended if tolerated.	M	52	3  years	1/29/2008
4	acne	jaundice, increase in liver blood tests results, fatigue	I took minocycline for 1.5 years and noted suddenely that my skin and eyes became jaundice.  My Nurse Practitioner stopped the medication and my jaundice went away and my blood work became normal in 3 months.  I was so happy because I thought I may have had some more serious disease. It did help my acne though	F	17	1  days	12/2/2007
1	acne	lupus like symptoms.  Severe Hives, I could not walk for days.  Bruising easily, severe swelling of joints, face, wrist, hands, dizzy, blurred vision, PAIN SO MUCH PAIN.	I was only on it for 4 days, i did go into the sun.  I have tried doxyc. and other antib. but this one did me in.  I SPENT SEVERAL DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL.  TOOK WEEKS TO START GETTING BETTER.	F	33	4  days	8/8/2007Email
2	Acne	aches and pains, difficulty breathing, headaches, fatigue, general sick feeling, dizziness/vertigo	I took this about 2 weeks.  The first week was ok, just some headaches.  But right around day 10 or 12 the other side effects kicked in.  I stopped it for 3 days, restarted, only to have them return within hours.  I had a bad reaction in the past to doxicycline (also a tetracycline drug). I don't recommend taking this if you have had a bad reaction to any other tetracycline drug. I wasn't on it long enough to see improvement in my acne.	F	26	2  weeks	7/10/2007
4	acne	weight loss- that's a GOOD thing	I first took minocin at age 18 b/c of an acne cyst.  It cleared promptly and I also ended up losing 10 pounds in a month- not at all a problem for me!  My first experience with minocin only lasted 2 months since it was just for that one cyst.  At 22, I was put on minocin again for a continuous basis b/c I'd suddenly developed acne that wouldn't go away with ordinary cleansers.  I'd never had an issue with acne- ever- other than that one cyst.  This time around, it took about 5 months worth of minocin to get results.  My body is now resistant to minocin, so I am no longer taking it.  My skin looks great compared to how it was before treatment, though.	F	23	8  months	4/10/2007
4	cystic acne	Upset stomach-I would get nauseous and sometimes throw up.  One time I got so sick I actually had to go to the hospital.	I have been taking this drug on and off for years. I have to eat yogurt or take acidophilus to replace the "good bacteria" that the mincoin was taking out of my stomach.  Apparently this is common when taking any antibiotics but none of the doctors ever told me.  After I knew that I just eat some yogurt every couple of days and I'm fine! Cysts and acne rarely occur and the minocin works!	F	23	5  years	4/2/2007
5	acne	none	made my horrible skin more clear than ever, a true lifesaver, this is the only thing i needed for perfect skin, very happy with the results i got	F	20	2  years	3/30/2007
1	acne	"Lupus-like symptoms", severe & chronic arthritis	Years ago I took minocycline for a year or so without problem then went off it for the summer (cause it makes the sun worse on you if you go outside a lot).  The first day I took it again after the summer ended, I got severe and chronic arthritis everywhere.  It kind of dissipated a bit after a few days, so I decided to try another pill a few weeks later just to make sure that was what caused it - yep.  It was TERRIBLE!!  I've had pain before, but nothing before or since could have prepared me for it.  24/7 EVERYTHING HURT!!  Walking across rooms HURT.  The only time I was remotely OK was when I was lying completely still.  My parents freaked out because I was in so much pain and when I had to move I moved like an old lady.  I must have gone to 10 different doctors and none of them knew what caused it (because obviously it couldn't be the wonderful minocycline!).  Bullshit.  Eventually my father found some other people online who had similar symptoms and we went to a doctor who would a	F	23	1  years	1/28/2007Email
1	acne	"Lupus-like symptoms", severe & chronic arthritis	# just wanted to finish my last entry...#...a doctor who would actually believe that this was the cause.  She prescribed me an anti-inflammatory and it worked amazingly well.  For several months later I felt mild arthritis, but nothing compared to those first 5-6 months.  About a year and a few months after I took those 2 pills, the minocycline had finally left my system and I felt fine. Apparently there's a 1/10,000 chance of this happening to anyone who takes the drug.  Don't believe the pharmaceutical companies - their interest is in $, not in your health.	F	23	1  years	1/28/2007Email
3	acne	The drug worked well to clear up my acne and I ended up staying on it otherwise my flare up would continue.  Years down the road I had to have surgery and afterwards my bruising would not go away.  The doctor who did the surgury could not figure this out, so he quized me on how long I'd been on Minocin for.  It had been about 5 years.  He then pulled out his medical book and read that Minocin, after being on it for an extended period of time, can leave deposits in your body which caused my above condition.  The bruising eventually faded and went away completely.  Another problem I experienced is the deposits ended up in my teeth.  I have grayish colored teeth and my dentist blames this on the minocin.  This will never fade or go away.  Watch your teeth color and bruising.		F	38	5  years	1/7/2007
2	perioral dermatitis	extreme dizzyness to the point i couln't drive and felt like I was drunk.  made my blood pressure go up to 180/110. went off it after 3 days		F	47	3  days	9/11/2006
1	adult acne, rosacea	systemic pruritis:  palms of hands, scalp, ears, groin, etc...followed by joint and muscle pain in arms, blurred vision,	I was taking 100mg bid and using Klaron	F	43	3  weeks	7/31/2006
5	acne	None that I know of.	Has worked better than any other acne medication/antibiotic Ive tried.  Has taken away the majority of my acne.	F	24	1  years	6/30/2006
3	Acne	I really thought I was getting somewhere with these pills, until I'd been taking them for 7-10 days and I started itching all over.  It was unbearable, drove me mad but I tried to persevere as I could see good changes in my acne!  My doc said to stop the pills immediately as I had a rare allergy to them.	Definately worth a try for acne sufferers, I hate that I developed an allergy, but as I said, it is rare to have this so you should be okay.  The itching starts 7-14 days after starting the course, and didn't stop until I'd stopped taking them for about 3 days - nightmare!!	F	28	12  days	11/25/2005
1	acne	Ischemic colitis.	I took this drug twice for 5 days on two separate occasions approx. 4 years apart. Both times wound up in the ER and the hospital for 6 days the second time. Ischemic colitis was diagnosed the second time. I took it the second time because no one believed that the Minocin was the cause of the colitis the first time. Uh, it was.	M	30	5  days	5/23/2005

1	dermatologist	Briefly?  He put me on it for seven months.  It has destroyed my life.  I have IBS for 8 years...pain, gas, bloating.  This man has done to me what the medical establishment is doing to people left and right:  He took a fabulously healthy person and made her chronically ill.  Why?  Because the medical industry does not make money on you when you are healthy.  What's worse is that there was no need to do this to me.  I have good skin.  If you want a great complexion, GO TO A NUTRITIONIST!  STAY AWAY FROM LONG-TERM ANTIBIOTIC USE.  PLEASE DONT DO IT.	DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.	F	44	7  months	8/7/2003

5	Acne	None.	This drug cleared up my acne which I had on my face and on my back.  I was 30 years old and I had acne since I was a teenager.  I started taking one pilld daily, and twice daily during my period.  Once my skin cleared up, I tapered off it.  Now I have almost perfect skin, and I take it rarely, only when I experience an acne flare up.	F	33	3  years	9/6/2002
5	Acne	none	I had severe inflammed painful acne all over my face, scalp, chest and back.  I refused to go on Accutane because of all the terrible side effects so I was put on Minocycline 100mg/daily and after 10 weeks it reduced the acne by at 90%!.  The inflammation is all gone, the redness is gone, all i have now is 2 or 3 little tiny pimples on my face that are hard to see - its much better than having 150 large pimples on my face!
