				F M	 	 	    
4	insomnia and anxiety	Makes me sleep very well each night, but it's not until the afternoon when the fog clears due to the medication from the night before. Anxiety has kept well under control, appetite is good and NO NAUSEA. Plan to wean myself off slowly.	Certainly works for me.	M	55	3  months20mg 1X D	3/22/2013Email
4	Nerve pain (Mild CRPS)	Drowsy, dry mouth, vivid dreams (the day time drowsiness and dry mouth stopped after the first 5 days). Also makes you sleep very easily at night.		F	33	3  weeks25mg	3/17/2013
3	Pain and depression	Still depressed		F	54	5  months	2/22/2013
2	Transformed Migraine	Drowsiness that continues into the next day and this is with only taking half a tablet (12.5mg) which my GP said to start with but even with this dosage the drowsy/groggy feeling is unpleasant.	I have been on this for 5 days with no improvements so far for my condition of chronic daily headache (transformed migraine) and unrefreshing sleep/apathy (mild depression). Will persist for a bit longer and hopethe side effecst subsides and there will be improvement	M	52	5  days12.5 1X D	12/12/2012Email
5	for prereferral neuropathy	Dry mouth, drowsiness, sexual disfunction, weird dreams.	All I can say is the relief for the pain and numbness down my leg certainly outstripped the side effects of this drug.  It helped me have better quality of life and when you are in as much pain as I was, it was very welcome!	F	57	2  years20 1X D	12/13/2011Email
4	nerve pain due to adenomyosis	dry mouth, sleep about 2 hours after dose	it helped turn my agony to soreness.  It hasn't cured my condition but it sure makes the pain more bearable.	F	38	1  months10mg 1X D	9/24/2011Email
2	anxiety, insomnia	From the git go, this product 'zonked' me out big time, to the point I stopped taking it after only 1 month.  I had been taking Zoloft (which worked great), but was prescribed Endep instead when I developed side effects (muscle twitches) after a few months. My doctor suggested I take half a tablet of Endep every night, but then the dosage was too low and had no effect.  I suppose the full 25mg dose may have worked, but I was so doped up I felt out of it anyway so I can't really say if it was effective or not.  I don't recommend this product.

3	neuropathic pain and insomnia	Dry mouth, sour taste in mouth, thirsty, drowsy, no libido and feeling low.	I recomend it's use if you suffer from pain and cannot sleep but since it's also used for depression I'm not sure if it will affect your mood if used for a long time I also take 50mg of zoloft but still feel depressed don't know if any of these drugs really work once your body gets used it.

3	lupus pain and lack of sleep	Endep did help with my muslce and joint pain and it was really good as a sleeping aid ( able to come of sleeping tabs 'stilnox' after 2 yrs of use), but I did have slight weight gain and I needed something stronger as an antidepressant as I was only on 25mg.
