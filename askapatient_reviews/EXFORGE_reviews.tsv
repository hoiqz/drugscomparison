2	Hypertension	About two weeks after starting this medication, I noticed pronounced swelling in my feet and ankles. The swelling would start happening a couple of hours after taking the tablet, and would usually subside in the evening or overnight, only to occur again the next day. Initially I didn't realise it was a side effect, and wondered if it was due to a foot injury (I had been exercising a lot). Decided to stop taking Exforge, and the swelling stopped happening immediately. However, around the same time I began to notice some numbness in my toes and fingertips, and changed sensations mainly in the soles of my feet and palms of my hands, but also progressing up my legs and arms to some degree. The sensation is one of increased sensitivity, which makes walking unpleasant and also touching things with my hands. My GP says it is a peripheral nerve problem, but not damage, which should resolve after a few weeks. I'm not so sure. I have read that Exforge can caue peripheral nerve damage, and am con	Be very careful with this medication. I suffered two significant side effects from different ingredients in the tablet. If you notice any of these effects, especially any peripheral nerve problems, I think it would be best to stop taking the tablets immediately and contact your GP ASAP.	M	56	5  weeks5/160mg 1X D	12/17/2011Email
2	prescribed instead of beta blockers	Uncomfortable swelling of feet and ankles. Possible skin hypersensitivity (not sure if this is due to exforge, or has another cause at this stage).	Exforge seemed to help reduce my blood pressure to some degree, but the side effects were very uncomfortable and somewhat distressing, so have discontinued use.	M	56	5  weeksA5mg-V160m 1X D	11/25/2011
