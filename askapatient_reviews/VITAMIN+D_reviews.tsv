5	osteoporosis	only side effects have been improved health!	diagnosed at age 50 with osteoporosis. Found Vit D level to be only 20. Taking 6000iu daily raised level to 48, so I now take 7000iu to get level to 60+. My varicose veins are better, as is life-long eczema. Feel better and have less body aches. I think my body was screaming for it for many many years, and I think it is a miracle pill!! Of 11 people that I have convinced to get levels checked, 9 were too low! Epidemic...

3	Vit D deficient due to MS	None	I cannot seem to get my levels above 19-25 range. Been on this for 2 years. Lowest I have been is 7. That is when I was very sick. They tell me that is also the source of this deep bone pain I have.. deep in the bones. My PCP just increased it yesterday to 4 times weekly. I pray it helps and I have good results. I also have Ovarian Cancer.	F	38	2  years50,000 3X W	10/20/2012

5	Feeling extremely run down	absolutely no side effect, except I now feel one million times better. Highly recommended this vitamin	I was feeling extremely run down, tired, no energy, depression etc and I had always been a get up and go type person with loads of energy and never depressed. My blood test showed my vitamin D level was almost non existant so I started on Vitamin D3. I took five 1,000 IU pills a day for the first 10 days then I took three pills a day for the next 2 months and now I take 1-2 pills every day. With in the first 4-5 days I felt alot better it felt as though the fog had lifted and I could see clearer. Over the next few months I am back to my old self I feel younger again with more energy and enthusiasum for life. I think my Vitamin D levels had gone down over a few years and I was putting my lack of energy and haziness down to getting older but when I began to feel really run down I went to my doctor for some answers. I had every blood test known to man and the only thing that came back as odd or low was the Vit D. Its amazing what the lack of this one vitamin can do to your life. I also now go outside alot more like I did when I was younger and get the original source of Vitamin D from the sun as much as possible.	F	42	7  months	12/2/2009
2	Vit D deficiency d/t gastric bypass	jittery, nervousness, heart palpitations, irritability, insomnia	Be aware that there is a Vitamin D2 and Vitamin D3.  Prescription strength is D2, and often what is needed is D3.  I took 50,000 iu weekly, and my endocrinologist said there were no side effects.  S.E. started 24hrs after starting, and lasted for two days.  Did this for 4 weeks, then dr switched to Vit D3, 5,000 iu daily, which is much better tolerated	F	46	16  weeks	10/7/2009
