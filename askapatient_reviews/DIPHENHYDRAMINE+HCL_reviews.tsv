1	trouble sleeping	I bought SLEEP II at Walgreens which is the same thing. Like 15-20 minutes later I began do feel drowsy but my mind was racing . I could't sleep because it was as if I had lost control of my mind thinking about a bunch of negative stuff that made no sense. My heart was also racing. Even the next day when I woke up, I felt anxious. I got really scared because my hands and feet felt cold. I thought it was never going to end which made me even more anxious. It was horrible.

2	Sleep aid	I probably slept 12 hours after taking this drug.  That's more than I would have liked!		F	26	1  days	7/29/2008Email
3	sleeping pill	I did become drowsy quite quickly, but I woke up in the middle of the night vomiting. I felt better after vomiting/dry heaving a few times and went right back to sleep.		F	24	2  days	9/14/2006
