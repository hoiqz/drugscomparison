4	chronic diarrhea	None.  It improved my situation by 75%.  Still experience diarrhea but much less frequently.	kind of expensive - ($3,000 for 90 day supply) but insurance covers much of the cost.  Still I hate to take such an expensive med.  Inconvenient - have to take 3 capsules with every meal and 1-2 with each snack.  But - it helps...	M	67	80  daysgelcap 10X D	12/14/2010Email
