5	Plavix was not effective	Significant bruising, even more than Plavix	I credit Effient with saving my life.  After a heart attack resulting in 2 stents, and 2 additional stents placed in the next 15 months, I read about Effient in the WSJ.  My Cardiologist agreed that we needed to give Effient a shot.

5	4 stents, atherosclerosis	Some large bruising when I first went onto Effient, but over time that effect has greatly reduced.	Apparently my body didn't assimilate Plavix properly following my two 2008 stents, so I ended up with a total blockage of a really main heart artery (a full MI) and so literally left Earth for a few minutes in April 2011. (BTW, that's an  incredibly experience -- one both awesome and totally reaffirming that what we've taken to be true really IS.) Two more stents and a change to Effient seems to have done the trick so far. Energy  returned, lung capacity normal, good results.	F	64	14  months10 mg 1X D	6/30/2012Email
5	Have 14 stents	Bruising but it goes away faster than with Plavix.		M	64	1  years10 mg	5/13/2012
4	4 Stents placed	Major bruising on hands and arms - slight bump will cause large dark bruise that takes about 2 weeks to go away. Some areas of my arms seem to be stained from the bruising and it leaves some redish brown coloring that will not go away. Very hard to stop minor bleeding as well.

2	post stent insertions (2)	Thrombocytopenia	This drug put me in the hospital for 1 solid week then weekly blood test until my platelet count got above 50.	M	51	1  weeks 1X D	12/22/2011
4	After Stent Insertion	None, except for the bruises which are mainly on my thighs.	I am satisfied to the degree that I donot know how effective this drug is.  While I have not had any problems, I wasn't having any problems so to speak before my H A.  The only indication that I have according to the Dr. is the  bruise marks tell me that the drug is working.

1	post stent insertion	HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE depression and muscle weakness. Have pre existing fibromyalgia and Effient has made it much worse. Plavix did the same thing.		F	67	6  weeks5mg 1X D	8/12/2010
4	Post stent and myocardial infarctio	No side effects as yet, other than a few black and blue marks if not careful.	I also take aspirin 160mg at the same time.  I was switched from Plavix because I take Nexium.  YOU CANNOT TAKE PLAVIX AND A PPI AT THE SAME TIME.  There is no problem taking Effient and a PPI.	M	58	2  weeks10mg 1X D	6/21/2010
