5	Depression (bipolar)	Loss of Appetite (some weight loss due to that), spaciness when the dose was too high.	This has been a great drug for me.  I've been every class of AD during the last five years and finally decided to give the MAOis a try after not finding relief with the others (or finding the side effects intolerable IE SSRIs).  I went with Parnate first which kinda worked but caused me to have blood pressure spikes after each 10mg dose.  I didn't want to switch to Nardil despite lots of people saying it's the best.  Mainly because from what I've read (a lot of anecdotes) it almost always causes weight gain and anorgasmia neither of which I'd tolerate.  So I've been on Marplan 25mg for ~2 months and it's helped a lot.  My mood is better, I'm better in social situations, and the only real side effect is food not tasting good.  I don't think that's common and sometimes it's annoying but losing 10lbs so far is amazing - definitely love that  :)  Hope it continues to help and also that they continue to make it (it was pulled from the market once before).....

1	Depression	Terrible Drug caused me to become even more depressed than I was, awful too get off took 8 weeks of anxiety,deep depression and confusion		F	50	10  days25mg 2X D	4/25/2010
5	dysthymia/chronic depression	No significant ones. Dry mouth, occasional constipation, ejaculatory delay.	Have tried 25 or more antidepressants over 25 years, alone or in combination. This is the only agent that has produced a clear positive response. Other MAOIs, including parnate and Nardil, produced little or no response.	M	48	 	4/26/2007
4	severe depression	loss of libido, difficulty in ejaculating, somewhat "driven" feeling	I had good results with Marplan, which I took for about 8 weeks (when it stopped working for me, which does happen).  While it worked, I went from a bedridden mess to a guy who was having fun with life.  MAOIs (Marplan, Parnate, Nardil and EMSAM) are the most powerful antidepressants.  Period.
