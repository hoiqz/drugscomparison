				F M	 	 	    
5	Bipolar I	Sedation, issues with toxicity if I skip a meal, stomache pain	Works well, side effects are tiresome as they are with all of the mood stabilisers but overall the drug does it's job.	F	34	1  years	6/27/2009
1	behavior issues	mental slowness, satanic thoughts, possible delay of puberty	This stuff was hell for me. . . somewhat literally!  Those thoughts would stick in my head.  Not only that, but they would corrupt my good thoughts.  I had almost no filter.  I was also numbed to the emotional aspects of good and evil.  The dark side would have seemed just another side of things had it not been for my intellectual knowledge and the grace of God.  I would also be paranoid that gang writing and stuff was satanic.Stay away from those drugs and especially don't drug your kids on them.	F	29	2.5  years	3/27/2009
4	Bipolar I	Weight gain (165 to 180 inone summer) which is OK, I am a 6'2" male and needed the weight.  I didn't use to eat.  Always drinking water and must urinate hourly.  Starting to have high blood pressure and am wondering if it is the lithium.	I put up a big curb on my rage.  Everything used to bother me and piss me off severly.  Now I can still be irritable but can think things throgh enough to not have sudden rage issues.  MADE ME EMPLOYABLE!	M	37	4  times	1/12/2008Email
3	bi polor	weight gain, no need to sleep, stay hungry, constant thirst	last resort for anxity and depression, is effective	M	55	15  days	10/23/2007
1	misdiagnosed bi-polar	extreme exhaustion, delayed reaction time, slurred speech	I've watched my mother on these meds since I was small.  When they gave them to me, I was hesitant about taking them, but at the time I figured I needed them.  Now I know better and I'll never take this again.	F	21	2  days	4/18/2007
4	bipolar disorder	tremor, dry mouth, drowsiness	I have been taking eskalith for about 5 years now.  I was previously taking depakote for my bipolar disorder.  I find eskalith to work in a more even steady way.	F	20	 	9/9/2004Email
