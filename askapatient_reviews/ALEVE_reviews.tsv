1	pain in shoulder	I took one tablet of Aleve 12/14/2012 and within 15 minutes had itching and then burning palms and felt strange. I waked to the next room to tell my wife I had taken an Aleve and that I thought I was having a drug reaction. By the time I finished that sentence I passed out. I went into shock and was taken to the emergency room and was hospitalized for two days. I still cant believe I nearly died from one pill sold over the counter. This is a dangerous medication.			71	1  days 1X D	3/13/2013Email
1	Back Pain	I got up and had a shower in the morning, I was drying my back and I turned wrong and got a strain. I went and took (2) Aleve Liquid Gels naproxen sodium capsules, 220 mg (NSAID). I sat down and put a heating pad on my back.  Within about 10 minutes I started to feel strange, never had that feeling before.  I started to get tingly/itchy fingers and then I noticed my tongue was getting itchy also and I felt it swelling.  I started to walk around thinking I was having a heart attack and then after calming down I realized I was having an allergic reaction.  My face and arms began getting extremely red. I picked the phone up and dialed 911, then I noticed my tongue had stopped swelling and decided to drive to Urgent Care.  I got there and immediately saw the Doctor who figured it was the Aleve, due to everything I did that morning was not out of the ordinary. I was given (2) injections, methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (SOLU-MEDROL) injection 125 mg and diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) inject	If you get those reactions, go to the ER as soon as you can.

1	Stomach pain	Only made my stomach issues worse instead of better.  Also had very itchy hands and feet along with my right shin breaking out with bruises.		F	31	5  days	2/8/2013
1	Knee pain	I was told that aleve would soothen my knee pain. I took 1 aleve after food. In about 1 hour I got a huge hive. Won't be taking it again.		M	36	1  days 1X D	2/3/2013
1	headache	I took one Aleve for a headache before going to bed.  Two hours later I woke up to intense itching of my scalp.  The itching was so intense I wanted to rip my hair out.  I got up and was in shock when I looked in the mirror.  My face and neck were covered in hives, my eyelids  and my lower lip were swollen. Luckily, I had no problems breathing. I took a Zyrtec immediately and then waited for the drugstor to open.  I took two Benadryl in the morning and two more before going to bed.  This morning I still have some hives but in much better sshape than yesterday.	Be VERY careful with this product.  Too many people are reporting the same type of side effects.

3	Toothache	Fatigued and a bit anxious (I have an anxiety disorder though).	Felt extremely drowsy for no reason so thought i'd google Aleve and see if it could possibly be because of that (hypochondriac). Man, reading everyone else's side effects is scaring the crap outta me :D. If my snatch starts to itch i'm gonna be mad! Toothache is gone though so I guess that sometimes you just have to barter :D.

1	For back pain and headache	Within minutes of taking ALEVE, I felt cramps that spread to my lower back, feeling like contractions. Could barely stand or talk. My husband had taken the same medication earlier in the day and experienced lower abdomen and back pain as well. He went to order pizza and could barely articulate his order because his pain was so severe. He took some Pepto Bismol, which helped a little.	I will NEVER ever again take this medication, because this is the second time it happens to me, the first time around I had not linked the terrible lower abdomen pain to ALEVE but I went to the pharmacy in the middle of the night to find something for stomach pain.

1	Pain	I used to take Aleve all the time for cramps it was the only thing that cured it and I never had a problem...but when I take it now I break out in a rash and have difficulty breathing so I've stopped. Wondering if the ingredients got changed?		F	45	1  days 1X D	12/27/2012Email
1	arthritis pain	Took one Aleve after breakfast, was OK until after lunch when a blinding headache hit, became dizzy and frightened.  Had tried taking one Aleve several months ago.  Same experience but  was not sure at the time that it was a result of the single Aleve pill I had taken.  Now I know.  Will never take Aleve again.		F	72	1  days 1X D	12/18/2012
1	Back Pain	I have severe sciatica in my lower back which causes constant pain. I've taken Advil for long periods with no side effects but hasn't seem to address the pain. I thought I'd try Aleve because you only have to dose twice a day. I experienced nausea and my blood pressure spiked horribly to 200/112. Normally I read 120/78. Horrible OTC drug that should be taken off the market.I've since stopped and blood pressure seems to be returning to normal and nausea is leaving.	Lousy drug for pain. Side effects are horrible!

1	headache	Took 2 at 3am.  Three hours later woke up with itchy palms.  Many body parts including hands, neck, eyes etc swollen and itchy.  Went to store for benadryl.  Several hours later hands like balloons along with neck and face. Ears especially inner still not good.  After reading on the internet found I an not alone.		M	49	1  days440	11/25/2012
4	Inflammatory arthritis	Wheezing, tiredness, pain in upper left abdomen, gasI am supposed to take a large dose for 3 months, I hope it goes okay. It has worked well in the past when I occasionally used it for cramps, etc.		F	24	2  weeks500mg	11/23/2012
2	neck pain	My index finger twitching started 3 weeks ago. It twitched in lateral (side to side motion) and the frequency started to increase. I started quickly losing strength in my left hand as well. Then i started having other neurological events - burning, tingling and numbness in my feet and hands. I starting waking up in the middle of the night feeling like my whole body was buzzing. I had hurt my neck a few months ago and was thiking that my symptoms had something to do with it, but the timing was strange because it had been some time since the injury and I was suddenly having mounting issues that all began with the finger twitching. Earlier in the month, I had begun taking Aleve to deal with my neck pain because I was looking for something longer lasting than Advil.Then last week, for two days in a row, i forgot to take Aleve before going to work. By the end of the second night, my finger suddenly stopped twitching. I was flabbergasted. Then the other issues also improved. I thought ab	Aleve caused neurological problems for me over the two weeks i took it: Finger twitching, hand weakness, numbness, paresthesia in my hands and feet, and a sensation of body buzzing/tremor.

1	Menstrual Cramps	I had taken this several times and I felt that it was my magic pill. but today  i took my second dose and within 10 minutes my lip and my right side of throat and inside my mouth felt tingly and almost like i had been bitten by a mosquito and the itchiness continued. I felt some strange sensations on the top of my head and my ears also felt strange. I am not sure if it was my anxiety that caused my heart to feel strange or if it was the medication. I have just taken 2 Benadryl capsules and I am hoping that they will reduce these symptons. I don't think I will take this product again- I feel sort of out of it too and I think that other times I had felt that before getting this serious reaction this time.		F	32	 220 2X D	9/9/2012Email
1	Back sprain	Took 2 caplets as an initial dose (as directed), then one more caplet later the same day (also as directed).  Within 30 minutes of the second dose, my entire torso, right side and back broke out in a red rash, which over the course of the next day or so, spread to my upper arms and thighs, turning a purplish color.  Today, I seem to be in an uncomfortable itchy-bumpy phase, but thankfully the main rash seems to be subsiding.	I am a fairly healthy 52-year old on a trouble-free daily aspirin regimen, and have never had an allergic reaction to any foods or medication. Overall, I'm not sure if this drug helped to relieve any of the back pain. I will never use it again.	F	52	1  days220mg 2X D	9/6/2012Email

1	back pain	have taken aleve in the past with no problems. took 2 and broke out head to toe with hives and itching. shot of benadryl and was okay but did not associate it with the aleve. took 2 more a week later and this time reaction was worse. swollen throat, blood pressure dropped extremly low and dizziness, trempling along with the hives and itching. something has changed so  be carefull with this.		M	46	1  days2 1X D	7/9/2012
1	Back and leg pain	Have taken aleve previously with no side effects that I noticed. Took 2 Aleve yesterday morning @ 9:30 and by noon I had hives that began in my feet and then moved all over my body during the course of the day and night. Did NOT associate with Aleve, thought maybe a spider had bitten me. I was also VERY anxious all day--maybe it was from being irritated by the itching but I think probably not. Am sure my blood pressure rose too. I work for a cardiology practice and one of my doctors gave me 1 Aleve before lunch which I took then looked at the bottle and saw hives is a side effect. Bingo! I knew at once this is the source of all the itching. Now 3 hours after that 1 Aleve, I'm itching all over again but not quite as severly as yesterday, probably because I took one not 2. I won't be taking this product again.		F	64	  1X D	6/25/2012Email

Scratched until my legs started bleeding. Duration 2 hours. Would have gone to ER but who has that kind of time. Aleve, meet bin.	I understand that it works for some people, but jeezzzzz.

1	lower back pain	After two doses for back pain, began to experience severe stomach pain; fatigue, mild headache, lower abdominal pain, loss of appetite, bloating, trouble sleeping. Doc says allergic reaction to Aleve. Prescribed Protonix for probable stomach damage.	As I have a hx of stomach problems, I should have heeded the warning label.

1		My husband took one Aleve gel-cap.  A severe allergic reaction set in almost immediately.  The reaction was terrifying.  I drove him to a hospital, where he passed out.  His vitals were all at a dangerously low level.  He has never had any allergic reaction to any over the counter or other medications.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PAIN KILLER TO ANYONE!

3	Tendinopathy	Various digestive issues, nausea, burning, diarreha	Even though it's OTC, very important to limit time on this drug.  For my particular problem, efficacy wasn't all that great.  Acetaminophen actually provided better pain relief.  That drug of course has its problems as well.	M	63	5  months2x220 3X W	5/15/2012
2	shoulder pain	took aleve for shoulder pain, 4 in the morning, 3 @ lunch and then 4 in afternoon because shoulder was killin me, to night I have severe itching on  legs and genital area, thought it was bed bugs,lice, ticks etc., but we wash our sheets every two days , itching moved all over then started looking at all the aleve I took, guess too much, hope this goes away soon!

1	headache	Red spots that itched around my mouth and by my left eyebrow. swollen lips	Aleve relieved my headache but caused more severe problems for me. I will not take this again.	F	45	1  days1 1X D	5/8/2012Email
2	Pain in quadriceps and hip	I took one pill of aleve right before a track meet. I felt on cloud 9 after I took it, feeling no pain in my legs. I was literally jumping for joy. I did my events and still felt wonderful, despite the fact I was terrible in one event. About 5 hours after taking the aleve, which includes 2 hours of resting I felt a burning sensation in knees. My knees never even hurt, but for 15 minutes I felt excruciating pain in my knees. I was unable to stand or even bend my knees during the 15 minutes of pain. I will NEVER touch this medication ever again. Pushing through the original temporary pain in my quadriceps, pinch in my hip, shock in my feet, and sting in my ankles after jumping is better than the pain from this medication.	Aleve worked wonders on my friends who took the same dosage at the same time as me.I will never take it again. But, my friends will definitely use this medication again.

1	pain from a fall	I had a bad fall and took aleve for the pain. I fell asleep and woke up about 20min later because I felt tingling on my hands and bottom of my feet. They were itching so bad and soon I broke out in a rash from head to feet. This lasted for about an hour till I had someone bring me Benadryl which took another 30-40minutes for it to relieve the itch.		F	43	1  days 2X D	5/1/2012Email

2	Headache/Migraine	Every time I take Aleve, my upper lip will swell up. This time it was worse, typically it only swells slightly and isn't a problem. But today I took an aleve for my headache and my upper lip swelled to about twice the size, mostly in the middle of my lip. I do not take aleve frequently, only occasionally if I have a bad headache. The swelling goes down fairly quick, within about an hour or less. I won't be taking anymore aleve after this time.		M	19	1  days1 pill	3/21/2012
1	Back Pain	Triggered what appears to be a herpes outbreak. Swelled burning lips and red spots.  I have thought that I had herpes, but have not been able to confirm.  I suspected Aleve so stopped using it and I did not have a "outbreak" for 2 years.  After taking one pill last night I broke out within hours. I hesitated before taking the pill because I had suspicions, now it is confirmed. If I have herpes, then Aleve definitely triggers the outbreak, but after reading some of these comments, I may be having reaction to the Aleve.	Never using again, will not let my children ever take it.	M	48	1  days 1X D	2/29/2012Email

2	Shoulder Pain	Swollen lips, itchy scalp, eyes swollen shut, mild rash on other parts of the body.  Went to the doctor and blood pressure was slightly elevated and had blurry vision.  Took Benadryl and the doctor prescribed some Prednisone.  Feeling much better now.  I have never had an allergic reaction to any medication.  I ran out of Allegra the night before my symptoms started and the Allegra was probably masking the allergic symptoms.  Aleve is going in the trash bin.		M	54	10  days1 2X D	2/17/2012Email
3	severe neck shoulder pain	Burning in my throat and sharp pain like stabbing with a needle from my throat up to my ears. After a while the pain goes to my chest and not sure if it's heartburn like symptoms or just warming pain by the heart and chest. This lasts around 30 minutes.		F	29	2  days 2X D	2/13/2012Email
1	Headache	Tingling palms and fingers, tongue swelling, itching, breathing difficulty, pressure on chest.	I used Aleve rarely over the years with poor results on headaches. Tried it again to cut down on Excedrin usage. This morning I took two. Thirty minutes later palms and fingers began tingling, felt tongue swelling, itching on back of head, neck and shoulders. Started having chest pressure, trouble breathing and coughed up phlegm (I thought) but it just looked like saliva. Thought about going to clinic but I knew I would look like a Tourette's patient with all the scratching. After dealing with it for thirty minutes, things eased up.

1	fever	Gave 1 pill to my son last night for a 102 degree fever.  After taking, he had racing thoughts, talked about gears spinning in his head too fast, and facts and figures running through his mind.  It was a scary experience.		M	11	  1X D	2/13/2012
1	Arthritis	I have taken Aleve from the US before with no side effects.  When the drug became available in Canada I was glad to see it here, however, I took Aleve for my arthritis and my hands and body began to tingle, my lips went numb, my tongue swelled up, and I developed a rash all over my body.  I went to the hospital ER and the treated me for six hours and then I was released.  I have never had any reaction to any other drugs in my 63 years. This experience has made me warey of any drug containing fillers and dyes.  I don't understand why I had not problems using Aleve before??	It would appear that this is a very dangerous drug for some people to take, me included and warrants an investigation by both food and drug agencies on both sides of the border.

It was unbearable. I took four Benadryl which gave no relief. My husband rushed me to the emergency room - by then my throat was swollen and I was incoherent and my blood pressure had escalated. I was treated and released with strict instructions from the physician not to ever take Aleve or even ibuprofin again. He said that any future allergic reactions would be worse.

Treated it as a yeast infection for almost a week (as long as symptoms lasted). Began to blister on genitals. Very painful to urinate. Went to doctor and was perscribed anti-fungal meds. and antibiotics for the infection.  2 days after symptoms began to clear, I took Aleve again for back pain (not knowing it caused a reaction the first time).

It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.

Worst feeling ever-it made me not able to think clearly, and keep my train of thought. I got off of it within 1-2 weeks	Spare yourself and don't try it	F	18	2  weeks 1X D	1/9/2011
2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.

1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010

I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR.

5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it.

5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.

5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
4	BIPOLAR 2	Severe Hiccups, lasted for 3 days.  Nausea, severe burping, felt like I was going to throw up, lasted for a week.  Slight mania, abbreviated sleep cycles, still having these.  I feel the side effects are worth it because of how well it keeps me from short cycling, which causes way more problems in my life than a little Nausea		M	36	8  weeks15 MG 1X D	6/2/2010
2	Bi-Polar	Lethargic, Weight Gain and Depression has gotten worse.  I want to be taken off this medication.  Having indecisiveness (more than usual) and my OCD has increased.  Not seeing many benefits after being on Abilify for 2 months.  Feeling sadness daily and lack of energy.  Seems to slow me down to a sad halt.		F	53	2  months10MG 1X D	5/29/2010
2	bipolar 2	sleepiness or death tired during the afternoon even after 9 months of taking this med also i'm waking up in the middle of the night; also i decided because of the drowsiness i would go off of this cold turkey- bad decision because he had sweats, nausea and severe headache.....	the doctor wants me to stay on this but the daytime drowsiness is ruining my life and the nighttime waking is too much	F	50	9  months2mg 1X D	5/29/2010

1	Depression	Brought on RLS bad aniexty thought i was going to loose my mind could not sleep due to the RLS	would never recommend this drug i believe it needs to be pulled  this is a very dangerious drug anyone taking this drug please do your research on side effects	F	50	30  days15MG 1X D	5/27/2010
1	bipolar depression	Agitation, Heart Pounding Anxiety, Insomnia, Sweating, Headache, Shakiness	I took this drug one time, and it was a HORRIBLE experience. Abilify is not the right drug for me. I do NOT recommend Abilify.	M	41	1  days5 1X D	5/21/2010
5	As a complement for Major Depressio	Stiff Muscles and ridigity, upset stomach but those symptoms went away in aprox. 1.5 weeks.	A life saver for me. Eased my stubborn treatment resistant depression. I am starting to feel like my old self.	M	41	40  days15 1X D	5/17/2010Email
3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped. Abilify worked immediately and I haven't been depressed since.	F	24	3  weeks5mg 1X D	5/9/2010Email
4	psychotic symptoms	i was taking Geodon for some psychotic symptoms. have sleep problems (insomnia), switched to Abilify and i felt like i gained some of my energy back (still have sleep problems, though). i haven't had very many side effects with abilify and taking it seems to prevent the onset of my psychotic symptoms.	geodon seemed to help me lose all the weight i gained from zyprexa and helped me keep it off. my weight on abilify has fluctuated and i have not been able to return to my ideal baseline.

1	Bi Polar 2, Panic Disorder	horrible headache, voracious appetite (gained 10 lbs.), dizziness, anxiety, hot flashes, chills	At first this med seemed to be wonderful but after the first two weeks, these side effects became unbearable and I am three weeks off now and still having problems with my increased appetite. Normally b/c of other GI issues, my appetite is very suppressed but now I can't stop eating. However, the other side effects have decreased to almost nothing.	F	33	4  weeks5 mg 1X D	4/30/2010

4	GAD with Nausea	Appetite coming back.  Sex drive increased.  Anxieties seem to have diminished.  Feel a bit tired and flu like at times but not too bad.	Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal. I belive my GAD is finally diminishing - regular therpay is helping me too.  I have had my condition for 6 yrs and 6 months now.	M	45	2.5  weeks2 mg 1X D	4/19/2010
1	paranoid schizophrenia	hallucinations, night terrors, thought people were coming to kill me, locked myself in my studio, saw demons everywhere, racing thoughts, hearing things, couldn't sit still or sleep, the hour or two i was able to sleep was awful, i was going to kill myself but some how made it to the hospital and got some seroquel.  I was no where near this bad before i started taking it.		M	28	3  weeks5-15 1X D	4/19/2010Email
1	Bipolar spectrum disorder	Restlessness, anxiety, drowsiness, face rash	I went on Abilify at the start of an up period, so I don't know how effective it would have been in treating depressive spells. However, it did counteract some of the effectiveness of my lithium, and I was falling asleep during the day more frequently than usual. Had to go off it because of a rash on my chin/cheeks/ears.

5	for depression-w/ my antidepressant	lowering my libido. Craving more sugary, fatty foods and carbs.     I took this several yrs. ago and although the medication initially worked-I packed on more than 10 pounds. I got depressed due to weight gain, but after several months I feel medication ceased to be effective. This time  was very reluctant (2 yrs later & different Dr. & different anti-depressant medication-Prozack-2 yrs ago) but I am trying it w/ a different antidepressant than previously-Taking now w/ Wellbutrin.

THIS DRUG SHOULD COME WITH A WARNING LABEL.  I WOULD AKIN THIS TO RAT POISON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	F	54	4  months4 mg 1X D	4/17/2010
4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue. Negative - I find myself much more emotional - memories, key phrases, smells, songs, pictures, etc.can bring me to tears.	M	50	9  months50 MG 1X D	4/11/2010
2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now. I have woken up from a 12 year-long medication-induced nightmare.	M	57	 15 MG 1X D	4/7/2010Email

2	depression	Nausea the first few days, some constipation, cloudy thinking, increased appetite	Combined with Wellbutrin XL which suddenly stopped working for me after 3 years. After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

Insomnia (but the Seroquel has completely cured that.)	Abilify has helped me like no other drug.  I am on it along with cymbalta, deplin, seroquel and ativan.  Within just a few days I was feeling better and am now able to exercise, clean my house and just moved across the country-something I could never have done during my depression.

3	Bi-polar, Depression, GAD	Terrible night sweats, very vivid, bizzare dreams, constipation, twitching, extreme lethargy...	I don't feel depressed and sad anymore.  I feel kind of leveled out, but I hate the tiredness all the time.  I can sleep for 10 hours, take my son to school, come home and go back to sleep for another couple of hours.  Then still have little to no energy for the rest of the day.  I was previously, taking 60 mg. of Cymbalta for almost 2 years, but my dr. switched me to this when I started to feel like dying again.  I also take Valium (5 mg.) when I feel anxious and panic coming on.	F	35	14  days5 mg. 1X D	2/12/2010Email

3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!	F	38	1  years20mg 1X D	2/5/2010
2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010
1	depression, of all excuses	This is to the PARENTS out there who believe that if their child looks passive on the drug it is a godsend:  Beating someone over the head with a baseball bat can also make them sit still.  Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.	F	31	1  years	1/14/2010
5	anxiety and depression	increased hunger and increased energy	This is a wonder drug for me. I thought I was going do die due to severe depression and anxiety. I am taking cymalta but after about a year, it didn't work. My MD RX'd 5mg of abilify along with my cymbalta every day. In my opinion, it saved my life. I feel like I have a reason to live and starting to enjoy the things I used to, just after one week of starting the med.	F	42	7  days	1/13/2010
4	Bipolar and anxiety	restlessness increased appetite inability to concentrate. Not sure if there are periods of anxiety or nervousness. No Mania	Works for mania. My pdoc says there is activation at low doses. My son started on 10 mg and takes 15 mgs. He also takes 900 mg of lithium and 10 mgs of Lexapro.	M	10	6  months	12/29/2009Email
3	Depression	Weight gain and constant appetite, anxiety, inability to concentrate	Worked well for the depression, but the constant appetite and associated weight gain, along with anxiety at higher doses, was not worth it overall	F	39	2.5  months	12/22/2009
5	Major Depression, PTSD	Insomnia, but only compared to previous behavior of sleeping 10-12 hours per day.	It really works!	M	64	1  months	12/21/2009Email
1	anxiety and mood swings	increased heart rate that made my daughter pass out only after the 2nd day.	after first night of taking my daughter missed school the next day feeling nauseated and stomach cramps. That night she experienced indigestion/heartburn. She vomited. Sleepy but couldn't sleep. Feeling scared for no reason. Next day she passed out after being awake for 15 min. I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug. I got home and looked up the side effects and all of these were listed.  I can only say that we are glad we found out so quickly about this drug.	F	12	2  days	12/19/2009
2	OCD, racing thoughts.	drowsiness, leg pains, akathisia...	it is a great drug to calm down mind... seems to be on a "holy peace"... but side effects are too strong, just for me.	M	23	14  days	12/18/2009
3	bipolar	stopped after 14 months due to heart pulpitations, memory loss, trouble sleeping, slur speach due to excess syliva, after 12 months these things started. At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying. I am very uncomfortable giving a child this age any drug that is diagnosised by trial and error.	M	8	14  months	12/17/2009
2	unipolar depression	nasal stuffiness, dyslexia, word finding problems, increased appetitite, change (worsening) of vision, weight gain and wanting to graze constantly, watering eyes, feel like gravity is heavier (I have to sit down to brush my teeth), very restless around people, visual hallucinations (things disappear then reappear right where I saw them last), trouble focusisng while driving  --- weird.	I am taking 50 mg of lamictal concurrently with 7.5 mg abilify.  Affect is flatter, less mood swings, but more non-reactive than anything.  I'm not sure this is where I want to be. I have been able to get projects done that I had difficulty starting.  Some days I have energy, some days I don't.  I a fasting blood draw yesterday and haven't heard the results yet.  Continuing to take abilify is a quandary -- do I feel worse or better if I factor in all the weird side effects?  I will probably cut down on the dose since I really will be suicidal if I gain any more weight.	F	51	30  days	12/17/2009
3	Bipolar	Some weight gain, some restlessness	My 14 yr old son has been on 2.5 mg of Abilify for 3 months now.  He has gained 8lbs. so we are going to be watching this closely.  It has helped him be able to concentrate, and definitely better in school, and social groups.  Smoothed out the ups and downs.  Previously was on trileptal and zoloft.	M	14	90  days	12/14/2009Email
1	Post-opiate addiction depression	Cannot sit still, terrible anxiety after about 2 weeks, weight gain	This drug should be taken off the market.  After about the 3rd day you will not be able to sit still, ever.  It feels like there is something inside of you trying to get out.  After about 2 weeks I started having severe anxiety attacks almost constantly and came very close to having to be committed/hospitalized.  Smack your doctor if he recommends this.	M	26	 	12/13/2009
5	Depression, bi polar, etc.	NONE, ...perhaps a little sleepy. I only take 5 mg per day.	I know I am lucky for this but I really haven't noticed any side effects. Abilify has been great in that for me it creates a kind of peace of mind by eliminating the aberrant thoughts and whatnot.  I stop talking to myself so much, it helps me get out of my head so to speak...   Based on my positive experience I would tell others to start with no more than 5 mg for the first month...  	M	42	3  years	12/3/2009
2	Anxiety/Depression/Bipolar	It was great made me finally happy but gave me TERRIBLE Akathisia.		M	27	2  weeks	12/2/2009
3	bipolar	insatiable appetite. Gained 7 pounds in 4 weeks.	Worked well on stabilizing my mood. But already being overweight, my Doc said the rapid weight gain was unacceptable and switched me to lamictal. Geodon had been working well for me, but the side effect of clenching my left side...mainly leg and toes, leaving my toes red and swollen, led me to stop taking it. Depakote made me a zombie.

4	autism spectrum disorder/ bipolar	Weight gain - up to 30lb	My daughter has had tremendous improvement in energy, concentration, and mood. Before taking Abilify she was on Geodon and had terrible akathisia. It also interfered with her ability to learn, and she had to withdraw from college courses to avoid failing. (She wound up finishing college with a B average, so you can see she's normally able to learn. ) Once she got off the Geodon, the irritability and stupidness went away but she became suicidal and self-injured. Since starting the Abilify she hasn't tried suicide even once. (Before that it was 14 times in six years.) I am grateful to the Abilify, but I wish she wasn't so hungry all the time.

4	recurrent major depression	Within the first 4 days I had experienced a great sense of relief of the depression. I had a burst of energy that is still there, my old self. I did experience about 3 days of severe headaches , migraines , but I weathered the storm and  the headaches went away. I take Cymbalta 60.mg and now 2 mg  abilify.I would stick with it since it works within 2 weeks.I sleep better, and  am more focused. I do eat more but I think it's the winter and I needed to feel better from the headaches. Diet tomorrow!		F	49	6  days	11/23/2009
5	Autism/ADHD/Bipolar	Muscle pain and sleepiness	My son started taking 10 MG about a year ago.  He has made drastic improvements in his schoolwork and social skills.  He is now making friends and getting good grades.  Besides the leg pain and sleepiness at night it has been great.	M	9	1.5  years	11/19/2009Email
1	bi polar	Weight gain within weeks. I felt bad enough w/o the extra pound a week.Went From 110 114 IN 3 Weeks. Very restless as well. I stopped taking my 10 abilify and continue with ambien and clonazepam	made me feel worse. I would rather deal on my own	F	39	1  months	11/15/2009
1	depression & anxiety	I took this and right away I had more energy. Even joined a Gym for the first time in my life. But than within a week my blood sugar sky rocket, I mean I was in the hospital with sugar over 600, my meter couldn't even read it, and the hospital had trouble bringing it down with fast acting insulin. Then my legs started shaking couldn't keep still. I had to go off it cold turkey because of my dangerously high sugar. It might work for some people but be careful of the side affects.		M	26	1  months	11/9/2009
4	major depression and anxiety	the first night i felt like i was coming down from meth. i adjusted the times i took my meds, because i take asprin, reglan, nexium, and effexor 75's.  i took the asprin, nexium, and reglan with dinner, and the effexor and abilify, plus a half of a klonopin at bedtime, and i sleep through the stomach upset.	the second day i felt much better.  i was able to clean a room, take care of bills, and just never thought of negative things more than twice.  this is my third day, and i was able to joke around with my husband at the store, and though i still haven't showered, i may do that tonight, after i clean the bathroom.  i have great hopes for this med, and hopefully, i won't have to take it very long.	F	47	3  days	11/8/2009Email
5	Bipolar depression	Some weight gain and insomnia.	This drug saved me from the darkest, deepest depression I have ever had to endure.  For over two years, I lost my will to see people, clean house, get dressed, etc.  After just three days on Abilify, I was able to get up, shower, go visit friends in New England (I live in South Florida), clean up my messy house and talk on the phone again.  I have gained a great deal of weight over the years from all different types of medication.  I accept the fact that medication makes me heavy and I am grateful to be heavier and sane than thin and crazy.	F	54	30  days	11/2/2009
5	Depression/Anxiety	Occasional headache.  Woke up in the middle of the night a few times but that got better.  Still sleeping well.	Doctor added 2 mg Abilify to my 10 mg Lexapro because I was still having suicidal thoughts despite the Lexapro.  Its worked great so far and has been a real boost in energy and mood.	M	17	5  weeks	11/2/2009
4	anxiety, paranoia and major depress	restlessness at 20 mg, eye tic at l5 mg, now down to 2 mg daily.  No weight gain at all on any of the doses.	Because of side effects including diabetes risk tried to go cold turkey at l0 mg.  Okay for about 2 weeks then experienced major nervousness, disorientation, jaw clenching, etc.  Now taking 2 mg. daily and feeling much better.  Still worried about side effects.  Not taking any other drug along with it.  Still experiencing anxiety but it is manageable.  You must wean yourself off this drug and not try to quit at once.	F	62	3  months	11/2/2009
3	ADHD	uncontrollable muscle movements, especially when in the car.	My son has been on Abilify (1 mg) for over a year.  We started on .5 mg because of his weight.  I did not want to medicate my child but I had no choice.  He was diagnosed at 2 with ADHD, but I didn't believe the psychologists because it's hard to diagnose something like that at age 2.  He is also ODD.  Last summer he was almost kicked out of daycare because of impulsivity, aggression, and inablility to sit still.  The Abilify worked for him then and continues to work.  I would love, however, if he didn't need it but now he's in kindergarten and has to take it to get through the day.  I was also able to get him a 504 plan with the school since I got another diagnosis at age 4 which was ADHD.	M	5	1.5  years	11/2/2009Email
2	add on for depression	none except rapid and major weight gain	I was very hopeful at first. I felt improvement after the 3rd day when this was added to my Wellbutrin. But in 5 months time, I gained 40 lbs on a petite, 100 lb frame!! I'm really struggling to lose it, and am currently discontinuing because of it. People that I bump into at stores and such ask when I'm due!!Really too bad, I had no other side effects. but now I'm left with this big mess with my weight to clean up.	F	34	5  months	10/29/2009
1	GAD/Depression	weight gain, extreme fatigue, depression worse	I was taking 2 mg of Abilify last Spring after Paxil didn't seem to be working as much any more. I felt ok then I felt bad again. Dr put me on 5 mg of Abilify. I feel terrible!  Extremely tired- so much so that I can barely move. I am going to ween my self off immediately.	F	47	6  months	10/28/2009
3	Mood stabilizer along with Zoloft	I took 1 mg daily and it helped but caused too many side effects. I'm very med-sensitive. I've stopped Zoloft at this point.	I was on Zoloft and Abilify but stopped both due to weight gain. After a lot of research I'm adding Abilify back at 1 mg every three days. I'm very med-sensitive and tend to respond at lower doses than other people do. Will be back to post how this goes. Something has to help. I'm a wack-job right now. Can't control my thoughts and I dwell on bad stuff too much. Can't get sad events out of my mind etc. I have to give Abilify another chance at a reduced dose.	F	62	 	10/27/2009
4	Oneiric states	jittery at low doses, sleepy at high	It has helped me stop feeling like I'm in a dream all the time                                   but my mood is only a little better so far	F	59	3  weeks	10/25/2009
2	Depression	Insomnia, chest pain, blurry vision	Only on 0.5 mg. for three days.  Horrible insomnia no matter what time of day I take med.  Makes me drowsy during the day, hard to tell if my mood is improving due to the side effects.	F	35	3  days	10/24/2009
5	major depressive episode	Energy and hope restored.  Insomnia, head ache, speedy, shaky,visual disturbance,constipation.	Hopefully the side effects subside as my body gets used to the med.  I'm not willing to stop taking the med as I feel so much better with just 2mg of Abilify as an adjunct to Lexapro.  I have hope again.  I got my butt out of bed by day 3 (went shopping) then cleaned the house on day 5.  What a change from the depths of deep epression to my old self in less than a week...WOW!	F	46	10  days	10/23/2009
3	bipolar II	agitation, shakiness, acne, loss of libido, weight gain, inability to urinate	This med helped stabilize my mood a bit, but I could not get the full benefit because I could not increase the dose.  Every time I would go up on the dose, I would be hit by an avalanche of side-effects.  Had to get off eventually.	F	26	5  months	10/23/2009
3	To help my mood	Strange itching in my nose. I made myself bleed by trying to scratch it but couldn't help myself. It tasted good so I'm okay with it.	I've had depression of one kind or another most of my life.  I wanted to feel normal.  But, I ran out of samples after a week.  It wasn't long enough to find out if it would help.	M	56	7  days	10/22/2009
3	Mood Disorder	My son is 9 years old. He started in June on a mood stabilizer.  Abilify 5 mg, worked on mood, however he has gained 25 pounds. He can not stop eating.  He even sneaks food!! I don't know what the doctor is thinking.  We are taking him off.		M	9	4  months	10/19/2009
5	Bipolar Disorder	Very hungry, but able to manage it. Some difficulty sleeping, usually for an hour in the middle of the night. Spending money a little more than usual. Initially had a few days of headaches, not major.	This drug immediately snapped me out of low-grade depression that was steadily worsening. I started taking 2 mg of Abilify each morning and all of my depression symptoms lifted. I only realized how bad my concentration had been because it was so improved on this drug. Like others have said, I lost my hyper-sensitivity to people and situations and replaced that with a high tolerance for life's challenges -- big & small. The side-effects are very minimal at this point, but I'll be paying attention to see if this continues. Lastly, the fact that it works so quickly is a powerful asset if it works for you.	F	39	2  weeks	10/17/2009
1	depression/schizoaffective	can't stop pacing, feel like someone is inside me trying to get out of my skin, insomniac, no sex drive, having to put car into park at stoplights to keep from ramming into someone in front of me; insane.	i stopped taking this today and hope to G-d it doesn't last long in my bloodstream.	F	29	2  weeks	10/16/2009
2	possible bipolar	feel like a crack addict, hard to even sit here and type, hitting wrong keys, clenching jaw, restless beyond belief	on 10 mg...gained about 5-7 pounds, doc swears I need it, am bipolar but w out mania, just very low lows.......need to get off this but afraid of geodon...feel like a speed freak.  sleep is my only relief.............	F	38	6  weeks	10/7/2009
1	Mood stabalizer	makes me gain weight, tired, not sure if it is what causes memory loss, fatigue, moodiness, irratability.		F	35	2  years	10/7/2009
5	Anxiety, depression, mild mania.	Jitters, sleepiness, stomach distress.	This drug is very strong and very good.  I am taking 2 mg in conjunction with 7.5 mg of Lexapro.  It has reduced my severe PMS and helped me with my previous need to sleep 11 hours a day.  Note that I am on one tenth of the recomended starting dosage for someone who is bi-polar; I can only imagine the side effects, however for my purpose it has been a god send.	F	29	1  months	10/3/2009
1	Bi-polar	pacing, high blood sugar, foamy urine, severe thirst, fatigue, pancreatitis, kidney damage	Please stop taking the Abilify immediately.  My husband was prescribed Abilify and it almost killed him. He was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis for 10 days and then on home care hooked up to ivs for another 2 weeks. He is now diabetic and needs to take insulin shots 4 times a day. He is on a very strict low-fat no-sugar diet and may never have even a sip of alcohol ever again. His pancreas is permanently damaged. We are very lucky he is alive. Abilify is evil. Please do not take it. It will kill you.	M	30	 	9/30/2009Email
5	depression, OCD	more alert, motivated, racing thoughts greatly diminished, some nausea, no weight gain!	I was leery about taking this, others make it sound like a nightmare drug. I have no doubt that it affects some people badly, but for me, it made a huge difference. I do wonder if this will wear off after a few months, but so far 5 mg have allowed me to think clearly, get off the couch and accomplish things. No weight gain but dr has me on Metformin to regulate blood sugar and cravings, so that might be the trick there. Important for everyone to monitor their own reactions carefully, or ask family members to help, because every drug works differently for every person. YOU know best what helps YOU.	F	45	2  months	9/19/2009
3	depression/ bipolar	flattening/apathy, word-finding problems, short-term memory loss, trouble concentrating, not able to articulate thoughts and feelings, muscle weakness. To be fair, it made me manic for the first month I took it, which was wonderful, and I say I'm not depressed now, but is apathy really that different from depression?	When trying to stop taking 5mg, severe akathasia that literally kept me from sleeping at all. I'm tapering, now on 2.5mg, but still fearful that I will have the same symptoms when I discontinue again. Feeling a little trapped.	M	35	7  months	9/17/2009
3	Childhood Bipolar, ODD	WEIGHT GAIN, MUSCLE PAIN/STIFFNESS	My son has shown improvement in mood, decreased mood swings, more even temperament, however, he constantly complains about pain in his feet and legs. He describes as burning, stinging pain, mostly in his feet. We have observed more nasal stuffiness. He appears short of breath, at times, however, we are linking this to his weight gain (approx 12 lbs) and history of asthma. We are still observing and waiting to gauge any affect in cognitive abilities (school grades). Time will tell if the side effects are actually worth taking the medication.	M	11	3  months	9/16/2009
1	Bipolar 2-PTSD	Eating abnormal amounts - lethargy - no libido - no personality - sweating	This shit, and yes I say this profanely because that's what it is. It made me more depressed than ever. Yes the headaches and voices went away. But it made me socially anxious , paranoid , ripped me of my self esteem and made me gain weight because all I did and wanted to do was eat. I am an athlete, model, and full time mom. I kissed my life goodbye when taking this shit. Desparate, I stopped taking it. Which made life even more worse. I wanted to kill myself so badly because I wanted the pain to go away. It's all in my head. Mind over matter. I'll be the moodswingin crazy gal I am than risk my life. Also causes muscle weakness. Lucky to be able to carry anything up a damn flight of stairs. All in all, just stay away!!! Spent the whole summer in bed sleeeeping getting fat and suicidal. Whack!!!	F	25	2  months	9/14/2009
1	GAD/BPII/PTSD/OCD	Severe depression/out of touch	I was on Abilify for three weeks.  I started with the 10 mg for two weeks and up to 25 the third week.  On the 10 mg I started feeling "funny" and experiencing some side effects.  By the third week I was self mutlilating (something I have not done in 15 yrs.  I was so depressed I could not function at any level, very irritable and people just were too much to deal with.  All I wanted to do was sleep and just disappear.  My Therapist said it was like I did a 180 in two weeks and was so concerned she called my Psych.  After seeing my Psych, she immediately took me off it and put me on Geodon...not sure if that is a possitive change or not.	F	37	3  weeks	9/14/2009
3	Bi Polar 2	Akathesia, insomnia, anxiety, weight gain, head aches	The Akathesia was awful.  I would lie in bed thinking I was weak or flu-ish, but once in bed I could not get comfortable.  My workouts decreased as I felt weak, dizzy, short of breath, lost balance while stretching. My face would sweat way more than normal.  I could tell I was starting to gain weight and would pack on the pounds rapidly if I did not stop taking this. Since exercise is therpeutic for me, the abilify took that away from me.  BUT it did help control my mood swings (by making me feel like an emotionless zombie) and the need to act out my irritability. However, inside I felt increasing anxiety and irritability.  The side effects just aren't worth it.	F	30	2  months	9/8/2009
3	Depression/Anxiety	I have gained 20 pounds and am not eating any more than normal.  The medicine definitely lifted my depression, but the weight gain now has me looking like a pig.  And, it seemed to increase my libido.	Started off with 5 mg; now am down to 2.5... but, because of the weight gain, I am asking to get off of this medication.	F	40	4  months	9/5/2009
1	anxiety	Akithesia	Do not take this med. I had severe akithesia whereby I had a constant feeling of having to 'move' It was exhausting and I thought it would never leave which made me feel even more panicked. It was the most scared I'd ever felt on a medicine. Before this I truly never paid attention to side effects on labels, now I do.	F	38	 	8/29/2009
4	Bi-Polar	Akathisia, increased libido, insomnia	Loved it the first week until the Akathisia kicked in.  Then I wanted to jump out the car while it was moving... Halfed my dosage, no help.  Halfed the dosage again, no help.  Now I am on 1/8 of the pill.  Akathisia is gone, but increased libido went away.  Still have insomnia taken care of by Ambien.	F	46	1  years	8/28/2009Email
5	for incentive, to mk decisions	none except lots of hope, energy, lack of fear,loss of procrastination, able to make decisions, ability to focus just an all around zest for life with unlimited happiness	If your anti depressant or anti anxiety meds work but you still have no energy, ask your Dr to add Abilify. I had never heard of it but now instead of thinking of everything I need and want to do I am optimistic and bubbling with enthusiasm and energy. Now instead of reading all day long I am cleaning and doing hobbies, kyaking, running, dancing and marching with my grandchildren Whats next a sea plane ride and travel. Was just weeks ago I was close to Agoraphobia. If your meds only get you to the bottom of the mountain looking up and wishing you would, try Abilify, you will climb that mountain, maybe even run up it and then dance on the top!!!	F	62	3  weeks	8/23/2009
2	bi polar 2	weight gain, sugar cravings, excessive sleepiness, inability to exercise (no stamina, gasping for breath)	It helped with irritability (because nothing seemed to matter) but left me unable to live normally and my friends all asked if something was wrong because I was so quiet and getting more quiet with each passing day.  Because the side effects were so crippling, I have stopped taking Abilify and switched to Geodon.	F	60	4  months	8/18/2009
1	Bipolar I	Akathisia, loss of interest in life, Always sleepy, high anxiety, catatonia	Got really bad Akathisia after only 3 days on 10mg. Was taken during a bad manic/pschotic state so was forced to stay on it. Initially was bumped to 20mg which made me catatonic. Back to 10mg kept hallucinating. Added Cogentin, made Akathisia go away but severe anxiety came in it's palce along with lack of motivation and no interest in anything. Severe confusion followed. This sucked my will to live. The Akathisia was so severe I was suicidal.	M	32	7  months	8/17/2009
3	depression; withdrawal aid	VERY rapid weight gain (10 lbs in a month!), constipation, swollen legs and feet, back pain	GOOD NEWS: This drug helped me in the horrible phase of discontinuing Cymbalta.  I was no longer moody and nasty-tempered.  BAD NEWS: the fact that my face is so puffy I now look like a fatter, older version of myself and I now have GOBS of fat in places I never gained weight before (back of arms, waist) proves this stuff is POISON.  It may inhibit thyroid function, because I am not eating more than I usually do (in fact my appetite is less than normal--wierd!) yet I am piling on weight. The constipation, nausea and fatigue aren't fun either.  And I look like CRAP: bloated, haggard, pale, and unhealthy. Phasing off this med asap!	F	31	2  months	8/14/2009Email
5	depression	I have experience swelling of the calves. This may not be related to the Abilify, as I have had a kidney transplant.	My family has a history of serious depression to the point of being institutionalize. For many years now my brother and I have tried one drug after another. Nothing helped us 'open the curtains'. Two mg of Abilify each morning, after just a couple of days, has given us our lives back. This is a miracle drug for both my brother and my self. I must include, we have only been on this medicine for two or three weeks.	M	60	18  days	8/8/2009Email
5	wellbutrin	somewhat more tired, some difficulty urinating..	A Great help.. relieved pain in my shoulders and elbows.. and has rid me of most of my suicidal or weird thoughts and voices.	M	57	25  days	8/5/2009
4	bi-polar 1 disorder	nausea, vomiting, insomnia	I am 5mg, for just about a week, first 2 days I was very hostile, last 4 days restless with insomnia and cant eat much.However I have energy, I get things done, I am back to being social which I was not for over a year and half. No fears of public and can focus to read, play games etc.  My patience level is much better.  Just would like to know when the insomnia and nausea will pass.	M	41	1  weeks	8/5/2009Email
2	Possbile Bipolar 2	Extreme sweating, extreme nausea, weird chest movement, insomnia	Been on Celexa for 10 years now, up and down in dose as lifes stresses went up and down... 40mg now for past 2 years. Doctor added abilify for possible Bipolar 2. I took at 7pm and within 2 hours I was sweating profusely and kept doing so for the next 24 hours, then it started to go away. I wasn't hot, I even cranked up the air conditioner, didn't help at all. I soaked my clothes and sheets. This caused some dehydration which didn't help the nausea. That was also extreme. I never actually vomited but still laid on the bathroom floor just in case. The first few bouts of it I could barely move. I was flushed and weak and trembling it was so bad.I also couldn't sleep, which I'd already been fighting insomnia the past few months. But this made it worse as I couldn't sleep more then 10-30 mins at a time. The constant sweating didn't help when trying to sleep.I'm not saying don't take this med. I dealt with bad nausea for weeks when I first started it, and also when I went without for over a week. Just wanted to share what happened to me	F	32	1  days	8/2/2009
5	major depression/Bipolar	None really..Some initial insomnia but got better with time. Sexual sides are minimal and never a problem	A great medicine.It worked the 1st day I took it (5 mg)..I felt so much better..NOTHING has worked for me except Abilify and Parnate. People love to rant and rave when something is not working for them. Fine. But please don't tell other people to stay away from the drug because it doesn't work for you. If your having a hard time finding something that works, try this med. It works quickly so you'll know if it's for you without having to wait 2-4 weeks.	M	49	60  days	7/31/2009
1	Bipolar Disorder	Weight Gain	I was taking this medicine for about half a year and was recommended to not go off of it. In this six month period I gained 67 pounds. It also made it very hard to lose the weight afterward. Here I am almost two years later, and I am five pounds away from getting rid of the 67 I initially gained. Although the weight is gone, the stretch marks remain and still will. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE.	F	22	6  months	7/27/2009
5	schizo personality disorder	I LOVE ABILIFY!!  It is my favorite antipsychotic.  Side effects range from mild tiredness and hunger spells to insomnia at bed time.  But that helps with Ambien CR which my doc loves to prescribe like candy to me!  Abilify helps tremendously with voices and does not give me the akathisia movement disorder like the "dones" risperidone and ziprasidone antipsychotic do 100% of the time.	This medicine is a mild antipsychotic when it comes to side effects when compared to other antipsychotics.  I would recommend ABILIFY (aripiprazole) over the other atypical antipsychotics any day.	M	29	6  years	7/23/2009

1	major life long depression	I had a STROKE after 9 days on this awful medicine. I've been on wellbutrin for years and started to feel a deeper depression than normal. My psychiatrist put me on Abilify as a boost. Within 3 days I became very confused and very tired. It was the weekend, on Monday I called the doctor. He said it was the side effects and would clear up, that I had only been on it 6 days. On Thursday, I called and told him that I was stopping it. In addition to the confusion, I was having a hard time talking. He said the side effects would probably be gone by my appointment. They got worse! I couldn't remember how to use my utensils, my toothbrush etc. I couldn't spell or write, was mixing up the phone number even if I was looking at it. Monday, he still felt that it was side effects but at my insistence he sent me right to a neurologist, who ran me through a number of tests. He agreed that it was side effects. If I wasn't better in 3 weeks, he'd do a CAT scan. After 1 week insisted on the scan and lo	I was 62 years old and do not have dementia. My doctor did not consider me elderly. At what age does the drug company consider elderly? My doctor said that this shouldn't have happened. I am better but not back to the way I was before Abilify and the stroke. After 13 months I don't feel that I am getting any better and I honestly feel the problems I am still having are permanent. But it could have been worse, I wasn't paralyzed! Even with the computer, this write up has taken me 2 1/2 hours to compose.	F	63	9  days	7/15/2009Email
2	Some psychotic disorder	Akathisia. Insomnia.	Tried Abilify for a while and was hoping the initial akathisia and insomnia would go away, but after a month there was no change, so I gave it up.	M	34	1  months	7/14/2009
1	depression	I had bad nausea and vomiting. Very bad acne. Super drowsy.	It didn't even help with my condition. I have been trying it out for about 4-5 weeks and the side effects are horrible. I was still the same person I was before takin Abilify if not worse.	F	21	5  weeks	7/10/2009

1	Bipolar	Explosive headaches, sexual dysfunction, blurry vision, muscle stiffness, indigestion, nausea, loss of concentration and memory impairment	I am a heart patient and have also experienced sky high BP. I have no idea why this drug would even have been prescribed to me. I agree it is a poison.	M	51	1  months	7/5/2009
4	Pediatric BP rapid cycling	tired, sleepy,	9 yr old boy, started on 10 mg then increased to 15 mg. Takes 900mg lithium and 15 mg Abilify. Takes all at night due to sleepiness. Is a bit far away during the day on the 15 mg. Hardly any mania or outbursts. No complaints of inner restlessness. No weight gain. Appetite is normal.	M	9	1  months	7/3/2009Email
1	Bipolar	Miserable, horrible drug: extreme fatigue, bloated face, mental sluggishness and confusion.	NO theraputic effects whatsoever for me. Useless. I took it for about 6 months in 2003 and was taken off it by my psych. at my sister's urging. She came to see me at Christmas and was shocked at what she found. I was not even aware of how bad it was until I was taken off it.	F	41	6  months	7/3/2009
1	BiPolar II	Severe headache, tooth pain, muscle aches, depression, lethargy, trouble sleeping, jaw pain.	Called doctor and she said I had an allergic reaction to Abilify and to discontinue use immediately.  If you have any of the symptoms listed above, contact your doctor ASAP.	F	35	1  days	7/1/2009
5	Schizoaffective Disorder	I initially experienced Akathesia, Nystagmus and sleepiness. Then my dosage was recently upped from 20 mgs to 25 mgs due to break through depression, after that I did feel some nausea. Other than those few side effects I've felt fine on Abilify. I would recommend Abilify to others who are being carefully monitored by their Psychiatrist. I just happen to have an excellent Dr., which does make a difference.	I take Abilify along with Divalproex Sodium ER 1250 mgs for migraines, Clonazepam, Cogentin 1 mg for Akathesia, 2 grs of Armour Thyroid for Hypothyroidism.	F	47	5  years	6/28/2009

3	anxiety/pmdd/depression	I have tried all the SSRI's and am currently taking Cymbalta 60 mg daily.  I was told that abilify helps so many people in my situation but so far the side effects have been miserable.  Yes, I am more mellow and not as irritable, but I have a constant headache/eye pain (like a migraine), I cannot sleep and I'm nauseous.  I'm reading all these other comments and I'm terrified of gaining weight, so I think I'm going to stop.		F	39	3  days	6/21/2009
1	misdiagnosed	SEVERE AKETHISIA- I had to walk out of the class room daily and skip class because I COULD NOT SIT STILL TO SAVE MY LIFE i felt like something was inside me trying to come out...my mind could NOT control my body, SEVERE WEIGHT GAIN ..and I used to always be thin) made me OBSESSED with food...I would do anything to get to food and i would eat and eat and eat uncontrolably. Never have I been suicidal, but I wanted to die just to get rid of the akethisia it was LIVING HELL. I have permanent side effects... i'm way slower in the head...memory loss...stuttering... I would lie down and not be able to get out of bed I was SO tired at times.	POISON! google AKETHISIA and read the hell it could bring you and your loved ones.DO NOT TAKE ANTI-PSYCHOTICS ... they WILL make you CRAZY so they can keep giving you more pills when you complain about the side effects they will more than likely tell you it's symptoms of something else and just put you on more medication that will permanently damage your brain and life. I can't believe they give this to people knowing what harm it can do.	F	19	6  weeks	6/18/2009
2	Major Depression	weight gain, fatigue/tiredness/drowsiness, loss of concentation	I have ADD and even though I am on Adderall the abilify counteracted it and I had a lot of trouble focusing in school. I am tired all the time getting 12 hours of sleep a night and still taking a 3-4 hour nap in the afternoon. It did help with my depression but recently I have been having suicidal thoughts. I also gained 15 pounds in just a few weeks.	F	20	2  months	6/15/2009

2	Anxiety	Hallucinations, seeing spots (colored), toothaches (the whole right side of my mouth) I know this because when I stopped taking, it was way improved. Headaches, angry outbursts, very very tired 24/7.	Did help the anxiety. However, I couldn't tolerate the side effects I listed. It seemed each day was worse than the day before.	F	35	1  months	6/7/2009
1	Depression	Insanity. I know that sounds wierd, crazy or whatever, but that is the closest word I know to describe it. For three days I went into a world where I couldn't understand what was going on aroung me. I would start to speak, the words were clear in my head, but gibberish would come out. I was terrified for much of the time, curled in a ball, feeling I was about to die at any second.	This drug is now advertised as an add on supplement to anti-depressants. This is crazy! It's an anti-psychotic! It has a side affect profile that if fully revealed to patients would sent them running for the nearest exit.	M	28	4  days	6/7/2009
1	wrongly diagnosed	So, I am posting this message mainly to help others with their emotional/psychological struggles.  I would like to give people who have been put on anti-psychotics some pointers and guidance that might help.  I was on abilify for six years and regret it completely.	Honestly, Abilify works wonders for some people and for many others I can make matters worse.  I have a strong desire to help others so they hopefully don't have to go through what I went through to get to a state of well being.  Everything is anonymous!!

4	Bipolar II	Love this medication.  I finally feel like me again and can handle things.  However, I am EXTREMELY hungry.  Does this go away?  Also experiencing severe muscle aching.  I don't want to go off the Abilify, but can't take the hunger pain.		F	43	4  days	5/30/2009Email
4	Major depression w/ psychosis	Something similar to restless leg syndrome, fidgeting	I've now been diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features along with some other things.  Abilify was prescribed to me because my initial diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder. The two disorders are somewhat similar.  Abilify has more or less completely eliminated my psychotic symptoms and I do well on this medication.  I have not experienced any negative side effects in the past 2 years.  For the first 6 months I had restless legs and some fidgeting problems where it was hard to sit still.  Those symptoms passed and I feel pretty much fine at this point.  I also take Effexor XR, Lamictal and Librium.	F	31	2.5  years	5/29/2009
4	Depression & Paranoia	I've been taking 2 mg Abilify for 2 weeks now, along with my usual 40 mg Prozac and 900 mg Lithium. I feel like I'm on speed or something with abilify! I have no appetite (a good thing-could lose a few lbs), I feel restless, but I feel like I see things differently now. I also have a "full" sensation in my head and a little shakiness. I'm scared, because I keep reading all these bad things about Abilify, but I feel soooo much more alert & interactive now. If only the restlessness would go away, this is a miracle med for me. How long until these side effects taper off?		F	28	14  days	5/28/2009
3	Bipolar Disorder (rapid cycling)	Weight gain (about 20-30 pounds in a six months...without changing eating habits), extreme tiredness, lethargy, shaking/tremors, increased levels of insulin (blood sugar).	It helped my manic episodes and leveled out my mood. However, I don't feel it was worth the weight gain and increased blood sugar levels, which contributed to reoccurring, prolonged (and quite painful) yeast infections.	F	20	6  months	5/23/2009
1	bi polar	This was the worst medicine ever. I tried it for 6 weeks, starting at 2mg, and by the end of the time taking 15mg. My body would not stop moving. I couldnt read a book or watch TV. I found myself taking too many sleeping pills (and i never take sleeping pills) to counteract the movement so that i could fall asleep. This medicine should be used as a torture technique!!. The the doctor gave me sleep meds, and blood pressure medication to help with the Abilify side effects.(the blood pressure meds were supposed to make me stop moving...) So she had me on three medications! (NOt to mention this medicine is extremely overpriced!) You couldn'tpay me to take this medicine again. I am on Lamictal 25mg (a very low dose) and its a miracle. I bet this medicine will be pulled soon. It was just like a poison! Be very careful trying this medication.		M	39	6  weeks	5/19/2009
2	depression and ptsd	inner restlessness and desire to drink or eat	i took this for about two monts along with wellbutrin and at first had a hard time staying awake during the day.  after that passed i began wanting to drink so badly it was driving me nuts.  i began to drink to control the restlessness i felt because i was climbing the walls in my house just trying to get away from myself.  i quit taking it a week again and with just the wellbutrin i feel much better.	F	29	7  weeks	5/18/2009
5	Depression	Feeling a little "speedy" mentally, waking up early (4am), weight gain (about 10-15lbs) in 2mos.  Sometimes I feel overtired and not able to sleep enough to catch up.	I was depressed and Cymbalta was not helping---I could not motivate myself to do anything, even just taking a shower was hard.  Went back to Effexor XR (150mg) which had helped before with 5mg of Abilify and I could almost immediately feel the difference.  Wish I felt a little more energy physically, but I do feel a lot better.	F	48	2  months	5/16/2009
3	psychosis/spirit possession	weight gain, perhaps constipation, perhaps insomnia	I've been taking Abilify for 3 years and liked it the most of all the anti-psychotics I tried. Resperidol made me gain a lot of weight quickly. And Haldol was abominabal - I ate constanly and got ridid muscles, but that was also from all the anti-psychotics I tried. The key for me was finding the right DOSAGE, which was much lower than my doctor put me on originally. 5mg Abilify was just right, but I've been gaining more and more weight over the years and want to go off it due to this serious problem. It did however, protect me from the spirit invasion or what others call "voices" or "hallucinations". The risk of psychosis is one problem by going off of it, but so is diabetes and obesity, as well as other side effects from staying on it. I have weighed the consequences and made my choice. I will add that I'm perturbed with my doctor for not monitoring my weight while I've been on this drug. I think he doesn't want to see that it causes obesity.	F	46	3  years	5/13/2009Email

4	Schizofrenia/Severe Anxiety Mix	Extreme dizziness & Muscle Tremors.	It works well, don't get me wrong. I switched from Invega. I'm on only 10mg and will probably switch to 25mg by next fill up. Totally helps with the anxiety and works well as an antidepressant. I've been able to focus more, but i'm also on Vyvanse for ADHD. I've had no suicidal thoughts what-so-ever. 10mg is a bit low, in my opinion anyway. Also, if you take any anti-psychotics, through my experience, for a month straight, the side effects generally seem to wear a bit off.	M	15	1  weeks	5/8/2009
1	Depresstion	Facial tics - blinking, tongue thrusts to the point where I had sores in my mouth, muscle stiffness, joint pain.  Uncontrollable muscle movements, twitching, jerking. Fatigue.	This medication was the worst thing that I ever took.  I had "parkinson syndrome" from it.  The facial tics & tongue thrusts lasted over a year.  I had to take Vitamin E for the past 18 months to get rid of them.  I still have blinking tics.  My daughter's doctor wanted her to try it(in small doses) but I refused. This was a horrible experience for me.	F	44	6  months	5/8/2009Email
4	bi-polar depression	Week 1: very slight weight gain -- about 2 lbs. that seems to have leveled off; a few days of extreme fatigue. Overall: slightly irritated stomach (I believe this makes me eat more, and is responsible for the weight gain), lighter sleeping, more sleep disturbances. I used to sleep like a log. Now I sleep like a cat. I miss my old sleep.	I was on abilify once before. The doc took me off due to my "speedy" response. But I have ADD, and I really liked the abilify. New doc is a-ok with my response, so long as it works for me. I'm also on Adderall and Welbutrin. Since starting this drug, I actually feel like doing things rather than just thinking about doing them and then thinking that I'll never finish and then getting depressed and hating myself. I'm more social. Self esteem is better too. Disruptive and ruminative thoughts are way down. Overall, I like.	F	33	16  days	5/7/2009

1	depression	facial tics where my left side of my face moved with my inability to stop it, my legs felt like they were filled with lead and I didnt want to work out anymore, my feet tingled and my toes hurt this was the creepiest drug I have ever taken	I felt happy but the side effects were so horrible it wasnt worth being happy (and that says a lot) I'm on wellbutrin and pristiq and this medication was a nightmare. My psych really pushed for me to take it and I had to really stand up for myself to say no. Dont let the commercial fool you and keep trying other drugs cuz abilify is poison	F		2  months	5/6/2009
3	anxiety, bi polar, chest pain	i can barely do anything...i just want to sleep until it hurts.  while sleeping i feel as if i am on a trampoline, i just toss and turn and bounce.  today(day 4) i feel jittery.	i was put on abilify because i was having panic attacks and feeling as if i was having heart attacks.  tight chest and trouble breathing, er visits.  doc thinks its in my mind and that im bipolar.  i cant believe that chest pain so severs is mental.  i havent had a bad attack yet but i feel as if i will collapse, i hope this tired dead-battery feeling goes away or i cant take it, i have a 2 month old.

4	Bipolar Disorder	weight gain, inner restlessness.	I've been on lamictal, seroquel, and geodon since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder two months ago.  Each of those medicines gave me horrible side effects.  Abilify is the only medicine that has helped.  I am calmer, do not have my angry and irritable outbursts.  I'm also a self-injurer and haven't done anything since a couple days being on this medicine.  The downfall, I've been on this medicine for 2 weeks and I've gained 12lbs.	F	23	2  weeks	5/3/2009
2	Bipolar 2	Insomnia, wide awake every hour or two; impulsivity, shopping, eating, speaking; 15lb weight gain in 1 month; became nearly inarticulate, could not convey my thoughts or feelings very well at all; hypomania	I took Ability for a month as an adjunct Zoloft 100mg, which has stopped working.  In term of relief from the depression, the Ability worked wonderfully.  Because of the side effects, I dropped from my initial dose of 5mg to 2mg, and the depressive symptoms/suicidality returned nearly immediately.  After bumping back up to 4-4.5mg, the side effects returned.  This med may be tolerable for others but the side effects were intolerable for me.	F	36	1  months	5/2/2009
5	Bi Polar Disorder, Psychosis	Weight Gain (15 lbs in 6 months)	My daughter is doing EXTREMELY well on Abilify. Her rapid cycling is nearly zero. Her psychosis is also tremendously better. The change is almost as if she is a different kid. She went from extreme  mania episodes that cycled at times within minutes. To near stable in her moods in just days after beginning this medication. Her doctor wants to change her to Geodon due to the weight gain. Weight was never an issue for her until she started taking Abilify. But I think with the improvement in her mental stability a little weight gain is not that significant. I love this medication. She was on 5mg per day up to 7.5 per day after 2 months. It's effectiveness wore off at about 2 months in. No problems since upped to 7.5mg a day. She has no trouble sleeping. I didnt realize how her mania was affecting her sleep until starting this medicine and she is actually tired when it's time for bed. No complaints from me.	F	7	6  months	4/26/2009Email
2	Bipolar	Severe akathesia!  The restlessness drove me up a wall.  I also experienced word loss, short-term memory loss, stiff muscles and joints, tremors in my left hand (I'm left-handed), raised body temperature, weight gain (15 pounds in 4 months), no sex drive, increased breast size with milk coming out of them, fatigue during the day and sleeplessness at night. I took Abilify before I want to bed.  I have tried almost every dose: 30mg, 20mg, 10mg, 5mg and 2mg.  At 5mg and above I experienced euphoria that made me feel like I could probably jump off of a building for fun and be o.k.  At doses below 5mg I still experienced all of the side effects (except for the euphoria)and became extremely irritable and hostile, but otherwise I had no emotions.	To be fair, my paranoia went away. This was the only medication I was taking.	F	45	4  years	4/23/2009
2	Bipolar Disorder	Brain fog, Stiff muscles, inability to ever sit still or relax,	Abilify caused me to not be able to relax my muscles and I was always uncomfortable.  I had a hard time sleeping at night.  Wasn't what I expected. I had to go off of it becuase my grades in school started to drop.	F	23	2  weeks	4/17/2009
5	Mixed bipolar		I have been on Abilify for 2 years with no side effects. It has stabalized my mood along with Tegretal and Pristiq. While my antidepressant often stops working or has to be adjusted in the dose, the Abilify 10 mg has worked for me. I take all my meds at bedtime and sleep well, have no appetite increase or weight gain(terrible wt. gain on Depakote that I have since  lost), no nausea, dizziness, or vivid dreams. For me it's a life saver and I'm able to continue to work at a high functioning capacity.	F	60	2  years	4/16/2009
4	Suicidal thoughts	My mouth is dry and i've noticed i'm not hungry but my muscles ached terribly for the first two weeks.	I'm glad I didn't listen to the scary potential side effects. On abilify I feel even but I still feel emotions only I dont think about how much I hate myself anymore. I'm surprised at how this has worked so far.	F	35	2  months	4/16/2009
3	depression, over fatigue & stress	at first my husband take zyprexa but his doctor changed it to abilify due to gaining his weight. after a week i notice that my husband became restless and move or walk like a robot, though he can sleep he always tell me that he tired very easy as well his muscles. his craving more than before so his cholesterol became higher. so i decided to stop taking abilify and i noticed that my husband movement became normal.

Zyprexa(worked on the outbursts, but huge weight gain,and the threat of him developing Diabetes) He's been on Abilify now fo thirteen days but I'm getting very concerned about side effects, So I'm now considering stopping the drug, It has helped keep him calm, but at what risk to his health,We are running out of options for him	M	18	13  days	4/15/2009Email

3	Resistant Depression/Anxiety	15 lbs weight gain.  Restlessness.  Chronic insomnia.  Night binging (and subsequent purging to curb weight gain).	Ironically, this drug (5 mg to 2 mg with 150 mg of Wellbutrin XR and 20 mg of Adderral XR) helped my self-confidence in social situations by minimizing my anxiety and shutting off my self-critic -- despite shattering my self-image (as a result of relentless weight gain).  At my best, I didn't care.  I shopped nonstop -- because I was constantly gaining weight (in reality) and my clothes no longer fit me.  In my case, my doctor did not listen to my threshold for weight gain.  In two years, I gained 20 lbs with various antidepressants.  Desperate to gain some resemblance of myself back, I began purging.  In the eight months that I have been (on/off) the Abilify, I have vacillated from hypomanic (on) to hopelessly depressed (off).  In fact, the spiraling phase upon quitting the drug (without compliance) has translated to increased anxiety (and dependence on Xanax) and debilitating depression. I do not recommend this drug to young women whose self-image is inextricably related to their appearance in anyway.	F	33	8  months	4/1/2009
3	Depression	Speedy manic feeling, shakiness, feeling like I couldn't sit still, a little nausea in the beginning, craving for sweets at night, WEIGHT GAIN.	I was already taking Prozac for depression but still having depression symptoms, so the Dr. prescribed Abilify to supplement the Prozac. In the beginning, this medicine really helped to pull me out of the funk that I was in.  I felt energized, productive, and like my overall attitude was very much improved.  After a couple or 3 weeks, however, I noticed that I was gaining weight at an alarming rate.  In the 2 months that I took this drug, (at a low dose of 1mg/day) I gained over 15 lbs!  I also felt strangely like shopping and spending money all of the time, almost like I was having a manic episode. All in all, I felt much less depressed, but stopped taking for fear of becoming REALLY overweight. Note: after I stopped this drug, I felt more depressed than ever and almost suicidal.  If you stop, you should probably taper off gradually!	F	45	2  months	3/29/2009Email
5	pediatric anxiety/possible bipolar	nausea & headache for the first few days. Also, tired during the day for 1st week. otherwise, none.	This medication has worked wonderfully for my daughter. She has been on it 3 weeks and for the first time in her life I heard she had a "wonderful" week at school. The side effects are most definately tolerable and my daughter says this medication changed her life. Parents-don't be afraid to try it. I know everything on this site sounds bad, but it has been a Godsend to my family.	F	8	3  weeks	3/20/2009
3	Post Tramatic Syndrome & OCD	I wake up several times in the night and am not able to go back to sleep usually for an hour or so.  I have never had this problem in the past.  I have also been very restless and am not able to stay focused on one task for two long.  I have to be doing something that is keeping me very busy.  I have also noticed increased anxiety with this medication.		M	36	1  months	3/15/2009

4	psychotic episode	filling a little dizzy the first day	after 2 years from  my first episode I had to change from solian to abilify due to sides effects(waight gain ).So far it helps me	F	40	6  days	3/5/2009
5	manic/psychotic episode	restlessness at first, waking up several times in night	Switched to it from risperidone, 4 months after a manic/psychotic episode. I was depressed on the risperidone but depression lifted on aripiprazole (an antidepressant was also added). Didn't have the demotivation and lethargy I experienced on risperidone.	M	24	9  months	2/24/2009
3	autism  bipolar	painful erection of penis	My 6 year old son never had a problem with erections until taking Abilify.  Then it happened all the time and was very painful.  The doctors would not believe me that this was happening - even though it is rare side effect.  His behaviour settled down on the abilify; but we have not seen an increase in bad behaviour since taking him off the med.	M	6	3  months	2/21/2009
1	Bi-Polar	Could not sit still.  Felt confused.  When I say I couldn't sit still I mean it.  This drug had me jittery, and it was the worst feeling I have ever had in my life.  Sit down to watch TV, standing up thirty seconds later.  To come off the drug was worse then the side effects of the drug while taking it.	Be very careful of this drug, it is very powerful, and it takes a good month to get it out of your system.	M	38	4  months	2/21/2009
1	Depression	I went from being moderately depressed, to feeling suicidalwithin 2 weeks. Acute anxiety and paranoia followed.	This is a very dangerous drug.	F	41	16  days	2/20/2009
4	Depression	Insomnia	I started taking this b/c my regular depression just wasn't doing the job. Now I take 2mg of abilify and 150mg of Effexor XR and I haven't felt this good in months. Absolutely no side effects from the abilify except difficulty staying asleep during the night. That's why I gave it a 4. It did exactly what it was supposed to do! Thank goodness!!!!	F	31	20  days	2/13/2009
4	Bipolar and Schizophrenia	None that I can directly attribute to Abilify	I have been taking Abilify for over 2 years now. As a result, I can no longer remember what it felt like to not be on it or what it actually does for me when I take it. It is just another drug that I pop twice a day. 15mg twice a day for a total of 30mg. I do know that my hallucinations are very minimal from what they used to be. But I still hear voices and see things on occasion that are very disturbing.	M	36	2  years	2/5/2009
1	depression	weight gain	I gained 35lbs in 6 months... it helped with my mood swings but when my psych told me it was why I was gaining weight, I went off it.... i hate it =( Now I'm left almost 40lbs overweight	F	22	6  months	2/5/2009
3	depression	weight gain = 60 lbs in 1 yr, craving sweets, developed pre-diabetic condition, BANKRUPTED ME AS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE	I've suffered with intractable depression for decades and have been on just about every medication ever made.  After years of working with an extremely competent, caring psychiatrist, he placed me on a 2 drug combination of 60mg/daily of Cymbalta and 15 mg/every other day of Abilify and, for the first time in a very long time, I do not experience the terrible lows which with I previously struggled.  Now, if I could just lose the weight I gained.....I'd feel much, much better.  Please do not construe this medication combination as a CURE.  I AM better; BUT, I still struggle with depression...just not as often.	F	50	4  years	2/3/2009
5	Depression	No perceptable side effects. This medicine stabelized me and provided some lift. I am taking it along with anafrinil and cymbalta.		M	46	2  weeks	2/1/2009
5	depression/bipolar	weight gain	I gained some weight and told doc, he took me off and put me on Lamictal which just made me very cranky, angry, hated everyone. ( I took lamictal for 4 weeks then when off of it). Am now back on abilify and much better	F	38	2  weeks	2/1/2009Email
1	bi polar-anxiety	my side effects were jaw discomfert, ticks all over body mostly face,worse anxiety,worse depression,loss of vision,head aches,mixed thinking,suicidal thoughts,loss sence of reality,and first six months in this med only slept 30 mins a night,and the first two months on this med i went from a weight of 250 to 180 and rarly ate anything.	when i was 8yrs old i was diagnost with bi polar and by age 18  i was put on this med  by my old doctor who misdiagnost me with bi polar and after my 21st birthday i got a second opinion of my illness and they told me that i have an anxiety disorder and ptsd i have now been of this med for around 5 months and most of the side effects have worsend but my mental state has been entirely diffrent i feel like my self again and im accualy in a great place	M	21	3  years	1/30/2009
1	Aspergers, depression, anxiety	My 10-year old son was put on abilify to quell his anxiety and depression.  He has gained over 40# in 3-months, he beats his head, calls himself stupid and begs to go to God where the pain will be gone.  We are in the process of weening him off this drug for good.	Scary...We were told it did not promote weight gain in children..yet our son gained 40#.  Did nothing about his depression and anxiety and actually made him more manic and out of sorts...Did not work for our child.	M	10	4  months	1/30/2009Email
4	Bipolar II	Mild insomnia	Despite the insomnia, this drug has given me more energy and helped with both depression and anxiety.	M	40	1  months	1/28/2009
1	Bipolar	After two days on this stuff, I've got a terrible headache that won't quit and I feel like I need to vomit.	I'll give it a few more days until I see my doctor next week, but I'm not sure if this is worth it.  Hopefully the side effects wear off.	F	39	2  days	1/26/2009
1	Bipolar II, insomnia	This is one of the worst medications I have ever taken.  I took 1 2.5 mg tab and started experiencing extreme anxiety and insomnia.  This developed into a hypomanic state and I have been lucky to get 3 hours of sleep a day.  I had to start taking Seroquel (which I also hate because it leaves me hung over) and I was able to sleep 6 hours.  Now, I have to take Seroquel to get any sort of sleep.  Also, benzos did not counteract any of my anxiety.		F	34	2  days	1/21/2009
4	head banging	slight weight gain (now taking 1 mg per day with 25 mg Zoloft)When on 10 mg (in error)had severe muscle stiffness and zombie effect.	This has helped enormously-feel less anxiety, more cheerful and outgoing, can speak more slowly and clearly-and head banging only once mildly in 9 months (full moon). I have developmental disabilities and, probably, autism.	F	63	9  months	1/18/2009
3	Severe Depression	Last year, I was started on 2mg and was very irritable...my doctor increased me to 4mg a day and the irritable feelings went away.  However I have gained 50 lbs in one year.	Abilify in conjunction with fluexotine has helped my depression.  However the weight gain is very discouraging...I am trying to lose the weight but it is very hard to on this medicine.	F	23	1  years	1/18/2009
1	halucinations, anxiety	My 10 year old daughter has been on abillify for a year and she had gained weight.  Also, her inner cheeks were sore as if she had began to bite them (unknowingly).  She complains of stomach aches sometimes.  Lately her cheeks, chin, and lips have swollen as a result, I am weening her off.  I am looking for a natural alternative with minimum side effects because my daughter asked me why must she keep suffering.		F	10	370  days	1/16/2009Email
4	Depression	Restlessness, can't sleep very well	I'm taking Cymbalta and Wellbutrin and still was in a fog or in low gear all the time.  My psy thought Abilify would be a good catalyst for the two and it has worked great.  No more fog, I want to do more and wake up getting going.  The only issue is waking up too early; sometimes 3 and 4 am.	M	50	30  days	1/15/2009

				F M	 	 	    
1	bipolar 2 -- hypomania	For the first 5 days I was incredibly organized and productive but this soon flipped (like taking amphetamines, really) into panic and confusion. By three days into the second week (with dosage doubled) I felt like I was crawling out of my own skin, could no longer think clearly, and was very confused and full of anger and frustration towards others, even though rationally I was aware that it was me, and not them, with the problem. I believe one has to take medication for a month or so for one's body to adjust and for side effects to fade, but after ten days I had to stop because I was so agitated and confused. I soon returned to my old self. A horrible experience, really.	Like taking amphetamines, with quick flip from productivity to confusion and anxiety.	F	54	10  days	1/14/2009
4	Bipolar	First two days I was very irritated and quite edgy.  However, I am starting to get used to it and it seems to be working great.  Tried lithiam, depakote which worked great except for the terrible hair loss, so hoping this will stop the loss		F	44	7  days	1/11/2009
1		this is for those who have experienced the horrifying effects of abilify. abilify ruined my life for quite sometime. the worst of my symptoms came on after a month of taking it (extreme anxiety, racing thoughts, nervousness, obsessing)  and then when i came off of it the withdrawals were horrifying (suicidal and homicidal ideations, profound thoughts of suicide, pacing, nervousness, almost psychosis). drug management has never had any negative side effects for me. infact medications had been quite a sense of relief for my diagnosis.  abilify worked oppositely as it is supposed to for me.  i warn all of you to always be of understanding about the side effects medications you are taking. if i would have educated my self on the side effects i might not have been in the horrifying mess that i was in.....and i am still dealing with the grief of the aftermath.	read,read, read and understand the side effects of being on and coming off this medicine.	F	35	31  days	1/8/2009
4	Minor depression, anxiety, and ADHD	Minor akathisia the first day. This subsided with clonazepam. Main side-effects are drowsiness, nausea, mild muscle weakness. Basically flu-like symptoms. For nausea, TRY GINGER PILLS!! Works perfect!	Feel less of a mental fog. Less depressed. A tiny bit more anxious, but wasn't expecting it to do much for anxiety. I have clonazepam for that. ADHD improved in only 3 days for sure. I realize 4 days is not enough time to gauge effects. I'll try to update later when I've been on it for longer.	M	34	4  days	1/5/2009Email
1	Bipolar	Nervousness, legs have to move all the time like RLS, glasses feel weird on my face take on and off and bother my nose never did before, agiatated, sleeplessness and tired and sleepy all day.	I stopped taking Abilify after a month as I would rather be sane and feel normal than live like this.  Wife noticed anger and agitation were heightened and sleep interupted every hour to hour and a half. Woke up at 3-4 AM every day and could not fall back asleep. Need to try something different as can't take these side affects as worse than the symptoms for me.	M	47	1  days	1/4/2009
5	schizoaffective, deppressed	Some restlessness and anxiety	I've found Abilify to be a great maintenance drug, helping to reduce or eliminate paranoia, inner chatter/voices, intrusive images and visions.	F	33	1  years	12/30/2008Email
1	Bi-Polar I w/psychosis	Feeling of unease, legs had to move constantly,could not sleep. sick to my stomach. Just felt horrible, drained all day. Also woke up in unusual places.	I tried this "NEW" medicine for my Bi-Polar w/psychosis. Just horrible.	F	41	3  weeks	12/30/2008Email
4	bipolar	35 pounds of wieght gain, some sleepiness	I like being on abilify.  It helps me a lot with my rapid mood swings.  THey are almost non existent now with the exception of slight depression from time to time.  WHen I try to go off it, I either swing high or really really low.  With out abilify, my depressions are debilitating and i cry at the drop of a hat. It really helps me maintain a normal functional life.  Its when I don't take my meds that I have a problem.

4	Schizoaffective, BPD	Tardive Dyskinesia - severe twitching of both eyes, weight gain	It has really helped me function, giving me the ability to hold a job.  Unfortunately, I've only had a job 7 months at longest, but at least I can work.  Bad part is, the severe eye twitching.  I stopped taking it for 2 months and I relapsed.  I did accupuncture to treat the twitching and it went away, but I had to go back on Abilify to treat my mental illness.  I'll just have to live with the twitching.  God help me.	F	34	1.5  years	12/27/2008
1	depression	Stomach ache, extreme nausea, exhaustion, dizzy, irritable	I don't like this drug. Added it to limictal. Limictal gave me stomach ache this drug added the nausea etc... Taking 10mg. Been on it 3 days.  I'm too sick to care about being depressed.  Getting off it now!	F	44	3  days	12/25/2008
2	depression	There was exteme restlessness for a while.  The drug did nothing to decrease my depression.  Then, I kept getting super stiff, very uncomfortable muscles.  I kept telling my doctor, but he kept telling me that stiff or rigid muscles were not a possible side effect of the drug.  I quit taking it and have sinse read that stiff muscles may be a side effect and may be part of a potentially life threatening condition.  I stopped taking it two years ago and it may be that the medical community was not aware of the stiff muscle side effect then.	If you have any bad side effects from this drug and your doctor tells you the side effect is not on the list of side effects associated with this drug, it may be that the medical community is not yet aware of the side effect.  Find a doctor who will listen to you.  It seems that drugs like Abilify get prescribed before anyone really knows how well or poorly they will affect humans.  I am worried about the long term problems I may be vulnerable to after having taken this drug.	F	36	180  days	12/22/2008

5	bipolar management/anxiety	slight weight gain, active dream cycle	This is a great pill. I am calm, think more clearly, and any "hot temper" I had is gone. I gained a few pounds, but will adjust my diet, no biggie.	F	33	3  months	12/8/2008
4	PTSD (complex)	Exercise regularly? Be careful. I thought I was just tired but muscle weakness was the issue and I hurt myself trying to do my usual routine. Also, extreme drowsiness at first but it went away (reduced bendaryl as well). First few days were difficult but to my suprise it got a lot better. First few days: no "zest for life", drowsy, salivation (lots).	Really helped me function. My concentration at work was poor, and I was constantly being triggered. Also, many compulsions toward self-harm. All these disappeared or became manageable. I hope this will be short term but it's good to know I can use this med if necessary.	F	47	7  days	12/8/2008

2	GAD	extreme tiredness during the day, sleeplessness at night  5 mg at night.	I think it helped with anxiety, however, it made me so tired.  I didn't want to go to work each day because I was so tired.  The day dragged by and would wake up each day at 5 am.  Seemed like the tiredness took away the anxiety	M	31	2  weeks	12/5/2008
1	Anxiety	Extreme akathisia, severe restlessness. I became extremely restless and couldn't sit still, sleep, lay done or stop moving. It was scary. I kept moving and couldn't sit still and I felt all jittery. The akathisia was scary and it lasted the entire time. I got off this drug after a couple days of akathisia and even when I went off it, the akathisia stayed for weeks and it eventually died down. I was only in high school when I experienced the akathisia and had to miss a lot of school.	Akathisia, severe itnernal restlessness on this drug is very severe and it's a scary, terrifying feeling.	F		 	11/27/2008
5	panic, anxiety and rage attacks	I went on a course of Zyprexa before but it made me gain 10 kg. I switched to Abilify and it keeps me balanced without having my mood all over the place. no more panic attacks. the downside is that I cannot miss one dose or else I go on harsh cold turkey and have rampant anxiety.

4	BiPolar some Psycho.	Mimics Parkinson's Disease. Endless shaking on my right side, something is wrong with my "gait", balance very poor...Seeing a neurologist tomorrow.

Took my mother in to Crises Center begining of October, they put her on Abilify I immedietly noticed her symptoms worsening and despite my repeated attempts and concerns to dr's, nurses and social workers she was released. Took her to another hospital for tests 2 weeks after discharge. She was fine. 2 weeks later took her back to crises center only to find out this..She has had constant restlessness, halucinations, paranoid thoughts, mania, depression and many other mood swings and symtoms.

2	Bipolar, rapid cycling, mixed state	Loss of fine motor control due to shaking, especially hands, also some hair loss	I am very sensitive to medication, especially anti-psychotics, and can only tolerate small amounts; but I need them to level out my mood swings and break escalating episodes. Abilify did not work for me. The side effects have NOT gone away in the 6 months since I have stopped taking it. As an artist it's a real problem to be unable to draw a line that isn't wibbly.	F	47	30  days	10/31/2008
5	pediatric bipolar	tired at night, and sometimes upset stomach.  That's it!	Cost is huge, even with insurance. It is SO worth it b/c it has made 90% of our daughters symptoms go away. She is able to function normally; she has lots of friends, plays sports and aside from  a little irritability at night; she is a typical 9 year old.	F	9	2  months	10/29/2008
2	bipolar depression	inner restless, urge to move, couldn't sit still even to read	I think this med could have helped had I not been so restless.  It also made me want to eat and smoke ALL the time to quell the restlessness.	F	35	5  days	10/27/2008Email
4	psychosis/ocd	inner restlessness, tremors	This medicine did wonders for my voices and delusions but the side effects (tremors, inner restlessness) were too much to handle and I stopped taking this med and now I'm taking seroquel.	M	19	2  months	10/21/2008
3	Bi-polar and anxiety	Tiredness, food cravings, WEIGHT GAIN whenever the dose is increased.	I started on 5mg now I am on 30mg due to this medication not having an positive effect on my bi-polar and anxiety levels.	F	16	4  years	10/21/2008

1	Bipolar II/ Mood disorder	Extreme Akathisia! it was horrible! jittery all the time, I couldnt sit still, I had to move constantly, shaking all over and I couldnt sleep at all. It is the worst thing I have ever experienced! Plus I gained 5lbs in 1 week! Crying all the time, I bawled like a baby watching the Price is Right yesterday, bc a man won a car! Crazy!! This stuff is awful!	Its been 2 days since I quit taking it, and I am still shaky and unable to sleep. Yesterday I had to take 2 valiums, 1 and a half restoril, and 100mg of benadyl(recommend by my doc.) to try to calm me down and I was still in high gear. And after all those meds. to calm me down I was still hypomanic/ very hyper. I felt like I could have ran a marathon! I would def. not recommed trying Abilify, unless you want to feel like your going crazy....	F	22	6  days	10/18/2008Email
5	Bipolar disorder	Heightened libido, and that's all. I'm on 5mg qd.	Abilify has a half life of 3 days and so tends to build up in the system, and so pdocs inadvertently rx it at too high a dose. At too high a dose, it causes agitation, extreme restlessness, anxiety, etc. This has led to a lot of people begging off of it w/o giving it a fair trail. This is the best bipolar med I've ever been on, and I've been at this now for 6 years. It's looking more and more like I'm cured. I take 5mg coupled w/ 3mg of Invega and 100mg of Desipramine. I am happy, productive and participate fully in life.	M	70	3  months	10/16/2008Email
2	Bipolar	Great at first, little sleepy, had some headaches but got used to it. Was only taking 2mg, moved up to 5mg and came down with a rash all over my arms and legs. Friends said my face looked puffy. Stopped taking it, rash went away within a week, started it up on 2mg again and my eye's swelled shut. I also retained water on this med, gained 7 pounds over a month	Loved how this drug made me feel at 2mg but the rash and puffiness just wasn't worth the trouble	F	30	30  days	10/15/2008Email
3	depression	No side effects for the first 10 weeks. Around the 10th week I experienced two side effects that appeared almost simultaneously. The first side effect involved swelling of my parotid gland. This is a salivary gland that is located just in front of your ear and near the upper jaw. The day after I noticed this side effect, I began to experience acne-like clusters on my forehead and scalp. I'm usually pimple free, so the abilify seemed to be the likely cause.	Due to the side effects mentioned, I discontinued use. This was disappointing because the medication did seem to lessen my depression and it helped me increase energy and concentration.	F	47	10  weeks	10/14/2008
2	Compulsive Skin Picking	Severe facial acne, clumsiness, muscle weakness, severe fatigue	Due to this medication for the first time in 10 years I was able to stop my skin picking.  Then two months into the regime severe acne broke out on my face.  7 months later and I'm still dealing with it.  The side affects aside I did have some unexpected results that I really liked.  Although I wasn't taking the medication for my ADHD I found while on the medication I was extremely punctual and capable of tearing myself away from something I was focusing intensly on.  I've been off the medication for several months now and have gone back to being chronically late and having periods of hyperfocus where I can't do anything else but the task in front of me.  I wouldn't take it again, but some of the results were very impressive.	F	24	3  months	10/11/2008
3	Bipolar Type I	Loss of appetite, weight loss, dizziness, tiredness, difficulty with some motor and cognitive skills.	I do love this drug because I've lost a ton of weight really quickly.  I don't know if it will stay this way, but I can only eat small portions, if I can eat at all.  Mind you, I'm not taking this medication in conjunction with anything else that would make me gain weight.  I realize I've had some bizarre side effects, but the loss of motor control and dizziness have started to go away.	F	25	45  days	10/7/2008
2	bipolar/schitzophrenia	restless, no appetite or sex drive, unable to focus or concentrate on anything, diarrhea.	Hate it and when I called doc about side effects she INCREASED dosage. Hope it wears off soon. My son says I look "zoned out." If this is supposed to help my manic episodes, I'd rather be manic. Up to 20 mg in 4 weeks. Ugh.	F	45	4  weeks	10/4/2008
2	Bipolar 1	My 72 year old mother was diagnosed with Bipolar 1...taking Abilify she is losing her ability to walk and sleep..she is currently on 5 mg...I want to ween her off..I don't like how combative she has become...		F	72	5  weeks	9/30/2008Email
5	bipolar	None that I am aware of.	This drug (and I am only on 5mg now) gave me my life.  I was completely unstable, foggy, rocking, in the black, sleeping depressive fragile anxious way, and then this drug came along and made everything all right.  With therapy, I have resumed a normal life, work full time, and am basically doing well.  Taking Abilify was the turning point.	F	33	6  years	9/27/2008
3	Bipolar I	Loss of appetite (the very thought of most foods made me sick), sleepy, kind of depressed, a little weepy.	I don't think I've been on it long enough.  I'm only on 5 mg, but I'm also on Klonopin and Lamictal, so it may be a mixture of the three that's causing this.  I was really surprised with the loss of appetite.  Normally, I get up in the morning and can't wait to eat breakfast.  Lately, I wake up and just want coffee before I realize that I'm bored and have nothing I want to do at all.	F	24	14  days	9/24/2008
3	Bipolar	extremem restlessness, nervousness, I couldn't sleep, would toss and turn. WHen I did sleep I woke up hour on the hour. I felt  blah about everything. Increased appetite.I gained 10 pounds in one money. Trembling and shaking hands.	I started out on 5mg and upped to 10 mg. in two weeks. I started feeling better but then the side effects became too much. I literally couldn't stay still, no position was comfortable whether it be standing, sitting or laying down. Even after taking an Ambien I still couldn't sleep. I finally did after taking a clonazepam and Ambien together.	F	30	5  weeks	9/24/2008
5	Schizophrenia, poor cognition	Really bad anxiety, homicidal thoughts. Some tics.	Really excellent medication, main reason I had to switch from Risperidone was my thinking was really messed up. But having switched to this my thinking is clear as, no problems on the schizophrenic side either.Fantastic medication.	M		6  months	9/13/2008
1	OCD	Extreme restlessness. I couldn't rest or sit still. My arms and legs were shaking constantly, my feet and toes kept shaking, it was terrifying and painful. I had to be out of school for a week because I was unable to sit still, I kept moving and my feet and arms and legs felt like they had to keep moving. I was so scared, I thought the pain wouldn't ever end. It took weeks after getting off it before the restlessness stopped. It was scary.	The most frightening pill ever. I could not stop moving or sit still or lay down or rest. Abilify made my arms and legs feel like they had to constantly be moving and it felt so uncomfortable sitting still or laying down, I felt constantly restless. It was extremely terrifying and I was young and hadn't known the side effects the pill would give me. I was so scared the restlessness and pain was going to last forever. I could not lay down or sit still, I had to be moving every second and I couldn't rest. It was awful. Scary stuff.			 	9/13/2008
3	Bi-Polar	Akathisia.  The worse feeling I have ever felt.  Just the definition alone will make you understand, but if not it felt as there were people inside of me, trying to push out of me.  All around my entire inside, all pushing with the same resistance at the same time.  I would of rather taken a bullet to the head than deal with that feeling ever again.	It was difficult to tell whether it helped with my mood since I cycle so frequently.  I was in a good mood while I was taking it.  The side effects didn't start till I was upped from 5/mg to 10.  After that I was on 10 for approx 3 days when it started.  Quit taking it and the side effects went away immediately.	M	30	3  weeks	9/4/2008
3	Stuttering	I have been taking Abilify 5mg for 4 weeks now and I am feeling fatigue and disconnected from life all day. Very little emotions and no sex drive. Sleeping ok but still just tired all day.	I was prescribed the dung as an experiment to treat stuttering or speech disorder I have. I have had a reduction is my stuttering but I am not sure if it worth the side effects. The feeling tired all the time is the hardest side effect for me. I might be put on Geodon instead.	M	27	4  weeks	9/3/2008Email
2	paranoia, depression, anxiety	went on 10mg after risperidone, made me gain weight and my prolactin rose to drastic levels. have been on for 3 months and feel horrible, paranoia worse, didnt have it on respiridone, twitchy, edgy, sleeping all the time, feel ill, vomiting, stomach problems, strange light headed feeling	am fed up with it and disappointed, initially switched as it is the only drug over here without supposed weight gain(u.k)am seeing doctor tomorrow with view of stopping.	F	26	4  months	8/31/2008Email
2	BI-POLAR/COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR	weight gain (size 10 to a 14 in 1-2 months) Constant hunger, Night sweats, emotionally detached, sadness, depression (over weight gain) No "zest for life"	I have quit "over-spending" & other compulsive behavior but never leave the house: (	F	30	2  months	8/31/2008
5	Bipolar	Extreme restlessness but take cogentin, now no problems.	I take 20mg and experienced extreme restlessness, however, my pdoc prescribed cogentin and I've not had any problems with restlessness since.  Abilify really helps my bipolar mania/depression.	F	46	6  months	8/25/2008
4	Depression	Interrupted sleep, weight gain at higher doses (which isn't coming off by lowering the dose), more energy, decreased sexual desire and ability	This drug has been great for me. I'm only on 5 mg to augment Effexor 225mg, but it gives me more energy and really helps elevate my mood. It's been a lifesaver. I had some weight gain and irritability at 7 and 10 mg, but none at 5. I just wish the weight would come off just by going down in dosage, but it's not. My only big complaint is the cost. Even with my (not so great) insurance its very very expensive, but I'm working with my Dr. to make it more affordable	F	22	4  months	8/22/2008
4	bi-polar	Nothing serious. A little light headed and "floaty" maybe, slightly nauseous. (after 2 weeks of 5mg dose)	Definitely agitated, not hyper, but a noticeable "high" feeling.	M	34	14  days	8/18/2008
1	Bipolar	I took ONE 2mg tablet- Pdoc assured me that I would have no side effects on such a miniscule dosage.NOT- I was so nauseous I had to seek anti-nausea meds from my primary doctor. My head pounded for 12 hours and tylenol nor advil would stop the pain.	Mood wise- I could feel a difference. I was very Calm. However the nausea and headache were enough to not ever take this again.	F	38	1  days	8/17/2008
2	Bipolar,ptsd,bordline psnality d/o	So dizzy! Feel like passing out whether sitting, standing, or walking. Also hearing things now and vision not right either. Yuck. However, i'm not crying anymore. Hmmm...	Also on Topamax, Wellbutrin, Lamictal(450mg), Ativan as PRN, and just tapered off Effexor 37.5 when I started the Abilify. Don't know what s/effect is from what anymore!! Hungry, tired, sore, anxious, poor judgement. Used to be on 10mg Abilify and couldn't sit still or concentrate on anything. Drank and smoked way too much! Once off of it, all negative behaviors stopped. 2 years later we decided to try a smaller dose (2mg) and things are different, but not good.	F	37	10  days	8/10/2008Email
5	Depression	Day 1 - Very sleepy, felt drugged. No serious side effects since the first day. A little bit of night-time waking, but not really insomnia. Sometimes I struggle a little bit in conversation. It seems that I occasionally take a little longer to find the right word when speaking.	My doctor suggested that we augment my Wellbutrin with a low dose of Abilify (2mg). After the first day I felt less sleepy & each day began to feel like a had more energy and desire to get up and do things. I'm taking the abilify in the morning now and not feeling drugged at all. Day 6 - 14, I've continued to feel less depressed and my energy seems to be returning.I've been on Wellbutrin 300mg for over 12 months with some stabilization of my mood, but my depression never really went away with just the Wellbutrin. The Abilify seems to be doing the trick.	F	47	14  days	8/8/2008
1	bipolar NOS	severe akathisia - extreme restlessness to the point of interfering with my life and sleep - this only on 10-15 mg. Went off the 10 mg cold turkey.  Will not take again.	It's hard to tell if it stabilized my mood or not.  I was told I have rapid cycling mixed episodes.  I won't take it anymore though because the akathisia (look it up on wikipedia) was like TORTURE.	F	34	20  days	8/8/2008
4	Depression AND Anxiety disorder	No Side effercts	Found it brilliant was on another type before this and it made me put up 3 stone. No side effects experienced from this and im in great humour.	F	24	1  years	8/7/2008
2	bipolar disorder? / schizophrenia?	EXHAUSTION - extreme hunger- dry patches on skin- unexplained bruising- thinning hair	I have been on this med for over 4 years, and have hated every minute of it. I can't move when i finally wake up after sleeping 12+ hours a night and have gained over 50 lbs.	F	21	4  years	8/7/2008Email
3	depression, ocd, panic disorder	Feel "blah", disconnected. Unable able to get restful sleep, like i am aware of everything around me.  I toss and turn all night long.  Slight dizziness, extreme hunger and thirst.	Within an hour of taking the first pill i felt like someone had shut of a switch in my brain and my thoughts just stopped racing, which was great!!  I am just so tired, I have always had vivid dreams and have had no trouble falling asleep, anywhere.  I'm not sure i like the way i feel. Maybe i'm just used to being on high alert all the time, but i feel so "just here".  My husband keeps telling me this will pass.  I had been on 40mg of prozac for 11yrs and was taken of cold turkey 2 weeks ago, that went very bad.  So now i am on 20 prozac and the abilify.  Just don't know if i can hang in there!!!

1	Dad (82)was taking it for dementia	This drug killed him! He threw up all night and next day,was unable to swallow,his dementia got much worse, and over a month long period he lost 40 pounds! The stupid doctor said he was psychotic but we found out later dementia can have a paranoid component. Dad was never bipolar! He went downhill and quit eating, etc., and finally died--night and day difference for the worse after the pill. We found out later this drug should not be used for people with dementia. Parade magazine has been ads sayi\ng don't use in the elderly and esp. those with dementia! Don't take this if you're older or have dementia.		M	82	1  days	7/21/2008Email
1	BiPolar - Mixed	Debilitating -- Exhaustion -- Fatigue -- NOT able to get out of bed.	This is the WORST drug I've ever been on -- and I've been on a lot.	F	58	1  weeks	7/21/2008
1	Depression	Just after thirty minutes of taking the drug (I took it in the morning), I literally fainted on my living room floor, and slept for six hours before waking up again. It made me feel like a zombie, dizzy, and it certainly didn't help me at all. The next day I took it, I saw spots all over, and I felt as if I was going blind. It scared me so much.	Never will I take this drug again.	F	15	2  days	7/18/2008
2	Depression	Restlessness, leg aches, foot pain, inability to "get comfortable," unable to concentrate on one task long enough to finish it, always hungry, skin breakouts, confusion (driving has become scary), light bothers my eyes, and my vision is blurry -- like there's a layer of gel on my eyes that I can't get off.  I keep moving things closer and closer to me so that I can see them.	I took 2 mg for two weeks and 5 mg for 1 week. I'm also taking Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, and Topamax -- all because I'm so depressed that I see no point in any aspect of living. Add in the Abilify side effects, especially the muscle pain, confusion, and vision problems, and I'd rather not live than continue taking that drug. Think I'll inquire w/ my doctor about Cytomel or Ritalin to augment the antidepressants.	F	37	3  weeks	7/15/2008

I COULDN'T FUNCTION AT ALL	F	36	3  months	7/8/2008
5	Bipolar II	Acne, occasional fatigue and leg cramps in the first couple of weeks, has since gone away - still have occasional pimples.	Love this medicine. It's the only Bipolar med that has helped me along with Topamax. I have tried almost every med out there and everything had so many side effects or just made me loopy or made me pass out all day. This combo has kept me stable with little to no side effects. I'm so thankful for Abilify.	F	29	1  years	7/6/2008Email
1	Yes	Tardive dyskinesis, weight gain, terrible mental health ( mental fog, slow thinking, poor coordination, excessive sleep)  not able to function to my full potential...just a walking zombie....like being in a vegetative state.	Presribed by doctor and forced to take by the doctor for her diagnosis for schizophrenia....the new doctor i saw after her expressed concerns about the previous docs diagnosis....for i never exhibited any of the symptoms except for depression...	F	26	3  years	6/28/2008
2	major depression and gen. anxiety	the first night i had a bit of nausea and kept waking up in the middle of the night, and then second night i also had nausea and i ended up passing out in the hallway.  it felt like there wasn't enough blood in my head, and then i collapsed and hit my head, and a few minutes later i threw up.	i can't say anything about its psychological benefits because i only took 2 small doses (2.5mg), and i stopped taking it due to the bad side effects.  mostly i'm terrified of taking new meds now, as i already had an intense fear of getting sick and was weary of side effects from anything.	F	17	2  days	6/21/2008
5	schizoaffective or biploar	none	This drug made many improvements in my day to day life.  I was constantly suicidal, hearing voices, and overall extremly depressed, etc... prior to starting this medication.  Now if I can find someone willing to hire a schizo, I'd be all set.	M	36	2  years	6/16/2008Email
4	depression	significant weight gain; impotence	abilify was especially helpful with motivation.  overall, depression was greatly reduced.  gradual weight gain and sexual dysfunction made me stop taking it, however.	M	47	1  years	6/13/2008
5	bipolar mania and psychosis	Emotionally disconnected taking 25 mgs. a day.		M	31	2  years	6/12/2008Email
2	Bipolar - rapid cycling	jittery and sleepy all of the time.  Extremely irritable	I began taking this drug to help with my rapid cyclng.  Abilify only made my life more difficult due to the unability to sit still for more than 15 seconds.	F	35	3  years	6/6/2008
3	bipolar	Initially I was VERY restless and had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Eventually that wore off. Weight gain.	I'm on the fence as to I feel about it. The weight gain bothers me the most. It served its purpose at the time it was needed but now we are going to discontinue it.	F	37	1  years	5/27/2008Email
2	Depression	My Dr. added this Rx to my Effexor (150mg) and Wellbutrin (300mg) because I was still having problems with my depression.  I'm gaining weight (which I definitely don't need since I already have a weight problem), my knees are killing me, I feel very fatigued, I'm not sleeping all that great, and I can't seem to feel "good" anymore--not even for a day. I'm going to ask to be taken off of this drug.  I have never done this before and I've dealt with depression off and on for the past 10 years.  The side effects are just not worth it to me.		F	48	3  weeks	5/27/2008
2	PTSD - Anger Management Issues	Extreme Restlessness, Unable to concentrate/focus (this is a big problem for me as a go to school), Night Sweats, Weight Gain, Blurred Vision.	Abilify is supposedly the better substitute to Geodon according to my Doctor. However, I never felt anything different other than than my nausea went away. I always have this feeling of restlessness and the need to move every minute. It has also become difficult for me to study for school because I cannot focus my attention to my readings! My dreams have also become vivid and I wake up all sweaty. Since I started taking Abilify, I couldn't stop eating! I already gained 10lbs in the last 3 days. Definitely not worth it!

1	bipolar/ ocd	ticks, shaking, extreme anger, sleepy, extreme moods,	when your up your really up and hyper which lasts an hour then extreme exhaustion...extreme anger,,i was on for 2 weeks and made my doc put me on something else	F	25	14  days	4/29/2008
3	depression-CFS	constipation, I've gained 20 pounds.. but I took a vacation and I have been able to gain wieght easily in the past.	It seems to really numb me out. I take 15mg abilify-120mg cymbalta-90mg adderall + slepping pills. I think the abilify take the highs and lows out of the adderall. Bummer on the highs but good on the lows. I would rate it higher if I had more exerience with this drug	M	37	30  days	4/19/2008
5	PTSD; depression; rapid cycling	Some blurred vision; muscle stiffness and fatigue	I am extremely medication resistant and after trying virtually ever psych drug on the market with no success, Abilify has been a life saver.  It works for me on a low dose (4mg) and has improved and stabilized my moods and quality of sleep. A great drug if it works for you.  Try lowering dosage or starting on a really low dose if side effects are too much.	M	45	4  weeks	4/16/2008
3	OCD	extreme restlessness	this medciation is REALLY helping my ocd, but the restlessness is almost unbearable, especially since i have a desk job. i'm going to talk to my psych about maybe taking something to combat the side effect.	M	24	1  months	4/12/2008
4	Bipolar: depression, phycosis	night sweats, weight gain, bloating, restlessness, insomnia, hypo manic and a little grouchy	i have been on 10mg for about three weeks. at five mg the first week i felt great. i had been having psychotic thoughts and depression. now i am hypo manic which is much better than being depressed. i can't sleep well or sit still but i get my housework done. I have started having night sweats and insomnia on week 3. the psychotic thoughts have not totally been taken care of but i do not want to increase my dosage yet. it's hard to be around other people when i have these thoughts.

1	bipolar/depression	extreme restlessness, unable to concentrate, nausea, headache.	I was on 10mg and the only thing it helped was that I stopped getting mad... but the sideeffects were definetly not worth it!	F	22	10  days	4/4/2008Email
4	Bipolar, antisocial disorder	Not able to eat much, bowel movements inconsistant, weird taste in mouth	Mu Daughter has been taking this med. in the morning, along with Pamilor at night(I assume to counter effect some of the nasties that can go along with Abilify) So far, her mood and behavor are MUCH better, relationships with friends and family are more stable. She is on 5mg right now with an expected increase next week to 7.5mg. I think that will do it. She seems to be aware of other human beings now and the distruction of the house (mostly unintentional) has improved soooo much.	F	13	1  weeks	4/3/2008Email
2	Anxiety, Depression, Bulimia	Extreme hunger!!!! Restlessness, tremors, insomnia.	Obviously I hated being hungry all the time. Not the right medicine for me.	F	18	4  days	4/3/2008
3	Childhood Onset Bipolar Disorder	Parkinsonian symptoms including elbow flexion, mask face, dysfunctional posture, some stiffness in arms, initially somnolence, but this eventually passed	My 7 year old son was started on Abilify as soon as he was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder.  He improved remarkably after the first dose, and within 6-7 days his symptoms were improved by 80-90%.  However, he also immediately developed what is called in medical lingo akinesia, which is abnormal movement and posture, delayed spontanuity in gesture, and abnormal posture.  Most of these side effects made him look like a Parkinson's patient.  The pych was against giving a drug to counter these side-effects becuase he felt it was not a "clean solution."  Later however, we did put him on Congentin which immediately took care of these side effects.  In a nut shell, we tried various other drugs and none worked as well as Abilify so we are now going back to it hoping the side-effects don't re-emerge.  He has been on numerous anti-pychotics since, and the side-effects are slowly diminishing with each new one.	M	7	6  weeks	3/25/2008
3	bipolar II - Depression - anorxia	killer headache - pain in my jaw - nausea - dizziness	Can't really say yet if I like this medicine.  I've only been on it for four days - 5mg.  Seems as though a lot of people have gained weight. Hopefully that won't happen to me - right now I am nauseous so I don't want to eat; which is good sort of - I've had an eating disorder for many, many years.  Now I am worried about gaining weight.  If I do - I am off this drug. Thanks for the heads up - because my Doc prescribed this med as opposed to seroquel.  I am hoping that these side effects go away.	F	50	4  days	3/25/2008
1	SUPPOSED BI POLAR AND DEPRESSION	I cant fall asleep or stay asleep when the abilify was added to the effexor a week ago. Anxious and Xanax wont take the edge off	AS I sit here crying at 5 am becasue I once again am sleep deprived, have gained weight from it and keep getting told its okay I want to scream its not!!  I am goging to have my dr remove me from this drug.  Its as some have said not worht the side effects.  I lived through the nausa but the no sleep other than 3 hours a night is wearingme out.

5	Complex PTSD	thinking becomes dull, thick.  Dizziness, a little tardive dyskinesia.	Used this drug for a year or so, then was able to ween off of it. Now it works well when  I cannot slow my brain down in any other way.  Sometimes I only need it for 3 days, sometimes for a month. I can always ween off of it again and have months that I am ok.  Many times, it has kept me from having to go back to the hospital.  I am grateful to have it.	M	51	3  years	3/16/2008
5	BIPOLAR II - PTSD	mania, jaw clenching, consitpation, increased appetite for sweets, jittery, sleepy after taking, anxiety,	it has IMPROVED my mood 100%. Very LOW dose 2.5mg. Started at 10mg, then 5mg every other day, then 2.5 mgs. That works best. Perhaps these folks on higher doses need to lessen dose until it is manageable. I am on EFFEXOR+Abilify 2.5-was suicidal b4 for 2 years.  Now in less than a week I was up, productive, working, getting things done I hadn't in months. Will monitor for weight gain--I already gained weight on Effexor! No need for more weight.	F	46	14  days	3/11/2008

4	Bipolar w/psychotic features	always hungry; some weight gain (would be more if I ate when I was hungry); not sure how to describe this, but the blahs; physical restlessness	My doctor is thinking about switching me to geodon because of my constant hunger, but is concerned about the extrapyramidal effects with that medication; I'm not sure how well this works for depression either.

1	Bipolar	Fatigue, depression	I was taking 15mgs and could never stay awake. I would sleep for almost 12 hours and still fall asleep at work and in class. I had to drink 4-5 energy drinks a day just to make it and I STILL had difficulty staying awake.	F	22	1  months	2/23/2008

1	Bipolar II	So far, the side effects of this medication are some of the worst I've ever felt. I have had non-stop nausea, vomiting and a horrific headache since the medicine got into my system. I've only taken one dose and am reluctant to take another before first speaking to my doctor about my exteme side-effects.	Skin "crawling" and cannot get comfortable.	F	30	1  days	2/12/2008
5	bi polar	sleepy	you doctor may not tell you this but if you are over weight or insulin resistant this medicine may cause you to become diabetic I am insulin resistant and for that reason I had to wean myself off of this the benefits were not worth having a future of diabetes	F	28	9  months	2/11/2008
4	PTSD	Weight Gain	Helped with nightmares. Went to sleep within 1 hour of taking. Other than 20 lb. weight gain, this medicine was very effective.	F	25	3  months	2/3/2008

1	Was switched from Rispiradol.	Our 16 year old son had gained a tremendous amount of weight taking Rispiradol and the Dr. switched him to Abilify.  "Will do the same as Rispirasol for your son without the weight gain", the Doctor told us. Well, he STILL continued to gain weight (always hungry) (has gained 70 pounds in 9 months, and he was always small framed until beginning the Rispiradol). He became extremely restless and he would pace and not be able to sit still for more than 8 minutes at a time. His lying and disrespect intensified.  It was as if we no longer knew our son.Now, two weeks after stopping the Abilify, our old son is re-emerging.  It is a welcomed sight.	We will never allow him to be put on abilify again.	M	16	2  months	1/22/2008
2	Anxiety & Depression	Strange restlessness; especially in arms and legs. No chair felt right. First few weeks: couldn't sit still !! Increase in anxiety & depression. Slight increase in weight which subsided after 5 weeks.	Quicker orgasms!	F	40	6  weeks	1/17/2008Email
3	depression	20lb. weight gain,sleep disrupted, fatique.	New info about weight gain caused by increased appetite will be published soon. My therapist knows someone who works for the co. and he said my psychopharmacologist didn't have the info because it hasn't been published yet. I was waking up several hours earlier than normal and went back to my regular schedule as soon as I stopped.	F	50	4  months	1/11/2008
1	supposed bipolar	my son was 17 yrs old.He was on abilify for9 months with some progress with social issues.he gained 50 lbs.he went to bed at 10.30 and passed away in his sleep.this was the only med he was on.autopsy report could not determin a definate cause.we believe it had to be from the med.		M	17	9  months	1/9/2008Email
4	Bi-Polar, ADHD	My seven year old son has been on this med for two weeks. He complains about a little pain, I am thinking muscle pain, he has had a sore inside his cheek that we treated with clove oil and hydrogen peroxide (went away), he has been a little sad on this med, a little whiny, but considering all he has been through, it seems like he is finally able to feel emotions whereas before he seemed very out of touch with reality and non-emotional (his dad abandoned him and we are in the middle of divorce, and my son has hardly registered emotionally, which might have been a blessing in disguise all this time, and I think part of his whininess is just his ability to finally feel the things he had not been able to feel before).	Now the good stuff, we tried this med first (physician sample), then Risperdal (actual prescription). The Risperdal had no effect on him, he was still racing around like a lunatic, and after seeing him on this drug, we decided this drug was far better. He can focus at school, listens to the teacher, was able to be included in his school Christmas pageant, the violence against others (classmates, his dad, myself) has stopped, and he is able to sit still for long periods, complete class work and homework, no longer destroys the house like he did before, the school is considering allowing him to rejoin his classmates in social activities (recess and PE, which he was held out of for most of the school year because of fighting and violence), and this saved him from being suspended for the second time. My son likes the drug, wants to take it, and gets a lot of satisfaction from being able to complete tasks and follow directions. He was in so much trouble before, and meds were a last resort f	M	7	2  weeks	1/7/2008Email
3	depression,  adhd, anxiety	2mg every 2-4 days, per shrink.  I have noticed that I have been happier the first day after taking it, each time, but then I get more moody or anxious as the pill wears off so I take another one which is about 2-3 days later.  I sleep fine but not as hard anymore as I used to and I find myself more bored.  I am more friendly to people though - most of the time.	I am still on the fence on this drug.  I am not sure if it is because I am "thinking" it is working in a good way - or if it really is.  This is one drug I am still waiting to see miracles happen but, honestly, I doubt it'll ever happen.  I will continue to take the samples I received from the shrink and go from there.....	F	38	30  days	1/3/2008
2	BI POLAR I	Tired, less energy, lathargic, mouth is dry, jittery, cold sweats, etc.	If i take it in the day I feel tired all day, I take it at night around 8 eiother was around lunch I am so tired and sleep 3 hours and around 8-10 at night, when I take it at night I am almost on the verge of passing out and it gives me quite a rush and keeps me up. I was very energetic before, now I feel like not even moving. LOL if you can tell I had just tookin my meds or I would not even be typing this. Also I am ever so restless legs, getting comfortable etc.	M	34	4  weeks	12/26/2007Email
3		Massive increase in hunger and weight gain.  No other side effects	Abilify worked great to stop mood swings and sense of "What's the point?" and fearful thoughts.  The doctor said the medication would make me lose weight but it didn't so I decided to stop it	F		2  months	12/25/2007
1	Bilpolar	RESTLESS!! Doctor said technical term is "akastasia" pardon spelling. Wasnt even comfortable to drive. I have driven cross country etc. before this experience. Couldnt sit still, stand or ANYTHING for 5 mins. Thought I would crawl out of my skin. Was making me feel almost suicidal! TOOK TWO full weeks or more off my 15mg dose to feel "normal" again.	I was on this med for occasional manic episodes and rapid speech.....it made me feel completely whacked out. Have never felt so uncontrollably "odd" like that before. Was honestly a terrifying experience!	F	30	4  weeks	12/19/2007
3	Bipolar	Extreme nausea like I've never had, unusually tired, constipation, and restlessness	Helps keep my mind clear though...good for that, but the nausea makes me too sick to move much	F	30	24  days	12/15/2007
4	Bipolar/OCD	Grogginess in the morning	This drug has worked absolutely fantastic for me, I was so manic, my mind was always racing..."I have to buy this", "I have to do that"; And now I feel so peaceful.	F	23	6  months	12/14/2007
1	Bi Polar disorder	Even more depressed, irritated, can't concentrate, bladder problems, shaky legs and hands, swollen extremities, can't laugh (I love laughing- now seems like I have to retrain myself how to do it), painful joints/stiffness>(doesn't subside at all!), severely panicky, crying a lot, very sad, can't stop thinking about how horrible I feel mentally and physically. I'm even more paranoid/worried about what other's think about me than I was before taking Abilify. 	Not for me. I'm glad to see that it works for some people. I was open minded and looking for help and whatever medicine works/worked, would be willing to try for sure..but not this one!	F	46	2  days	12/14/2007
5	complex PTSD	Thinking is thick and slow	I take abilify when my brain starts to go out of control and won't stop.  It is step 4 in a 5 step management process.  (Step 5 is back to the hospital.)  I've tried most other atypical anti-psychotics and for me abilify is the gentlest and sturdiest way to get my brain to stop.  Usually stay on it for a month after an episode and then go off of it and am ok for a few months.	F	51	3  years	12/11/2007
3	bipolar and OCD	motor impairment, slight weight gain, EXTREME fatigue, EXTEREME thirst, akathisia (need to move; I can't sit still anymore), and I believe I am experiencing Tardive dyskinesia	This medication was okay at first, or at least better than risperdal (which overall made me gain well over 100 pounds, but abilify was not that drastic). It had greatly reduced my obsessive and intrusive thoughts but now it's just an annoyance. Most of my meds, including this one, have slowed down my entire body (thinking, reaction time, speech, etc.) which is the reason I have a learning disability. I'm SO tired! I do have sleep apnea but abilify just makes it worse. Tardive dyskinesia is a problem, too (involuntary movements such as: grimacing, tongue protrusion, rapid eye blinking, finger movements as if playing a guitar or piano, etc.) Tardive dyskinesia happens with antipsychotics like abilify and I do every single thing I listed there. It's also potentially irreversable. I'm just not the same as I once was.	M	20	2  years	12/11/2007
4	stress disorder	restlessness tremors BOREDOM pacing vivid/scary dreams	i had to cut my dosage in half (15 mg to 7.5 mg) and the side effects lessoned..... it works but side effects are annoying	F	14	1  months	12/8/2007
5	Schizoaffective- Bipolar Type	Was tired when I first started taking it but that subsided.  Now after being on it for 4 years I'm starting to have Extra Pyramidal Symptoms in my Eyes (unusual eye movements).  So I've had to lower my dose.	This drug saved my life.  I was literally at rock bottom when I found abilify four years ago and it brought me out of the deepest darkness imaginable.  It stopped my hallucinations, controlled my bipolar symptoms, and allowed me to get to the point of being able to go back to school.  I'm terrified that I'll have to stop taking it because of the EPS.	F	22	4  years	11/27/2007
3	Bipolar/Hypomania	Hypomania, insomnia, blurred vision, nervousness, paraniod thoughts after 3 weeks of usage, unable to relax, confusion (could have been from lack of sleep).	The first week was great, very motivated on 10 MG.  Week 2 began feeling confused, blurred vision, light sensitivity, nerviousness, yet still unable to stop moving.  Third week 15mg, had to start taking Temazepam to get to sleep, still only 2-3 hrs of sleep a night.  Still unable to stop moving.  Finally called doc and weaned off in 3 days.  Wonderful motivator, but unable to focus and sleep.  The sleep deprivation and vision issues made this drug debilitating.  Seemed to make my hypomania worse.  Weaning off had delusional thoughts for a day or so.  Defintely do not cold turkey off this med.	F	34	3  weeks	11/27/2007Email
2	bipolar	great med but it made me to restless	great med but it made me to restless	M	39	40  days	11/18/2007
4	bipolar	restlessness	other than the restlessness its a great med	M	39	35  days	11/13/2007
3	SCHIZO apparantly	wait gain, not thinking as much, tired, lazy, eyes twitching.	I have taken this medicine for sometime now and this medicine has made me lazy and tired all the time, making me put on weight.	M	33	2  years	11/12/2007
4	Major depression	Vivid dreams, waking up in the middle of the night, blurred vision (but I'm on a cocktail of meds so I don't know if this is all due to the Abilify or the others)	I've had chronic depression my entire life.  I was recently (last month) suicidal, and a few days after my psychiatrist prescribed 2.5mg a day, I was out of the suicidal haze and began to feel better.  After adding Lamictal (in addition to the Lexapro I was already on), I feel a LOT better.	F	21	1.5  months	11/8/2007
