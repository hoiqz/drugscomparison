1	to lower my cholesterol	I took 500mg for 3 years, then after my PCP doubled the dose, I began to experience severe neuropathy and myopathy in my hands, arms and legs.	Although the drug lowered my cholesterol, it attacked my nerves and muscles and made a cripple out of me.	M	51	3  years	7/19/2007Email
3	High Cholesterol	Heavy flushing, especially of my face. Aspirin helps some. I have a headache in the morning. No real improvement in my numbers over Lipitor. Caused my blood sugar to go up. My wife says it makes me grumpy. Maybe she is just agitating me more.	My numbers actually were worse with Advicor than with Lipitor. I do not think I like this drug given the poor results and the way it makes me feel. I also have Type 2 Diabetes which seems to complicate the issue. Advicor raised my blood sugar average by about 15%. I am going to ask my doctor to change me to something else.	M	57	6  months	5/28/2007
