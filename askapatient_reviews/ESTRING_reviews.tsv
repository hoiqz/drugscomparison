1	Irritating  Vaginal Discharge	Weight Gain, Hair Loss and NIGHTMARES	I don't know why my doctor prescribed it. I was the REVERSE of being dry--copius, irritating discharge. I had been post menopausal for 8 years, then all of sudden--this discharge.So, I tried the ring and IT DID NOTHING FOR THE DISCHARGE, but I experienced severe Hair Loss, Weight Gain and NIGHTMARES. I am discontinuing its use.	F	56	3  months 1X D	3/24/2013Email
1	Yes	Estrogen absorbed into my bloodstream causing high billi rubin count. The reading indicates the medicine is being filtered through the liver. Because this side effect didn't show up in studies, my endocronologist thought it was due to my thyroid medicine and prescribed thyroid removal. After careful evaluation of my blood work a second doctor relised estring was the culprit. Blood work showed my estrogen levels were sky high as were billi rubins. I reported side effect to manufacturer and stopped estring. Billi rubins back to normal. Had my blood not been monitored for Graves estring could have caused serious problems down the road. Aside from potential liver damage I had no other side effects. I wish they made a lower dose ring my body cold tolerate. I loved the ease of the estring.		F	50	6  months 1X O	2/10/2013
3	Vaginal dryness, thinning walls	No side effects from Estring that I'm aware of.	The walls of my vagina are stronger now, and I am less dry, so sex is less painful. My libido is very low, however, it has not helped with that at all. This medicine is expensive, and now my drug insurance wants me to switch to something else or pay a higher percentage of the price myself. The cream was too much trouble so I didn't use it; the ring is the way to go. I don't find it difficult to insert or remove; just lay down on the bed, reach in and grab it with my middle finger and pull it out.	F	58	2  years2MG 1X O	1/29/2013
4	vaginal atrophy, painful sex/pap	I still have hot flashes that come up over me suddenly, and of course happen at the worst times.  While I am relieved of the dry tenderness of my vulva and vaginal walls, I seem to have lost my libido, which is seriously troubling!	I wasn't able to have a pap smear easily for the last few years before using this insert.  I hadn't been in a relationship and/or having sex before, so that wasn't an issue, but then I met someone.  When we got close enough for me to share intimate details and then have sex, I was relieved to not have any issues with pain or tearing.  I am concerned about not feeling sexual and/or having an orgasm, which was previously not something that bothered me, but maybe that will level out in time with usage and with the relationship.  The cost of using this is outrageous too!	F	55	6  months1 1X AN	12/23/2012Email
5	vaginal dryness, UTIs	Slight itching and burning only for first few  days.	Estring has been a good solution for me.  Symptoms have cleared; I am now well-lubricated and have not had even a hint of a UTI since I inserted the first ring.  I previously used Estrace cream, but I hated the inconvenience and it didn't seem to help the symptoms as much as Estring does.  I have zero problems inserting or removing Estring.  My fiance says he "might be able to feel it during intercourse" but it doesn't bother him.  I can't feel it at all, any time.  I don't even know it is there; I had to put it on my calendar or I would never remember to change it every three months.  As a bonus, it seems to have helped my hot flashes and night sweats somewhat.	F	58	4  months7.5 mcg 1X D	10/6/2012
4	Dryness and discomfort during inter	Discomfort for 1st few days, pressure and bloating.  Fine after that and has helped.	Removal was difficult.  I thought I was going to have to go into the dr. To have it removed.  The trick is to prop leg up, lubricate finger, push or contract at the same time you insert your finger to get the ring to move down.  Got it the first time using this technique...	F	42	3  months 1X D	9/16/2012
4	Vaginal dryness, tearing, burning,	ODOR!!!......I have never experienced odor like this, it is constant and awful!   My husband notices it too.   Hair loss, weight gain, bloating.     I feel like I am in my 20's again with great lubrication......not sure I can continue with these side effects though.   It took pain away, much better lubrication, that Estrace cream couldn't give me.   I still apply a little Estrace externally to vulva, t/o the week.    Stuck on what to do..........		F	39	6  months	7/31/2012Email
2	vaginal dryness	Weight gain.  I weighed 124 lbs and two months later 127 lbs.  All my pants are tight and my stomach is bloated.  I pulled it out only with the help of my husband and it hurt!  It is not worth the weight gain for me.		F	56	2  months2mg 1X D	7/26/2012Email
3	Vaginal dryness, pain during sex	No physical side effects; depression	It really did the trick in terms of creating vaginal lubrication and elasticity. It went in easily, I couldn't feel it, all was good. I have taken an anti-depressant for about 3 years, and after about 2 weeks of using Estring, I had all the old, miserable depression symptoms again.  I can't find any reference to Estring counteracting anti-depressant medication- anyone know anything about that?  I removed the ring and the symptoms went away.  I'm disappointed I have to choose between painless sex or sanity, but I'm going with sanity!	F	61	5  weeks2 mg 1X D	7/12/2012
2	Vaginal dryness and incontinence	Seemed to help dryness at first but then my reasons for using it seemed to worsen. Discontinued use about 2 weeks ago.  Incontinence improved but still having HOT FLASHES like I have never experienced. Has anyone else had them after using the ring?		F	65	2  months	7/1/2012Email
5	Vaginal dryness,atrophy,	It was hard to insert the first time. Very uncomfortable for several weeks.	I Love the estring! At first i just thought it wasnt going to work for me because it was uncomfortable and I always felt it. After about a month of wearing it constantly; I got used to it. All my symptoms have disappeared! No more dryness, even my bladder symptoms hace dissapeared! I have even started squirting when I have sex!! That never happened before! I love this ring, It has made such a difference for me!!!	F	43	7  months2mg 1X D	5/6/2012Email
4	Vaginal Atrophy	Discomfort, abdominal cramps, Vaginal Swelling	I am 54 and have used Estrace Cream for last 4 years.  Was tired of having to insert an applicator full every other night and wearing a panty liner the next day.  Also the cream didn't provide a uniform result and I always still burned after intercourse.  My Dr. suggested I try the Estring for 3 months and see what I thought.  Have been using Estring for 8 weeks  & just love the results I'm getting.  My Vagina feels normal again and doesn't hurt during intercourse or burn afterwards.  However, there are down sides to this drug.  My husband can feel it and it is not comfortable for me either- so now I take it out before sex. Another thing is It never feels like it is inserted properly even though I insert it into the vagina as far as I can,  by the end of each week I am swollen inside and uncomfortable with it riding so low in the vagina and my side aches (I do push it back up throughout the week) So, for the last two weeks I have been removing the ring on Friday night and reinserting it back on Sunday night before I go to bed. This gives me a break over the weekend.  By Monday Morning I'm back to normal & I usually don't feel the the discomfort from the ring again until about thursday afternoon. This seems to be the only way I can use this drug. I will finish out my 3 months, then take a month or so using the cream again, then back to the ring for another 3 months.  I would recommend Estring. The results are awesome just the discomfort that's not.	F	54	8  weeks 1X O	4/21/2012
5	dryness, painful intercourse	NO side effects.The dryness was resolved after 2 weeks.Intercourse became enjoyable once again.AND, I no longer get up during the nite to urinate.	This is wonderful.I inserted it expecting to experience NO unpleasant side effects and that's what I got...NO UNPLEASANT SIDE EFFECTS.It has been the answer to a once again happy sex life as a sixty six yr. old.	F	66	3  months2 mg 1X O	3/31/2012Email
3	vaginal dryness	I am a whimp.. Thank you all for writitng your comments, this has really helped.. I feel foggy, have leg pains..hmm wondering if it was this.. and now all my jeans are tight.. We havent even had sex yet,but I am giving it up. And getting it out! I laughed with the woman who had her husband do it,I was almost there getting very frustrated.This sounds like it gave many women their sex life back.. I wish it did the same for libido!   I have really stopped for the side effects, and we just dont seem to be taking advantage of it, so I just dont want to continue.		F	55	4  weeks30mg 1X D	3/21/2012
1	extreme vaginal dryness	weight gain that may be due to Estring or to new antidepressant, loose bowels, itching, discomfort	This ring has done nothing for me -- vaginal dryness is no better. The ring makes it difficult to have a bowel movement because any straining brings the ring down into a very uncomfortable place. When the ring moves downward, it causes extreme itching.  I am seeing the gynecologist to see what other options there are.	F	57	7  weeks30 mg 1X D	3/19/2012
5	Vaginal dryness, painful sex.	I'm suspecting it's causing anxious emotional states-crying and tension towards the end of the 90 days.	Due to my suspicions of anxious emotional states towards the end of the 90 days, I will shorten the use of the second ring to see if I feel better. The dryness and painful sex have disappeared. The comments regards removal of the ring could not be more true!! have just spent approx. 30 mins trying to remove it for a fresh one but have given up! Think I'll make an appointment for a nurse @ the surgery tomorrow!!	F	60	90  days2mg 1X O	3/12/2012Email
5	Vaginal Dryness and Urinary Urgency	None	At first I was reluctant that this ring could help my severe symptoms, but within a week the vaginal dryness and urinary urgency were gone. It gave me my life back! Be patient with it the first two days as it takes a couple of days for the body to become used to the feeling and then I didn't notice it was there. I personally like to remove it once every week just to rinse the ring off with lukewarm water and reinsert directly after and I remove while having sexual intercourse as it tends to get in the way and then I reinsert afterwards. I will use this indefinitely as long as it is working for me. I recently placed a new second ring as the first lasted me only about 80 days before I began noticing vaginal dryness and urinary urgency that brought me to the ring. FYI, stress will make the body use Estrogen at a more rapid rate.	F	42	90  days2mg 1X D	3/9/2012Email
4	dryness and hot flashes	After 2 years post menapausal(50yrs old) I started the estring. I have used it for 5 months and my period just returned. My doctor never got back to me so I dont know if I should worry about it or stop using it		F	50	5  days2mg 1X D	3/4/2012Email
4	vaginal atrophy	prior to estrogen replacement I experienced severe vaginal atrophy and painful sexual intercourse. I tried transvaginal cream but found it messy and inconvient. I hated it and wouldn't use it as frequently as I should bringing my issues back	The first day I put the estring in it was VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. I thought for sure it was not inserted correctly. I did multiple internet searches to see other peoples experiences and that is why I am writing this.  I am a 41 year old post surgical menopausal woman since the age of 28.  The first day I used the estring it felt like it was going to come out and it almost felt like I was on the verge of bad cramps. I was just so uncomfortable and didn't think I could use the device. I took it out and inserted it again several times thinking it wasn't high enough.  By day 2 I could feel it but it wasn't uncomfortalbe anymore.  By day 3 my body had totally adjusted and I can't even tell it is there.  So I just wanted to let other women know that it does get better-just give it a few days.  I have not tried to have sex with it yet since it's not been long enough but I can't imagine I will be able to with the device in. Because of my hysterectomy I do not have a cervix and think my vaginal canal is probably shorter which along with the atrophy contributed to my first day of pain.	F	41	4  days2mg 1X O	2/12/2012Email
3	Vaginal atrophy, urine loss	First 3 months relief of atrophy and of frequent urge to urinate. Taking the ring out was difficult and slightly painful. Fourth month bloating, abdominal cramping, dark discharge and weight gain. Helped in the beginning, disappointed it didn't continue to work without the annoying side effects. Took it out after 4.5 months.		F	56	4  months	1/15/2012
5	vaginal atrophy	Suffered from painful intercourse, vaginal atrophy and hotflashes. All vanished with first use. After a year or so, I got a whopper yeast infection so I took the Estring out and threw it away...Dryness was back with a vengeance within a week or two and hotflashes were back. My refill wasn't due for 8 more weeks, so I suffered through rather than pay out of pocket. Sex was terribly painful and I worried it would remain that way. Not so--within a week of the new Estring lubrication was back and within two weeks all vaginal dryness and painful intercourse was gone within a couple of months, the hotflashes faded too. MD said I didn't need to take it out for the yeast infection--I'll take her advice if I get another one.	I've had some of the side effects/symptoms described: weight gain, cramping, sore breasts, joint pain, but don't attribute them to the Estring. While I was off, I didn't notice a big change, but wasn't looking for it either. So far no hair loss, but that would be a tough trade off if it happens.	F	51	1.5  years 1X O	12/1/2011Email
3	vaginal dryness	Hair loss after two months.	I loved the initial results. The vaginal dryness went away and sex was no longer painful, but the hair loss just started and coming out like crazy. I removed the ring and hoping hair will grow back. I am post menopausal so disappointed about this side effect.	F	67	2  months2 mg 1X O	8/23/2011Email
4	vaginal atrophy and painful intercourse	Occasional abdominal cramping	I went into menopause at age 43 - for the next 10 years was off/on hormone replacement tx.  I am 60 now and have been using Estring for about 3 years.  It is great, but sometimes it actually seems to fold in half after intercourse, and removal is very difficult.  However, the crochet hook did the trick - a VERY large one with rounded edges.  Periodically I take a brief holiday just to see how my body feels - it takes about two weeks for me to notice the symptoms that brought me to Estring to begin with.  Much better than creams, in my opinion; when I was using those I seemed to have frequent UTIs.	F	60	3  years1 1X D	8/16/2011
5	Bleeding during sex, dry vagina	possible weight gain, possible insomnia	I am 54 years old and for the past year had NO sex drive, mainly because of dryness, tearing, and bleeding during sex.  My gyno recommended the Estring and my life HAS BEEN CHANGED!  I am lubricated again, am able to have orgasms, and am totally ENJOYING sex for the first time in a long time.  My husband has no complaints, says he cannot even feel the ring, and it does not interfere with oral sex at all.  I am just concerned that after 5 months I am beginning to gain weight because of it.  I also wake up at about 4:30 almost every morning and cannot go back to sleep - this just started in the past month or so.  Nothing is different in my life except the Estring, so I am worried that the Estring is causing the side effects.  It has improved my sex & love life so much, though, that I can't even conceive of taking it out! :(	F	54	5  months 1X O	6/8/2011
5	vaginal atrophy, u. infections	I was an "early adapter" of the ring after pills had bad side effects. I was having recurrent urinary and yeast infections and vaginal atrophy. This was a life saver, restoring me to health. At age 66, the ring no longer provides all the estrogen I need, so I am using cream also. But for many years, this was sufficient.	I never had side effects. Tho I am a real ninny, I have found it easy to insert and remove, if I did not leave it in more than 3 mos. The middle finger makes a good soft hook providing you do not have long nails. A little lubricant helps if the ring seems stuck. Be sure the ring goes as far up as you can push it; it will find a comfortable spot above the cervix.	F	66	14  years1 ring 1X O	5/25/2011
2	vaginal dryness, painful sex	abdominal cramping, pressure on bowels, low back pain, feeling of  uncomfortable fullness in pelvis	Maybe it's too soon to draw any conclusions. I've had the ring in 4 days and am hoping the side effects I described will disappear. If they don't, I will take it out. I'd rather use the cream or a tablet. I'm not sure how long to wait, but will be talking to my gyn in a few days.	F	52	4  days2mg 1X O	4/22/2011Email
3	Vaginal dryness and interstitial cy	No side effects for 7 years.  Suddenly with a new ring, abdominal pain, cramping,changes in bowel habits.  Extensive tests including a CT scan revealed nothing.  Drs were baffled.  I removed the ring and all symptoms disappeared.  Inserted again, more symptoms. Have done this four times.	It is incomprehensible to me that doctors (several of them) claimed that my symptoms could not have been caused by the estring.  It was only after going online and reading these comments that my own suspicions were confirmed.  As a breast cancer survivor, I do not have any other choice.  So at the moment I am trying to endure.  Not sure what is worse, the dryness and IC complications or the side effects from the estring	F	58	7  years 1X D	4/21/2011
5	Complete hysterectomy. Vaginal dryn	Just have a question.  I am starting a new relationship.  Was wondering about oral sex....does est-ring have a taste or odor?	I definitely have better lubrication.	F	56	3  years30 mg 1X O	4/20/2011Email
4	vaginal atrophy, frequent UTI	episodes of hypoglycemia	I was prescribed the Estring for vaginal atrophy and recurrant UTI's. It worked great for the UTI's. I had the ring in for 90 days and then replaced it. After having it in for another week I started experiencing episodes of hypoglycemia and was hospitalized. I didn't know wheter it was related to the ring or not but I decided to remove it and had it out for about 2months, the hypoglycemic episodes stopped (they couldn't find any medical reason for them) and the UTI's started back again so I reinserted a new ring with in 2&1/2 weeks my blood sugar started dropping again. So once again I removed the ring and have an appointment with the Endocrinologist. Has anyone else had this happen to them?	F	58	90  days2MG 1X D	4/5/2011Email
5	vaginal atrophy, dryness, pain	Vaginal dryness, burning, pain, recurrent UTI's requiring low dose antibiotics.	Intially I had difficulty inserting the ring in the proper position and could feel the ring. After a couple of days this was resolved. Now months later my symptoms are totally gone, no UTI's in 6 months and off antibiotics. Sex life is active and very enjoyable again.	F	59	6  months2mg 1X M	2/26/2011
5	hot flashes, dryness	It helped hot flashes and skin dryness and appearance right away. I enjoyed the dramatic improvements.	I started the ring in Jan 2010. In June,2010 I was diagnosed with Colon Cancer. My cancer was removed in Nov and I was back on Estring after mamogram is cleared in Dec 2010. I don't know if the cancer is related to the Estring. I have not read any case related these two together. But I think it's worth to mention just in case someone else has the same experience.	F	54	9  months2mg 1X O	1/21/2011Email
5	dry vagina, painful sex	discharge and slight odor	The best Estradiol that I have had since stopping Estrace and provera.  It works just on the vagina and made sex comfortable and not painful.  I really recommend this for women who are older and have dry vaginas with painful sex.	F	71	1  years2 MG 1X O	1/12/2011Email
5	extreme vaginal atrophy, burning	Slight breast tenderness, otherwise no side effects.	Had burning and itching to the point where I thought I had either a yeast or UTI, but GYN told me it was from lack of estrogen.  Tried cream, which was messy; pills and patches which seemed like overkill and didn't deliver to the correct symptoms.  Very difficult to remove!  I came to this site to see if anyone had suggestions about removal other than having to go in every 90 days for re-insertion by health professional.	F	54	6  months1 ring 1X O	12/8/2010
4	Vaginal dryness and pain	Initial discomfort on insertion and trouble getting the ring in the proper placement. Mild cramping that stoppped in 24 hours. Gliding of the ring with straining that requires occasional  repositioning. At times I can feel the ring when running or cycling. My husband can not feel the ring. I have not experienced any side effects of weigh gain, hair loss or depression as mentioned by others.	Significant improvement in overall vaginal dryness, pain intercourse has disappeared. Occasional itching and burning at vagina opening, easily treated with OTC meds.	F	57	1  months2mg 1X D	11/28/2010Email
5	Hot flashes and vaginal dryness	I had no side effects.  This is my preferred estrogen delivery and it far surpasses any other HRT I have taken.  The fact that it is delivered vaginally -- direct to the vaginal walls and cervix -- makes it easily absorbed where my body needs it instead of being metabolised through the body and the liver.  I'm amazed to read that people have problems because it was so perfect for my needs.	Fantastic.  I couldn't feel it inserted, I merely felt 100% better. I have no self-consciousness about inserting fingers or rings or diaphragms or anything, so maybe that made it easier. I would use this the rest of my life if I could!	F	68	4  years 1X M	11/21/2010Email
5	Vaginal atrophy, dryness	Occasional discharge and slight odor. I have had a couple of yeast infections since beginning treatment.	Excellent relief of symptoms, and sex is much more pleasurable now.  My husband says he cannot feel the ring. I've had no trouble with insertion or removal, and I replace the ring every 90 days.  Bearing down can cause it to slip out, but that is a minor inconvenience.  I am concerned about possible long term effects of HRT, even though the dosage is low and it is not delivered systemically.	F	58	4  years2 mg 1X O	10/31/2010
5	vaginal dryness, frequent UTIs	Maybe weight gain.	I was having frequent UTIs, as many as 6 in one year. My ob/gyn said my vagina was very dry and suggested the estring. Once I started using, the UTIs became less frequent, and right now it's been over 1.5 years since the last one. Sex is much better now too.	F	57	4  years2 mg 1X D	10/25/2010
5	Vaginal atrophy and dryness	I do have some thinning hair, but am try to use some products for that because sex was unbearable before, and not feeling into it was hard on my marriage.	The Estring completely changed my libido, lubricated my vagina and I have been very happy with the results. I had foggy thinking before and that has gotten better.	F	67	1  years2.0 mg 1X D	10/24/2010
3	Painful intercourse, dryness	Severe migraines, breast tenderness, insomnia	At first, all was well. felt great, sex was enjoyable again, then the side effects, the most painful migraines, and breast soreness, weight gain, and worst of all insomnia. Once the removed, the symptoms subsided, w/in a day or two.  I would rather use the vagifem them the is insert, did not experience side effects with that, just a bit more costly.	F	50	5  months30 mg 1X D	10/8/2010
1	post menopausal vaginal atrophy	Horrible smell, so bad that my husband could smell it on his penis after we made love. So bad that he couldn't stomach giving me oral.When I decided to take it out, I couldn't get my finger looped around it to remove it. My husband had to reach in and pull it out for me. (Love is grand :-)	I'm going to ask my doctor for an estrogen pill you insert in you vagina or an estrogen cream you insert in your vagina instead of the Esting. Those are the other two options he suggested when he suggested the Estring. I chose the Estring because I thought it would be a simpler option. I took transdermal estrogen for years as part of a combined estrogen, progesterone and testosterone hormone replacement therapy, but went off everything four or fivr months ago and was finding my vagina dry and easily torn.On the transdermal estrogen, I had very little vaginal sodour and my husband said it was a "nice" smell, so I don't think it's the estrogen. I think it's the material that the ring itself is made of interacting with the natural vaginal lubrication that causes the smell.	F	59	18  days- 1X D	10/6/2010
2	Vaginal dryness, sex painful	foul-smelling discharge, hair loss, and leg cramps.	I was disappointed about these side effects because the estring really helped with the vag dryness.	F	53	5  months2 mg 1X O	9/17/2010
2	vaginal dryness	Thinning hair, constant UTI's, headaches and urine leakage.	Felt great initially, my husband and I began to enjoy sex again. Hair is growing back a friend suggested Rogaine...no more UTI's and I use KY Liquibeads for vaginal dryness. Another friend suggested acupuncture for overall menopausal symptoms. Caution - hormone replacement is not for everyone. Do your homework and ask your health care provider lots of questions. Also if you have had an adverese effect from using the Estring the FDA website has a voluntary reporting section for consumers at fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm053074.htm.	F	55	2  months 1X D	9/9/2010Email
3	Pain during intercourse, dryness	breast tenderness, very slight cramps, and I feel bloated.  This feels sort of like PMS, hoping these side effects will go away in a few days.	I just started using estring, so I really don't know yet how well it's working (or not).  I am having very mild side effects...feeling similar to those from pms, like breast tenderness, slight cramps/tummy upset and a bloated feeling.  I'm hoping that these side effects will go away as my system becomes used to the estring.	F	51	6  days2mg 1X D	8/30/2010Email
2	painful intercourse,dryness/atrophy	insomnia, leg and toe cramps, irritability, abdominal discomfort	hx.bipolar disorder, postmenopausal 1 yr., will talk to my doctor tomorrow because I feel generally uncomfortable and my sleep has been poor.	F	53	5  days2 mg 1X O	8/8/2010
2	vaginal dryness	The ring worked extremely well for the first 5 months though I felt mild crampy discomfort occasionally. After five months, I developed UTI-like symptoms and cramping feelings increased. A urine test proved negative and discomfort increased so I reluctantly removed it after 5 1/2 months.	Side effects are subsiding slowly but surely. After one week, I'm feeling much more comfortable.	F	63	6  months2 mg 1X D	8/7/2010
1	Vaginal atrophy	I thought the estring was extremely uncomfortable.  I feel like I had inserted it correctly (I used a diaphragm in my youth--much more difficult to insert than the estring)--but it just hurt.  I much prefer the Estrace cream, will go back to that now.	Very few of the side effects described beautifully on the message board are in the patient or physician literature, does anyone find that strange?	F	58	3  days2 mg 1X O	8/7/2010
1	Dryness & urine leakage	After the first day I got a slight itching problem. By the 4th day it was unbearable so I pulled it out.  Still itching, waiting to see doctor to see how I can relieve the itching. I think I must have been allergic to the ring it self, because prior to this ring the Dr. had put in a Femring in the office and I had no problem with that.  Definately won't use this one again.		F	56	4  days 1X O	7/31/2010
3	burning, itching of vulva	hot flashes	I am 68 years old, have had the estrogen patch for years, recently became sexually active after nine years and was experiencing painful intercourse and burning and itching. There was no evidence of yeast, so the doctor suggested the cream, but it was too messy. So, I switched to the Estring and use the cream twice a week on the outside, because I was told the estrogen from the patch does not get to the vagina, and the estrogen from the ring does not get to the vulva. While all the other problems have subsided since using the Estring, I now have hot flashes which are making me pretty miserable.	F	68	2  weeks2mg 4X O	7/30/2010
3	vaginal atrophy	Hair thinning after 3 months.	I used an estrogen cream for a few weeks prior to insertion and didn't have trouble, removal was a little stressful--crochet hook helped.  Got a yeast infection right away, which I treated with OTC meds. No recurrences.  The Estring relieved my vaginal dryness and greatly reduced tearing--still had to use lubricants, though. I even seemed to sleep better.  But after 3 months started noticing hair thinning--mostly around the temples.  My hairdresser noticed too.  Didn't relate to the Estring until 9th month when I re-read the product insert. I removed the Estring and I'm not refilling Rx. Frankly, I'd rather have hair than sex!  I am switching to KY ovules.  And Rogaine!	F	55	9  monthsN/A 3X O	7/17/2010
3	vaginal dryness	I didn't like the smelly discharge which was on-going.	I switched to estriol vaginal tablets compounded by a women's pharmacy in Wisconsin.  They are more convenient, less messy, and I think provide better lubrication!	F	54	7  years 1X D	7/11/2010Email
5	Vaginal Atrophy	None	Around age 50, as I was going into menopause, I began having slight urinal leakage while I was jogging, or dancing, or if I sneezed while standing. It became more of a problem as time went on during any activity requiring physical exertion (even walking fast)  so I started to use light days pads, then progressed to light Tenna and Poise pads. I often had urgency to urinate. Intercourse was uncomfortable due to dryness, so we started using a lubricant. I noticed my vagina was 'drying up and shrinking'. My Dr. recommended Estring because it delivers only estrogen locally (and it is not systemic like the creams that have both estrogen and progestin which will make you menstruate). Now my vagina is back, with body, full and plump!  I notice a slight more fullness in my lower abs; but no weight gain, no hair loss, no dark circles - none of the side effects that others reported, which could have also been due to menopause.  I can now go to the gym without wearing a pad and have no leakage! Only word of caution: the ring may move forward during contractions during bowels movements, so be ware because you may have to push it back with your finger before you stand up or it will fall out!

5	vaginal dryness, pain , hot flashes	early itchiness - first week only - perhaps a holdover from earlier dryness	outstanding success;no pain; intercourse enjoyable and frequent, little reduction in hot flashes but I have to live with them as my mother did until she was 93	F	70	2  years2mg 1X AN	6/1/2010
3	vaginal dryness	Severe migraine headaches, severe lower abdominal pain, nausea, change in bowel habits.	The Estring worked well for vaginal lubrication for about the first 10 months, but then side effects appeared.  It took about 6 months to identify the cause of the side effects.  Once I removed the Estring, the side effects were gone within 1-2 days.  I will not use it again.	M	58	16  months30 mg 1X D	5/21/2010
3	Vaginal Discomfort	Helped vaginal dryness for a while, but not real well. Still needed a lubricant.  Very difficult to remove. No negative physical side effects that I know of.	Never felt the ring, once inserted.  Did feel better, less bitchy at the beginning of the 90 day period.  Got pretty bitchy near the end.	F	55	2  years2 mg 1X O	5/19/2010
3	atrophy and dryness	discharge with bad odor	atrophy and dryness was relieved - it took 3-4 weeks to reach full effect	F	61	6  months2mg 1X O	5/19/2010
5	vaginal atrophy	none	Thank goodness for Estring. I am single, had not had intercourse for 3 years, was several years into menopause, and intercourse felt like shards of glass. After a few months of using the Estring I had intercourse again and it was fine. I do think it is pretty difficult for a single 62 year old baby boomer like myself to establish a serious relationship with out sex. Phew!	F	62	2  years2 MG 1X O	5/18/2010
5	vaginal atrophy	No adverse side effects	Taken for vaginal atrophy.  Very satisfied; no more tearing or discomfort with intercourse.  2 mg ring per 90 days.	F	63	120  days2 mg 1X O	5/2/2010

1	improve vaginal dryness	At my 1-yr pap exam after using the Estring for about a year, my gynocologist found a large ovarian cyst (15 cm). It is the first and only time I've had a cyst.  I also had my very first UTI ,coincidentally, just a week before the cyst was discovered.  I feel quite strongly that both the UTI and the ovarian cyst are a result of using the Estring.  There is no other reason at age 57 that I would get both of these ailments within the same timeframe, and for the first time in my life, and only after using the Estring; also the first time I've used any type of synthetic form of estrogen.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
