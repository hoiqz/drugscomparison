4	Enalapril	Dizzy. After the first couple of days when my body was adjusting to the medication all side effects went away but after 6 weeks, I woke up one morning and was dizzy. It did not go away and so I went to see my Dr. He prescribe some antibiotics and then something else thinking it was just an inner ear infection but it did not go away. Went for MRI and it came back clean (thank God!!). After that, my Dr. was willing to believe me that it was the Enalapril and it was not going to go away so we changed to 25mg of Losartan. TBD on how this goes.	Let me start by saying that I am one of those that somehow got bad genes when it comes to BP. I am not overweight, 148 pounds, and run 30-40 miles a week. Eating right does not help my BP either. I was actually taking 10mg in the morning and 5mg at night but there was no way to enter this. The Enalapril controlled my BP great!! Without medicine, I am 150/100 person and it took me to 118/72 or lower. I really wish I had not developed the dizziness b/c this medicine was doing really well for me. I would recommend it for sure. Also, we have to keep in mind that the majority of people who rate the medicine on the web are the people who are having side effects. There are hundreds of people that experience no side effects but when you do experience them, your doctor should be understanding!!	M	39	10  weeks15 mg 1X D	2/17/2012Email
1	High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)	I was on 10mg once a day of Enalapril for half a year. Then my doctor upped it to 10mg TWICE a day. I had no problems. BUT, when it was upped to >> 20mg << TWICE a day, that's when I started getting irregular heartbeats! My heart would beat normally and then I would get a POUNDING heartbeat (of one) and then it would return back to normal. I also would get shortness of breath and fatigue. WHEN I STOPPED taking it and switched to a different medication, the irregular heartbeats went away COMPLETELY.	If you do take it, I would be aware that a higher dose INCREASES the likelihood of more side effects, so be careful.	M	32	1  years20 2X D	3/19/2011

1	Hypertension	Intolerable, life disrupting dry cough somewhat like a post nasal drip cough but nonproductive. A very strange sensation in the back of my throat on the right side would bring on the cough - almost like I was going to vomit. A few sneezes would also accompay the coughing fits. I did not learn that this was a possible side effect of Vasotec until the third Rx refill when they finally put that informative sticker on the container! It was NEVER mentioned by my perscribing Dr.	I just missed two doses while on vacation and the coughing has stopped entirely! Right now my blood pressure is not being treated, but I will speak to my Dr. on my next appointment date.	M	55	9  months5 MG 1X D	2/9/2010Email

4	heart  murmer	occasional "funny" sensation in right hand and lower arm, right side of face-kinda mild pens and needles, cold feeling, right side of face feels "dry" like skin pulling, kinda like bells palsy without the palsy-diarhea, im diagnosed with fibromyalgia occasional flank pain, flu like muscle ache	bp went from 130-135 over 80-85  to 110-115 over 60-65 feel good	F	43	30  days	9/18/2008Email

2	high blood pressure	I developed Erythema Multiforme after taking Vasotec for several years. It continually got worse starting as a cold sore on lip and spreading to face, neck, arms, hands, then knees and back. Very scary to look at and took 3 weeks to completely go away until it started all over again!	It took 3 doctors (allergist, dermitologist, and internal medicine dr.) to finally pinpoint that the EM trigger was enalapril (Vasotec). I'm now off of it now and EM is under control.

2	Hypertension	I took it the first time for 2 weeks and I felt slower.  Later on I had trouble breathing, especially after climbing steps.  I also developed pains in my legs.  Went off it and tried it a second time.  My chest seized up after one dose and I had to quit.	It lowered my blood pressure, but not being able breathing is impossible.	F	40	1  days	11/15/2007
1	high blood pressure	Headaches, dizziness,numbing in left hand, insomina,swelling of throat, hospitalized for four days sedated for three days with tube in throat and breathing from an oxygen machine.		F	43	1  years	10/23/2007
2	high blood pressure	I've been taking 5 mg of Enaparil for over 2 months and have a terrible, dry, barking cough that keeps me up most the night and I'm exhausted.  The cough seems better during the day, but that could be because I take the med at night and perhaps it's worn off by late morning.  It did reduce my BP, now at 120/77, but what good is that if you're a walking Zombie during the day? Prior to taking Enaparil I took Atenonol--which made me dizzy, lethargic, tired and consequently depressed.  I just called the doc and he suggested I cut my dose of Enaparil in half.  Anyway to reduce high BP without these meds????		F	59	10  weeks	9/11/2007
3	Hypertension	Abdominal swelling and pain.	I was proscribed 5mg of Norvasc and 15mg of Vasotec per day.  The Vasotec at that dosage caused severe abdominal swelling.  I couldn't button my pants.  Any abdominal pressure caused pain.  Symptoms went away within 3 days after I stopped taking it.  I found I can tolerate 5mg per day with no symtoms and believe it helps me even at that low dosage.

5	Borderline high blood pressure	None so far. I had tried several other ACE inhibitors before this one. They didn't work and one contributed to such a bad lower respiratory infection I had to go on an inhaler! Vasotec has been very good so far.		F	38	1  months	1/24/2007
5	Hypertension & Fast Heart Rate	I take 20mg of Vasotec twice a day.  I also take 25mg of Coreg Twice a day and 25mg of water pill.  All three combined have gotten my blood pressure down to normal limits.  The Vasotec helped reduce chest pressure and I have had no side effects.  No male sexual disfunction side effects.	This is a great cheap generic LIFE SAVING drug.	M	40	14  months	11/17/2006
5	High blood pressure	No side effects whatsoever.	I have been taking these pills (10 mg) daily for 6 years and it has kept my blood pressure down.	F	64	6  years	11/12/2006
5	HYPERTENSION and DIABETIC	REAL problem cough with Enalapril [ACE] so I asked Dr. for Rx for 40 mg DIOVAN but then read here about hair loss and weight gain possibilites so afraid to take it and split my dose of Enalapril in half then to 3/4 instead, & side effects gone, but BP not low enough and want to TRY Diovan, but still afraid with whole bottle Diovan still UNUSED in my drawer!  Any questions or HELP, please feel free to write me.  Would like to discuss your experience with DIOVAN hair loss and weight gain as opposed to Enalapril's side effects.  More....>	I am also Diabetic and ACE inhibitors are supposed to be TOP BP meds for Diabetics, but the cough is intollerable, so thought Diovan would be better, but CANNOT LOSE HAIR nor GAIN WEIGHT and don't know what to do PLEASE HELP. I am going out of my mind with these Diovans sitting here untouched for a month, and WANT to try them but so scared of HAIR LOSS and WEIGHT GAIN! [I put 5 rating so this would be read on top, I am in desperate situation, please write to me about those 2 side effects IF you're experiencing them].  Thanks.  Email address to the right...>	F	45	1  days	6/12/2006Email
3	HI BP	REAL problem coughing w/5mg by 2nd refill [not 1st] even lost voice, so tried HALF pill & that was fine but didn't lower pressure anymore so tried 3/4 pill & that seems good for a month so far, no more side affects [except still little fatigue] but back down to 130's, 140's mostly but sometimes higher, [& 120's only RARELY]	Dr. gave Rx for Diovan BEFORE I started splitting enal., but then read about hair loss & weight gain with Diavan so didn't take it & split Enalaprils instead.  [Lost rating points for coughing and loss of voice which has NEVER happened to me before, and for having to lower more effective, higher dose.] Any questions feel free to write me.   Would like to discuss Enalapril and Diovan too.	F	45	3  months	6/12/2006Email
5	High blood pressure	No ill effects	Keeps the pressure in check, I also exercise.   Have taken this drug for 5 yrs.	F	70	5  days	3/23/2006
4	borderline high blood pressure	Dizziness if I rise up quickly out of bed (but doesn't that happen even if you aren't on medication)?	I also believe that my higher blood pressure caused me to feel very nervous, shakey, irritable, and depressed.   Ever since I started taking this medication, I have felt calmer, happier and patient (like I was years ago).  I am only on 2.5 mg and take the generic "enaparil."  At that low dose, it has brought my blood pressure back to how it used to be (before children).  I feel great.....also by just knowing that it is lower.	F	33	1  months	10/11/2005Email

1	high blood pressure	I developed angioedema of my face.  It started with a hive on my lip and progressed until my face was so swollen I looked like a monster.  Spent the night in the ER and was given benadryl, epinepherine and cortisone.  The swelling continued even with all those meds.  It took days for the swelling to go down. The doctor said he		F	58	21  days	3/22/2005
3	high blood pressure	Am married, very active sexually. After starting vasotec experienced slight change (for the worse) in erectile hardness and response to things that usually triggered erections.	High blood pressure used to made me irritable, nervous and caused insomnia.  I know the Drs say this cannot be but I know my body and KNOW this for a fact.  Lower blood pressure since vasotec changed m personality for the better and my quality of life improved.  Now I want my cake and eat it too - I want an impressive hardon back AND lower blood pressure.	M	45	2  years	8/10/2004
