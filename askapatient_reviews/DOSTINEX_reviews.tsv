4	Prolactinoma	Started out with high prolactin levels around 100-150 in 2011, but  this year 2012 my level was at a normal 5, when I started taking Cabergoline the one suffering side effect was extreme fatigue and a dizziness that would not go away for about 3 months! After that everything seems to start adjusting, BUT not ended there; I started with mood swings and emotional stress. Today after one year, the one thing I notice the MOST and I am afraid of sometimes is the MOOD SWINGS! Sometimes I can't control them and anything (the most simple thing) can trigger it and I have hurt my boyfriend feelings many times. I pray to God to give me the strength to continue and be able to manage this anger issues. In all I feel 90% better than when I was first diagnosed, and I was able to drop half the weight I had gain since then.....I don't want to depend on this medication and I have faith I will be heal.

3	Prolactinoma	I first started with Bromocriptine and it was Awful!!!! I had the worst side effects I could ever imagine... Dr said I was taking to much. My Endo put me on Cabergoline this Sep. 2011, and my experience has been good and bad, I started with severe Vertigo(felt like I was spinning all the time)... Then it stopped. After that I've lost weight, also had little appetite and severe sexual urge. But that has also been minimized with time, now I'm more tired, fatigue is severe, always feel like sleeping. Also during the months I experience moods swings and feel very irritated and just Angry for no reason. My last blood test showed my prolactin a normal range from 150 to 5... I really wish I can just stop taking this, I feel like it worsen with time and I don't want to depend on it my whole life. I have also been going to depression, ups and downs. So I feel like it help on one end, but also worsen on the other. :-(		F	33	1  years1x1week	11/6/2012Email
5	Pituitary macroadenoma	None really to speak of that I can attribute to Dostinex	Firstly, I was fortunate to find out that I had a pituitary macroadenoma; a routine MRI found it, as I was asymptomatic. I was luckily able to avoid surgery and was started on Dostinex. My side effects could be attributed to the fact that my high prolactin level of 4000 killed my testosterone level completely. Have been taking weekly testo injections for the past year to compensate and that could be what is causing my increase in appetite and aggressive moods. Just did bloods and my prolactin level is now at 600 and dropping, so I would say Dostinex is definitely helping. Sex drive still not quite there but I do sleep at night and have no other side effects.All in all I would say a very positive drug for my condition	M	53	1  years2 mg 2X W	10/12/2012
3	prolactinoma	I can sleep more than 10-12 hours, feel very tired, depressed and sex is far away from my mind. I am not the same person.	All my life my periods are not normal, but this drug didn't help me with that. My prolactin level is ok now, I hope my endo will tell me to reduce or stop taking it. I also have proplems with my breasts - fibroadenomas. Please write me, if you have fibroadenomas and prolactinom.	F	24	2  years0,125 MG 1X W	10/7/2012Email
4	MEN1/prolactinoma	None the first time I took it. This time feeling groggy and not much of an appetite.	I was on Dostinex for about a year a few years ago. It helped bring my prolactin level down greatly. Then when i got my period back I got pregnant so i had to get off of it. I continued after child birth until i lost my insurance. Ive been off of Dostinex for almost 2 years now since its so expensive. I had tried Bromocriptine but it made me horribly nauseous. I never had any side effects before with Dostinex. I just finished my first week of getting back on Dostinex and I have noticed groggy/hungover feeling. Just feel blah most of the time. Also lack of apetite. I hope it brings my Prolactin level down though. Anyone else have MEN1?	F	29	1  weeks.25mg 2X W	9/10/2012Email
4	prolactinoma	I am a 70 year old male, with a 3mm prolactinoma, diagnosed 2 years ago. Been on dostinex almost 2 years, my dosage is 0.25mg twice (that is a half a tab)a week. I ocasionally have that tired feeling on the days I take the medication. If you are taking .5mg twice per week, it could be too much, talk to your doctor and determine if that is the case. My hormone levels were not good for the last 20 years with no clue as to why, until I had an MRI and found the prolactinoma. Since I have been taking the dostinex my hormone balance is now normal for a male of my age, I have lost 20 lbs. with no real effort. All other side effects that have been reported by other male patients have been very minimal if any and not of a concern. So my evaluation of dostinex is between a 3 and a 4, it is effective for my condition. I have had no shrinkage in tumor size but no growth, that is good. If no growth continues in the future, surgery will be avoided. If surgery in needed, then the Denver area has on		M	70	2  years.25 mg 2X W	9/6/2012Email

2	active prolactenoma	CRAZY in the head. Irrational. Nausea for 3 days after taking it. Sleep for 10 hours but don't feel rested. Sweat so much at night I think I peed the bed. Want to drink beer and lots of it. Lowered sex drive and drive in general. Dry mouth.This is the third time I have been on this drug. I am having the worst side effects I have ever experienced. I am on cabergoline this time instead of dostinex. I am going to stop taking it. I don't know what my next move will be but I know I can't live life this way.The active tumor makes me nausea, eat more, crave certain foods, gain wait and feel moody but at least I was happier and have a desire to be active and live my life when I wasn't on this medicine.I am glad for those that have had success with you.

1	prolactinoma	terrible weakness, unable to get out of bed, dizziness, ended up in the emergency room because of the symptoms, change in personality, appetite, everything.  Very scary	I had to stop taking Dostinex after a trip to the emergency room.  I now experience severe withdrawal effects.  Dizziness is much worse than when I took the drug, i feel that I have to hold up my head, because it feels like something is moving in it.

3	Macroadenoma	Increased Libido, ability to loose weight, muscle mass increase, increased energy levels	The drug worked as advertised, reduced my prolactin levels from 15000 to less than 2 in less than 2 years and increased my T-levels from 70-600.  However, although increased libido is of course good, hypersexuality is a problem and I find myself thinking about sex all the time...Watch out for compulsive behaviours (sex, drugs, gambling)	M	38	2  years0.75 1X W	5/4/2012

But just recently I have noticed heart palpitations and increased anxiety the day after I take it. Anyone else experience this?  The heart palpitations are really starting to bother me.

5	macroadenoma	Tiny bit of headaches, constipation	I think this is a great drug!! My sex drive over 4 years of being married plummeted!! I was not sure what to do? I was finally diagnosed about 2 months ago with a very high prolactin level a little over 3000. I had an MRI done about 1 month after it showed an macroadenoma 2cm x 3cm. I have been taking the medicine and can already feel a HUGE DIFFERENCE!! I have labs this thursday and cant wait to see what my levels are at now! My sex drive has started to slowly increase, my energy night and day difference, my motivation went from wanting to lay down on the couch and exhausted after 8pm most of the day to exercising 3-4 times a week and still perky at 10 and 11 pm at night. EATING HABITS A HUGE KEY FACTOR!! I went from trying to eat right to living it. My wife the angel that she is got us stated in GREEN SMOOTHIES, 60%fruit 40% veggies. I have never felt better. It the RAW diet, there's a family that lived in my home town that taught us a lot about eating correctly and my life has improved significantly. I would say that's why I have probably not had huge side affects like most people have bc I was willing to change my diet. I can almost promise you that as you do your health will increase and same with your energy. You can mix what ever you want in the green smoothies it just depends of what you like them to taste like.Any questions email me! Increasing meds this week	M	27	1  months0.25 2X W	10/30/2011Email
5	Pituitary Adenoma	Cabergoline - Fantastic Side:   Reduced prolactin from 137 to 7 in just a few months.  (Had already developed breast cancer by then). Reduced diplopia in both eyes quite a bit, although I traded that off for worse vision.  Still that was a benefit because you can't get glasses for spastic diploplia (each episode lasting about 2 to 4 hours).Felt 100% better in about 3 days already.  Was calling it the magic drug right from the start after having a brutal head-splitting incident with Bromocriptine.Solved some pretty serious intestinal issues.   Down to 3 times a day versus 6.Gave me a great lift.I am almost a senior so I couldn't take it in the full dose because that kept me awake for 48 hours at a time.  That's why it was reduced.  It also made my heart beat faster which was great because I had bradycardia, possible LVH (EKG said) and extreme irregularities when it got too slow.  So as far a I was concerned, it's these tumours that cause LVH and not Cabergoline.Didn't do a t	Got off of the Cabergoline.  Violent reaction first few weeks.  Worse than getting off of a drug like Paxil.  Very violent depression.  Felt awful instantly.  Broke out in massive uncontrollable sweats!  Started sleeping more.  Started getting violent spasms in muscles from hip to toe - very violent!  From one I was crawling for several days, and others I was sore for several days from less painful charlie horses.   My body didn't like quitting this drug at all!   Heart started getting too slow and irregular again at night.  After three weeks overcame major depression but was still in some depression for next three months with odd bout of severe depression.  Started on Cabergoline again.  Don't know what prolactin level is now and don't know what tumour size is. Should find out soon.  Not sure what to do about the stomach issue.  Don't like "coated" pills because I believe that they cause cancer in the intestines.  Might weaken it a little on occasion in the future, but I think I will need it for another few months at least.

5	Prolactinoma	I am a bit disgusted at some of the people commenting here. This drug cannot be causing some of the side effects they say they are experiencing as many of them are not even known side effects of this drug. I had NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL.  After being on bromocriptine and the nausea that came with that drug, it was a relief.	There are lawsuits surrounding this drug at present and I think people are scapegoating this drug. I was on it for 15 years, so I was one of the earliest users of this drug for prolactinoma. Prior to this drug I was on bromocriptine and that drug caused me terrible nausea. Cabergoline supposedly causes impulse control issues like gambling, high sex drive, etc in certain people. My doctor never had a patient with these problems and I certainly never experienced them. I never had a single problem with this drug.	F	45	15  years100 1X W	8/2/2011Email
3	High Prolactin Level:  155	Extreme fatigue.  I can sleep for hours at a time.  Also, I have GI upset, and just a sense of feeling blah.  My appetite has also decreased.	I am taking 1/2 of a pill twice a week because of an irregular menstrual cycle.  I haven't had a cycle since January, and this was even after a course of Provera.  I was wondering if anyone could share their experience in terms of how quickly their cycle resumed after taking Dostinex.  Thanks!  My rating is low because I haven't been on the drug long enough to tell if it has lowered my prolactin level.	F	38	9  days.5 MG 1X W	7/27/2011Email
4	High Prolactin Levels	Tiredness, lighheadness, nausea, feeling hungover, change in mental health, depressed, anxious and panic attacks got really bad, mood swings, change in personality, became a different person.	I have now stopped taking dostinex after two years on them i ended up in a psychiatric hospital, i am not blaming them totally for my mental health as i have always had mental health issues but thay made me alot worse i felt like i was loosing my mind. I am seeing the endo tomorrow as i have been of them three months and my psychiatrist and therapist said i need to make sure he listens to me that i can't take them. I am now afraid my levels will rise they were 30 when last tested and that was on the meds before is started them the levels were almost 4000.

3	High Prolactine 265.0	Please contact me if anybody is experience the same or similar as me. This is a moment in my life when I really need a friend with my same problems so we can help each other. I started taking Dostinex to reduce mi Prolactine Level. During the 4th weeks I am experiencing a huge change in my temper, i have terrible hot flashes, nauseas and I feel i gain weight. I don't have any desire for sex, not at all, I don't even want to sleep close to my husband it bothers me a lot. I thought this pill will help me in my sex life but it doesn't.	I started taking Parlodel 6 years ago in small doses and increasing at 2/day... it was horrible, i can't work well, think, drive my car, sleep, talk to people, it was a horrible experience, I had horrible migraines my vision started becoming black by the pain in my brain I called the ambulance several times and it cost me thousands of dollars...., because all this i lost my job and i went to a deep depression. after 1 year taking Parlodel i quit. Then I didn;t do anything for 5 years, of course i did wrong my prolactine went higher... 3 months ago i experienced bad headaches and terrible migraines and the dr. told me to start with dostinex, not bad at all in comparison with parlodel this is much better. I am having terrible hot flashes now like 20 times a day, and this just started last week. I lost my temper for no reason, I am sleepy I do not want to have sex and i hate my life this way. I just lost my job again, this time I had a Government Job and the medicine effects cost my Job I am very upset , under stress and very very frustrated; this time in the middle of my treatment and now i will have to stop the treatment again, I only have 2 pills left for the next 2 weeks and that's it! I have no insurance for the expensives MRI, Dr's Appointmens and either for the medicine. Who can help me :-(  I already have an appointment in 2 weeks and I don't think so the Dr. from the Baptist Medical Hospital  will allow me to get in without paying...

3	elevated prolactin	fatigue, headache, dizziness, "hung over" feeling (particularly 24-48 hours after the dose), depressed mood, lack of energy, needing 10-12 hours of sleep a day.	I have a 5mm pituitary microadenoma that secretes prolactin. My prolactin level is 40 w/o meds, and that is high enough for me to miss periods.  Also, I have extreme difficulty sleeping when my prolactin is elevated.  I also had extremely painful periods (cramps so bad I couldn't leave the house) for 11 yrs prior to my diagnosis, and still for 5 years after I started the meds. Now they are pretty much pain free but I don't credit the meds, just increased age and a much improved, plant-based diet.  With cabergoline (they don't make the brand name, Dostinex, anymore) my prolactin is usually around a 5, but since the generic came out it doesn't seem to be working as well and the side effects are more pronounced. Junk. I take the smallest possible dose to keep my period regular and make sure I am sleeping.  HOWEVER, the drug has problems. The side effects are consistent and have not gone away after 10 years of use.  I feel hung over for 24 to 48 hours after my weekly dose (I used to take it 2x/wk, but due to the side effects, I'm down to 1x/wk with my doc's approval).  On Dostinex, I require a LOT of sleep, 8-10 hours at night and often a long nap during the day.  It is very disruptive to a productive life.  When I first started taking it years ago, I had increased sex drive, but after about 6-12 months it went away (so those of you on it only a few months, don't expect it to last).  Also, since Dostinex is a dopamine agonist, expect mood changes. Still not sure it's worth it.	F	35	10  years0.25mg 1X W	6/1/2011
5	Micro Prolactinoma	Had mild cramping like a period was due but they didnt start. Also have felt more moody.	I went on Dostinex for a few months back in 2008 to make my period regular and I fell pregnant the first try. After pregnancy my Micro Prolactinoma grew from 4mm to 8mm. My prolactin was 5000 (range 85 - 500) but after this past 8 weeks back on dostinex my level has dropped to 499. Hopefullt a period will soon follow.	F	31	8  weeks0.5mg 1X W	5/25/2011Email
3	Prolactinoma	Extreme increase in sex drive and mood swings.	This review is about my ex-wife not myself, just to inform people about the drug.   I love and hate what this drug did to my ex-wife. It saved her life, for that I will always be gratefull.   However it's side effects of EXTREME sexual arousal and mood swings destroyed our marriage and family.   She went from never wanting sex at all, to cruising the internet for men to sleep with and having unprotected dangerous sex with strangers.   After she filed for devorced to sow her wild oats I found out I had been exposed to STD's through her and had to pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket to have myself tested so it wouldn't affect my health insurance rates.   Be carefull when you or a partner uses this drug.

It took 4 weeks for any of these side effects to be felt. I was relieved to find that my lack of drive and my unexplained feelings of depression are a result of this drug and not some break-down! I'm battling to work out how to do my job effectively while feeling this way. It's like feeling sick all the time which I'm not used to as I am otherwise very healthy.

It has brought the levels down to normal.I posted again because i have noticed a complete change in my personality since taking this drug, which is confusing as i had mental health issues such as depression and panic attacks before starting it but they got worse after, i now do things totally out of character.

5		Extreme tiredness, almost comatose sleeping in random places.  Weight loss, and abnormal emotional reactions (almost unemotional)	After having 1st baby at 18, i was without period for 2 years and even after breastfeeding ceased i was secreting milk, i also found it hard to lose weight. after failure to conceive i was diagnosed with a 5mm tumour hormone level 800.  I was given dostinex 1 x a week and within 5 weeks had my period back. After 8 weeks i fell pregnant again (unknowingly) and thus continued taking dostinex fro 4 more weeks.  After vomiting non stop for about two weeks and no period realised i was pregnant and stopped dostinex. I was still very sick for about 6 weeks which was when the dostinex cleared out of my system. I was monitored very closely during pregnancy and had a perfectly normal baby.Now after 4months of breastfeeding am back on dostinex now 2x a week because hormones level are at 5000. have only been back on for 1 1/2 weeks.

I can't cope.I hate waking up.For a long while I couldn't even sleep.I can't function. I just get angry so suddenly by the slightest thing.My mind reels around sad thoughts and sad memories.I don't trust my own judgement anymore.Things (that should be easy) are just absolutely impossibly difficult.I woke up drenched the other night.I've had near blackouts.I feel like...I try to swim up and out of the water to get air to find that there IS NO AIR.This is so scary because it is not tangible! it is a feeling of complete, sad, emptiness.I should have filled gallons with tears by now. I shake.I lost over 30lbs.Everything is a blur.Remembering is such a task.It's like having a veil in front of your eyes that keeps you from the real world. My rationale is gone! I have never felt so horrible in my life. I was taken off the medication on Aug/8th. I still feel these effects, although the intensity is less and less (after 7 weeks I am still very sad).I am scheduled for surgery in Nov because I refuse to try Parlodel or antidepressants. I just want to be normal again and capable and independent and HAPPY.I am now trying to find out as much as I can about the medication and surgery, and anything related to short or long lasting side effects of both.  	F	29	3  years.5 mg 2X W	9/27/2010Email

1	macroadenoma hyperprolactinemia	Chronic fatigue, weakness, car-sick feeling of mild dizziness and nauseous, making it hard to concentrate and be functional. Depression, depression, depression.	Diagnosed at age 12 with Prolactin of 1600.  Responded well to Parlodel and Permax but both made me violently ill and unstable at school (passing out constantly).  When Dostinex hit the market, I switched over, same side effects but more spread out with the time release effect.I can't tolerate enough of the medicine to get Prolactin below 120 so having surgery at Stanford to remove the tumor and the need for the Dostinex.  Tumor is still a Macro but has been on the Micro/Macro border for many years.Some important stuff I've gleaned from many doctors:-the high prolactin level and Dostinex can cause or worsen Depression.-Depression is treated with Dopamine inhibitors and Dostinex is a Dopamine antagonist, rendering treatment for Depression, ineffective at best.

3	Pituitary Tumour	Before: unbearable migraines, loss of menstruation, breasts enlarged, depression, loss of libido, obscure dreams. After: migraines disappeared, menstrual cycle returned but severe cramps now and can last 2 weeks,returned libido, wake up in the mornings after taking it feeling terribly weak, obscure dreams, sleeplessness.	I'm not 100% sure what symptoms are actually related to the tumor and the dostinex or what's just me. I can't properly remember the details i think it was 1cm with prolactin 2000 or 3000. The first mri i got was distorted because of my braces and the second was only last year which showed slight reduction. Dostinex worked wonders it brought the prolactin down to 200 i think within a month and my agonizing headaches were cleared up quickly. The only major issue i've had is the painful and heavy mensuration that's crippling once a month. Origionally i was on 5gm twice a week but within the first 6months this was reduced to once a week because i couldn't handle taking two weeks off every month! I've been on it over 2 years now and everythings been going well but in the last weeks my breasts have began to swell and lactate and my headaches are returning. I'm rather worried that the medicine is no longer working but is that even possible? I would greatly appreciate any feedback on this.	F	20	2  years.5mg 1X W	8/10/2010Email
5	prolactinoma	The first dose made me very tired the next morning, felt like a hangover, but nothing else. After one month i was fully adjusted to it, no more side effects, maybe mildly more tired the morning after i take it. My prolactin dropped from 300 to 18 in one month! on half a pill a week. Fantastic result. And i lost 5 pounds. I am very active all the time and over the last 2 years i had these couple of extra pounds i could not lose, and i have a strong suspicion it was the high prolactin. The weight dropped off as soon as my levels went back to normal. Also, improved sex drive (husband happy!).	worked great for me. My doctor said that for women that suffer nausea etc, it can be taken vaginally - so those of you that have more side effects may want to check in with your doctor.

3	Prolactinoma	Mood swings, depression, severe anxiety, cold hands (blue fingernails), increased levels of anger and aggression, OCD type-thoughts, hair loss, tendency to OD on booze and other (legal!) experiences which make me feel high.	My prolactin reading was approx 12,000 before taking this drug.  Has reduced levels down to around normal for a man, but I am convinced it is playing havoc with my mood and mental well-being. Plus sides include severe weight loss so I am now down to my target weight, more energy. I was also prescribed this with testosterone replacement so not sure if that has played a part on my weird moods. Get very angry, then anxious to the point of shaking.  Although I look healthier, inside I feel mentally very unwell.	M	40	18  months5 MG 2X W	7/30/2010

My level is 60 firstly then 47 and now 80..I hope to have a baby and am wondering to take Dostinex.Your experices inspire me a lot.Do you continue to take the medicine after the pregnancy or stop it?

3		Depression, drowsiness, sever fatigue, anxiety, fat	I have been taking the medication for about 4 months and have seen my levels drop pretty fast, but not fast enough to have a cycle which i havent had in years. I want to have a baby but since i dont ovulate i dont know when or if that will ever be possible. this has just been a nightmare for me, but finding this sight helps. To see that there are others having this problem really helps me cope. I just dont want to take medication for the rest of my life. I really dont know why this has happened. Has anyone consider surgery to remove the tumor or know anyone who has with success? I just want to know what other option are available rather than taking this medication.

It did work well in terms of that it brought my levels down from 3000 to 30,i also got pregnant twice while taking dostinex the first time just six weeks after starting it, previous to that i had no periods for 3yrs so it worked really well.

2	Pituitary tumor,Prolactin level:380	Unbearable headaches, nauseus, exhaustion, mood swings, anger, dizziness. I've been out of work for 3 weeks now. I'm not able to function on this medicine. I've seen 2 different endocronoligists and a neurologist. They keep telling me there must be something else going on with me and that it isn't the medicine causing me to feel like this!!But all the research I've done on cabergoline I'm finding out that others are going through the same thing! I'm so frustrated and don't know where else to turn! I can't keep missing work! Is this something that will eventually go away?	I gained 12lbs in 3 days!! And I wasn't eating b/c I've been so nauseus! I keep having burning sensation in my chest(kind of heartburn).  My endo ran more test yesterday on my pituitary and to check my prolactin levels since I've been on the medicine. Won't get the test results back until July 1st. I don't know if I can make it another 2 weeks of waiting! My PCP feels I should stop the cabergoline, but the neuro and endo both said no!	F	28	4  weeks.5mg 2X W	6/17/2010Email
3		none	I have a question, I have been on this medication for about six months now. I have a relatively small tumor on my pituitory gland (9mm) and I think that I am just now starting to feel the effects of this medication. I now wnat to do things like excersise, watch what I eat, and I am now sleeping better. So my question is how long has it taken for most of you to feel this medication take effect.

5	Macroprolactinoma	Constipation (resolved by increasing fibre in diet), Energy levels reduce massively in the evening, morning after taking dose I feel a bit groggy	Taking Dostinex after being diagnosed with a 25mm x 25mm macroprolactinoma 7 weeks ago. Prolactin level at diagnosis was 14,750 which reduced to 4,500 within 12 days on the lowest dose. It's since reduced to 450 at last test having been on 500Mg twice per week. Sight tests also improving so I hope that means the tumour is shrinking too.I have had some side effects - constipation and feeling groggy the day after taking dose. Also find my energy levels in the evening plummet - hardly surprising though if my body is fighting to get better and a small price to pay for the results it produces. On the plus side I'm feeling much better now than I've felt for a couple of years - libido returning too which is a massive bonus.	M	33	6  weeks500 2X W	5/22/2010Email
4	Pituitary tumor (benign)	Early on-headaches, nausea, increased sex drive (difficult combo).  Now, very sleepy, nausea.	I was first put on Parlodel and stopped after 1 dose- made me violently ill- vomiting every 2 minutes.  Several years later, went back on (with reduced dosage) and suffered through the side affects until became pregnant with my daughter.  When wanted to have a 2nd child, was put on Dostinex.  50X better than parlodel.  But now, 4 years later, having trouble with sleepiness (literally ready to fall asleep while exercising), nausea and low blood pressure.  I'm interested to know from others with these side affects how they dealt.	F	36	4  years.5 mg 2X W	5/4/2010Email

I am not looking to make more children, but I am excited that this shows I probably have a more normal prolactin level now (it was originally 110). So probably also my tumor is shrinking which is the best of news, and all of this with a very small dosage and no noticeable side effects so far.	F	44	5  weeks.25mg 2X W	4/21/2010Email
3	High Prolactin (80)	sudden and strong nausea, headaches (I am also taking Prometrium that also causes this), fatigue, weight gain, acne	I have had high prolactin for 2 years, my first OB GYN never mentioned this was a problem!! My husband and I have been TTC for 13 months, and just found out my prolactin level of 80 was causing me not to ovulate and to have irregular cycles. My infertility docotr prescribed donstinex to help lower my levels. If the Dostinex gives me a baby...then all the side effects will be well worth it!!!If it works out in the end for me, I will have to update my rating :) So lets hope it does!If anyone has questions for me please feel free to e-mail!

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS.

We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .

This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011

I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email

Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present.

I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email

4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.

5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010

3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped.

5	for depression-w/ my antidepressant	lowering my libido. Craving more sugary, fatty foods and carbs.     I took this several yrs. ago and although the medication initially worked-I packed on more than 10 pounds. I got depressed due to weight gain, but after several months I feel medication ceased to be effective. This time  was very reluctant (2 yrs later & different Dr. & different anti-depressant medication-Prozack-2 yrs ago) but I am trying it w/ a different antidepressant than previously-Taking now w/ Wellbutrin.

4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue. Negative - I find myself much more emotional - memories, key phrases, smells, songs, pictures, etc.can bring me to tears.	M	50	9  months50 MG 1X D	4/11/2010
2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now. I have woken up from a 12 year-long medication-induced nightmare.	M	57	 15 MG 1X D	4/7/2010Email

2	depression	Nausea the first few days, some constipation, cloudy thinking, increased appetite	Combined with Wellbutrin XL which suddenly stopped working for me after 3 years. After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

Insomnia (but the Seroquel has completely cured that.)	Abilify has helped me like no other drug.  I am on it along with cymbalta, deplin, seroquel and ativan.

Then still have little to no energy for the rest of the day.  I was previously, taking 60 mg. of Cymbalta for almost 2 years, but my dr. switched me to this when I started to feel like dying again.

3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!

2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010

No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010

Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.  No more for me. Abilify- Forgetaboutit!!!!!!!	F	57	3  days	1/30/2010Email

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.

That night she experienced indigestion/heartburn. She vomited. Sleepy but couldn't sleep. Feeling scared for no reason. Next day she passed out after being awake for 15 min. I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug.

At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying.

I am taking 50 mg of lamictal concurrently with 7.5 mg abilify.  Affect is flatter, less mood swings, but more non-reactive than anything.  I'm not sure this is where I want to be. I have been able to get projects done that I had difficulty starting.  Some days I have energy, some days I don't.  I a fasting blood draw yesterday and haven't heard the results yet.  Continuing to take abilify is a quandary -- do I feel worse or better if I factor in all the weird side effects?
