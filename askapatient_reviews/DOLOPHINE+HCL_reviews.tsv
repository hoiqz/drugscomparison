3	Lower back pain, plantar fasciitis	Progressive build up if taken continually. Tried taken it on two separate occasions due to severe pain. Both incidences produced massive internal kidney hemorrhages. Last incident requires 5 units of whole blood plus 2 units of plasma to stabilize me in ER. hemorrhage are very intense and profuse, minutes only. However, did relieve severity of pain.

4	Chronic Pain	Ocasional Constipation and Sweating	The one narcotic that ive taken that has given relief without the "fogginess" experienced from others ive taken over last 25 yrs. I have sporatic B/Tpain and I take roxicodone 30mgs which stops pain almost immediately.	M	43	2  years50MG 3X D	9/26/2011Email
4	shoulder, back surgeries, neuropath	mostly constipation, but makes me feel "normal"	no euphoric, able to sleep, people say it is addictive, but I take it occasionally, when other pain meds don't work and get enormous relief.	F	57	6  months10 1X D	9/9/2010
1	Migraines and Cluster headaches	Intractable projectile vomiting, itching, drowsiness, unclear thinking	Horrible!  I couldn't stop vomiting.  The headaches were better but I was so doped up I couldn't think or drive.  I tried decreasing the dosage to 2.5 mg and was still having all the side effects.  Plus everyone thinks your a drug addict for being on it which doesn't help with all the other crap i was going through.	F	33	60  days10 mg 2X D	4/18/2010Email
1	Pain, and recreation	Dolophine in 10mg doses, had zero analgesic effect on me- even when I took 10 at a time. However, my junkie buddies on line at the methadone clinic, would favor me with a single capfull out of their 4oz bottle, a perk for driving them into Manhattan at 5am, and the high was incredible- It also made you puke your guts out, bile, red blood, and all- but when you were that high, who cared? Supposedly more addictive then Heroin, but many diehard junkies, became easily controlled sheeple, forgoing criminal activities, keeping regular low wage jobs for years, and staying off H. With drawl is a fucking nightmare, and lasts up to 30 days, or more.	As a pain reliever, I wouldnt recommend it, because it dosent always work at all in many people. Its a drug of last resort- If I were a physician, I would rather have my PTs on morphine, or dilaudid, which has the amasing feature of not causing near fatal constipation	M	62	 	1/19/2010
5	Nerve damage due to wounds recieved	Constipation and drowsiness	every doctor i have ever gone to has put me on percocet, or vicodin or oxycodone or some other opiate.  i got severly addicted (over 30 pills a day 10 mg/325).  methadone has not only saved my marriage, my family, my career, my life but my faith as well.  i take 10 mg 3x daily on average, but sometimes only 1 or 2x a day only.  very satisfied and still in the Marines.  i thank god and my doctor for the foresight and wisdom of the drug that so many stereotype as a bad drug.

4	fibromyalgia,ddd in neck and back,					 	5/9/2008
3	heroin addiction	ALL! no sex, loss of menstrual period, severe edema and pain in legs and feet, severe weight gain, sweating, which did subside a little finally but comes back. sometimes nod off, get tolerant to the dosage and have to keep upping it, still having cravings	it keeps me off heroin...i want back on suboxone though. had to get on methadone cus of pregnancy. my baby is beautiful and healthy but i got treated like a homicidal convict in hospital bc of methadone. wouldnt even offer me a tylenol while in labor and delivery. doctors hate it and hate u for being on it.

5	Chronic migraine / neck injuries	The only side effect I've had is constipation.  40 mg per day were prescribed for me but I'm down to 10mg in a.m. and 10 mg in p.m.  I am quite pleased.		F	59	10  years	4/4/2008
5	fibromyalgia	Other than constipation, no side effects. High fiber diet helps. Some sweating initially--not enough to be bothersome.	I have had FMS/CFS for 10 yrs. A yr.ago I was about to lose it as I am unable to take enough vicodin or any other opiate without severe debilitating nausea. Also seemed to experience MORE muscle pain on opiates. Dolophine has truly changed my life; have my mind back! Also getting out & participating in life again! 5mg. 4xday works for me after a yr. Have had no need to increase dosage and, in fact, often forget to take it.  That's a first! Use to watch the clock for the next dose--no more! Forever grateful to my dr.for suggesting I take this med although I was horrified at the thought at first. That was stupid & showed a lack of info. I freely tell other sufferers to stop allowing pain to take over their lives. Still have pain but on a scale of 0-10 have gone from and 8/9 to a 4 unless I do too much. So it's up to me to monitor my activities & general health. Not easy for a type "A", but I'm learning.	F	68	13  months	1/20/2008
3	Chronic migraines=opiate dependance	The absolute worst side effects for me were severe sweating/ hot flashes and extreme weight gain. This is very troubling, considering that I used to be a thin and beautiful young woman. I went from 125 lbs(sz.4)(5'7") to about 200lbs (sz.18) in less than a year! I have never been an ounce over weight, or even at my ideal weight for that matter until going on methadone. On top of that, any time I ever get up and move around.. especially trying to get ready to leave the house.. I get incredibly hot and I sweat profusely, especially my head. By the time I shower,dry my hair, put on makeup and get dressed, my hair is soaked with sweat, and my makeup has run off.  It is terribly disturbing.  I have completely lost my self esteem, and cannot apologize to my husband enough for looking the way I do.  I would never have considered myself a vain person, but when you go from feeling great about the way you look to feeling ashamed and embarrassed to leave your house, it truly effects your lif	Tolerance built up quickly for me.  I have always had a high tolerance for opiates, and it was no different with methadone.  I felt the dose would only last for a couple of months before I would have to increase.  I think this med. worked very well for me when I was on the proper dose.  I didn't think obsessively about "taking my pills" all day long.Also, for me, the dose would definitely not "hold" for 24 hours with me.  I would have to end up taking an extra bump dose later in the evening.	F	28	20  months	12/11/2007

4	severe chronic  back pain	I recently came off the Fentynal patch (that is a tough to detoxdrug!) I went onto 120 mg of Methadone and although I hate the thought of being controlled by adrug I find that it helps the pain just enough and there is little euphoria.		M	52	6  months	10/1/2006

5	Chronic Pain in a Heroin Addict	Terribly low testosterone levels, slowed motor function, slowed thought process, tolerance.	Methadone, after several attempts, eventually allowed me to become Heroin-free since 11/2003.  An automobile accident resulted in the need for pain-management, so I'm currently titrating downward from 40mg Four times a day to 30mg three times a day (current) and eventually (hopefully with success) to 10mg four times a day, then switching to Suboxone.  I feel as if Methadone literally rescued me from the awful grip of Heroin, while allowing mild/moderate pain relief.	M	26	6  years	6/1/2006Email

4	Back Pain/Opiate Addiction	Daytime drowsiness, fatigue, loss of sex-drive, dry-mouth, mild insomnia at night, nausea, and visual disturbances	I am on 60mg per day.  At first they gave it to me all at once, but I was getting too tired during the day.  Now I take 20mg 3x a day.  Good drug for someone in my situation (pain and history of opiate abuse.) This is the first opiate I can take without taking more than I need. I get very little euphoria and if I take more than I am prescribed, I just get very tired. It does a good job with my back pain as well. For the first time, my prescription lasts me the whole month. That is unbelievable for someone like myself who loves opiates so much.
