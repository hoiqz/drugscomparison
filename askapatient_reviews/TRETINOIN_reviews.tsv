1	Acne on forehead.	Burning of face and peeling		F	15	3  weeks	1/5/2012
5	Moderate adult acne	Dry patches on U-zone of skin (chin and jawline) that became red, scaly, and covered with weird red bumps that were not pimples (hyrocortisone cream helped get rid of them). Some dry skin, peeling, flaking, and burning.	As a teen I never had an acne problem, but after going off the BC pill my face exploded with a constant stream of pimples, both painful deep and surface. Mostly they were in my T-zone but also some in my U-zone that were leaving nasty purple scars. I washed with salicylic acid 2x a day, used astringent once/day, washed my hair daily, changed my pillow cases often, stopped touching my face, stopped wearing foundation, etc. Nothing helped. Finally the Dr gave me generic Retin-A and it has done the trick. It gave me some nasty dry patches on my chin, but I stopped putting the cream there and hydrocortisone cream helped it clear. My forehead has never looked better! The cream tends to make me have small, unnoticeable blackheads instead of huge nasty pimples, and that's fine by me since they're small, discrete, and easier to pop. I use the cream at night on my forehead/nose after washing with Noxzema anti-bacterial cleanser and applying .5% salicylic acid astringent. I also use Noxzema cold cream in the afternoon daily as it really helps draw out the blackheads and dries out the rare whiteheads I encounter on my chin.	F	22	1  years.05% 1X D	8/29/2011
2	severe adult acne	My doctor prescribed a low dose of Retain A gel...that did nothing except make my skin Horribly dry. About 3 months later I was bumped up to a higher dosage, in creme form, the strongest one available shy of Accutane, and it's been 3 months, I'm not impressed at all.		F	25	6  months 1X D	6/23/2010

I just turned 38 and most people think i'm in my early 30's. still get asked for ID all the time. :)...BUT i have always taken good care of my skin and moisturized everyday since i was a teenager. i also tan during the summertime as well. (but don't use retin a before or while in the sun!). try and find a sunlock without vitamin a in it as well.(not good)	M	38	2  years.5mg 3X W	5/25/2010

2	acne	severe peeling, redness, burning, irritation, even left raw spots on my face, kind of like blisters	i was prescribed retin-a along with a benzoyl peroxide wash and wasnt very satisfied. after just one night, my skin was severely peeling and my face was getting painful raw spots everywhere. my doctor said the peeling would go away after 2 weeks but it hasnt for me. i was taking it for 5 months and during that time, my acne seemed to get worse instead of better and i dont like how long it takes to show improvement(about 3 months) when there are plenty of faster working medications out there. i wouldnt recommend retin-a to anyone.

3	Acne	None, clearing up a bit...even age spots!  Looking forward to the next couple months eliminating all my acne!  If you just use the pea size at night, I can't imagine anyone is "peeling & dry"...perhaps heed the phrase, "more is not better!"	Liking it after a month...looking forward to achieving more results!  Remember, a Pea size pearl a day.  Apply to gently cleansed face befor bedtime.	F	44	4  weeks	3/23/2008
5	acne	very bad peeling initially and increased breakouts	eventually cleared my face completly took about 3 months	F	24	1  years	2/15/2007
3	acne	First used this for acne as a teenager, and had wonderful results within a couple of weeks of nightly treatment.  Tried to go back on it as an adult some 10 years later for mild adult acne (very bad blackheads), and had lots of side effects in flaking and redness.  The first 5 weeks or so on it caused a lot of breakouts as it "pulls out" all the problems in your skin at once.	I do not think this should be used if you have rosacea, as I now do.   It would periodically cause a profound red "rash" all over the face, I suppose because it exfoliates so much.  However, on normal skin types I think it will work fine.  It did help a lot for the blackheads, but was not worth it in the long run due to the redness and tons of flaking.   I did not have rosacea when I was a teenager, and Retin A worked very well then.    It is expensive, though... about $50 a tube.  But if you have basic acne, it's worth it for the treatment!

When I first starting taking the Retin A Micro, I had peeling itchy raw skin, worse at times than others.  Finally at week 7 the itchy peeling skin and the redness was finally gone.  I did have a breakout at the beginning of week 8, but my skin tone is so much better than its ever been.  I'm hoping the breakout is just impurities still coming to the surface.  My freckles/age spots are fading a little.  I'm hoping that this is finally the beginning to beautiful skin		F	45	8  weeks.1% 1X D	6/14/2012Email

4	Acne, acne scaring, fine lines	Been on and off retina for months. Generally quit due to laziness and annoyance with red and peeling skin.  I have been using daily. And yea my skin is red and peeling and dry ... Looks like a slow chemical peel. Stating to see results. Cheeks are very smooth, no clogged nose pores, forehead skin tone is evening out. I am using this in conjunction with a hydroconique cream to bleach my dark scars.  Once I get through the first month my skin should lookGreat!  It also feels tight and fresh.

5	acne and scars	At the beginning, I experienced all the side effects - burning, itchiness, and a horrible initial breakout, worse than I had ever experienced before. Peeling was also a problem, especially if I wanted to wear makeup (which I did!).	It really works!!! If you're wondering if you should stick with it, do! It's worth it. The side effects are bad and depressing and it takes a while for it to work (2 months is a blatant lie, it's more like 9-12 months before you see actual improvement!)But, you stop breaking out and all the dark red spots and scars get less and less visible every day. I can now wear no makeup on my face going out and it's the best feeling ever. And I had it bad! Give it 1 year! I promise it'll work and your face will look better than ever!

5	To smooth skin/get fresh look	Mild peeling in the first couple of weeks.	I love, love, love this product.  I don't have acne or scarring but love the results of a cell/skin renewal product so I took it to the next level with a prescription strength.  I saw my 40 year old dertmatolgist's skin and loved it - so fresh looking.  I asked what she used and she said Retin-A micro.  She said a lot of dermatologists use it themselves.  I get compliments all the time and two co-workers now use it.  I'm hooked.	F	43	2  years 1X D	3/21/2012Email
1	Cystic Acne	Burning, itching	pretty weak considering the cost. takes forever for any noticable difference on severe acne, would have to take for years to clear worst of it, by then your skin would be so raw it wouldn't be worth it.the main problem with retin-a is that its topical and cannot penetrate your pores deep enough to clear cysic acne, just surface acne.if your acne is very mild to moderate retin a may be sufficient, but if its severe you will be disappointed.

4	Acne	Brief dryness patches at first, but suddenly around 4 weeks had horrible micro bumps then peeling of entire face (still occuring now).	I used retin a micro a few years ago when my acne first got bad (age 19.)  I went through bad initial break out ( I had moderate inflammed acne to begin with) but once it was over I had glowing white skin.  I used for 2 years, but then stopped when I ran out of prescription and was too lazy to refill, and because I was experiencing very clear skin.  4 months later I started to have hormonal breakouts again and just unreliable skin in general.  I have restarted using retin a 0.04% because I know it will work for me again.  Weeks 1-3 I had the same minor break outs I was having before starting, and minor dry skin patches that I could slough off with wet rag.  However, starting week 4, I experienced an entire burning of the skin, practically over night, and have no idea why....I am very meticulous about how much I use and about waiting at least 30 minutes after washing face to use.  I usually take 1 night a week off as well to just readjust to the side effects.  This recent dryness has been unexpected and because of that it's hard to deal with mentally! But I know it'll work out--just takes some time.  Anyone going through this try not to fret!  It will give you glowing skin.  When I finally do have results, I will be putting online a full log with pictures of almost every 2 days of my progress to help those going through first rough 3 months : )  Look forward to it!

3	Acne-mild	Horrible peeling, flakey-ness, redness, almost like raw skin especially around my mouth, hasn't really "cured" my acne yet. I am hoping it will, along with my oral antibiotics. It also made me very nauseous and gave me head aches the first week and a half. If retin-a does not help my acne with 3 more weeks of use (which will be 12 weeks), I am praying my derm. will give me accutane.		F	19	9  weekspea size 1X D	8/4/2011
5	moderate acne, acne scars	peeling, redness, dryness, itchiness	I had moderate acne, but dreadful post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and light acne scarring, which plagued me for years before my parents finally sanctioned a visit to the dermo. I started Yaz about a month before, and my doc started a course of doxycycline 100 mg 2x daily, and retin-a micro 1x daily. My skin had a very light initial rxn to both the topical and oral treatments within the first week, but nothing awful. Then my skin started flaking horribly, and more sensitive skin areas become frightfully red and dry and peely, as if I got a sunburn and it was healing. This cleared quickly, leaving newer, brighter skin in its wake, but this still happens from time to time, revealing nicer skin each time. I never had an awful initial breakout (at least, not yet!), but I still get a pimple every couple of days that is gone by the next day, with v. little PIH. My acne is now light, my PIH and (light-to-begin-with) scars are starting to fade. I flake occasionally, but nothing intolerable, and my skin is SO smooth, even the places to which I have not applied the retin-a micro. I hope it keeps getting better, and doesn't come back once I stop, because it's been very nice clearing the ghost-like PIH that's been haunting my otherwise porcelain skin for so long.

3		Very dry skin and peeling.   I usually tend to put too much on though.  It's not to bad if you get a good moisturizer.  It seemed to work really well now but now I haven't seen significant results and I am considering Accutane.   For the people who complain about their acne getting worse, thats what its suppose to do.  It makes all the acne thats inside come to the surface.  No matter what you will eventually get the pimples, Retin-A just makes them come out quicker and go away faster.  Most pimples you have, have developed for about a month before its visible.  Thats why most acne medicine makes it seem as if your acne is getting worse but it' really is getting better		M	19	90  days 1X D	5/4/2011
3	For non comedonal acne	Flaky skin, dryness, oily skin just on my nose, painful skin texture	I'm just finishing up my first month of this, so im still in the uncomfortable stage of peeling, flakiness, dry skin and breakouts. It was okay the first week  but once the second week came around it's gotten really bad. If I don't wear makeup my skin is shiny from all the moisturizer I need to compensate for the dry skin, but if I do wear makeup I get a lot of flakes and it just does not go on my face well/looks strange. I have noticed improvement in a weird unexplainable way, which is why im sticking with it. I hope to see some good noticeable and describable results within the next few weeks. I've tried it all so the negative side effects of this are fine for me if I Wang the great results I so often read about. Will update in a few weeks. Crossing my fingers..	F	20	  1X D	3/28/2011
3	Moderate acne w cystic,hyperpigment	Initial breakout, delicate skin (accidental scars),then horrible breakout, has broken up hyperpigmentation and is making skin lighter	I've had hormognal acne since age 22.Started RA a year ago and had great results on my chin and jawline where I'd had cystic acne within two weeks. However, the rest of my skin (mostly cheeks)were horribly broken out and it left scars.After 2 mo's I stopped using it but continued on jawline. Jawline looks flawless.Decided to give RA a try again because I read a lot of people's cheeks can't handle RA daily. Now day 42: (taking every other day)within last few days, my cheeks are now broken out with a few cysts and several small bumps but nothing looks like it's coming to the surface, and I'm not peeling yet.  Did anyone else peel so late? Is it weird nothing is coming to the surface yet? Did people get cystic acne after taking this? Please help!:)	F	28	43  days.04% 1X D	3/24/2011Email
4	wrinkles, pigmentation, acne	Redness, itchyness, flakyness and dryness.	I think it's working but my dermatologist said to be patient with it because to get the full effect it can take several months. Initially I told him I wanted something for pigmentation/sun spots/wrinkles and therefor he prescribed me retin a micro 0.04. He also said it works on controling acne. Everyday I use sunblock(SPF 30-Eucerin or Aveeno). And I use cetaphil daily facial cleanser every night. I have to invest in a good moisturizer to use at night and/or day.

5	Moderate Acne	Initial peeling, Initial break out	Hello, I have been dealing with acne problems since teenager. I had severe acne during my teenage. Later in my early 20's, I spent lot of money on microderma, facials and other acne control products. I did not visit any dermatologists as I had no faith in them. I think this was the biggest mistake I did. In my 20's, I had moderate acne. I decided to visit derm for acne problem and she prescribed me a topical cream(antibiotic) in am and Retin A micro gel 0.04 in pm. And i switched to cereve cream and face wash since then. First week, i had lot of peeling. 2nd week, my skin felt very soft and was glowing. 3rd week onwards, I got my worst ever break outs. These break outs were very different from the once i used to get, they were bumpy, reddish and took more time to fade. In my case the intial break out lasted exactly from 3rd week to 12th week. I got around 3 new acnes every week. The last set of acnes were in 12th week. After 3 months, Initial break out stopped and my skin is more soft and smooth. Retin A also helped improve my complexion and removed all those ugly comedons. I am glad i stuck to the cream and I will always. I hope my review was helpful. My advise is to stick to this cream, it will definitely work.	F	26	6  months 1X D	3/21/2011
5	acne	I initially experienced some redness, peeling and worsening of acne when I began using the Retin-A in March 2010. Since, my acne has almost completely cleared, I would say it's helped about 85%. My dermatologist has suggested I try the .1% to get to the 100% mark. So, we'll see how that goes.

5	moderate acne	Peeling, new breakouts, redness	for the first week my skin peeled around my mouth and chin.  Then, I got some new pimples on my forehead and jawline.

1	Cystic Adult Acne	Redness, severe itchiness, painful burning, worse acne, tender skin, peeling	My dermatologist kept saying to be patient with Retin-A, but I only got worse month after month. Eventually the burning and itching got so bad that I stopped using it, because it was too painful to keep up. In retrospect, I would not have trusted the dermatologist so long, and I think she is an awful physician's assistant. Retin-A was not right for me; I have very sensitive skin. Now my skin has many red scar marks and looks worse than it ever has, and I truly hope the marks fade over time.	F	26	6  months 2X D	1/30/2011
5	Acne	The only side effects I experienced were in the very beginning with mild peeling and a slight worsening of my acne. Even now it still makes me peel a little sometimes but oil free Neutrogena moisturizer helps a lot.	I take Duac Topical Gel in the morning and the Retin-A at night. I also use Neutrogena face wash and moisturizer, and my skin is practically flawless.  I've had terrible acne since I was only nine years old, and I've tried all sorts of acne fighting cocktails.  Retin-A has done the best and I have no desire to change. I have experienced no serious side effects and I am very happy with the results I've received over the years.

4	Moderate acne, scarring	I have been struggling with acne for about 6 years, I'm 20 now. I've been on proactive, benzaclin, tetracycline, and STILL the acne won't go away and I get breakouts, so I visited derm and he prescribed retin-a micro. First day I used it, no problems, it felt like a normal cream, but a couple of hours later, my skin started to REALLY sting, and I looked in the mirror and I was red and itchy, anyways this went on for a day or two, and then I basically started to peel everywhere I used the medication. At first I thought I had done something wrong and messed up, but after researching I found out this is common for initial retin-a-micro users, so I stuck with it and continued using daily, once in the morning and once before bed. About 4 days into the medication I noticed bumps and acne on my face subsided greatly, but the peeling and slight stinging still occured, but the pain was MUCH MUCH less on the fourth day, I'm gonna keep using this and see what happens, so far it went REALLY bad on		M	20	1  weeks50g 2X D	12/27/2010

Like most patients I broke out heavily when I began my acne regimen of a prescribed cream in the am and Retin-A Micro in the evening.  I followed my dermatologist's advice "to the t" and 5-6 months later my skin has cleared up significantly.  My skin is practically flawless (I get an occasional small pimple or two that I spot treat with "Eradi Kate" from Sephora).  I also went through years of trying several other products with no long term results; these include: Proactiv, Murad, Acne Free, Hauschka, Dove and other acne targeted washes.  I'd recommend Retin-A to anyone with moderate to severe acne who is looking for long term results and a healthy, smooth and glowing complexion!	F	28	 0.1 1X D	12/2/2010

5	Moderate-Severe Acne	Break outs, peeling.	So I've been taking Retin-A Micro for about a month and 3 weeks. The first month was really bad. I battled a lot of breakouts and it wasn't just ugly they were extremely uncomfortable breakouts. After that first month I started to clear up back to normal (prior to use) at about a month and a week. And now, two weeks later, I'm completely acne free. Let me put that into perspective. I have tried everything, tetracycline, benzaclin, differin, Proactive, Murad, AcneFree, etc, etc and I have never uttered the words "ance free" in SEVEN YEARS! The last time my face was this clear, I was 14, and I'm now 21. But it gets even better and better up to six months...... I still have scars but they're slowly fading as well. I'm very excited and hope this review helped. You must wait at least 3 months to pass judgement btw.	M	21	51  days.1 1X D	8/18/2010Email
5	acne, hyperpigmentation (scars)	severe breakouts, stinging, burning around eyes, severe dryness	I was dealing with pretty bad adult-onset acne. My dermo started me on .025 mg which didn't work very well. Within a few weeks, like most people, I had an awful breakout all over my face, chest and back. I was SO discouraged but I stuck it  out because I had read the comments on this website. The acne got better but not great. My dermo upped the mg to .05 and that is when I started seeing a difference. It makes my skin REALLY dry, so I started using some Cetaphil lotion, SPF 50 which works GREAT. I've been on the .05 for about 6 weeks now and my skin is radiant. I get compliments on it ALL THE TIME, people saying they wish they had skin like mine, that my skin looks like porcelain, etc. I'm so glad I stuck with it. Really, the first month or so sucks, it really does - but if you stick it out, it will work!	F	32	5  months.05 1X D	8/8/2010

2	Acne	Like all other topicals, Retin A AND Azaelic acid AND Clindamycin etc. etc. etc., Retin-A micro irritated my skin and made it break out in keratosis pilaris bumps after just three days.	I think retin-A micro is a good option for people with normal skin, but for people with sensitive, easily irritated skin like mine, Retin-A micro might just make your skin worse. However, if you have insurance that will cover it, you might as well try it and see if it works for you. Or get a freesample from your derm. Try  patch test first on the underside of your chin or on the sides of your face. Use it for 2-3 days there and see if you have a bad reaction before applying it elswhere on your face.

1	Had few pimples	Burning, itching, many more new pimples, acne worsened, face became red, peeling.	This product only created more acne for me. I have not seen any reason for me to continue using it. I lasted the full 7 weeks, which were the worst 7 weeks ever.	M	15	7  weeks.04% 1X D	7/28/2010
3	ACNE	Hi every one wondering ! Im a licensed esthetician.. Heres my experience ...Peeling , reddnes, Acne got worse then ive ever had acne before looked like milia all over my entire face ...The first 4 weeks i didn't want to leave the house!  Now about on the 6th week im starting to clear up :) ps.. used cetaphil face was first 2 weeks.	One. Your skin will be very dry, dehydrated find a good moisturizer , with me i couldnt use one but every few days, or id break out worse but make sure ur staying hydrated! Drink lots of water, take omega 3's , and choose a good toner (aveda dry skin ) That can be used through out the day and helps hide the flakes.  Also never pull off the flakes gently exfoliate with ur fingers in the shower :).Two. After your face gets a lil used to retin A's peeling (2weeks) add in benzoyl peroxide wash 5% is good twice a day and possibly advance to a gel if still needed Remember these two will work together very well but dont rush it ! If needed an antibiotic might do you well try solodyn, similar to doxycycline yet this drug allows sun sexposure :). Sun block is a must yet it breaks me out :/ Remeber this is one of the most important to remember if ur out but u a cute visor i know thats difficult!, untill your face is ready to tolerate the spf's as well.  This is alot yes but hey how long did you have acne its not gonna go away in a day :( I say give it 2 months no change u may need something differnt. THREE....Do not pick at your bump's what so ever they can even turn into blisters retin a is making your skin very thin..you dont want to rip your skin and have to make your body work even harder to repair it. I know its hard jus dont eventually what will happen is youll wake up one morning and litrally youll be able to wash it away..

5	Acne	None so far.	Alright, I just started yesterday and from reading the reviews before hand I got a hold of a couple things to ensure success. Most of the reviews I read of people taking it at least 3 months said they experienced much worse acne before it got better. Because of this I'm using the thinnest layer possible for the first two weeks so that maybe my skin can get acclimated without the break outs.  Many said they experience peeling as well. So, I got Olay moisture, 100 SPF sunblock, and a gentle moisturizer/cleanser. I'll be updating my rating in 3 months time. Good luck everybody.	M	21	1  days1g 1X D	7/1/2010Email
1	Acne	Skin dry, pealing, bright red	I stayed on Retin a micro for over 3 months and it did not help at all. I had mild acne before using it and now i have moderate acne with terrible scars. My Derm. was not helpful during the process so we changed doctors. At my first appointment the new derm. told me that the gel should have worked by now(4 months) and put me on a new cream. Taking retin a micro was probably the worst decision of my life and i still regret it to this day.	F	16	3  months.1 % 1X D	6/15/2010

5	mild acne	redness, peeling, burning upon application, acne got worse for a couple weeks	I actually was on retin a micro when I was a sophomore in high school (about 5 years ago). My skin constantly peeled, stayed red, and acne got worse in the beginning weeks, peeling and redness continued for 2 months but after the break out period my face completely cleared up and I stayed on the medication until I ran out. My face was clear for about a year without using anything. Then over the past 4 years it's worked itself back up to a mild case and I have decided to try it again, hopefully the starting weeks won't be as bad as i remember!	F	21	8  months.04 1X D	4/21/2010

Within the first 2 weeks, the worst pimples of my life started coming up along with severe dryness. By week 7, the acne finally subsided and my skin under the flaking looked brand new! Now 4 months later, I still use the gel at night along with a gentle cleanser and moisturizer day and night. AND I'm finally getting complimented on how pretty my skin is. It's important to stick to it, even when everyone is telling you to stop---don't listen!	F	28	4  months 1X D	2/26/2010
4	acne	PEELING PEELING AND MORE PEELING	I started this topical treatment 1 week ago. I had a few acne bumps on each cheek. Within the first day those bumps were all gone. I still have bumps but i know they will clear up in a couple of moths. I am serious DREADING the "big breakout" but i'm gonna stick it out. I really recommend this product so far. I use cetaphil as a face was and i have a cetaphil sunsceen moisturizer that i use when i go out into the sun, and i also have another normal cetaphil moisturizer for sensitive skin which works wonders.. They both have really helped with the peeling which kicked in on day 3. Wish me luck!!	F	15	1  weeks 1X D	2/22/2010
4	Acne	Peeling for the first 2-3 months... learned to keep my face moisturized and always use gentle cleansers(I use Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Bar and Creme) and I have no problems.	In the beginning, my face peeled daily for the first 2-3 months and it was a bit annoying but I continued using it nightly along with Duac during the day. Now I still use it nightly along with Aczone during the day and Doryx pill once a day and my skin is basically clear for the most part. I still get the hormonal pimples but that lasts a week or two and never severe anymore. It just takes time, but it's worth it when you stick it out. It's best to use a heavier moisturizer as well, I use Cetaphil Creme twice a day and it's amazing... your skin will be uncomfortable if you put Retin-a-micro on it if it's dry, so lotion up!

4	persistent, moderate acne	redness, peeling, flaking, skin sensitivity, minor headaches,	i have had persistent, mild-serious acne since i was 13 y/o.  my dermatologist put me on my first round of accutane back in april of 2008 for 6 months, but i relapsed after 2 months and started another round in january of 2009 for 7 months.  after another 2 months i relapsed and decided to try topical retin-a micro.  it's true what they say...the side effects, the flare ups, the sensitivity and discomfort; HOWEVER, after 2 months, i am definitely beginning to see results when i thought it would never come.  you HAVE to stay persistent no matter how embarrassing or uncomfortable your skin gets (but if after 3 months you see NO results, you should see your dermatologist again).  i'm not 100% clear just yet but i really think another month of retin-a micro applied all over my face at night will get me back to my good ol' accutane days when i didn't have a single bump on my face.  don't get discouraged when you break out even more.  just treat your skin gently, moisturize, stay away from the sun, drink plenty of fluids (green/chamomile tea), DO NOT pick your skin AT ALL, gently exfoliate the dead skin with your fingertips while in the shower, and wait...the results will come and it's worth it.

4	mild acne, enlarged pores	experienced the worst break outs of my entire life, red, flaky, peeling (similar to the worst sunburn of your life).	I have been working on my skin for over 5 years and have been on everything, this is the ONLY thing that has really helped. You have to be PATIENT and stick with it, your acne will get so much worse before it gets better... first 3 months are the hardest I have seen AMAZING results but have a few mild scars.

4	hormonal chin acne	burning, stinging, alot of flaking and peeling, redness	I never broke out before and this year, I was faced with lots of hormonal breakouts. I would get breakouts mainly on my chin and it would take months to go away and would leave heavy scarring. I was so fed up with breaking out so much that my sister recommended retin-a micro. She used that medication when she was going through her breakout phase. I used it and during the first two weeks, my skin looked awful! I couldn't even go out in public because my skin was so red! I was really depressed and I was about to give up but then I decided to stick it out. It's been about 4 weeks now and my skin around my chin was improved by 50 percent. My red marks are fading slowly and I can't wait to see how it looks like in the next couple of weeks and months. I still have red marks left but they are fading!	F	22	30  days	1/2/2010Email

I'm worried I applied too little.. but everyone seems to be saying 'a little goes a long way' so I'm hoping it's just my skin not being too sensitive. I've heard lots of great things about this product and am hoping it'll help me as well (: But I am kind of worried.. why am I not having any side effects?!?!		F	18	1  days	12/17/2009Email
3	acne	redness, dryness, burning, itching, peeling	I just don't know about this drug... Two weeks into the treatment, I had the worst break-out of my life. Although it has improved (somewhat), it's still not good. PLUS now I have redness and flaky skin. Someone at work came into my office yesterday and said, 'What happened to your face? It's all red.' So I don't know if that's a real improvement. Of course, the doctor never warned me that (1) the drug takes a while, (2) it causes break-outs early-on, and (3) it's very hard on sensitive skin. (I *have* started using a noncomedogenic moisturizer -- which helps.) I would have waited until AFTER the holidays if I'd known how bad it was going to make me look... I will definitely not feel good about seeing friends and relatives looking like this. So beware.	M	38	4  weeks	12/8/2009

3	Acne; esp. on jaw line and neck	I am using retin a micro 1% and am on day 5 and my face is burning and very painful. I am peeling everywhere except my cheeks. I have very oily skin and have suffered from acne since I was a teen. I am really hoping this works, since I am now 34 and feel very embarrased that I have to still deal with acne. This is the worst my acne has ever been (before using retin a micro)and now it seems to have prevented any new ones from forming, which is great but my skin is very painful.	Does anyone have any suggestions for a face wash that would be gentle? Sometimes I need to wash my face 3 times a day because it is so oily esp. in the summer months. When I wash my face, it burns while I am washing and very tight after I pat it dry. I am also looking for a moisturizer to apply after (during the day)most scented stuff burns when I put on my skin and does not help with the peeling skin. OUCH!!!	F	34	5  days	8/22/2009Email

I have been using this product for 4 weeks and the first few days were tough.  I experienced severe burning, which made it difficult to even fall asleep.  This only happened for the first 4 days, no real discomfort now.  My skin has more of a pink undertone and appears a little oilier but I have not had a breakout since.  I also use a Benzoyl Peroxide wash, wash my face with a Clarisonic brush (the best $200 investment I could have ever made and highly recommend it) and get a microdermabrasion once a month.  For the last 3 weeks I have not experienced any discomfort. No peeling nor dryness, if anything, my skin seems a little oilier but the acne has cleared up nicely.  It's only been a month, I can't wait to see my results after the full 7-8 weeks!	F	31	1  months	8/13/2009

I'll admit it improved my mood somewhat, but I was waking as early as 3am and feeling very restless (at first the medication made me drowsy but the longer I was on it the earlier I would wake up).

While my mood is better and my anger issues are nearly non-existent now, I'm finding I'm still a bit hypomanic and the Abilify creates extreme restlessness in me.  While my house has never looked better and I'm getting lots of project done, I find I can't sit still for longer than 10 minutes and by the end of the day my feet ache for being on them so long running around in the house and doing all my projects.	Together with Depakote.  Doc now prescribing propranolol for agitation/restlessness/irritability - would rather prescribe additional med for side effect than change primary meds...and I agree with his decision.

This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds.

4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out!

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie).

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months.

2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011

3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed.

Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight.

3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email
2	depression/ insomnia	temperature change ever so often, have been feeling like im going to faint the room feels like its spinning. helped with the depression, but did nothing for the insomnia toss and turn all night feels like my joints in my legs hurt. hip just started hurting. makes me feel weird.   i think i gained weight but everybody says i look the same.	if i had a choice i would not take it, i would try and get prescribed some thing else that's just for me it may work for other people a different way.

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

5	bipolar	askithia	This medicine has been great but I have started to feel a side effect of my mouth twitching back and forth. I am worried this will be permanent. Will talk to doc about this.	F	35	5  years20 mg 1X D	11/20/2010Email
3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email
5	depression	none - maybe weight gain as is with everything it seems	Just a small increase recently really pulled me out of a slump	F	54	 20 mg 1X D	10/23/2010Email
5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

3	Bipolar I	Increase in appetite (gained 2 lbs in 2 weeks), GI upset initially, migraines so bad had to discontinue it	I'm bipolar with mixed states. After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated. Who knows if it "helped my depression" because it made me an absolute basket case!	F	21	14  days2.5 mg 1X D	9/27/2010
2	GAD	RAVENOUS, INSATIABLE HUNGER!!!!	When I see my Doc I have to tell him I MUST come off this med or I will be the size of a house in a month!	M	33	2  weeks 1X D	9/25/2010
2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).	F	42	16  months30 mg 1X D	9/7/2010
3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.	F	35	4  weeks15 MG 1X D	8/29/2010Email
5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.
