5	Hypothyroid	Mild increase in heart rate for first 20 minutes.	After 13 years of Synthroid only (total thyroidectomy) I feel like my old self.  I've cried countless tears in the last week....tears of joy.  Lab were always "normal" but I always complained of not feeling sharp, happy, capable, friendly, kind to family/friends etc.  My career is back on track.  I take 137 mcg Synthroid which is still excedingly valuable to keep a nice base, then this Cytomel bump to get me the rest of the way back to myself.  Otherwise I get too cold at night when the Cytomel wears off; fyi, it only is in your system for 6-8 hours, then it's gone.  Thank you Jesus.	M	41	6  days2.5 mcg 3X D	3/25/2013Email

5	Hashimoto's	Mostly none but sometimes feel very slightly shaky "inside"  but with no outward display of shakiness.	Absolute miracle for me. I take 25 mcg on waking and 12.5 around noon (or six hours later).  Without the second dose I'm tired and become negative/slightly depressed. After years of wondering what was wrong with me, I now think I was hypothyroid for a long time, maybe 20 years. I am a different person, more alert (no more brain fog), more confident, with much more stamina and energy, losing weight I couldn't lose no matter what. I don't feel like hiding anymore. Am taking Paddock brand.	F	64	120  days37.5mcg 1X D	12/16/2012Email
5	sythroid levels were too high	only positive effects,  more energy, clear thinking, no more constipation, no more headaches, skin improvement,  no need for afternoon naps.  great addition to synthyroid., as the synthyroid alone did nothing for my hypo symptoms.		F	52	60  days12.5 3X D	8/18/2012
4	weight gain, bery tired and sluggis	A lot of energy and very hungry. I eat what I want and haven't gained any or lost any weight.  I do have a problem falling and staying asleep once in awhile but after having a few alcoholic drinks,  I might as well forget about sleeping. Feel very alert. Sometimes I feel shaky but it goes away after I eat. I like cytomel a lot better than synthroid.		F	28	3  weeks5 mcg 2x d	7/8/2012
1	Possible hypothyroidism	Note:  Generic Cytomel.  Hot flashes and heat intolerance, increased body temp including one or more fevers.  First three days, seemed to feel more optimistic.  Then for most of past 23 days, irritable, feeling "not right," crying for hours and feeling hopelessly depressed, unable to eat.  Getting levels checked today and hope to stop taking it.	Been feeling so bad emotionally and unlike myself, but it took me a while to connect it to the Mylan generic drug.  It's definitely not for me or the generic is no good.  In past learned generic drugs often are dissimilar to the brand names.	F	61	26  days5 mg 2X D	5/29/2012Email
5	Hypothyroidism	I take 88 mcg Synthroid every day and 5 mcg Cytomel 3x per day (15 mcg a day.) My endo told me to space the dosage of Cytomel every 5 hours - EX: 8:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m. None!!!	I take 88 mcg of Synthroid every day and 5 mcg Cytomel 3x a day (15 mcg a day.) I space my doses out  as follows : Synthroid - 6:00 a.m. Cytomel - 8:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m. This is perfect for me. I began taking 5 mcg a day and slowly moved up to 15 after about 5 months. I didn't do well on Synthroid alone. Cytomel suppresses TSH, but my endo says that TSH can be meaningless after treatment has begun and he doses based on free t4 and free t3 levels and how I'm feeling. I feel fantastic! No more brain fog and exhaustion. Cytomel completely stopped my hair loss and now it is full and healthy again. This medication totally changed my life and made me feel healthy again.

3	Hypo/hyper thyroidism	Feel back to normal after morning dose of 5mg, more energy, clarity.	I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism at 28 yes old after my second child was born.  Was put on 100 mg of levithroid for 15 years with very minimal dosage adjustments.  I did great on it.  In 2009, all hell broke loose with my hormones.  Went into perimenopause and my thyroid was out of whack.  For 3 years I have been suffering with dizziness, fatigue, weight gain, heart palps, irregular periods and horrible pms.  Saw a homeapathic hormone specialist the last year and she has been tweaking my thyroid as it keeps fluctuating from high t4to low t3 and reverse t3.  She put me on a high dose of t3 compound, for 10 months I was fine on it but the last month has been complete HELL with major fatigue dizziness and heart palps and anxiety attacks.  Was finally referred to an endocronolgist from my regular insurance just this week.  She put me on 3 days (taper down) of cytomel twice a day 50 mg to 10 mg.  Starting 150 levithroid tomorrow once daily.  The cytomel feels like a burst of energy to me for about 5 hours, then I plummet into extreme fatigue again be foe my second dose.   I hope starting back on the levithroid will balance things back again.  I want my life back again.	F	45	3  days10 2X D	4/29/2012Email
1		At first, my levels were a little on the low side, so my doctor put me on 5 mcg cytomel. After only 1 week she checked my blood again and said that there was no change. I thought this was weird because usually you wait 3 weeks after starting a new medication. She bumped me up to 25mcg. I was on the small side (120, 5'6'') and I thought that was quite a jump. Well after 3 weeks on 25mcg, I have INTENSE chest pains, and diffeculty breathing. And now I am only 112 lbs. My endo told me to stop it right away. I am now on the hyper end for my thyroid, and my endo wants to put me on synthroid. I do not understand this at all seeing as his a hormone replacement, and if my levels are already high, why would he want to give me more? This is the 3rd doctor that has tried to do this to me here. I just feel like death everyday. In and out of the ER. I wish I would have just went with my gut feeling and only took a half instead of the full 25mcg. I trusted doctors with my life, as you should be able		F	25	21  days25 mcg 1X D	4/10/2012Email
1	my doctor is playing with my meds	I have a doctor appt this friday, but might just go off this horrible med myself. I have suffered Thyroid issues for 30 years. The ONLY drug that has ever helped me is Armour. Which in December I was fine on Armour, had NO Side effects, numbers were in the low normal range, but I FELT FINE. My doctor went to some conference, changed all his patients, and now I feel like a handicapped person. The pain in my legs, joint pain, stiffness, feeling like my knees are going to crumble and give out on me is HORRIBLE!! I am depressed, cry every day, and I am miserable !! I HATE cytomel and do not suggest if for everyone. By the way, I am very angry at my doctor for playing with my meds. IF you are a doctor out there reading this, listen to your patients symptoms first before deciding what is the right course of action. I was fine on Armour and never should have been taken off.

5	hypothyroidism	occasional headaches	I felt horrible on T4 alone but since T3 was added, I feel great, have lost 9 lb (in 3 wks) and my mood has entirely improved. I also suffer from low progesterone so I have been taking DHEA and Prometrium as well.	F	32	3  weeks2.5 mcg 1X D	3/21/2012Email
5	Hypothyroid	Cytomel in combination with T4 has been extremely helpful to me. But I also made sure that I was taking vitamins that supported my thyroid including magnesium, iodine, B vitamins and most importantly a good multi-vitamin and Vitamin D. Most of my research shows that a good endocrinologist will treat with a combination on T3 and T4. If yours is saying no, and you don't feel good on T4 alone, demand that they let you try the T3. If they still say no, write the head of the hospital where they work, or find another doctor. It is your life! Make sure you feel good and demand answers if you don't!

2	Hypothyroidism (Low Thyroid)	Generic version (12.5 mcg  half of a 25 mcg. Tablet)  Experienced fatigue and sleepiness along with some very slight burning in my nostrils.  I also felt a little foggy-minded and dizzy.	I don't think I even needed this and that the initial fatigue I had with the Levoxyl was due to my body having to take the time to convert the T4 to T3 (since I stopped the Armour Thyroid and it had T3 in it already).  [Note:  I was taking Armour Thyroid prior to this and it didn't seem to do much].	M	49	7  days12.5 mcg 1X D	3/5/2012
1	Depression	Tremor, forgetfulness, slight weight gain, really messed up thyroid, shortness of breath	I recently went to my primary doctor for my quarterly checkup and he told me that when he saw my blood tests, they read that my thyroid was "really out of whack" and recommended I stop taking it. He was also going to send the recommendation to my psychiatrist. I took his advice, threw the remaining pills down the toilet and will seek an adjunct antidepressant. It also did nothing for my depression anyway.	F	48	3  months25 1X D	12/24/2011Email
2	hypothyroid; reduced T3	Started at 1/day and had increased appetite and weight gain-- 5lbs the first week.  My MD told me to up to two times a day if I wasn't feeling relief from my symptoms(always cold, tired etc) and I did that about 3 weeks ago.  My appetite normalized BUT I have gained about 8 pounds in 6 wks.  I still feel cold, tired and "brain fogged".		F	34	45  days5mcg 2X D	10/15/2011Email
5	Hypothyroid, Deppression, & Fatigue	Much less Agitation and nervousness than in the past so far	My personal experience has shown me that the benefits of taking T-3 far outweigh of side effects of T-4, If T-3 is started at very low doses (5 mcg) and is gradually increased over 2- 3 Months. I remember what the agitation was like when I tried to increase my dose to 25 mcg. of T-3 too quickly. I started my dosage at 5 mcg/day and then up to 5x day at 3 to 5 hour intervals. I then increased my dosages up to 10 mcg 3X day. Sometimes the afternoon doses can be reduced to 5 mcg.for the entire day. For about a year, I needed 30 to 35 mcg. of T-3 a day to prevent real nasty depression and to avoid memory loss associated with Hypothroid. Thyroid Resistance may be the issue in my case. I've been very blessed in the last 3 days in that I seem to be holding out on just 15 mcg/day(5mcg at 7:00, 11;00 & 3:00) believe that it's possible for some people on thyroid medication to have more complications with T-4 than T-3. You might want to check out Dr. Lowe's website regarding this: http://www.drlowe.com/ If you find that T-3 works better than T-4, you will probably eventually have a suppressed TSH(in taking at least 25 mcg. which is normal & temporary although endocrinologists don't like the notion  When taking T-3, you really have to adjust your dose and ask yourself which is worse: a little nervousness or more depression, poor memory& focus?  Very small amounts of the right tranquilizers can offset the nervousness.I am only partially in agreement with Wilson's Temperature	M	62	16  months5mcg 3X D	9/22/2011EmailHistory
4	Depression	Perhaps increased appetite	This is an update to when I first started taking Cytomel and experienced extreme anxiety. That has abated, thankfully, and I'm 150mcg synthroid and 25 mg Cytomel. It hasn't quite cleared up my depression yet, nor my afternoon fatigue, but at least I can get out of bed in the morning. I'd give it a 5 if my depression and fatigue were licked; maybe I need to give it more time.	F	48	2  months25 1X D	9/17/2011Email
4	Hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue	Blood pressure increased.	Finally I have some energy and brain fog is reduced after adding 15 mcg cytomel to  50mcg dose of synthroid. On synthroid alone my labs looked good, but I felt tired and foggy-headed. Cytomel reduces that tired foggy-headed feeling. My blood pressure got high when I experimented with a 25mcg dose of cytomel, so went back down to 15 mcg which is bringing my blood pressure down some.	F	53	2  years15mcg 1X D	9/7/2011Email
5	Depression	Felt a bit nervousness/increased anxiety at the start (first 2 days). Adjusted med (5mcgs)to take 1/2 pill in the am and the other 1/2 in the pm and this helped decrease side effects. Slight nausea, but this two subsided.	It's done wonders for me. On the third day, I felt more alive. I'm actually getting used to feeling so good since it has been awhile- I know that sounds "odd" but after feeling lousy for so long, it is an adjustment!	F	39	1  weeks5mcgs 1X D	8/18/2011
5	Severe Depression	Slight anxiety upon starting. Small dose of diazepam helped.	This is truly a miracle drug. Have tried (literally) every SSRI, SNRI, MAOI, RIMA, Tricyclic antidepressant medication ever made over ten years.  None of them helped me. Cytomel made my depression disappear in two days. It was like someone turned on the life switch. My thyroid tests were normal, and remain normal. Do not start this drug higher than 5 mcg's! That's "micrograms." move to 10 mcg's maximum for depression. You will feel what it is like to be alive for the first time in your life. Normally "alive", not medicated numb by useless antidepressants. Thank you Cytomel!	M	39	6  months5 MCG 2X D	7/29/2011
2	To augment Wellbutrin	ANXIETY!!!!!!!!!	It may have been because my pdoc didn't reduce my dosage of Synthroid, which is 150mcg, but the first time I took 25mcg it did absolutely nothing. The second time I took it, it took eight valium tablets, four propranolol tablets and four over the counter sleep pills to even begin to calm me down. After that I slept forever, but I was up at 1 this morning and, like a fool, took another pill and went through this all over again. How long does this last? Can I cut the pills in half? Can I take them later in the day? I was so counting on this to help me with my treatment-resistant depression because I had tried everything and my bed and pillow have become my best friends.

1	RT3 issues	Horrible, anxiety, depression, crying, feel out of control emotionally. Panicky, feeling very sweaty and over heating. very rapid pulse, high b/p swollen feet and hands. headaches. all this on only 2 days on this drug. I thought it was going to be a miracle drug for my severe Reverse T3. it's been nothing but a nightmare. I am using the generic form of cytomel by Paddock Labs. I may (if I want to continue) try the compounded T3 or ask my doctor for the real thing. Generics have fillers and this one has talc in it too. and to think I am supposed to raise the dose? I don't think so. I want to stop but I don't know if you can just stop. I have only been on it for 2 days and it's been a real nightmare. Oh, did I mention insomnia too. I would think twice before taking it.		F	55	2  days5 MCG's 2X D	7/24/2011Email
1	Low Thyroid Low T3	Severe weight loss - BMI is now 17.  Deep depression.  Anxiety. Sleeplessness. Nausea and no appetite.  Feelign very unwell.  Severe hair loss.	This drug has been a complete nightmare.  Be very very careful when taking this drug. I do not have a thryoid and have been on Synthriod for the past 18 years.  I was feeling very tired and T3 levels were very low so my Dr. prescribed Cytomel starting with 5mcg then to 25 mcg.  Immediately I had nausea and could not eat.  I lost 10 lbs in two weeks and my bmi in now 17.  Anxiety levels were very high and I could not sleep properly.  I have discontinued the drug and finally am able to eat a meal and enjoy it.  Also had severe hair loss.  I feel that this drug has taken away my life for the past 7 weeks.	F	45	35  days25mcg 1X D	7/10/2011Email

5	Hypothyroidism	None.  More energy but that's a good thing :)	After years of living in a fog I was prescribed cytomel.  I was previously kn levothyroxine and tried armour... Adding cytolmel to the levothyroxine helped tremendously.  The first day I had a headache but the day after was the best day I had had in years.  Every once in a while I'll feel sluggish again but nothing compared to the suffering I was experiencing prior to cytomel.  Also, I was prescribed cytomel 5mg 2x daily... For the first few weeks, I only took 1/day.  When taking T3 it is important to start at a low dose to avoid heart palpitations and chest pain.  I saw a few of you posted about that along with anxiety.  Try starting out with a very small dose and gradually increase it.  Hope this helps :)	F	24	2  months5mg 2X D	6/29/2011Email
1	Hypothyroidism	ANXIETY!! No relief from hypo symptoms, total loss of appetite, weight gain, nausea, diarrhea, joint pain, irritability, nail ridges, painful menstrual cramps, suicidal thoughts, depression.	Despite a super low freeT4, my endo gave me cytomel thinking I would go hyper on a T4 drug. First week felt more alert and energized. After that it was all down hill from there. After 2 blood tests and a list of horrible symptoms on this alone my doctor was finally willing to prescribe me armour since cytomel suppressed both my TSH and T4 to almost 0. Cytomel will naturally suppress your t4 because it is replacing what your own thyroid does. This drug should only be used if someone has a hard time converting t4 to t3. I am now on Nature-Throid  which is another brand like Armour Thyroid. It has alleviated most of my symptoms, but still working on finding the right dose. If your doctor is not willing to prescribe it, I would recommend changing doctors.	F	24	12  weeks25mcg 2X D	6/21/2011

1	Hypothyroidism	The second day of taking Cytomel,  I started moving around the house more, doing things and sat around less. I had lots of energy and ambition. I also started waking up at 6am, which I don't normally do because I never get to sleep til about 3am. I couldn't get back to sleep, so would get up and constantly putter around doing housework, etc. I also remember that I would wake up during that short period of sleep and take things off my nightstand, sometimes knocking them to the floor. I've never done that before. By the 6th day, I woke up at 6am again and felt like I was on a bad trip of some kind. Hyperness, fearfulness, paranoia and my bp was up to 136 and it usually is around 110. I stopped taking Cytomel immediately,  yet still had problems on and off throughout the day, feeling weird, wired, antsy.

3	Hypothyroid	Since adding the Cytomel, I am having shooting pains in my muscles.  It seems to bounce all over my body.  Recently I am having rapid heart beat and terrible chest pain.  It is weird because, they are not all at the same time.  One day the shooting pains, the next the chest pain.  Maybe I need to decrease the dosage??  I will do blood work in a couple of weeks.  A little scary though, keep thinking I am having a heart attack!		F	37	3  weeks25mg 1X D	5/11/2011
3	Hypo/Bi-Polar Depression	Difficulty getting and staying asleep, mood swings	I had heard this was a good drug for people having adjustment problems with T4 only for hypo.  My psych was not happy with mood and other hypo symptoms (the usual ones) and my TSH level being stuck at 3.8 (0thers were in range).  He talked with my GP and they agreed to try T3, 5 mg per day.  First few days were really great; mood picked up, constipation gone, energy up and weight loss was good (12 lbs in 2 weeks-had been 3-4 lbs a month).  But, maybe due to the low dose, had horrible depression and other issues after 4 days.  However, I know this is confusing (at least to me) I suddenly seem to be feeling a bit better than prior to taking T3.  From what I see so far it seems that a dose increase might be in order here.  Was wondering how others out there had experienced with their initial T3 dose and how the treatment has panned out for you. Thanks.One more thing, my hypo kicked in last April, about a week after I quit smoking (35 years).  It took my GP until August to finally agree to test for hypo, where my TSH was 10 (other normal).  He sent me to a Endo (short for that long name I can't spell) who put me on T4 25 umg a day.  By October I was totally bonkers and felt like I was going crazy (in addition to a lot of other symptoms) and got my GP to increase the dose to 50 umg.  My TSH had gone up from 10 to 17 taking T4.  By Dec the endo has increased the T4 to 8 50 umg tabs weekly, which again didn't do it.  So, I again increased my dose, this time to 75 and then 100 um	M	55	30  days5 1X D	4/11/2011Email

I started taking cytomel because I suspected hypothyroidism. And although I am not "technically" at that point, my levels are high enough so that I feel off.

1	Hypothyroidism	Hypertension, depression, mood swings,nervousness, anxiety attacks, feeling chilled, tingling in left side of face and left fingers.	I once had an unexplained thyroiditis for 3 years that ended about 4 years ago and returned.  The thyroid fluctuates between hyper and hypothyroidism and can be very frustrating.  I had been taking 50 mcg of generic Levoxyl and yet the TSH level dropped lower.  My endocrinologist suggested we could either increase Levoxyl to 75 mcg or stay at 50 and add T-3 (generic Cytomel) so I went along with Cytomel.  For the first 2 weeks, I felt fine, but then the terrible symptoms started in.  The first was tingling in the face and left fingers, then blood pressure of 165/105.  Some days I might feel OK and then symptoms would start again going from anxiety attacks to bouts of anger lasting over an hour about once a week.  Every couple of days, I spent hours feeing chilled from the inside out.  Once I went off the drug, it took a full 6 weeks for all the side effects to abate.  My primary care NP said Cytomel has a long half-life and, therefore, takes a long time to be completely excreted from the body once it has had a chance to build up in the blood.  This was a nightmare experience that I would not want to repeat.  During the early phase of the side effects appearing, I ended up in the Emergency Room to be sure I wasn't having a stroke.  CT was normal and, later, after a referral from a neurologist, an MRI was also normal.	F	54	2  weeks5 mcg 1X D	2/21/2011Email

She lowered my synthroid to 175mcg and 2 clytomel tabs 2 X a day.  I have been a bit depressed feeling today.  I was up for over 36 hours the first day I took it...whew....Hoping that everything evens out.  I'm tired of being tired and tired of being in a fog.  I'm also tired of gaining weight.  Hoping cytomel will help with that too.... time will tell.	F	43	3  days 2X D	2/19/2011Email
1	low T3 lab value	Anxiety, depression, tension, neck and shoulder muscle pain, trouble falling asleep.	I was told I needed Cytomel because my T3 lab value was below normal range, plus I had fatigue. Initially, for about a week, I felt euphoric taking 5 mcg a day; then palpitations set in plus heat intolerance and being overly "amped up" with even one panic attack. I dropped my dose to 2.5 mcg. Even on this lower dose, I began having horrible chronic daily headaches which never went away, and I had more migraines than usual. I had to take a beta blocker to calm myself down and help dull the headaches. Finally my lab values were normal after 7 months of taking Cytomel. My doctor said it was okay to stop taking it as other labs showed that my thyroid was working better than before. It took 2 weeks to return to what I call "normal", and my headaches have improved a LOT. I feel calmer, get tired at night like I am supposed to, and I hiked 6 miles this weekend, so I have enough energy. I feel much better off of Cytomel! I was also told that taking Cytomel would cure everything from low libido to a bad lipid profile. Nothing changed in either case, and my lipids are even worse. I guess I had to take Cytomel because my T3 was low, but I am thankful that the nightmare is over.	F	54	7  months2.5 to 5 1X D	1/25/2011Email
4	Graves > RAI >Hypo	If there were any, they were superior to what I was experiencing earlier!!	Diagnosed with Graves in early 2001. Hyperthyroidism was great (yes I'm Type A). Problem was my body was burning up and in Texas this is not comfortable. Had the RAI and transitioned to Hypothyroid. My Internal Medicine guy (an extremely sharp guy) listened when I told him Synthroid just wasn't cutting it. He recommended an Endocrinologist (she's sharp too) who gradually reduced the Synthroid to 100mcg and immediately placed me on 5mcg Cytomel tablets twice a day. That was literally "just what the doctor ordered" and helped tremendously. She also encouraged me to develop patience for this process and I've been on this regimen for about 10 years. I perform the blood test once a year and we shoot for the lowest value in the tolerance range possible. Yes, weight is a battle but I learned to eat and exercise better. Also, I get cold, even in Texas. I tolerate that so I know what to expect with everything else associated with this battle. I can tolerate Colorado ski slopes, I can tolerate this. Another benefit of keeping my weight down, I don't have to take meds for high blood pressure or diabetes. It's bad enough having to rely on thryoid medication, I would hate to think what those would make me feel like. Good luck to you all!	M	54	10  years5mcg 2X D	12/31/2010
4	sympt of hypothy dspite norm tsh		after 30 years of life "as a slug" and begging doctor #8 to try t3, i am finally feeling close to what i think others feel! Praise and Thanks be to God!	F	42	1  years2.5 2X D	12/9/2010
5	Hypothyroidism	Sleeplessness and occasional headaches when dose was higher	I am taking the generic Cytomel in addition to my Synthroid.  I was on Synthroid only for several years, feeling OK until suddenly started experiencing joint pain, brain fog, hypothermia, fatigue, weight gain.  TSH and FT4 tested within normal range, but my FT3 had droppped below range.  Feeling 100% better since adding Cytomel, although at first with dose at 25 MG along with my Synthroid, I had some sleeplessness and headaches.  Lowering the dose to 12.5 MG made symptoms go away.

5	fat loss, belly fat loss, weight lo	No major side effects apart from fast fat loss from cytomel. All in all I was happy with liothyronine sodium. The cytomel t3 or cynomel as it is called in USA did it's job and than some. :)	It's a very effective weight loss drug. In my experience only clenbuterol was more effective regarding weight loss. Cytomel is a good option for fat loss.	F	39	90  days20 mcg 2X D	11/19/2010
5	thyroidectomy	Prior to cytomel I was on Levothyroxine 137mg.  Physically I felt ok, not great, but ok.  Mentally and emotionally I was coming undone.  I felt disconnected and in a fog.  My doctor put me on 12.5 mg cytomel and reduce the levothyroxine to 88 mg.  The first day I took it everything changed.  I felt clear, energetic, and happy.  It took me about a week to get over the over engergetic feeling and heart palpatations.  But I will never go back to just thyroxine.	I would never recommend this medicine be taken at night.  Unlike levothyroxine, cytomel is fast acting.  I can feel a difference within forty-five minutes.	F	45	2  months12.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2010
3	Hypothyroid	Insomnia, sweating, weight gain, depression, indigestion.	I was taking 131mg.Levoxyl when my endo put me on Cytomel. He lowered the Levoxyl to 125mg. and added 5mcg. of Cytomel. First few days I was more alert but not energetic. Couldn't sleep, very sweaty, lots of indigestion. After 7 days, intense depression.After gaining 15 pounds after diagnosis two years ago, I had started to lose a few pounds a month. But I gained a crazy 4.5 pounds in 15 days after starting Cytomel. Day 17, I'm starting to feel better and more like myself. Hair still shedding like crazy, though.	F	54	2  weeks5 mcg 1X D	11/4/2010Email
5	total thyroidectomy	absolutely none!	Had total thyroidectomy 3-2009 was given .112 Synthroid by my Endro. Then went to .1. Now am at .88 w & taking .5 Cytomel-all due to bad blood results. Cytomel is a wonder drug and seems to be working and is what I've needed all along! I already feel a difference in my body and I have my energy back! I love life again!

3	To add T3	tingling in my fingers and numbness in the morning, shortness of breath,weight gain	cytomel was added to my 88mcg of synthroid due to lack of energy. I was on 135mcg syntrhroid only  for 2 years after total thyroidectomy. I have no energy and sleepy. After cytomel,i gained energy enough for the day, but have palpitations and weigh gain is unstoppable. I still maintain heaathy eating, and exxercise 3x a week. My be i need to increase  my synthroid. i have slight weight  increase when i was on 135 mcg of syntrhoid.Cytomel gave me energy but i gain weight. I will see my endoc. in 2 months, may be ask for increase in synthroid. She said ican only mave 88mcg of synthroid cannot increase synthroid, so may be i have decrease cytomel or take it every other day if in increase my synthroid. I am really confused.	F	57	9  months5mcg 2X D	10/4/2010Email
2	Graves Disease	Weight gain and foggy brain	I took Cytomel once a day for a year.  I gained 10 pounds and felt like my brain was in a fog.  Today I went to a new endo. and he wants to put me back on Cytomel-taking it 2 to 3 times in one day.  The new doc says that taking it once a day did more harm than good and taking it several times a day will be the trick.  I am hoping that the outcome is positive.  I have taken Synthroid for 13 years and have suffered from low energy.  I have prayed for years for an answer to the low energy-sleepiness problem.  I have no thryoid at all due to Radioactive iodine.  Now I am taking 100 mcg of Synthroid and will start the new dosage of Cytomel in two weeks after further blood tests come back.  I am excited that this time the Cytomel will be the answer for which I have prayed.	F	44	11  months 1X D	9/29/2010Email
1	Depression	Nervousness, Shaking, Headache, Insomnia, Nausea, Rapid Heart Beat, diarrhea, "foggy-headed", feeling like I may pass out	I thought this medicine was going to be WONDERFUL. I took this med at night, the first day after I felt more energized and alert. The second day the "nervousness" feeling and headache began to bother me a bit but still tolerable. Took the third dose and woke up and felt like I was going through withdrawals from heroin or something! My head was in a fog, my heart was racing, I was a huge ball of nerves, I was shaking, was short of breath, had the longest panic attack ever! I had diarrhea, couldn't eat, couldn't think. Pdoc said to try to "tough it out". I reluctantly took my fourth and final pill. I woke up at 2am, couldn't go back to sleep and had the same symptoms as mentioned above! Horrible med!

3	Hashimoto	Was prescribed 5mg in the morning with 50 synthroid and 5mg in the afternoon. Caused Migranes. Told to cut Cytomel to 2.5 in the morning and 2.5 in the afternoon, which also caused morning headaches. So taking 50 synthroid in the morning and 2.5 cytomel in the afternoon. Works great!		F	34	4  weeks2.5 1X D	9/16/2010
3	Hashimotos	Heart palpatations, speedy alertness, but unable to focus.	This is the second time around with cytomel.  I started many years ago after my endo prescribed it saying," not alot of evidence this works". This time new doctor prescribed and cytomel is too strong or something. Started breaking them in half as they don't split easily.	F	50	10  days25mcg 1X D	9/7/2010
3	Hypothyroid	Heart palpitations, a little anxiety, like I've had a double espresso.	This is just day 4 of this drug, and I'm going to have to make some adjustments. I've read many, many posts about Cytomel and asked my Endo to please let me try it because of fatigue, depression, weight gain despite exercise and calorie restriction and just a general "fog".  I started on 25mcg along with 150mcg Synthroid (been on that for 30+ years).  Day 3 (yesterday) was coming undone. Today, I've split both tablets and going to take 12.5 daily with 75mcg daily of Syn.  I can add on as needed, but I think I need to gradually work up. I have to take the generic because of Tricare refusing to cover the brand.  I've heard a ton of negative about the generic, but I have no choice, it's $3 for a month or $47...I have to be practical.  Mine is from Paddock, which seems to have better review than the other generic company Mylan, who has been under investigation. After 30 days on this med, I'll give further feedback, just giving a bit now.	F	43	3  days25mcg 1X D	9/4/2010Email
5	TSH on the upper end of normal	No side effects.	My thyroid tests came back not optimal but not out of normal range. I just didn't feel good. Aches in my joints upon getting up in the morning, tired and depressed although taking Lexapro. I stopped taking the antidepressant and began taking 5MCG of Cytomel.  Now I am totally off the antidepressant and have lost 12 lbs. My TSH is 1.23 and my cholesterol is down to 173 from 257. I am not taking a T4 supplement. Cytomel has been great for me. I feel like the small supplementation of T3 made all the difference in the world.	F	61	1.5  years5MCG 1X D	8/31/2010
4	Hypothyroidism small goiter	Problems with generic Cytomel.	I have been hypothyroid with a small goiter for many years, I just got a doctor to treat me a year and a half ago. I have been on a roller coaster with drugs starting with the old Armour thyroid, then levoxyl and and cytomel. Didn't stay on Armour long enough to see what it could do before it was unavailable. Went up and down with Levoxyl and cytomel. Finally settled on 25mcg levoxyl once a day and 10mcg cytomel twice a day. Stayed that dose for four months then bumped the cytomel up to 15mcg twice a day. When I first started cytomel I took the non-generic, but because of the high cost I tried to switch to generic. After three days on the generic I was climbing the walls. It was a very bad trip. If you are having trouble with Cytomel and are taking the generic I suggest trying the non-generic before you give up. Non-generic made a very big positive difference and worth spending the extra money. The only thing now is that I am having a very bad case of the "blues." But it may just be "life."	F	67	1  years15mcg 2X D	8/20/2010
2	Thyroid	Throat tightness and pain, voice cracking, lump in throat	I couldn't continue this drug because it caused too many throat symptoms for me.  It activated my thyroid to the point where it was constantly swollen, which caused throat pain, caused my voice to crack, and it felt like I constantly had a lump in my throat like I was about to cry.  I waited two weeks (per doctor's recommendation) to see if it went away, but I felt like it was interfering with my daily life and it never went away.  I did not work up to a high enough dose to take away any of my hypo symptoms because of this.  Just be aware that this is a possible side effect - I have not seen much reference to this on the internet, but it happened to me.	F	27	21  days5 mcg 2X D	8/11/2010
2	to supplement T4 (Synthroid)	Even with this tiny dose (I cut a 5 MCG tab in half) I had seriously heavy break-through bleeding.	I've been on Synthroid for 14 years and was currently alternating between 112 and 125mcg.  I decided to stay on just the 112mcg dose for two weeks before starting the Liothyronine (Paddock Laboratory's generic for Cytomel) in order to reduce my T4 a bit.  I am also on the contraceptive, Lutera, but I never bleed at this time of the month.  Within a couple hours of taking the Liothyronine (at 3PM, 12 hours after Synthroid), I had spotting.  The heavy bleeding happened overnight.  It could be coincidental that this happened exactly at the same time I started on the new medicine, but that's not likely.  I tend to be very sensitive to drugs and perhaps the Liothyronine stimulated the reproductive part of my endocrine system.  I did NOT experience any heart palpitations or dizziness.  I had some anxiety, but it was related to the bleeding.  I will stop taking the Liothyronine.  Right now, it's the next afternoon and I'm still bleeding lightly.  We'll see how long it lasts.  If it stops soon and doesn't come back, I may try the medicine another time, just to make sure this wasn't a fluke.	F	52	1  days.25 MCG 1X D	8/3/2010
5	total thyroidectomy	When my doctor started me on cytomel @ 10 mcg I had hyper symptoms and backed off to 5 mcg with great results	I was diagnosed with Hashimotos last year, compressive goiter and all the AWFUL hypo symptoms. Total thyroidectomy may 2009 and given cytomel only for one week after and felt like poo! Then started on synthroid only and ok for a few months, then exhausted, lethargic, hypo symptoms back. Started on 10 mcg cytomel at first but had all hyper symptoms so I backed off to 5mcg. Felt great, energy back, even did a triathlon!! Two months ago started slowly feeling ick again, hard to get out of bed, unable to exercise, depressed,etc. Increased my dose back to 10mcg and in ONE day felt soooooo much better! Cytomel is a lifesaver for me! Also taking 88mcg synthroid.	F	39	1  years5 mcg 2X D	7/28/2010Email
5	Hypothyroidism	The only negative side effects that I have noticed is a skipped heart beat every so often. Usually occurs when I'm idle or before going to sleep. I never notice this during the day or while excercising. I think as I continue to reduce my Synthroid(T4) dosage, this should subside.	T3 has been great. I was apprensive as I approached my doctor about adding T3 as he is in his late 60's and I thought he would be old fashion. To my suprise, he said "sure". I was so happy. I am 6' and 180lbs. I take 12.5mcg 4x per day. I don't see how 5mcg can do anything for people, even small women. 5mcg is an incredibly small dose 1 time per day. No wonder those people don't notice any increased energy and continue with hypo symptoms. Bodybuilders, celeberties and athletes take up to 100mcg per day of T3. And those people are not even diagnosed with Hypothyroidism like we are. Of course T3 is much stronger and faster acting than T4, so 100mcg is a lot. But they are essentially abusing T3 for incredible/substantial fat loss purposes. I was originally on 50mcg of T4 as a starter dose. After being on T3 I have reduced the dose in half and now have stopped. I spread out my T3 throughout the day. With T3, I no longer need any naps in the afternoon. I think more clearly and am more productive. I am no longer cold all the time and I have lost 2 lbs of bodyfat. I am an athlete so I am in pretty good condition, so the bodyfat reduction is basically carving out the last bits of stubborn fat. I think sedentary people that were overweight to begin with, would see substantial weight loss with a reasonably substantial dose. I spread my doses out every 3-4 hrs starting around mid-day and finishing before bed as it keeps my metabolism up throughout the nightime.	M	50	8  weeks12.5 4X D	7/26/2010
4	Grave's/Hypo	A burst of energy and concentration for 4-5 hours followed by slight crash.	I took this as part of combination therapy with 100 mcg Synthroid. This is the same combination of Thyrolar 2 - though I did not find that medicine effective. Had to go off Cytomel recently due to hyperthyroid symptoms though tests were normal. Warning: Cytomel negatively  combined with the supplement Coenzyme CQ10 to give palpatations. Currently on 175 Synthroid. Will add 5 mcg Cytomal if Dr. allows. I've needed constant monitoring of meds. since 131 treatment at age 17.	M	43	7  years25 mcg 1X D	7/24/2010Email
5	Thyroid Cancer	I am warmer than I use to be and I do get short of breath with a little rapid heart beat.	I took Synthoid for 36 years for a non-toxic goiter.  My surgeon switched me to Cytomel because he said I would need to be on this to start for my RAI treatment for Thyroid cancer.  I have more energy.  The rapid heart beat does not worry me because I had that problem at first with Synthoid.  Just figure my body would adjust.  I personally like it.  Have a little more energy.
