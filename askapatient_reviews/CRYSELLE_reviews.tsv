5	Birth Control & Ovarian Cysts	None.	No side effects what-so-ever.  Completely regulated my cycle to the hour.  Haven't had any cysts since I started it.  I plan on taking it for a long time.	F	26	2  years 1X D	9/13/2012Email
1	Cycle regulation	Did a good job regulating cycles - HOWEVER has been the main contributing factor in conjunction with Factor V Leiden clotting inheritance linked to the stroke I encountered in April 2011.	Previously stayed away from medications in general and never had blood test prior to beginning consumption - was given the thumbs up to low side effects and was instructed that the low amount of hormone was "ok".  Would NEVER have even started using if I would have known it was a possible complication.  Would really suggest asking for a blood test prior to beginning course.	F	39	2  years 1X D	1/16/2012Email
1	birth control	constant headaches, extremely bad moodiness, fatigue, leg numbness and pain	I had a terrible headache for the entire first week  of this pill. Nothing helped it go away. It also made me turn into a MONSTER. Everything made me angry. I couldn't believe how little control I had over my emotions. It also makes me extremely tired. The clincher is my leg numbness. It felt (and still feels) like I have tourniquets on my thighs. My legs throb and hurt. I still get headaches. I will not be renewing this prescription for the second cycle.

1	Shrink ovarian cyst/BC	I had EXTREME moodiness. I thought my husband was going to call off the wedding! Also, my libido decreased to a big fat ZERO. I have been off of it for four months now and the moodiness is gone, but the libido is still non-existent, which has never been the case for me. I'm a newlywed, so this is has been extremely frustrating. I will never take a birth control pill ever.	On the positive side, my doctor put me on this particular type because we were trying to shrink an ovarian cyst. The other lower dose pills were not working, and this one finally did the trick. But if I had known I would have these side effects, I would rather have had surgery, without a doubt.	F	36	5  months0.3-30mg 1X D	11/3/2010Email
1	Heavy menstration	Extreme moodiness, depression, slight headache, and night time nausea.	This pill was horrible for me.  I was a crazed lunatic on it. It caused uncontrollable anger. I had to stop taking it before I seriously hurt someone or myself:(  Not sure what I'm going to try after this because this one has scared me pretty good!  I feel sorry for my family having to deal with me.	F	30	2  weeks 1X D	8/31/2010
4			tired, but no moodiness, yet, but tired.	F	26	2  days 1X D	7/22/2010
