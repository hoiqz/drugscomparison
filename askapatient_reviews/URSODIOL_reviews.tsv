5	PBC	None	Life saver!  Recently had a liver biopsy and it has totally stopped any liver damage. Went from stage 1 or 2 (don't recall) to stage zero!   When I was diagnosed in the 1980s I was told I would have to have a transplant in approximately 7 years.   There is no cure for PBC, but the goal is to slow/stop the progression.  Ursodiol did that for me.	F	71	23  days300 3X D	4/30/2012Email

5	cirrhosis of the liver	none noticed	When I first found out I had cirrhosis my doctors were pretty sure I would need a transplant. They decided to up my dosage and since then the swelling went down and there has been no additional scarring on my liver. I should probably say that I am helping the cause of it remaining healthy because I do not drink nor have I even tasted alcohol.	F	19	4  years500 MG 2X D	4/18/2010
3	Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis	Severe fatigue at 9 pills per day.	For a drug known for its lack of side effects, be careful at higher doses.  I had been taking six per day for about six years and never realized how lethargic it was making me feel.  When the Dr. increased the dosage to nine per day, I could barely function.  Without it, my liver enzymes go off the chart, so for now I take four per day which is tolerable.	M	36	6  years	8/8/2007Email

4	Gall bladder	Stayed with 1 pill a day.  Two pills a day caused loose stools and some indigestion	I have polyp in the gall bladder which impeeds flow of bile into the stomach.  SEVERE bloating resulted and small dose of Ursodiol virtually stopped this.  Prescribed 2 a day (one @ breakfast / 1 @ dinner)  Stopped the dinner pill as I don't eat a large dinner and often would cause loose stools and some minor indigestion.	F	36	2  weeks	9/8/2009
5	primary biliary cirrhosis	none	Seems to be an extremely benign drug. Made the elevated liver enzymes go down and presumably slowed the disease progression but it's hard to assess that. There is no cure.	F	69	12  years	5/11/2009
