5	Skin infection, boil on face	I did not experience any side effects.  It is greasy and gives a greasy appearance, but the results make any "cosmetic" issues like this well worth it.	This product worked amazingly well for me.  I woke up with a swollen, red spot on my face that was painful.  First I tried an antifungal cream but it didn't improve.  After one week of this, I tried Neosporin and the effect was almost immediate.  The redness and swelling began to go away within 24 hours.  I didn't go to the doctor but think I had a Staph infection of the skin.  Neosporin is wonderful.  I was really impressed.	M	38	7  dayssmall amnt 3X D	9/10/2010
1	Minor Cuts and Burns	Extreme skin festering. I thought my minor cut was getting infected after using neosporin. The more neosporin, the worse it got.I went to dermatologist that said I was alergic to it.Ivory soap and water, it all went away, quick!	Looking back, after I found I was alergic to it, my whole life I had had problems with the horrible drug.	M	53	53  years	4/21/2005
