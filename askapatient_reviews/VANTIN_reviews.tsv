1	uti	started to have  abdominal pain right away after 1st dose. Pain getting progressively worse each day.. It is a 3rd day, I do not know if i can tolerate it a whole week, as prescribed.... Now, on top, of the abdominal pain i have pain in my back, nausea and very bad headache. Afraid, if it progress like that, i may end up with convulsions ! Will call the doctor tomorrow for the change of drug.		F	51	3  days 2X D	4/23/2012
4	UTI/kidney infection	Yeast infection, but normal with antibiotics.I was given Vantin 100mg twice daily after being on IV antibiotics for 4 days.  I actually quit them due to being so sick and visiting my doctor. My doctor switched me to levaquin, which I found out was poison and was having side effects after 8 days of it, plus it wasn't helping my infection.  I decided to take the Vantin after quitting levaquin and my symptoms have imoroved.  I still have kidney pain, but my fever is gone.The IV medication, which is in the same class as Vantin worked the best.  I had a bad doctor at the hospital that took me off the IV antibiotics early.  I will use Vantin again if needed for UTI/kidney infection.Now I hope I do not have permanent damaging effects from the leviquin.		F	38	6  days100	1/22/2012
