2	joint pain	First I did not notice any side effects, but after about 3 months, I got vertigo.	It did not help me at all. I did not feel any improvement. When I got vertigo, I went off of it,and the vertigo went away, and my pain did not get any worse. To sum up, it did nothing good for me.	F	50	3  months	1/18/2009
4	Chronic Back Pain	None that I can remember	I have been taking Daypro for several years.  Did not realize how much it helped until I quick taking it for several days.  Reduces aching in my back and other joints.  I take 1200 mg every night.	M	63	4  years	9/10/2008
4	osteoarthritis	feel tired more often, and it seems to bother my acid reflux at times.	I've been taking this drug for hip pain. After taking this drug for four weeks, I have gotten an 80% improvement in my hip movements.	F	51	4  weeks	3/14/2008Email
5	Inflammation in my lower back	nausea at the beginning but that went away after three days, bruising	Really helped my inflammation and relieves pain very well. I can take one per day rather than two. My only concern is that I was told by another doctor that after a plolonged time on the drug (2-3 yrs), it can cause liver and heart damage.

4	Extreme Menstrual Cramps	No side effects	It helped with cramps, but it wore off too quickly.  I've found that it works well for my migraines, which surprises me, but I'm satisfied with it.	F	26	6  months	6/7/2007

4	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Fatigue, and loss of appetite	Works well but sometimes I sleep through my alarm or fall asleep in class or even miss a class due to being so tired.	F	22	1  months	12/7/2005Email
4	Too Early...Osteoarthritis	It really hasn't bothered me much.  I've been kind of dragging at work, but am on a couple other pain medications so I'm attributing this fatigue to them for now.	It's really helped and majorly cut down the necessity for my other pain medication.	F	27	3  weeks	11/10/2005
4	plantar fasciitis	The only side effect that seems to be caused by this medicine is really bad heartburn.  A few hours after taking it, I am getting chest pain, which I can only assume is acid reflux.	Otherwise, this medicine has helped quite a bit.  Am taking it BID, in the morning and at night.  It has relieved my heel and instep pain to a dull ache even after a really hard workout and I do not have the morning pain anymore.	F	28	10  days	8/6/2005
5	rheumatoid arthritis	fatigue when driving, so now I take it AFTER I get to work	This medication helped to relieve my pain when naproxin didn't really do anything for me. I've been taking it since last February and am very satisfied with the relief it provides.	F	45	9  days	11/3/2003Email
