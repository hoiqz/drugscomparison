4	bv	Im using the vaginl ovules im on day 2 and so far it seems to be working, the only thing i have noticed is that i am very fatigued and my body is sore, not sure if that is caused from the medicine		F	33	3  days100mg	9/20/2012
3	BV	Nausea, vaginal discomfort, vaginal discharge,	Took Cleocin after Flagyl failed to help with BV. My doctor recommended taking Floranex (probiotic) while taking Cleocin to help balance PH. Two weeks later, still experiencing some stomach upset and burning sensation in vagina. Hate this.	F	32	3  days 1X D	8/4/2012
3	BV	bleeding - is it me or the medicine?	this is the second day of taking it...experiencing light vaginal bleeding, some nausea, and lightheadedness. the symptoms arent as bad	F	21	7  days40 g  2% 1X D	7/15/2011Email
1	BV	Neverending white discharge- think it is a terrible yeast infection.  Dr. visit tomorrow.	Horrible to take if prone to yeast infections- I took the Clindesse brand, but did not find a separate post for that here	F	36	1  days	9/1/2008
4	Cervicitis	I'm not really sure since I'm also taking diflucan with it.  It could possiblby be causing some nausea. Otherwise no other side effects to note.  I have not yet fully completed my treatment.	So far it appears to be working.  Like I said above my Dr. prescribed diflucan to be taken along with it since this drug can cause yeast infections as well. I will be taking the full 7 days, then terazole and then another 7 days of the cleocin.	F	33	7  days	1/15/2008
1	BV	intense burning...constant milky white discharge....resulted in vulvadynia (a chronic pain condition)	I would be very wary of this medication....it has caused terrible damage and I know from others who suffer from vulvadynia that I am not alone in this experience	F	38	3  days	6/26/2007
2	BV	took cleocin vaginal ovules for 3 days. side effects: intense itching after application; much leakage of medicine; loose stools. then, after all of that, i'm headed back to the doctor because my vaginal tract itches much worse than before; think it might have caused yeast (it targets all bacteria, good & bad, unlike metronidazole--but that's an even scarier medicine for women!)
