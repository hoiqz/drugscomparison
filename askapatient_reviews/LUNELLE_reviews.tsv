1	Birth control	Pain at injection site, mania, hysteria, crying, depression. Onset of these symptoms were about 24 hours after the shot. My poor husband thought I'd gone nuts. For about 4 weeks, I was a mess! I filed a report with the FDA, and I think this drug has finally been taken off the market. I have used birth control pills for years, with no problems, but tried this one time at the recommendation of my doctor. YUCK! Never again!	One dose lasts approximately 4 weeks.

4	not good with pills	soreness at injection site, some acne	I had a good experience with lunelle, but they recalled it due to so many women having circulatory problems because of the drug.  I suppose a recall is a good reason not to take something! I didn't have any troubles with it personally.	F	22	1  years	9/22/2007Email

2	birth control, control heavy period	A lot of breakthrough bleeding, It was like constantly having a period. Going to the Dr. once a month to get a shot was a pain.	This did not work for me but every woman's body is different.	F	25	3  months	3/21/2007
