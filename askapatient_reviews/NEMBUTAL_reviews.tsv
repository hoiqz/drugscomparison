5	Chronic insomnia	Euphoric bliss, and first class sedation. Also brutally addictive with an added feature, of disappearing in a spoonful of cold water, making it 'ideal' for being drawn up thru a #26 TB point for IV injection. It puts you in heaven for a few hours, and sometimes, forever.	Yes, it was the drug found in a dead Marylin Monroe- but remember that MM was murdered. Coroners evidence prove this. I had a second stay in the nut house for detox, where I met other users, some of which were taking up to a dozen a day, and still able to commit crimes. During the 1960's, dozens of barbiturates were easily available. Its a wonder I am still alive today.But for serious sedation? This stuff cant be beat. Stay away from it- it is total dynamite with a one inch fuse.	M	62	2  years	1/19/2010
