3	open-angle glaucoma	Slow heartbeat, weight gain, slight depression	This drug did what it was supposed to do:  lowered my eye pressure.  However, being a runner both before and after this medication was prescribed to me, I discovered almost immediately that it was difficult for me to run the same hilly routes as before.  I believe that the beta-blocker has a tendency to retard the heart rate, as I found it difficult to reach and maintain my target heart rate.  Using the occlusion technique when administering the drops was of some help, but I still noticed a big difference when my eye doctor eventually switched me to a different medication.

5	Increased pressure in the eye	Mild and transient stinging upon application. Blurred vision for a short period after application.	A very effective medication. But because it containes a gel to control the rate of release, it results in a little blurred vision for the first hour. For the same reason, it works better than Timoptic (non-XE) or Timolol Maleate	M	45	3  years	10/9/2006
