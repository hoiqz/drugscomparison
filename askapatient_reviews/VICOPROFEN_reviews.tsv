3	Hysterectomy	Extreme constipation and abdominal cramps that put me on my knees nearly in tears, felt like i was developing paralytic ileus. Had to stop taking at this time.		F	39	6  days7.5 mg	3/29/2013Email
3	Endometriosis, extreme pain	Hot flashes but bearable and itchy. I have been on Vicodin 7.5/7.5 for years and my Dr. Decided to change me b/c of my liver concerns. Vicoprofen is very disappointing, I thought after reading reviews it would be great. None of the same feelings from it. And very short pain relief. Like less than an hour. Worst cycle ever!!!!		F	30	10  days7.5/200	11/22/2012Email
2	Lower back muscle and nerve pain	GREATLY intensified lower back muscular and nerve pain.  EXTREME agitation. Very bizarre dreams. HUGE flare of the stinging and burning that I have had for some time. Burst of energy which equates to agitation for me.  I felt like I had to constantly be moving.  Sleep disturbance.  I will never use this medication again.	Some people can tolerate almost any type of pain medication. I cannot say that I recommend or that I do not recommend it. I only know that this medication can cause neuralgia, joint pain, muscular pain, anxiety, agitation. This information can be obtained by doing an Internet search for the side effects of Vicoprofen.

3	S/P Apical-Surgical removal of infe	Itching, intense sleepiness, stomach discomfort, nausea, vomiting. Could not lie down due to nausea which progressed to vomitiing until nothing left to throw up. Stomach ache finally stopped after throwing up.	Pain relieved - but the stomach ache and vomiting was too mcuh for me. Will switch to advil or aleve per MD instructions.

2	Gallstones	slight disorientation	Did nothing whatsoever to relieve pain:'(	M	21	4  days7.5mg/200m 4X D	8/29/2012Email
5	Ankylosing Spondylitis	Euphoria, increased appetite, decreased ability to orgasm. I've been taking for 6 mos. I'm worried about possibility of addiction since have to take several days in a row sometimes. It works great. It numbs the pain & gives me more movement. I try to space the usage out.		M	36	6  months7.5/200	7/13/2012Email
5	Multiple orthopedic issues.	I have noticed the stimulant effect that some describe.  I have not found it over whelming.  A sedative such as valium helps following surgery to help sleep and also manage the stimulating effects.	I am an orthopedists dream.  6 knee surgeries including two replacements.  L & R rotator cuff surgeries.  Spinal injections.  My use of this varies by how active I am.  When I go on vacation and am walking a lot I might take 3 or 4 per day.  Many days none is required.	M	56	7  years7.5/200 1X D	7/7/2012
5	Dental work	Highly effective. I have taken Vicodin previously and that made me ill more so than pain relief. I think because ibuprofen is an antiinflamatory it works well with the soft tissue of the mouth and has a more mild effect on the stomach. My only complaint is that I felt more itchy perhaps because it has 7.5 mg of hydrocodone compared to 5mg of Vicodin...? Nonetheless very helpful		F	26	7  days7.5/200	3/24/2012
5	Ankylosing Spondylitis	Plantar Faciitis type pain in feet. Goes away a few days after stopping vicoprofen. Severe stomach/abdominal pain after long term use.	Makes me feel alive again. Gives me great energy, happiness, and very chatty. If not for side effects, this would be my permanent medication.	M	50	4  years 4X D	7/25/2011
5	back pain/neck pain	Light headed, euphoric, mild drowsiness, increased talking, some constipation.	I call this my wonder drug if not for this drug, I would be couch and bed bound and have no social life. It definitly knocks out the pain especially when combined with a muscle relaxer. I would highly recommend this drug to anyone who needs pain relief.	F	21	4  months7.5/200mg 1X AN	7/3/2011
5	Extreme leg pain-Multiple Sclerosis	Minor constipation.	I would be couch bound 24/7 if it weren't for this medication. Other painkillers either didn't put a dent in my pain or they were so strong I would be spaced out and drooling. This is a happy, happy, medium. you can tell when it kicks in, I become a regular Chatty Cathy.	F	35	3  years7.5-200TAB 3X D	7/1/2011Email
5	Cronic back pain lower and mid back	only problem is constipation  and being way to happy at work =)	well overall it's great I just take stool softeners or mineral oil I'm managing I HAVE LESS PAIN	M	33	3  years7.5/200 3X D	4/9/2011Email
5	Widespread pain due to Lyme Disease	Stomach upset until prescribed a PPI such as Nexium or Prevacid	Used for breakthrough pain MUCH better than vicodin or norco which did absolutely nothing for my pain.  Excellent pain relief from this drug. Recommend PPI to protect stomach if on it long term	M	47	6  years7.5 4X D	2/4/2011
3	Chronic Neck & Shoulder Pain	None specifically, sometimes itchiness	This drug has helped to "take the edge off" of my chronic pain, which is moderate -severe. I am unable to tolerate Vicodin. Vicoprefen is not typically used long-term, but rather short-term; in my case it has allowed me to function- even daily activities. whereas without it, that would be difficult as the pain has been present for 17 years. It gets very hard to cope, and this med helps.	F	50	7  years7.5 3X D	11/8/2010
1	back pain	Falling asleep at work, dozing off during conversations, fell off a chair while watching TV and cracked my head with a nice black bruise, did a lovely job of taking the edge off a s****y day of work, lately of which there are many, works better than sleep aids. MAKES ME ITCH LIKE CRAZY!!!!	I was prescribed this drug for back pain because my insurance is so bad I can't afford the outrageous copays/deductibles for back surgeries so this is what manages it. Yes, it makes a sucky day at work great, until I'm nearly falling asleep and I can barely type. Then I hit the coffee and energy drinks. I have also gained 10 lbs. without changing my diet. Don't bother with it as a rec. drug unless you don't mind getting fat w/o eating anything!	F	46	5  years7.5 1X D	7/10/2010Email
5	Herniated disc, cervical	Boost of energy after 30 minutes, extreme mood swings, drowsiness and mild nausea lasting for several hours.	Works GREAT for relieving pain but side fx is not so great!	F	33	1  years7.5 3X D	6/23/2010
5	severe menstrual cramps	feels a little spacey, just wish the pain relief lasted longer	I have Crohn's disease and get very severe menstrual cramps.  The abdominal pain and cramping is so bad that I was bedridden for two days a month.  Vicroprofen makes the excruciating cramps go away and numbs my belly and uterus.  Just wish the pain relief lasted longer than two or three hours.	F	38	2  days 3X D	5/1/2010
5	fractured hand	None	I have a very high tolerance to most pain meds so it takes A LOT to get rid of pain. By the time I've reached a dose that works, I'm incoherent on other meds. On vicoprofen, I can take the recommended dose, or double for severe pain, and can function like a normal human being.  It also has the added benefit of reducing swelling a little...the only downside is it doesn't reduce swelling very much, which doesn't help when your hand is swollen to twice its normal size. I have also taken this for dental pain and it totally got rid of the "throbbing" nature of the pain.	F	38	5  days	1/22/2010Email
4	Back Pain	Restlessness, Moodiness, high feeling.	This drug works the best for me as far as the back pain goes. I've tried Percocet and like this more as far as taking the pain away.	F	34	6  days	9/2/2009
3	rotator cuff injury	halucinations, inability to orgasim, couldn't sleep	I took this for 5 days and had increasing side effects	M	34	5  days	6/29/2009
4		Slight drowsiness, Euphoria when taken a first part of day, nervousness if taken too often. Increased libido but unable to orgasm (a very twisted side effect!).	Incredible medicine when taken for a short time. Completely takes my chronic back pain away and allows me to function normally. If taken past 5:00PM, I cannot sleep.I have to switch this med out after 30 days though because it becomes ineffective after using for a month.	M	40	2  years	5/27/2009
4	endometriosis	euphoria, sometimes nausea, high energy, insomnia	I like vicoprofen ok. It only has 200mg of ibuprofen so sometimes when the pain is bad I take too many and get sick. But for the most part, its helped me out a lot.	F	24	2  years	3/27/2009
4	back pain	no pain, euphoria, sense of well being.		F	26	1  months	2/7/2009
3	severe migraine headaches	frequent urination, slight impotence, moody	I take vicoprofen 3 times day (5mg hydrocodone/tab).  It manages my headaches.  Headaches are only existant during stressful times.	M	21	2  years	9/11/2008
3	back pain and diverticulits	none	helped back pain but not diverticulits pain	M	56	5  days	6/23/2008
3	Bone Marrow Biopsy pain	nausea, dizziness, vomiting, decrease in appetite	I started taking vicoprofin after the doctor who did my bone marrow biopsy hit a nerve he wasn't supposed to. Vicoprofin got rid of the pain, but I was dizzy and throwing up everything I ate. Not really recommended.	F	21	3  days	3/6/2008
2	Lumbar Spinal Fusion	Moodiness, Mood Changes from happy to irritable and very mad, VERY scary dreams	I took this for several months as my only pain medicine following a spinal fusion. By the third month the pain was still well controlled but my mood was very depressed and getting ugly. I think this is great for short term disability but not for the 2 year recovery of back surgery!	F	30	4  months	2/13/2008
5	Menstrual cramps - endometriosis	Euphoria; sometimes energy and get tasks done; helped to sleep; constipation; makes me chatty;	Fabulous drug for severe menstrual cramps and other pain with the hydrocodone/ibuprofen combination; be careful as it can be very addictive; works way better than Vicodin, as the tylenol is a waste and is also bad for your liver; I take on an empty stomach for a better effect but be careful if you have stomach sensitivities	F	38	7  years	11/23/2007
4	degenerative disk disease/scoliosis	terrible back pain, upset stomach, itch but helped the pain very well	BEWARE! THIS WILL TRASH YOUR KIDNEYS---that's what the BACK PAIN  was all about. I noticed other people mentioned back pain. It's the ibuprofen that can damage your kidneys. doctor took me off ibuprofen and ibuprofen containing meds for good after this experience. BEWARE!	F	55	6  months	9/22/2007
5	Interstitial Cystitis	When I first started taking it, it made me drowsy.  Would have wierd dreams, leg twitching and would wake up with my arm in the air, then bent down in a wierd position.  I no longer have any of those side effects after continued use.	I wish there were something else I could take for what I have, but so far, no OTC drugs help.  Interstitial Cystitis is something I wouldn't wish on my worse enemy.  It knocks out the pain in about 1/2 hour.  I honestly don't know what I would do without the help of this drug.	F	46	2  years	9/14/2007
5	Pelvic nerve damage	euphoric feeling, overly emotional at times.	I had my 5th c-section in 2003 and it almost cost me my life. I have since had 12 surgeries for various related reasons leaving me with severe nerve damage and scar tissue in my lower abdomin and pelvic area. For 3 years I suffered in silence until I couldn't stand it any longer. I was originally put on percocet by my family doctor. Took this for one year, it certainly "covered" the pain and made me "feel" good, but I was still aware of the pain just didn't care. Finally I was reffered to a pain management doctor who took me off the percocet, which was TERRIBLE. Withdrawal made me feel like I was dying for days.... He then put me on the vicoprofen so that I would have the ibuprofen for the inflammation and the vicodin for the pain relief. It was a MIRACLE!! I went from excruciating pain everyday to an almost normal life again. I know that I am reliant on the meds. but I have weaned myself off twice and the withdrawal, while uncomfortable, was not unbearable and last	F	33	13  months	9/11/2007Email
4	Herniated disk C5/C6	At first I had some stomach cramps.  It definitely helps me if I drink a FULL GLASS of water with the dose.  Noticable energy boost about 45 min after taking.  Also noticable energy drain about 3 hrs after dose taken.  I typically take half a pill every 4 hrs, or 1/4 every 2 hrs to keep the pain relief constant.  Strong side effects (other than relief!) only occurred for me when I ran out of meds.  Extremely bad stomach and bowel cramps.  Make sure you come off this stuff slowly!	Works great for relief due to nerve damage or pressure as in my case.  I haven't experienced any addictions yet, but there is a euphoric effect with this med.  All in all this is definitely worth a try if you're hurting.  I've also tried the vicodin (hydrocodone & acetaminophen) and this works better for me.	M	29	4  months	8/30/2007
5	chest pain	none yee haa	be very careful you could build a house on that stuff very addicting took for 1 year off it now for 4 months with no with drawl i was lucky you might not be	M	40	1  years	5/18/2007
3	Back Pain	I became VERY addicted to this medication, though it helped with the pain.  I definitely needed more and more as time went on for the same effect.  BE CAREFUL, you will feel like HELL when you go off and it can really screw with your life!!!	You need to decide how severe your pain is and if it is worth being addicted to pain meds.  It is a very dangerous drug!	F	28	6  months	4/26/2007
5	Back and neck pain/auto accident	Gave me a serious boost in energy 30 minutes after doseage. Can not use at night, as I would not be able to sleep. Besides the rush, no ill effects at all.	GREAT pain med! After car wreck I had constant neck,back and shoulder pain until I started this med.	M	54	1  years	3/14/2007
4	Pleurisy	Itching of the arms, stomach, chest and back, Euphoria, Felt mentally 'foggy', decreased hunger, increased libido, sleepiness	The Vicoprofen worked pretty well for my chest plain, although I do continue to have some pain when I breath deeply.  I noticed that some people said this drug interrupted their sleep, I can sleep very well until it wears off and the pain comes back in the middle of the night.	F	24	3  days	2/21/2007
5	Neck and Back Injury	Insomnia,Dizziness,very weird dreams ,itching like mad	I have tried so many things and this is all that helps.Its worth the itching and not sleeping atleast I can function and lead somewhat of a normal life.I was in a car accident and still suffer from whipash 9 months afterwards.Some days are worse the othrs but I have my meds to take care of that now.	M	30	9  months	11/11/2006Email
5	Chronic back pain	mild excitement, mild tirdness after 5,6 hours	After herniating two discs (L4,L5-L5,S1) at work my life changed. This is the only drug that took the edge off my chronic lower back pain. I tried everything before this drug. I am so happy my doctor introduced me to vicoprofen. If your fed up with your pain.....try this medicine! Make sure you ask for vicoprofen and not vicodine. People say there the same but there not. This could make the difference in beating your pain. Vicoprofen is hydrocodon and ibuprofen mixed. I use the 7.5 mg. You need to be careful using this drug because it is addictive. I am very careful with it and use it only when I really need it. Sometimes I don't take it at all and sometimes 3 times daily. I never took more then that. Just use your head. It definitly takes care of (or hides) the pain. Just waiting on the right surgery for my situation to come along. The pain is so bad everyday that it's hard to even concentrate.    Good Luck!!	M	45	5  years	11/11/2006Email
4	chronic back pain	mild anxiety	This is the only medicine that takes the edge off the daily pain I experience. It took a long time to find something to help with my chronic pain but  I am happy I kept searching. I could at least socialize now.	M	45	5  years	10/24/2006Email
1	extracted wisdom teeth	drunk feeling, BAAAD STOMACHE&BACK PAIN!,sleepiness,chills, flu like symptoms,etc.	Been 4days since my surgery.all4were taken out.My stomache has hurt me so bad the past2days, ive woke up crying!AND Ive got this really wierd back pain..like ive been n an accident!!&ihavent!! tried eating sumthibn w/ my pills&it STILL HURTS.SOOO BAD.Olordy its a pain ive never felt!!Im sure its the meds om not use 2 taking.Im on Hydrocodone.ALSO the Hydro. was makin me ITCH LIKE CRAZY the 1st few days, so now Ihave 2 take 2 Benedryl w/it evertmie Itake it..Oman, this sux!Iwanna feel better!!My tummy&back hurt sooo dern bad! ahhg!	F	20	4  days	8/15/2006
5	Demyelinating Polyneuropathy	Except for an increase in alertness after about an hour after dose, I have had little side effect.	This was the first drug prescribed for chronic, increasing pain during the time a cause for pain was being researched.  As the pain increased, morphine was added, as well as Duragesic patch (fentenyl).  It took 3 years for a diagnosis and to begin a long term treatment.  I weaned off other pain meds, but kept Vicoprofen.  I have found that the Vicoprofen taken regularly at 6 hour intervals effectively controls (for me) the pain from permanent nerve damage that occurred prior to treatment for the disease (CIDP - Chronic Inflamatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy).  I now take 12 per day, 3 tabs x 4 doses per day, with no side effects.  For me, it has been an excellent drug, a true lifesaver.  Incidently, if you have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, chronic lyme, or other similar diseases, have your doctor consider CIDP.  Check it out yourself with a Google of CIDP. You will get the most info at www.cidpusa.org. A neurologist can test for and treat CIDP.  I am leaving my email address, al	M	65	5  years	7/22/2006Email
4	herniated discs	none	I can get around without being miserable. Works very well for my constant back pain.I'm so much happier now that I'm not in pain ALL the time.	M	36	1  months	6/8/2006
4	oral surgery-retreat root canal	My face itched alot and my chest and upper arms itched. I could not sleep very long or very deeply and I had very very vivid, odd dreams. Euphoric feeling and also weepy, like PMS. Emotional.	It most certainly helped take away the pain very quickly. I felt no pain almost immediatley after taking my dosage.	M	31	5  days	5/17/2006Email
3	Back Pain	Wonderful at first not many side effects.  Just felt better but after taking for several months began getting stomach ache.  I was so nauseous that I couldn't eat and I would vomit.	I think it is fine for short-term use but wouldn't recommend it long term.	F	33	3  months	3/8/2006
5	Oral surgery	It made me very sleepy. I slept alot during the day.	I felt no pain after surgery on my mouth. It was very effective for three days and afterwards I switched to Motrin for two days and then I stopped the Motrin.	M	42	4  days	2/14/2006
4	extracted wisdom teeth	Drowsiness	It is a powerful pain reliever and shouldn't be misused or used for extended period because tolerance and addiction occur and that defeats the purpose of the medication.	F	20	2  days	12/15/2005
5	herniated disc	euphoria, dry mouth, increased libido	I love this stuff. Took all my pain away and made me feel great! Good thing I only had 6 pills or I would have probably become dependant.	M	28	4  days	11/13/2005
5	migraines	relaxed, sleepy, and great relief	I loved it...can be very addicted. Watch out!!!	F	29	6  days	7/18/2005
4	Severe headache	Itching, drowsiness, severe mood swings.  If I lie down right away, I become very nauseated.  I've learned to sit up for about 30 minutes after taking it before lying down to avoid the nausea.	I take this medication every now and again when I get a headache that just won't go away, and it does help.  However, I worry about the possibility of dependence so I try to take it only when I absolutely have to.  I get very emotional when I take this medicine and I find myself calling or writing friends to tell them how much I care about them!	F	33	7  months	7/17/2005Email
5	Back pain after car accident	Euphoria, constipation with extended use	This drug is wonderful for patients, like me, who are allergic to Tylenol. It is a great pain reliever, although I have been off and on it for years and it can lead to medical dependence. But if you have a severe injury, this is often unavoidable. Take with food, and at the first sensation of pain for best result. It also works longer than most over drugs in the opioid family...I recommend this medication if you are really in pain.	F	21	4  years	5/7/2005
5	Grade 4 Osteoarthritis - both knees		Vicoprofen, like most opiods, seems to work better at smaller doses taken more frequently.  If you experience side effects like drowsiness and/or interrupted sleep, split the tablet in half and take 1/2 at shorter intervals.  Be sure to use Metamucil or increase your intake of dietary fiber while taking any opiods as they can cause significant constipation.	M	52	3  months	4/28/2005
2	pain due to kidney stones	aching burning sensation in middle/lower back (kidney area), intoxicated feeling, anxiety, tremors, abnormally vivid dreams	Helped acute pain, but wasn't worth the side effects	F	22	2  days	2/6/2005
5	pain	none	better than vicodin because it only contains 200mg of ibuprofen unlike vicodin which contains 500mg of tylenol. In the event your dr. ever wants to prescribe you vicodin see I prefer vicoprofen.	M	41	7  days	12/28/2004

3	Crushed ankle	Truncated	Some of my post didn't show. I've taken Lortab but that has Tylonol and Tylonol has never helped me with pain, but Lortab did give me a little relief. My question is, would Vicoprofin allow me to reduce my daily intake of ibuprofen due to the hydrocodone???   Thanks, Bret	M	41	0  times	12/28/2004
1	psoriatic arthritis	anorexia, mental fogginess, emotional outbursts	i've never had such a bad reaction to a drug.  i found out later that i was allergic to ibuprofen, so perhaps that was why i had such a terrible reaction.	F	36	2  years	11/27/2004
4	costochrondritis	after 2 doses - severe itching all over. Hiccups. Went to sleep and woke up with breathing difficulty and racing heart. Went to emergency room where they said it was an allergic reaction. Doctor said to stop the vicoprofen.	It worked great on the pain so if you don't have allergic reaction to it , it is good.	F	48	2  times	9/27/2004
5	radiculopathy/back pain/post surg.	love the stuff.  makes one a bit drowsy, but I found that this stuff was so potent that 1/2 the dose took the pain away, and then I had no drowsiness, but still pain relief.  I didn't ever take the full doses b/c then side effects were too drowsy.  Found that if I took only when I had pain, and not on a regular basis, the pain would go away, and no drowsiness.

3	Bipolar 2	I was hypomanic after the death of my father in November. Began taking Depakote in early December for anger/rage/mood problems.  Psych suggested Abilify might help Depakote work better.  While my mood is better and my anger issues are nearly non-existent now, I'm finding I'm still a bit hypomanic and the Abilify creates extreme restlessness in me.  While my house has never looked better and I'm getting lots of project done, I find I can't sit still for longer than 10 minutes and by the end of the day my feet ache for being on them so long running around in the house and doing all my projects.	Together with Depakote.  Doc now prescribing propranolol for agitation/restlessness/irritability - would rather prescribe additional med for side effect than change primary meds...and I agree with his decision.  Doc now bumping me up to 10mg 1xday and propranolol 10mg 1xday.	F	36	7  weeks5mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email
1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
