5	Type 2 diab	i was diagnosed with Type 2 in 2003.  I started taking pills.  however, 3 yrs later my sugar got out of control sort of.  i was hospitalized and started on a strict diet.  I was put on insulin in 2005.  I only take 50 units 2 times a day.  so far, I can say that my sugar has had better readings and I feel alot better.  my diet has helped and my eating habits have changed a great deal.  i walk more and in general, i feel great.	proper management under doctor's advise is the cure.  insulin, diet, medication and a good family doctor has helped me stabalize my sugars and feel better about myself.
