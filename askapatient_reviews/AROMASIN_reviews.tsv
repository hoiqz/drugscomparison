3	bc/st 1/nonmet./6.1 cm/est. pos	Hotflashes, vaginal dryness, painful intercourse, insomnia, almost nightly headaches (middle of night) that don't help insomnia, rapidly aged skin, muscle cramps, thin hair, facial hair, loss of muscle tone, high blood pressure (was always low before).  Incessant perspiration.	The hotflashes have improved somewhat.  However, I am sick of the constant perspiring!!  My skin is messed up (was always complimented on my skin looking so young before).  Aged.  Am on DHEA cream for vag. dryness. Seems to help.  The headaches at night are maddening.  I NEED SLEEP.  I was only stage one with no metastases (spelled right?)  I wonder if this is necessary.	F	55	5  years25 mg 1X D	3/11/2013Email
3	Stage 1 Breast Cancer	Haven't really experienced any side effects with Aromasin to date.   I had breast cancer 9 years ago and took  tamoxifen (no effects) for three years and then Femara.  Femara made me feel like I was 100 years old.  I took for two years and then quit.  I think that it was over several months that it made me feel that way.  It seemed like it was a cumulative effect over time.   So far, tho, so good with Aromasin.  We'll see over time		F	54	2  months25 mg 1X D	11/11/2012Email
3	breast cancer-- bone mets	All went well for first 2 months; then side effects kicked in. Almost immediately, had a craving for sweets; then at 2 months, severe mood swings, some Pain bottom of feet; At 3 months, shoulders and neck pain, severe insomnia; 3 months, nausea and dizzyiness.	The most dibilitating side effects for me, because I have to speak publicly in my work, is the naseau (It seems to sweep over me and then passes about half an hour). I had been taking right after breakfast, I am now going to take in afternoon. It seems nausea occurs with me about 4-5 houyrs after takining.	F	62	4  months 1X D	11/5/2012Email
1	stage 3a breast cancer- estrogen po	severe bone, joint, muscle pain, loss of short term memory. This has disrupted my life completely, although I keep a good attitude. I needed to see that I am not alone. I am considering going off the med to see where I am at with pain, so I can gauge what meds I need and dont need. I want my life back !	It was prescribed to me after all other choices of aramatase inhibitors failed. It does the job, but after having a total hysterectomy in 2010, I wonder if I even need it, I certainly dont need the side effects !	F	44	1  years25mg 1X D	10/25/2012Email

I am on it optionally now, but I am truly scared to go off it as I am sure it is keeping me alive and micromestastes at bay.  Quality of life is an issue thought and right now I cannot do the things I have enjoyed all my life, including dance.  It might not be Aromasin but certainly from reading previuos posts, I am wondering.	F	55	4  years 1X D	10/2/2012
1	Stage 1 Breast Cancer - 3 Tumors	24/7 Headaches (enough to get an MRI which was clean), gained 30 pounds in 4 months, burning in arms and legs that feels like they are on fire, joint/muscle pain (have RA which was under control until this drug), extreme fatigue, memory loss, vaginal dryness.	Took tamoxifen for a year with a few side effects (hot flashes were the worst) but bearable.  They switched me to Aromasin in February because of being post-menopausal.  Feels like I have had one long headache ever since.  Stopped taking it 4 days ago - does anyone know how long it will take to get out of my system?  Going to ask my oncologist to put me back on tamoxifen.	F	53	4  months25 1X D	7/9/2012Email
2	Stage 2 Breast Cancer	I started on Arimidex after lumpectomy, chemo & radiation. I didn't last long - 6 months - felt like 80 years old. My oncologist switched me to aromasin. It was tons time better! 2 years later - in last 6 months-  I have severe pains and need Tylenol or ibuprofen daily. Legs, hips mostly. Most recently, I can't close my right hand into a fist and middle finger is "trigger" finger. Working out at gym seems to help. Feel sluggish but my family doctor has me on phentermine (30 mg) and I take it almost daily unless I sleep in. (insomnia if you take too late in day). Tired of pain and not being able to walk fast but will tough it out if necessary!!  Question I have is does anyone ever get these little shots of pain randomly all over every once in a while?

Rapid 30lb weight gain.foot and hand aches,no energy, carpal tunnel type pain in wrists, sad feeling and tired.VERY stiff in joints, especially after sitting or sleeping. Irritable!!

1	Stage 2B Metastatic Breast Cancer	Weight Gain, Nausea, bone pain, developed protruding growths on my tendons in my hands, foot pain, acne, menopausal symptoms even though I have already gone through menopause, water retention, craving for sweets, a veeling of fullness or heaviness all over my body.  Only someone who has taken this drug should prescribe it!  Of couse the drs don't tell you about the side effects because they have never taken it.  My dr actually said and I quote " I can't believe you would go through Chemo and then question me about taking a little pill"  I said the reason I was questioning him was because I was scared to death and I had cancer, all he had was a degree!  I asked him did he have cancer?  Has he gone through this?  He said no, I said so pretty much you don't know the answer right? "  He was so pissed off at me but I don't care, it is my body, my breasts, my life and I have a right to know.	I have 4 more years to go on this drug and I am afraid that it is only doing me harm vs getting rid of any cancer in my body.  The chemotherapy I did for 8 months wasn't this bad.  If I thought I could get away with not taking this drug and be "normal" again I would stop it in a heartbeat.  Just typing this is making my hands ache.  it is a horrible thing to not be able to discuss the side effects with someone who knows what they are talking about.  There are very few drs that have been through this so of course they say that there are no side effects, they have never taken this drug.  they perhaps should listen to the people that have taken the drug but none of us have those things that they have,,,,a degree, all we have is cancer.	F	61	10  days25 mg 1X D	4/7/2012Email
2	estrogen positive	hands, knees, and feet really hurt. hot flashes, mood swings, fatigue.  my blood glucose levels and blood pressure have increased even though I am losing weight	I had stage 0 breast cancer/dcis.

1	breast cancer	Stiff joints, extreme pain in joints and muscles.  Like giving myself the flu everyday.	I have early stage breast cancer--I resent having a blanket dose of 25mg per day prescribed when less doses are effective according to the studies I've read. 25mg is the same dose for mestaaticized BC. used to strink tumors--i don't have that!!

1	post breast cancer	arthritis in my hips, which was a nuisance but did not really affect my quality of life, has been greatly exacerbated.  I cannot put on my socks or tie shoes.  Pains in hips, knees, shins and feet at night.  Difficulty rolling over in bed and getting out of chairs.  I also have carpal tunnel symptoms. I am having a trial period of a month off the medication.  I have been off for three weeks.  I have been going to physical therapy three times a week for the past ten weeks, and have finally seen quite a bit of improvement the last week or two.  Also have hot flashes.	My first breast cancer (2002) had no estrogen involvement.  My second, this past year, had a very small amount.  I am thinking of asking the oncologist to take me off this medicine when I see her next week after my four week trial dropping the exemestane.	F	66	4  months25 mg 1X D	2/7/2012Email

1	Had Breast Cancer Stage 1	Within 2 weeks after starting this medication these symptoms set in. Numbness, major joint pain, all fingers/thumb triggering, burning, cannot make a fist in both hands, pain in forearms and now shooting pains in hands.  Stopped medication approx. 4 weeks ago but still have these side effects. My  Doctor and also the Oncologist were pushing carpel tunnel syn surgery.  They seem to  have no knowledge of this serious side effect of the medication I was prescribed. Or had their head in the sand.	Any suggestions to reverse side effects would be greately appreciated and if anyone can give me an idea of a time frame they got back to normal after stopping this medication,I would welcome that information also.	F	69	4  months 1X D	11/27/2011
1	Stage IIB breast camcer	Severe thumb and wrist pain. Trigger thumb.	I started taking Femara which only lasted for 3 months. I had severe side effect such as body pain, confusion, difficulty getting up in the morning and walking. I would hobble around the house for 2-3 hours before I could really stand up straight and walk normally. My joints hurt so bad I could not sleep at night.	F	61	3  months 1X D	11/25/2011Email
2	Follow up to lumpectomy	Off and on shoulder pain, extreme depression, tiredness, hot flashes, muscle and bone pain in legs, dizziness, heart palpitations, headache, hair loss, memory problems, extreme sugar cravings	I started off with only hot flashes, but now have so many side effects I'm considering going off the drug. Tried to take it every other day, but there was no improvement. The two side effects that affect me the most are the heart palpitations and the depression. I'm also worried about bone loss due to osteoporosis and having already broken a wrist and a hip.	F	75	4  months20 mg 1X D	11/7/2011Email
2	Prevent breast cancer recurrence	After 2 years on Tamoxifen, switched to Arimidex.  Only lasted 3 months, then switched to Aromasin.  Muscle and joint pain all over body, trouble walking in the morning, hair loss, gained 30 lbs, severe fatigue.  Most severe pain was tendonitis in both thumbs and both wrists which was debilitating.  Had to wear splints and was awake all night with pain.  Oncologist discounted this as a side effect of the medication so I am looking for treatment elsewhere.  Off this drug for 2 weeks, I am already seeing significant improvement to wrists, but not to thumbs.  I have currently been switched back to Tamoxifen.	I feel guilty for not completing the three years on this drug.  I can accept the full body pain which at times can be depressing.  I can also accept and endure the other side effects, but the wrist and thumb pain...feeling as if all of my tendons are moving and popping, and almost fainting from the pain each time I take a shower...l could not endure that.  I am hoping that this damage is not permanent!	F	56	7  months25 MG 1X D	10/27/2011Email
3	breast cancer	Must decide if the side effects are interupting the quality of your life.  Muscle stiffness and joint pain limit my activities.  Doctors don't always tell you side effects you might experience.  Report every physical and emotional change to your physician.		F	64	4  years25 mg 1X D	6/27/2011Email
2	stage 1 lobular breast cancer	Because Arimidex caused so many side effects (I posted several times on the Arimidex page), my doctor suggested trying Aromasin. After taking just one pill, I had painful, sudden reflux causing painful, long-lasting burning in my esophagus.	Arimidex had also caused many digestive problems, but not the terrible burning. The original side effects from Arimidex were nearly gone when I started Aromasin, but it made the digestion problems start all over again: reflux, burning, bloating, gas all the time, smelly stools, and loose stools. With this much discomfort and interference with my daily activities, I stopped at one pill and will wait till symptoms improve and try again. If this does not work, I am stopping altogether. My surgeon is wonderful and agreed with me that existing in misery in order to take a pill that may (or may not) help with a recurrence of cancer isn't much of a life. I'd rather be functional and enjoy life to the fullest than be miserable for five years taking a medicine that my body is clearly rejecting! It concerns me that this type of medicine may have long lasting effects on our bodies. Reading the posts for Arimidex and Femara nearly bring tears to my eyes -- we are not making this up, yet it seems that we have to defend ourselves if we have a doctor who refuses to acknowledge with compassion what we are going through. That's why I quit two oncologists and have a new, very understanding and empathetic doctor. What I want as a patient is to be heard.	F	66	1  days25 mg 1X D	6/3/2011Email
3	Stage 2 hormone receptive breast ca	Took Tamoxifen for two years-switched to Aromasin third year at doc's suggestion.  Less dangerours side effects.  Bones good. Horrible hot flushes and lack of sleep becasuse of. Vaginal area dried up. Gained 30 pounds immediately and have less energy (lack of sleep-exercising less?)Memory loss-have a horible time remebering names of even people I know well sometimes.	Went off for over two months and slept better and had almost normal skin in vaginal area.  Checked in with oncologist who suggested that as my hot flushes were not a great deal less than before, I might consider going back on as we don't really know if I would recurr or not without it.  Cost has gone up dramatically, but husband does not want to take a chance of recurrance.  Memory loss is my greatest concern, other wise can deal with the rest.

2	locally advanced Stage 3C Breast Ca	Insomnia, rolling hot flashes, severe joint pain, bone pain, muscle pain, nausea & vomiting, 30 pound weight gain in the first 6 months, fatigue, and some hair thinning.	The pain is worse in my feet and hands, sometimes debilitating. I have had to go on several "medication vacations" of 2-3 weeks duration every so many months -- with my Oncologist's knowledge - in order to agree to stay on the Aromasin for 5 years. HATEFUL drug	F	61	17  months25 mg 1X D	2/14/2011Email
1	stage 2 breast cancer after mastec.	Intense pain on my shoulders and the outside of my arms.  I could feel the pain even when my arms and shoulder were still.  I cried out in pain.  I did not take pain medication because of a long drive to work.  I stopped taking it for a month earlier this year to see if it was causing the pain.  I think I need to stop it for a longer period since the shoulder/arm/elbow pain has increased significantly over the past year.  A shoulder specialist told me it was a pinched nerve; my family doctor said it was osteoarthritis (funny how it started in both shoulders and arms at the same time, isn't it); my original oncologist didn't think aromasin was the problem.  However, my keen intuition says it is and the shoulder pain comments I've read from others taking aromasin, tells me it is.  I'll speak with my new oncologist after the holidays.

3	stage 2 breast cancer	I was on femara prior to aromasin.  The pain was awful. I ached in my knees so bad I couldn't walk at times, feet hurt when I first stand up. Week hand muscles, hair is not growing back like it should. Night sweats,ache like I have the flu most days. Memory is better than it was on Chemo but not back to normal. Dr. switched me to Aromasin and the pain is less. It is bearable but I still have all the same symptons.  5 years of this makes me wonder - there must be a better way.

1	estrogen fed breast cancer	I have not taken this drug. I chose to have a total vaginal hysterectomy with removal of my ovaries.	There are 3 places that estrogen comes from. Ovaries, Adrenal Glands and Fat Cells. I have removed my ovaries and I eat very well and exercise. I would rather live a quality life than one filled with pain. I'm mentally stable and love life. I've read so many cases of women who are taking these estrogen blockers and still have a recurrance. I took femara and by the 4th day I couldn't straighten out my left middle finger, had back pain and headaches. It's a choice you have to make. I wish everyone the best and remember one thing. You're in charge of your own life. There are success stories of people who contine to keep  cancer at bay by the way they choose to live. Exercise and diet go hand in hand, one without the other will not work. I went straight into menopause after surgery but I'm  taking suppliments that are estrogen free to handle the hot flashes. If you need any positive reinforcement please email me. I'll be happy to help. I'm not a doctor, just a woman who has had breast cancer and chooses quality of life.	F	46	0  days	9/8/2009Email
5	Breast cancer; stage 1; node neg	I have had NO side effects with this medicine and would highly recommend it to anyone who has been on Femara with bad side effects.	Although I haven't been on this medicine for a long time, I know that I would have already experienced the side effects by now.  I was on Femara (which to say the least, was a total nightmare)for about 2 months but the side effects were well on their way within a few doses.  Aromasin is a godsend!	F	54	1  weeks	8/16/2009Email
2	Stage I breast cancer	I am experiencing hot flashes; severe joint pain with extreme stiffness after sitting for more than 20 minutes; carb cravings; worsening of carpal tunnel symptoms; numbness in fingers; imsomnia; uncontrolled emotional swings (unexpected crying); difficulty to concentrate (could be residual chemo brain); pronounced fatigue due to greater joint pain experienced.	I would like to switch to an alternative aromatase inhibitor but I'm afraid they all have negative side effects.  I will try to eliminate or at least cut down on animal proteins and instead attempt to get more protein from grains, fruits and veggies.	F	55	60  days	8/7/2009
2	Femara side effects	Started Aromasin two weeks ago after 7 months on Femara. Switched due to side effects, which have been worse on aromasin. I have severe fatigue. It's like going through chemo again. Joint pain, bone pain, headaches, hot flashes, having trouble sleeping. Heaviness in chest for last two days, like I had after each Herceptin treatment. I see my oncologist next week. I'm almost to the point of going off these meds and taking my chances. Quality of life is so important to me. If I have 5 or 10 years before the cancer returns, I'd rather live it without these symtoms!!!		F	61	2  weeks	7/2/2009Email
1	stage 1 breast cancer	joint pain and stiffness, extreme anxiety, hyped up, sleep disturbance, memory loss, hot flashes - but the worst was that I had frequent heart palpitations and several episodes of cardiac arrythmia which has stopped now that I am off the drug.	I think the extreme depletion of estrogen caused by this drug was more than my body could handle.  I know the studies are positive in terms of it being effective in preventing a recurrence for stage 1 breast cancer, but I did not want to sacrifice my heart in the process!	F	64	16  months	5/9/2009
2	stage 2 breast cancer 6 yrs ago	initially arm and wrist pain culminating in severe pain of the wrists mri scan confirms ulnar synovitis	Why does this occur? What is the treatment?

3	because Femara was a killer	right arm hurts between shoulder and elbow, had issue with left ankle hurting like it was broken.  left leg hurts early in the morning, must use heating pad to sleep.  But still better than Femara.	Aromasin is the best one for me so far.  Femara is awful Arimidex caused mood changes and joint pain.  It seems that they could come up with something better.  Has anyone had ankle issues?	F	58	75  days	2/16/2009Email
2	Recurrence breast cancer	Terrible joint and muscle pain.  No energy whatsoever.	Started off on Tamoxifen and my consultant changed that after two years to Arimidex but with the joint pain was changed to Aromasin.  Unfortunately I am still in severe pain - paracetamol etc do not help and strong painkillers upset my stomach.  Feel like stopping Aromasin altogether but scared of the bc recurring.

My oncologist put me on Femara, took it 2 months, had about 25 side effects...I told my Dr. I cannot take this any more, get me off of this.  So was put me on Arimidex, tried it for 2 months - found it to be equally untollerable, many side effects, felt like I had chemo brain much worse than when I was on chemo, to the point of not being sure I could find my way home on several days...told my doctor that it was not worth it, who cares if it might prolong life if you are unable to function, told them I was going to end up on Soc Sec disability for mental impairment if I stayed on it, it scared me to be on it.  So then they put me on Aromasin...after 2 months started getting headaches, felt ill (flu-like + more) all the time, was exhausted all the time - insomnia for 3-4 nights, then would "colap	F	54	6  months	4/4/2008Email

2	BC Stage IIC invasive	Took Tamoxifen for 2 yrs with side effects that included extreme hot flushes, nausea (like morning sickness), horrible insomnia & headaches.  Switched to Aromasin for next 2 yrs and it was tolerable for the first 6 months with same side effects as Tamoxifen.  Then the bone & joint pain in the outer extremities started. Couldn't get out of a bed or a seated position or do stairs without feeling like a cripple.  Mornings were worse & I too had the 'claw' effect with terrible weakness in my hands. Ankles felt fragile, as though the bones would break with the slightest pressure.  Once healthy libido disappeared, urogenital system dried up & cholesterol levels tripled, although no change in exercise & diet. Doctor switched me to Femara 2 months ago.  After the 1st week, I actually slept for two whole nights & felt awesome! Then the side effects of the Femara kicked in & it's starting to feel the same as with the Aromasin.	I'm so thankful to have found this website! Over the last few years, I've so often thought that I was the only one experiencing these awful side effects. Until diagnosis, I was very fit & worked out 5x/week - weights and cardio. I continued to work & work-out even through chemo cycles. Now I feel like a 90 yr old asexual being. Chemo-induced menopause presented its own challenges but these Aromatase-Inhibitor side effects continue to affect the quality of my life.  Doctors are quick to offer Rx for side effects but each Rx has its own risks & side effects. It's a domino effect & I just want to feel 'normal' again & get on with my life.  It would be so different if we were dealing with a broken arm.  An X-ray would show the break, time would heal the fracture & then it would be nothing but a memory.  Nobody knows if these AI drugs even work on something we don't even know is or isn't there.  Quality vs Quantity of life should be addressed by somebody!	F	50	2  years	1/3/2008Email

2	prevent recurrence of breast cancer	Horrible insomnia, brain fog, depression, food cravings/weight gain.  Like worse case of PMS ever and getting worse each month. Lost 70 pounds after diagnosis & kept off till started Aromasin.  Put 40 back on in about 3 months. Just couldn't make my brain care or tell me to stop craving carbs.	I was estrogen+ and HER2+. Had mastectomy/chemo/radiation and over 2 years on Tamoxifen. Did great. Switched to Aromasin and immediately things started going wrong.  After one year, I have refused to take.  Even people at work commented how much better I seemed to be after I stopped taking for two weeks. Began sleeping the whole night w/in two days of stopping.  Have lost 4 lbs. My brain works! Oncologist REALLY wants me to be on adjuvant therapy for another 2 years or so. Will start Arimidex next week. Trying to be positive.	F	56	1  years	8/28/2007
3	Breast Cancer Stage 2	Stiffness in hands, feet, knees and neck. Fuzzy head, memory loss.  Feel "old". Achy when I get up from sitting. Bone density is declining per scans to opteopenia. Same side effects but worse w/Arimidex.	I took tamoxifen 1st year, Arimidix my second year,Aromasin my 3rd yr(now) and thinking of asking my doctor to switch to Femara or back to tamoxifen for the last 2 years.	F	51	365  days	7/13/2007
1	estrogen-sensitive breast cancer	Severe joint pain, carpal tunnel syndrome in left arm, painful feet, weight gain, digestive problems, especially constipation.	My doctor put me on Aromasin after I had complained about the unbearable side effects I was experiencing with Arimidex.  However, after a couple of months of the new drug I felt even worse than I had felt when taking Arimidex.  I ache all over all day and night and can no longer exercise or carry things. It is now 18 months since I first started taking exemestane medicine,  and I have decided to give it up for a month before I next see my cancer specialist.  He had mentioned to me about five months ago that, since I was one of those patients who had experienced extreme side effects, perhaps I could benefit by switching to Tamoxifen.  I must say I'm not keen.  I have discussed the question with my family doctor and pyschotherapist, and both agree that, in the end, only I take the decision to stop. So that's what I am going to do.

1	To prevent reccurance	After three weeks of taking this drug my doctor switch me to arimidex (not much better) due to joint pain, headaches, nausea and vomiting.		F	45	3  weeks	2/18/2007
4	post -op breast cancer treatment	Trigger thumb and wrist pain.	I started taking Aromasin as an alternative to Arimidex, which had given me severe joint pains and general discomfort.  Apart from developing trigger thumb and wrist pain - since dealt with by my rheumatologist - I have been feeling much better on Aromasin and no longer have painful feet and joints.  A great improvement.	F	64	2  months	10/2/2006Email
3	Breast Cancer Stage 4	Depression, anxiety, frequent hot flashes.	I had no side effects from the previous drug I was on, which was Femara.  As soon as I started taking Aromasin I felt a deep depression overcome me, as well as considerable anxiety.  I don't know yet if the drug is helping slow down my cancer.  I've been on it for a little over 2 months.	F	56	2  months	9/25/2006

5	breast cancer, cannot take tamoxafi	Foot and leg achiness, short term memory problems.  Feel very old some days but that has not deterred me from going to the gym four times per week.  I am in better shape today than before my BRCA. I take Tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain.	As my oncologist said, it is only pain.  There are no real side effects due to the leg and foot pain.  I am Factor V positive and cannot take tamoxifin.  I trust my oncologist as he is one of the pioneers in discovering and treating hormone receptive BRCA.  Thanks to my doc at the U of Michigan, I have an excellent prognosis, and that is really what it is all about. No pain, no gain!	F	52	1.5  years	4/1/2006
4	Stage 2 breast cancer	Tired, short-term memory loss, travelling pain throughout body, frozen thumb, stiff fingers.	On tamoxifen 1 1/2 years and aromasin about 2 years.  Doctor switched me to aromasin due to estrogen driven tumor. Increased to 600-800 IU of Vitamin D. This eliminated the travelling pain. Frozen thumb is pretty much back to normal. INCREASED VITAMIN D REALLY HELPED THE PAIN! Eliminated carbonated drinks containing phosphoric acid.	F	68	2  years	3/29/2006

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.
