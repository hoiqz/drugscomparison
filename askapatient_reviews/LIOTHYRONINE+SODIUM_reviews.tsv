5	Hypothyroid	Mild increase in heart rate for first 20 minutes.	After 13 years of Synthroid only (total thyroidectomy) I feel like my old self.  I've cried countless tears in the last week....tears of joy.  Lab were always "normal" but I always complained of not feeling sharp, happy, capable, friendly, kind to family/friends etc.  My career is back on track.  I take 137 mcg Synthroid which is still excedingly valuable to keep a nice base, then this Cytomel bump to get me the rest of the way back to myself.  Otherwise I get too cold at night when the Cytomel wears off; fyi, it only is in your system for 6-8 hours, then it's gone.  Thank you Jesus.	M	41	6  days2.5 mcg 3X D	3/25/2013Email

5	Hashimoto's	Mostly none but sometimes feel very slightly shaky "inside"  but with no outward display of shakiness.	Absolute miracle for me. I take 25 mcg on waking and 12.5 around noon (or six hours later).  Without the second dose I'm tired and become negative/slightly depressed. After years of wondering what was wrong with me, I now think I was hypothyroid for a long time, maybe 20 years. I am a different person, more alert (no more brain fog), more confident, with much more stamina and energy, losing weight I couldn't lose no matter what. I don't feel like hiding anymore. Am taking Paddock brand.	F	64	120  days37.5mcg 1X D	12/16/2012Email
5	sythroid levels were too high	only positive effects,  more energy, clear thinking, no more constipation, no more headaches, skin improvement,  no need for afternoon naps.  great addition to synthyroid., as the synthyroid alone did nothing for my hypo symptoms.		F	52	60  days12.5 3X D	8/18/2012
4	weight gain, bery tired and sluggis	A lot of energy and very hungry. I eat what I want and haven't gained any or lost any weight.  I do have a problem falling and staying asleep once in awhile but after having a few alcoholic drinks,  I might as well forget about sleeping. Feel very alert. Sometimes I feel shaky but it goes away after I eat. I like cytomel a lot better than synthroid.		F	28	3  weeks5 mcg 2x d	7/8/2012
1	Possible hypothyroidism	Note:  Generic Cytomel.  Hot flashes and heat intolerance, increased body temp including one or more fevers.  First three days, seemed to feel more optimistic.  Then for most of past 23 days, irritable, feeling "not right," crying for hours and feeling hopelessly depressed, unable to eat.  Getting levels checked today and hope to stop taking it.	Been feeling so bad emotionally and unlike myself, but it took me a while to connect it to the Mylan generic drug.  It's definitely not for me or the generic is no good.  In past learned generic drugs often are dissimilar to the brand names.	F	61	26  days5 mg 2X D	5/29/2012Email
5	Hypothyroidism	I take 88 mcg Synthroid every day and 5 mcg Cytomel 3x per day (15 mcg a day.) My endo told me to space the dosage of Cytomel every 5 hours - EX: 8:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m. None!!!	I take 88 mcg of Synthroid every day and 5 mcg Cytomel 3x a day (15 mcg a day.) I space my doses out  as follows : Synthroid - 6:00 a.m. Cytomel - 8:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m. This is perfect for me. I began taking 5 mcg a day and slowly moved up to 15 after about 5 months. I didn't do well on Synthroid alone. Cytomel suppresses TSH, but my endo says that TSH can be meaningless after treatment has begun and he doses based on free t4 and free t3 levels and how I'm feeling. I feel fantastic! No more brain fog and exhaustion. Cytomel completely stopped my hair loss and now it is full and healthy again. This medication totally changed my life and made me feel healthy again.

3	Hypo/hyper thyroidism	Feel back to normal after morning dose of 5mg, more energy, clarity.	I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism at 28 yes old after my second child was born.  Was put on 100 mg of levithroid for 15 years with very minimal dosage adjustments.  I did great on it.  In 2009, all hell broke loose with my hormones.  Went into perimenopause and my thyroid was out of whack.  For 3 years I have been suffering with dizziness, fatigue, weight gain, heart palps, irregular periods and horrible pms.  Saw a homeapathic hormone specialist the last year and she has been tweaking my thyroid as it keeps fluctuating from high t4to low t3 and reverse t3.  She put me on a high dose of t3 compound, for 10 months I was fine on it but the last month has been complete HELL with major fatigue dizziness and heart palps and anxiety attacks.  Was finally referred to an endocronolgist from my regular insurance just this week.  She put me on 3 days (taper down) of cytomel twice a day 50 mg to 10 mg.  Starting 150 levithroid tomorrow once daily.  The cytomel feels like a burst of energy to me for about 5 hours, then I plummet into extreme fatigue again be foe my second dose.   I hope starting back on the levithroid will balance things back again.  I want my life back again.	F	45	3  days10 2X D	4/29/2012Email
1		At first, my levels were a little on the low side, so my doctor put me on 5 mcg cytomel. After only 1 week she checked my blood again and said that there was no change. I thought this was weird because usually you wait 3 weeks after starting a new medication. She bumped me up to 25mcg. I was on the small side (120, 5'6'') and I thought that was quite a jump. Well after 3 weeks on 25mcg, I have INTENSE chest pains, and diffeculty breathing. And now I am only 112 lbs. My endo told me to stop it right away. I am now on the hyper end for my thyroid, and my endo wants to put me on synthroid. I do not understand this at all seeing as his a hormone replacement, and if my levels are already high, why would he want to give me more? This is the 3rd doctor that has tried to do this to me here. I just feel like death everyday. In and out of the ER. I wish I would have just went with my gut feeling and only took a half instead of the full 25mcg. I trusted doctors with my life, as you should be able		F	25	21  days25 mcg 1X D	4/10/2012Email
1	my doctor is playing with my meds	I have a doctor appt this friday, but might just go off this horrible med myself. I have suffered Thyroid issues for 30 years. The ONLY drug that has ever helped me is Armour. Which in December I was fine on Armour, had NO Side effects, numbers were in the low normal range, but I FELT FINE. My doctor went to some conference, changed all his patients, and now I feel like a handicapped person. The pain in my legs, joint pain, stiffness, feeling like my knees are going to crumble and give out on me is HORRIBLE!! I am depressed, cry every day, and I am miserable !! I HATE cytomel and do not suggest if for everyone. By the way, I am very angry at my doctor for playing with my meds. IF you are a doctor out there reading this, listen to your patients symptoms first before deciding what is the right course of action. I was fine on Armour and never should have been taken off.

5	hypothyroidism	occasional headaches	I felt horrible on T4 alone but since T3 was added, I feel great, have lost 9 lb (in 3 wks) and my mood has entirely improved. I also suffer from low progesterone so I have been taking DHEA and Prometrium as well.	F	32	3  weeks2.5 mcg 1X D	3/21/2012Email
5	Hypothyroid	Cytomel in combination with T4 has been extremely helpful to me. But I also made sure that I was taking vitamins that supported my thyroid including magnesium, iodine, B vitamins and most importantly a good multi-vitamin and Vitamin D. Most of my research shows that a good endocrinologist will treat with a combination on T3 and T4. If yours is saying no, and you don't feel good on T4 alone, demand that they let you try the T3. If they still say no, write the head of the hospital where they work, or find another doctor. It is your life! Make sure you feel good and demand answers if you don't!

2	Hypothyroidism (Low Thyroid)	Generic version (12.5 mcg  half of a 25 mcg. Tablet)  Experienced fatigue and sleepiness along with some very slight burning in my nostrils.  I also felt a little foggy-minded and dizzy.	I don't think I even needed this and that the initial fatigue I had with the Levoxyl was due to my body having to take the time to convert the T4 to T3 (since I stopped the Armour Thyroid and it had T3 in it already).  [Note:  I was taking Armour Thyroid prior to this and it didn't seem to do much].	M	49	7  days12.5 mcg 1X D	3/5/2012
1	Depression	Tremor, forgetfulness, slight weight gain, really messed up thyroid, shortness of breath	I recently went to my primary doctor for my quarterly checkup and he told me that when he saw my blood tests, they read that my thyroid was "really out of whack" and recommended I stop taking it. He was also going to send the recommendation to my psychiatrist. I took his advice, threw the remaining pills down the toilet and will seek an adjunct antidepressant. It also did nothing for my depression anyway.	F	48	3  months25 1X D	12/24/2011Email
2	hypothyroid; reduced T3	Started at 1/day and had increased appetite and weight gain-- 5lbs the first week.  My MD told me to up to two times a day if I wasn't feeling relief from my symptoms(always cold, tired etc) and I did that about 3 weeks ago.  My appetite normalized BUT I have gained about 8 pounds in 6 wks.  I still feel cold, tired and "brain fogged".		F	34	45  days5mcg 2X D	10/15/2011Email
5	Hypothyroid, Deppression, & Fatigue	Much less Agitation and nervousness than in the past so far	My personal experience has shown me that the benefits of taking T-3 far outweigh of side effects of T-4, If T-3 is started at very low doses (5 mcg) and is gradually increased over 2- 3 Months. I remember what the agitation was like when I tried to increase my dose to 25 mcg. of T-3 too quickly. I started my dosage at 5 mcg/day and then up to 5x day at 3 to 5 hour intervals. I then increased my dosages up to 10 mcg 3X day. Sometimes the afternoon doses can be reduced to 5 mcg.for the entire day. For about a year, I needed 30 to 35 mcg. of T-3 a day to prevent real nasty depression and to avoid memory loss associated with Hypothroid. Thyroid Resistance may be the issue in my case. I've been very blessed in the last 3 days in that I seem to be holding out on just 15 mcg/day(5mcg at 7:00, 11;00 & 3:00) believe that it's possible for some people on thyroid medication to have more complications with T-4 than T-3. You might want to check out Dr. Lowe's website regarding this: http://www.drlowe.com/ If you find that T-3 works better than T-4, you will probably eventually have a suppressed TSH(in taking at least 25 mcg. which is normal & temporary although endocrinologists don't like the notion  When taking T-3, you really have to adjust your dose and ask yourself which is worse: a little nervousness or more depression, poor memory& focus?  Very small amounts of the right tranquilizers can offset the nervousness.I am only partially in agreement with Wilson's Temperature	M	62	16  months5mcg 3X D	9/22/2011EmailHistory
4	Depression	Perhaps increased appetite	This is an update to when I first started taking Cytomel and experienced extreme anxiety. That has abated, thankfully, and I'm 150mcg synthroid and 25 mg Cytomel. It hasn't quite cleared up my depression yet, nor my afternoon fatigue, but at least I can get out of bed in the morning. I'd give it a 5 if my depression and fatigue were licked; maybe I need to give it more time.	F	48	2  months25 1X D	9/17/2011Email
4	Hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue	Blood pressure increased.	Finally I have some energy and brain fog is reduced after adding 15 mcg cytomel to  50mcg dose of synthroid. On synthroid alone my labs looked good, but I felt tired and foggy-headed. Cytomel reduces that tired foggy-headed feeling. My blood pressure got high when I experimented with a 25mcg dose of cytomel, so went back down to 15 mcg which is bringing my blood pressure down some.	F	53	2  years15mcg 1X D	9/7/2011Email
5	Depression	Felt a bit nervousness/increased anxiety at the start (first 2 days). Adjusted med (5mcgs)to take 1/2 pill in the am and the other 1/2 in the pm and this helped decrease side effects. Slight nausea, but this two subsided.	It's done wonders for me. On the third day, I felt more alive. I'm actually getting used to feeling so good since it has been awhile- I know that sounds "odd" but after feeling lousy for so long, it is an adjustment!	F	39	1  weeks5mcgs 1X D	8/18/2011
5	Severe Depression	Slight anxiety upon starting. Small dose of diazepam helped.	This is truly a miracle drug. Have tried (literally) every SSRI, SNRI, MAOI, RIMA, Tricyclic antidepressant medication ever made over ten years.  None of them helped me. Cytomel made my depression disappear in two days. It was like someone turned on the life switch. My thyroid tests were normal, and remain normal. Do not start this drug higher than 5 mcg's! That's "micrograms." move to 10 mcg's maximum for depression. You will feel what it is like to be alive for the first time in your life. Normally "alive", not medicated numb by useless antidepressants. Thank you Cytomel!	M	39	6  months5 MCG 2X D	7/29/2011
2	To augment Wellbutrin	ANXIETY!!!!!!!!!	It may have been because my pdoc didn't reduce my dosage of Synthroid, which is 150mcg, but the first time I took 25mcg it did absolutely nothing. The second time I took it, it took eight valium tablets, four propranolol tablets and four over the counter sleep pills to even begin to calm me down. After that I slept forever, but I was up at 1 this morning and, like a fool, took another pill and went through this all over again. How long does this last? Can I cut the pills in half? Can I take them later in the day? I was so counting on this to help me with my treatment-resistant depression because I had tried everything and my bed and pillow have become my best friends.

1	RT3 issues	Horrible, anxiety, depression, crying, feel out of control emotionally. Panicky, feeling very sweaty and over heating. very rapid pulse, high b/p swollen feet and hands. headaches. all this on only 2 days on this drug. I thought it was going to be a miracle drug for my severe Reverse T3. it's been nothing but a nightmare. I am using the generic form of cytomel by Paddock Labs. I may (if I want to continue) try the compounded T3 or ask my doctor for the real thing. Generics have fillers and this one has talc in it too. and to think I am supposed to raise the dose? I don't think so. I want to stop but I don't know if you can just stop. I have only been on it for 2 days and it's been a real nightmare. Oh, did I mention insomnia too. I would think twice before taking it.		F	55	2  days5 MCG's 2X D	7/24/2011Email
1	Low Thyroid Low T3	Severe weight loss - BMI is now 17.  Deep depression.  Anxiety. Sleeplessness. Nausea and no appetite.  Feelign very unwell.  Severe hair loss.	This drug has been a complete nightmare.  Be very very careful when taking this drug. I do not have a thryoid and have been on Synthriod for the past 18 years.  I was feeling very tired and T3 levels were very low so my Dr. prescribed Cytomel starting with 5mcg then to 25 mcg.  Immediately I had nausea and could not eat.  I lost 10 lbs in two weeks and my bmi in now 17.  Anxiety levels were very high and I could not sleep properly.  I have discontinued the drug and finally am able to eat a meal and enjoy it.  Also had severe hair loss.  I feel that this drug has taken away my life for the past 7 weeks.	F	45	35  days25mcg 1X D	7/10/2011Email

5	Hypothyroidism	None.  More energy but that's a good thing :)	After years of living in a fog I was prescribed cytomel.  I was previously kn levothyroxine and tried armour... Adding cytolmel to the levothyroxine helped tremendously.  The first day I had a headache but the day after was the best day I had had in years.  Every once in a while I'll feel sluggish again but nothing compared to the suffering I was experiencing prior to cytomel.  Also, I was prescribed cytomel 5mg 2x daily... For the first few weeks, I only took 1/day.  When taking T3 it is important to start at a low dose to avoid heart palpitations and chest pain.  I saw a few of you posted about that along with anxiety.  Try starting out with a very small dose and gradually increase it.  Hope this helps :)	F	24	2  months5mg 2X D	6/29/2011Email
1	Hypothyroidism	ANXIETY!! No relief from hypo symptoms, total loss of appetite, weight gain, nausea, diarrhea, joint pain, irritability, nail ridges, painful menstrual cramps, suicidal thoughts, depression.	Despite a super low freeT4, my endo gave me cytomel thinking I would go hyper on a T4 drug. First week felt more alert and energized. After that it was all down hill from there. After 2 blood tests and a list of horrible symptoms on this alone my doctor was finally willing to prescribe me armour since cytomel suppressed both my TSH and T4 to almost 0. Cytomel will naturally suppress your t4 because it is replacing what your own thyroid does. This drug should only be used if someone has a hard time converting t4 to t3. I am now on Nature-Throid  which is another brand like Armour Thyroid. It has alleviated most of my symptoms, but still working on finding the right dose. If your doctor is not willing to prescribe it, I would recommend changing doctors.	F	24	12  weeks25mcg 2X D	6/21/2011

1	Hypothyroidism	The second day of taking Cytomel,  I started moving around the house more, doing things and sat around less. I had lots of energy and ambition. I also started waking up at 6am, which I don't normally do because I never get to sleep til about 3am. I couldn't get back to sleep, so would get up and constantly putter around doing housework, etc. I also remember that I would wake up during that short period of sleep and take things off my nightstand, sometimes knocking them to the floor. I've never done that before. By the 6th day, I woke up at 6am again and felt like I was on a bad trip of some kind. Hyperness, fearfulness, paranoia and my bp was up to 136 and it usually is around 110. I stopped taking Cytomel immediately,  yet still had problems on and off throughout the day, feeling weird, wired, antsy.

3	Hypothyroid	Since adding the Cytomel, I am having shooting pains in my muscles.  It seems to bounce all over my body.  Recently I am having rapid heart beat and terrible chest pain.  It is weird because, they are not all at the same time.  One day the shooting pains, the next the chest pain.  Maybe I need to decrease the dosage??  I will do blood work in a couple of weeks.  A little scary though, keep thinking I am having a heart attack!		F	37	3  weeks25mg 1X D	5/11/2011
3	Hypo/Bi-Polar Depression	Difficulty getting and staying asleep, mood swings	I had heard this was a good drug for people having adjustment problems with T4 only for hypo.  My psych was not happy with mood and other hypo symptoms (the usual ones) and my TSH level being stuck at 3.8 (0thers were in range).  He talked with my GP and they agreed to try T3, 5 mg per day.  First few days were really great; mood picked up, constipation gone, energy up and weight loss was good (12 lbs in 2 weeks-had been 3-4 lbs a month).  But, maybe due to the low dose, had horrible depression and other issues after 4 days.  However, I know this is confusing (at least to me) I suddenly seem to be feeling a bit better than prior to taking T3.  From what I see so far it seems that a dose increase might be in order here.  Was wondering how others out there had experienced with their initial T3 dose and how the treatment has panned out for you. Thanks.One more thing, my hypo kicked in last April, about a week after I quit smoking (35 years).  It took my GP until August to finally agree to test for hypo, where my TSH was 10 (other normal).  He sent me to a Endo (short for that long name I can't spell) who put me on T4 25 umg a day.  By October I was totally bonkers and felt like I was going crazy (in addition to a lot of other symptoms) and got my GP to increase the dose to 50 umg.  My TSH had gone up from 10 to 17 taking T4.  By Dec the endo has increased the T4 to 8 50 umg tabs weekly, which again didn't do it.  So, I again increased my dose, this time to 75 and then 100 um	M	55	30  days5 1X D	4/11/2011Email

I started taking cytomel because I suspected hypothyroidism. And although I am not "technically" at that point, my levels are high enough so that I feel off.

1	Hypothyroidism	Hypertension, depression, mood swings,nervousness, anxiety attacks, feeling chilled, tingling in left side of face and left fingers.	I once had an unexplained thyroiditis for 3 years that ended about 4 years ago and returned.  The thyroid fluctuates between hyper and hypothyroidism and can be very frustrating.  I had been taking 50 mcg of generic Levoxyl and yet the TSH level dropped lower.  My endocrinologist suggested we could either increase Levoxyl to 75 mcg or stay at 50 and add T-3 (generic Cytomel) so I went along with Cytomel.  For the first 2 weeks, I felt fine, but then the terrible symptoms started in.  The first was tingling in the face and left fingers, then blood pressure of 165/105.  Some days I might feel OK and then symptoms would start again going from anxiety attacks to bouts of anger lasting over an hour about once a week.  Every couple of days, I spent hours feeing chilled from the inside out.  Once I went off the drug, it took a full 6 weeks for all the side effects to abate.  My primary care NP said Cytomel has a long half-life and, therefore, takes a long time to be completely excreted from the body once it has had a chance to build up in the blood.  This was a nightmare experience that I would not want to repeat.  During the early phase of the side effects appearing, I ended up in the Emergency Room to be sure I wasn't having a stroke.  CT was normal and, later, after a referral from a neurologist, an MRI was also normal.	F	54	2  weeks5 mcg 1X D	2/21/2011Email

She lowered my synthroid to 175mcg and 2 clytomel tabs 2 X a day.  I have been a bit depressed feeling today.  I was up for over 36 hours the first day I took it...whew....Hoping that everything evens out.  I'm tired of being tired and tired of being in a fog.  I'm also tired of gaining weight.  Hoping cytomel will help with that too.... time will tell.	F	43	3  days 2X D	2/19/2011Email
1	low T3 lab value	Anxiety, depression, tension, neck and shoulder muscle pain, trouble falling asleep.	I was told I needed Cytomel because my T3 lab value was below normal range, plus I had fatigue. Initially, for about a week, I felt euphoric taking 5 mcg a day; then palpitations set in plus heat intolerance and being overly "amped up" with even one panic attack. I dropped my dose to 2.5 mcg. Even on this lower dose, I began having horrible chronic daily headaches which never went away, and I had more migraines than usual. I had to take a beta blocker to calm myself down and help dull the headaches. Finally my lab values were normal after 7 months of taking Cytomel. My doctor said it was okay to stop taking it as other labs showed that my thyroid was working better than before. It took 2 weeks to return to what I call "normal", and my headaches have improved a LOT. I feel calmer, get tired at night like I am supposed to, and I hiked 6 miles this weekend, so I have enough energy. I feel much better off of Cytomel! I was also told that taking Cytomel would cure everything from low libido to a bad lipid profile. Nothing changed in either case, and my lipids are even worse. I guess I had to take Cytomel because my T3 was low, but I am thankful that the nightmare is over.	F	54	7  months2.5 to 5 1X D	1/25/2011Email
4	Graves > RAI >Hypo	If there were any, they were superior to what I was experiencing earlier!!	Diagnosed with Graves in early 2001. Hyperthyroidism was great (yes I'm Type A). Problem was my body was burning up and in Texas this is not comfortable. Had the RAI and transitioned to Hypothyroid. My Internal Medicine guy (an extremely sharp guy) listened when I told him Synthroid just wasn't cutting it. He recommended an Endocrinologist (she's sharp too) who gradually reduced the Synthroid to 100mcg and immediately placed me on 5mcg Cytomel tablets twice a day. That was literally "just what the doctor ordered" and helped tremendously. She also encouraged me to develop patience for this process and I've been on this regimen for about 10 years. I perform the blood test once a year and we shoot for the lowest value in the tolerance range possible. Yes, weight is a battle but I learned to eat and exercise better. Also, I get cold, even in Texas. I tolerate that so I know what to expect with everything else associated with this battle. I can tolerate Colorado ski slopes, I can tolerate this. Another benefit of keeping my weight down, I don't have to take meds for high blood pressure or diabetes. It's bad enough having to rely on thryoid medication, I would hate to think what those would make me feel like. Good luck to you all!	M	54	10  years5mcg 2X D	12/31/2010

5	Hypothyroidism	Sleeplessness and occasional headaches when dose was higher	I am taking the generic Cytomel in addition to my Synthroid.  I was on Synthroid only for several years, feeling OK until suddenly started experiencing joint pain, brain fog, hypothermia, fatigue, weight gain.  TSH and FT4 tested within normal range, but my FT3 had droppped below range.  Feeling 100% better since adding Cytomel, although at first with dose at 25 MG along with my Synthroid, I had some sleeplessness and headaches.  Lowering the dose to 12.5 MG made symptoms go away.

5	fat loss, belly fat loss, weight lo	No major side effects apart from fast fat loss from cytomel. All in all I was happy with liothyronine sodium. The cytomel t3 or cynomel as it is called in USA did it's job and than some. :)	It's a very effective weight loss drug. In my experience only clenbuterol was more effective regarding weight loss. Cytomel is a good option for fat loss.	F	39	90  days20 mcg 2X D	11/19/2010
5	thyroidectomy	Prior to cytomel I was on Levothyroxine 137mg.  Physically I felt ok, not great, but ok.  Mentally and emotionally I was coming undone.  I felt disconnected and in a fog.  My doctor put me on 12.5 mg cytomel and reduce the levothyroxine to 88 mg.  The first day I took it everything changed.  I felt clear, energetic, and happy.  It took me about a week to get over the over engergetic feeling and heart palpatations.  But I will never go back to just thyroxine.	I would never recommend this medicine be taken at night.  Unlike levothyroxine, cytomel is fast acting.  I can feel a difference within forty-five minutes.	F	45	2  months12.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2010
3	Hypothyroid	Insomnia, sweating, weight gain, depression, indigestion.	I was taking 131mg.Levoxyl when my endo put me on Cytomel. He lowered the Levoxyl to 125mg. and added 5mcg. of Cytomel. First few days I was more alert but not energetic. Couldn't sleep, very sweaty, lots of indigestion. After 7 days, intense depression.After gaining 15 pounds after diagnosis two years ago, I had started to lose a few pounds a month. But I gained a crazy 4.5 pounds in 15 days after starting Cytomel. Day 17, I'm starting to feel better and more like myself. Hair still shedding like crazy, though.	F	54	2  weeks5 mcg 1X D	11/4/2010Email

Cytomel is a wonder drug and seems to be working and is what I've needed all along! I already feel a difference in my body and I have my energy back! I love life again!

3	To add T3	tingling in my fingers and numbness in the morning, shortness of breath,weight gain	cytomel was added to my 88mcg of synthroid due to lack of energy. I was on 135mcg syntrhroid only  for 2 years after total thyroidectomy. I have no energy and sleepy. After cytomel,i gained energy enough for the day, but have palpitations and weigh gain is unstoppable. I still maintain heaathy eating, and exxercise 3x a week. My be i need to increase  my synthroid. i have slight weight  increase when i was on 135 mcg of syntrhoid.Cytomel gave me energy but i gain weight. I will see my endoc. in 2 months, may be ask for increase in synthroid. She said ican only mave 88mcg of synthroid cannot increase synthroid, so may be i have decrease cytomel or take it every other day if in increase my synthroid. I am really confused.	F	57	9  months5mcg 2X D	10/4/2010Email
2	Graves Disease	Weight gain and foggy brain	I took Cytomel once a day for a year.  I gained 10 pounds and felt like my brain was in a fog.  Today I went to a new endo. and he wants to put me back on Cytomel-taking it 2 to 3 times in one day.  The new doc says that taking it once a day did more harm than good and taking it several times a day will be the trick.  I am hoping that the outcome is positive.  I have taken Synthroid for 13 years and have suffered from low energy.  I have prayed for years for an answer to the low energy-sleepiness problem.  I have no thryoid at all due to Radioactive iodine.  Now I am taking 100 mcg of Synthroid and will start the new dosage of Cytomel in two weeks after further blood tests come back.  I am excited that this time the Cytomel will be the answer for which I have prayed.	F	44	11  months 1X D	9/29/2010Email
1	Depression	Nervousness, Shaking, Headache, Insomnia, Nausea, Rapid Heart Beat, diarrhea, "foggy-headed", feeling like I may pass out	I thought this medicine was going to be WONDERFUL. I took this med at night, the first day after I felt more energized and alert. The second day the "nervousness" feeling and headache began to bother me a bit but still tolerable. Took the third dose and woke up and felt like I was going through withdrawals from heroin or something! My head was in a fog, my heart was racing, I was a huge ball of nerves, I was shaking, was short of breath, had the longest panic attack ever! I had diarrhea, couldn't eat, couldn't think. Pdoc said to try to "tough it out". I reluctantly took my fourth and final pill. I woke up at 2am, couldn't go back to sleep and had the same symptoms as mentioned above! Horrible med!

3	Hashimoto	Was prescribed 5mg in the morning with 50 synthroid and 5mg in the afternoon. Caused Migranes. Told to cut Cytomel to 2.5 in the morning and 2.5 in the afternoon, which also caused morning headaches. So taking 50 synthroid in the morning and 2.5 cytomel in the afternoon. Works great!		F	34	4  weeks2.5 1X D	9/16/2010
3	Hashimotos	Heart palpatations, speedy alertness, but unable to focus.	This is the second time around with cytomel.  I started many years ago after my endo prescribed it saying," not alot of evidence this works". This time new doctor prescribed and cytomel is too strong or something. Started breaking them in half as they don't split easily.	F	50	10  days25mcg 1X D	9/7/2010
3	Hypothyroid	Heart palpitations, a little anxiety, like I've had a double espresso.	This is just day 4 of this drug, and I'm going to have to make some adjustments. I've read many, many posts about Cytomel and asked my Endo to please let me try it because of fatigue, depression, weight gain despite exercise and calorie restriction and just a general "fog".  I started on 25mcg along with 150mcg Synthroid (been on that for 30+ years).  Day 3 (yesterday) was coming undone. Today, I've split both tablets and going to take 12.5 daily with 75mcg daily of Syn.  I can add on as needed, but I think I need to gradually work up. I have to take the generic because of Tricare refusing to cover the brand.  I've heard a ton of negative about the generic, but I have no choice, it's $3 for a month or $47...I have to be practical.  Mine is from Paddock, which seems to have better review than the other generic company Mylan, who has been under investigation. After 30 days on this med, I'll give further feedback, just giving a bit now.	F	43	3  days25mcg 1X D	9/4/2010Email
5	TSH on the upper end of normal	No side effects.	My thyroid tests came back not optimal but not out of normal range. I just didn't feel good. Aches in my joints upon getting up in the morning, tired and depressed although taking Lexapro. I stopped taking the antidepressant and began taking 5MCG of Cytomel.  Now I am totally off the antidepressant and have lost 12 lbs. My TSH is 1.23 and my cholesterol is down to 173 from 257. I am not taking a T4 supplement. Cytomel has been great for me. I feel like the small supplementation of T3 made all the difference in the world.	F	61	1.5  years5MCG 1X D	8/31/2010
4	Hypothyroidism small goiter	Problems with generic Cytomel.	I have been hypothyroid with a small goiter for many years, I just got a doctor to treat me a year and a half ago. I have been on a roller coaster with drugs starting with the old Armour thyroid, then levoxyl and and cytomel. Didn't stay on Armour long enough to see what it could do before it was unavailable. Went up and down with Levoxyl and cytomel. Finally settled on 25mcg levoxyl once a day and 10mcg cytomel twice a day. Stayed that dose for four months then bumped the cytomel up to 15mcg twice a day. When I first started cytomel I took the non-generic, but because of the high cost I tried to switch to generic. After three days on the generic I was climbing the walls. It was a very bad trip. If you are having trouble with Cytomel and are taking the generic I suggest trying the non-generic before you give up. Non-generic made a very big positive difference and worth spending the extra money. The only thing now is that I am having a very bad case of the "blues." But it may just be "life."	F	67	1  years15mcg 2X D	8/20/2010
2	Thyroid	Throat tightness and pain, voice cracking, lump in throat	I couldn't continue this drug because it caused too many throat symptoms for me.  It activated my thyroid to the point where it was constantly swollen, which caused throat pain, caused my voice to crack, and it felt like I constantly had a lump in my throat like I was about to cry.  I waited two weeks (per doctor's recommendation) to see if it went away, but I felt like it was interfering with my daily life and it never went away.  I did not work up to a high enough dose to take away any of my hypo symptoms because of this.  Just be aware that this is a possible side effect - I have not seen much reference to this on the internet, but it happened to me.	F	27	21  days5 mcg 2X D	8/11/2010
2	to supplement T4 (Synthroid)	Even with this tiny dose (I cut a 5 MCG tab in half) I had seriously heavy break-through bleeding.	I've been on Synthroid for 14 years and was currently alternating between 112 and 125mcg.  I decided to stay on just the 112mcg dose for two weeks before starting the Liothyronine (Paddock Laboratory's generic for Cytomel) in order to reduce my T4 a bit.  I am also on the contraceptive, Lutera, but I never bleed at this time of the month.  Within a couple hours of taking the Liothyronine (at 3PM, 12 hours after Synthroid), I had spotting.  The heavy bleeding happened overnight.  It could be coincidental that this happened exactly at the same time I started on the new medicine, but that's not likely.  I tend to be very sensitive to drugs and perhaps the Liothyronine stimulated the reproductive part of my endocrine system.  I did NOT experience any heart palpitations or dizziness.  I had some anxiety, but it was related to the bleeding.  I will stop taking the Liothyronine.  Right now, it's the next afternoon and I'm still bleeding lightly.  We'll see how long it lasts.  If it stops soon and doesn't come back, I may try the medicine another time, just to make sure this wasn't a fluke.	F	52	1  days.25 MCG 1X D	8/3/2010
5	total thyroidectomy	When my doctor started me on cytomel @ 10 mcg I had hyper symptoms and backed off to 5 mcg with great results	I was diagnosed with Hashimotos last year, compressive goiter and all the AWFUL hypo symptoms. Total thyroidectomy may 2009 and given cytomel only for one week after and felt like poo! Then started on synthroid only and ok for a few months, then exhausted, lethargic, hypo symptoms back. Started on 10 mcg cytomel at first but had all hyper symptoms so I backed off to 5mcg. Felt great, energy back, even did a triathlon!! Two months ago started slowly feeling ick again, hard to get out of bed, unable to exercise, depressed,etc. Increased my dose back to 10mcg and in ONE day felt soooooo much better! Cytomel is a lifesaver for me! Also taking 88mcg synthroid.	F	39	1  years5 mcg 2X D	7/28/2010Email
5	Hypothyroidism	The only negative side effects that I have noticed is a skipped heart beat every so often. Usually occurs when I'm idle or before going to sleep. I never notice this during the day or while excercising. I think as I continue to reduce my Synthroid(T4) dosage, this should subside.	T3 has been great. I was apprensive as I approached my doctor about adding T3 as he is in his late 60's and I thought he would be old fashion. To my suprise, he said "sure". I was so happy. I am 6' and 180lbs. I take 12.5mcg 4x per day. I don't see how 5mcg can do anything for people, even small women. 5mcg is an incredibly small dose 1 time per day. No wonder those people don't notice any increased energy and continue with hypo symptoms. Bodybuilders, celeberties and athletes take up to 100mcg per day of T3. And those people are not even diagnosed with Hypothyroidism like we are. Of course T3 is much stronger and faster acting than T4, so 100mcg is a lot. But they are essentially abusing T3 for incredible/substantial fat loss purposes. I was originally on 50mcg of T4 as a starter dose. After being on T3 I have reduced the dose in half and now have stopped. I spread out my T3 throughout the day. With T3, I no longer need any naps in the afternoon. I think more clearly and am more productive. I am no longer cold all the time and I have lost 2 lbs of bodyfat. I am an athlete so I am in pretty good condition, so the bodyfat reduction is basically carving out the last bits of stubborn fat. I think sedentary people that were overweight to begin with, would see substantial weight loss with a reasonably substantial dose. I spread my doses out every 3-4 hrs starting around mid-day and finishing before bed as it keeps my metabolism up throughout the nightime.	M	50	8  weeks12.5 4X D	7/26/2010
4	Grave's/Hypo	A burst of energy and concentration for 4-5 hours followed by slight crash.	I took this as part of combination therapy with 100 mcg Synthroid. This is the same combination of Thyrolar 2 - though I did not find that medicine effective. Had to go off Cytomel recently due to hyperthyroid symptoms though tests were normal. Warning: Cytomel negatively  combined with the supplement Coenzyme CQ10 to give palpatations. Currently on 175 Synthroid. Will add 5 mcg Cytomal if Dr. allows. I've needed constant monitoring of meds. since 131 treatment at age 17.	M	43	7  years25 mcg 1X D	7/24/2010Email
5	Thyroid Cancer	I am warmer than I use to be and I do get short of breath with a little rapid heart beat.	I took Synthoid for 36 years for a non-toxic goiter.  My surgeon switched me to Cytomel because he said I would need to be on this to start for my RAI treatment for Thyroid cancer.  I have more energy.  The rapid heart beat does not worry me because I had that problem at first with Synthoid.  Just figure my body would adjust.  I personally like it.  Have a little more energy.

It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .

This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email

I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie).

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight.

3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

3	Bipolar I	Increase in appetite (gained 2 lbs in 2 weeks), GI upset initially, migraines so bad had to discontinue it	I'm bipolar with mixed states. After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated. Who knows if it "helped my depression" because it made me an absolute basket case!	F	21	14  days2.5 mg 1X D	9/27/2010

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).	F	42	16  months30 mg 1X D	9/7/2010
3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.	F	35	4  weeks15 MG 1X D	8/29/2010Email
5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email

4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.

5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again.

3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped.

1	Bi Polar 2, Panic Disorder	horrible headache, voracious appetite (gained 10 lbs.), dizziness, anxiety, hot flashes, chills	At first this med seemed to be wonderful but after the first two weeks, these side effects became unbearable and I am three weeks off now and still having problems with my increased appetite. Normally b/c of other GI issues, my appetite is very suppressed but now I can't stop eating. However, the other side effects have decreased to almost nothing.	F	33	4  weeks5 mg 1X D	4/30/2010

4	GAD with Nausea	Appetite coming back.  Sex drive increased.  Anxieties seem to have diminished.  Feel a bit tired and flu like at times but not too bad.	Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal. I belive my GAD is finally diminishing - regular therpay is helping me too.  I have had my condition for 6 yrs and 6 months now.	M	45	2.5  weeks2 mg 1X D	4/19/2010
1	paranoid schizophrenia	hallucinations, night terrors, thought people were coming to kill me, locked myself in my studio, saw demons everywhere, racing thoughts, hearing things, couldn't sit still or sleep, the hour or two i was able to sleep was awful, i was going to kill myself but some how made it to the hospital and got some seroquel.  I was no where near this bad before i started taking it.		M	28	3  weeks5-15 1X D	4/19/2010Email
1	Bipolar spectrum disorder	Restlessness, anxiety, drowsiness, face rash	I went on Abilify at the start of an up period, so I don't know how effective it would have been in treating depressive spells. However, it did counteract some of the effectiveness of my lithium, and I was falling asleep during the day more frequently than usual. Had to go off it because of a rash on my chin/cheeks/ears.

5	for depression-w/ my antidepressant	lowering my libido. Craving more sugary, fatty foods and carbs.     I took this several yrs. ago and although the medication initially worked-I packed on more than 10 pounds. I got depressed due to weight gain, but after several months I feel medication ceased to be effective. This time  was very reluctant (2 yrs later & different Dr. & different anti-depressant medication-Prozack-2 yrs ago) but I am trying it w/ a different antidepressant than previously-Taking now w/ Wellbutrin.

4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue. Negative - I find myself much more emotional - memories, key phrases, smells, songs, pictures, etc.can bring me to tears.	M	50	9  months50 MG 1X D	4/11/2010
2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now. I have woken up from a 12 year-long medication-induced nightmare.	M	57	 15 MG 1X D	4/7/2010Email

2	depression	Nausea the first few days, some constipation, cloudy thinking, increased appetite	Combined with Wellbutrin XL which suddenly stopped working for me after 3 years. After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

Insomnia (but the Seroquel has completely cured that.)	Abilify has helped me like no other drug.  I am on it along with cymbalta, deplin, seroquel and ativan.

Then still have little to no energy for the rest of the day.  I was previously, taking 60 mg. of Cymbalta for almost 2 years, but my dr. switched me to this when I started to feel like dying again.

Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!

2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010

Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.

That night she experienced indigestion/heartburn. She vomited. Sleepy but couldn't sleep. Feeling scared for no reason. Next day she passed out after being awake for 15 min. I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug.

3	bipolar	stopped after 14 months due to heart pulpitations, memory loss, trouble sleeping, slur speach due to excess syliva, after 12 months these things started. At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying. I am very uncomfortable giving a child this age any drug that is diagnosised by trial and error.	M	8	14  months	12/17/2009
