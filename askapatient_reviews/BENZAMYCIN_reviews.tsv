5	acne	None.	My daughter started getting acne at a very young age.  She was the only child in elementary school with pimples.  This has cleared her skin wonderfully. Doctor tried to give her those other more expensive creams. They would give her HUGE pimples on her young pore-less skin;  I was afraid of scarring. Her doctor told me this cream would "probably not work." It has been great-now she can fit in until the rest of her classmates start getting acne.	F	11	4.5  monthsthin layer 2X D	11/16/2011
2	Oily skin	Dryness patches around my face, but overall oiliness	I have had extremely oily skin since I was in grade school. My dermatologist prescribed this to try to dry out my skin a bit. It works initially for about an hour after I apply it, but then the oil comes right back. However, I seem to have fewer/less severe breakouts.	F	20	4  months	12/1/2009
5	acne	dryness and mild peeling. some itching the first month or so.	Have used for 8 weeks now.  Has improved my acne by about 90% from when I started.  Very good drug.  Only problem is I have a lot of scars and red marks.  I think the medication is not allowing my skin to heal properly. This never happened in the past.  But I will continue to use it because it is so effective.	F	26	8  weeks	7/6/2007
5	acne	lots of dryness at first, peeling in acne prone areas, but also some oiliness in other places. Still have issues with dryness/peeling but it is improving.  I try to counteract it with lots of Cetaphil moisturizer and using less of the medication.  Use oil blotting sheets to take care of oily places.	Have always struggled with acne. Went off birth control and started breaking out, went back on the pill (a new one) and developed horrible cystic acne along my jawline and chin.  Some cysts were staying around 5-6 weeks and were horribly inflamed and painful.  Nothing was helping.  I am on week 3 of this medication and so far am ecstatic at the improvement I'm seeing. I hope it continues. Cysts started flattening some about 3 days after I started using this medication.  Reduces inflammation a lot.  I am still breaking out but it seems like the pimples are less severe and much quicker to go away. I'm hoping it helps with some of the hyperpigmentation that I have now.  I'd say my acne has improved about 50% since I started using this medication. I'm hoping for continued improvement as the pimples that had already formed are brought to the surface.

3	Acne	If I used too much, my face got irritated and red.	Worked decently. A container starts losing effectiveness after ~2 months, and you have to get another container of it.	M	25	18  months	2/8/2006
