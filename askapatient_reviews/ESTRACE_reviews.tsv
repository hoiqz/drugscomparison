				F M	 	 	    
1	vaginal atrophy	gained 10lbs and constant headaches, week after week and I NEVER have headaches	The side effects are not worth it	F	51	8  weeks0.5 2X W	2/8/2013
5	Vaginal dryness and bladder infection	No side effects	I have not experienced any urinary infections or problems.  This has relieved issues with vaginal dryness.  Highly recommend this medication.  It is a bit messy, but since it is only used twice a week it is worth it.	F	62	2  months2 mg 2X W	8/26/2012
1	hormone replacement	Blood clot left leg and pulumary embolism		F	50	3  years.05	5/24/2012
1	Vaginal Atrophy	Weight gain from 123 to 128 pounds after first week.  Increased blood pressure immediately and LDL cholesterol over a 3 month period. Everything has always been within normal range until this medicine. My DR says some women cannot take Estrace, while others tolerate it well.		F	62	90  days.5 2X W	3/9/2012
4	vaginal atrophy post menopause	Noticed vivid dreams since starting the medication.	Symptoms of dryness have improved.	F	57	20  days1 gm cream 4X W	9/20/2011
1	perimenopause	Vivid dreams (nightmares), frequent awakenings, anxiety, sleepy all day,bloating (I look pregnant), weight gain (14 lbs)in 4 weeks from 105 to 119 lbs. Headaches, migraines,dry red eyes,brain fog, visual disturbances, very dizzy. Flu like symptoms, increased head pressure. Felt much better on Evamist, but it was so expensive so I thought I would try these pills instead.  Now switching back to evamist (transdermal spray).		F	51	30  days1 mg 1X D	3/22/2011
2	hormone replacement	increased depression, sleeplessness, anxiety		F	44	14  days1mg 1X D	7/16/2010
2	To manage PP hormonal side effects	Fever, chills, headache, nausea. I thought I had the flu, but soon realized the symptoms would come and go, always beginning about 16 hours after applying Estrace. After 4 doses the correlation was clear. I stopped applying Estrace and symptoms ceased. This was my first experience with any sort of estrogen cream, so I may just be sensitive to them.	Told to apply a small amount vaginally to help relieve dryness and lack of elasticity 9 months postpartum (sex painful).	F	28	4  days	11/11/2009
1	vaginal dryness/chemo-induced menop		Messy, has not helped. I had been using Vag-i-fem and found it absolutely effective. Estrace cream is now first-tier coverage for my insurance co. I would not recommend it at all.	F	46	21  days	7/25/2008
4	HRT,vaginal dryness	cream is a bit messy	I insert .5mg estrace cream twice weekly. Restores vaginal moisture and may be helping elasticity.	F	35	1  months	12/20/2007Email
5	vaginal dryness	none	All I needed was 2grams twice a week. It has been a wonderful drug. Non perscriptive vaginal lubricants just didn't work.	F	62	2  years	10/13/2007
4	menopause	None what so ever	I had a hysterctomy and ovaries removed 3 years ago and have tried everything for hot flashes. They were horrible and nothing worked.  Since I have been taking the medication I feel like I did before the hysterectomy (NORMAL).  It is a wonderful HRT and now hot flash are rare  Also great for returning your sex drive.	F	50	2  months	10/13/2007
5	HRT/vaginal dryness	No negative side effects	If you are taking this for vaginal dryness in particular, I would STRONGLY recommend checking into FemRing, which is a flexible ring inserted vaginally every three months that delivers a measured dosage of estrogen.  FAR superior to the messy creams!  I would still be on FemRing if my Rx coverage had not stopped covering it.	F	54	3  months	12/18/2006
5	Thinning vulvar tissue	Some burning at beginning of treatment.  Was less each time I sued the cream.	I was happy to try this.  I'm not going into menopause.  I had VERY thin tissue in my vulvar area after use of other medications.  This really worked for me.	F	29	30  days	7/27/2006Email
3	Hystrectomy	anxiety	I have less side affects on this HRT than anything else I have tried.	F	53	3  years	7/7/2006
3	amenorrhea	weight gain.. (water retention)feeling of bloatedness.. other than that it has helped me have a cycle after 3 years of ammenorhea..and also feel like a woman again... although i also had to take it with provera...	I would recomend it only for those who wish to get there hormones under control..(HRT)	F	23	21  days	2/16/2006Email
4	HRT after hysterectomy	Headaches if I didn't stay to a schedule.	Helping a lot after trying patches for 3 years. Easy to take with me, I don't have to worry about patches coming off and it is a lot cheaper than patches.	F	52	2  weeks	8/29/2004
5	FOR   HRT	None at all, it took a few weeks to kick in for hot flashes etc. Initially a tiny weenie bit of breast tenderness which quickly left.	I've been on it for 12 years (oral and topical cream form) and absolutely wouldn't trust anything else being it's the natural bio-identical estradiol we produce our whole lives, as well as the cream totally restored the vaginal tissue using it even only topically.  I love it personally.	F	57	12  years	6/10/2002
5	hormone replacement therapy	none	This really helped smooth out the perimenopausal symptoms.  What a great alternative to those synthetic hormones (in birth control pills) that had unending side effects!	F	45	5  years	4/19/2002
