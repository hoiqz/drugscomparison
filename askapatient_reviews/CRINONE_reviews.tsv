3	Infertility	Uncomfortable with the amount of vaginal discharge after use, had to use a pantyliner.	I will continue to use crinone gel because I am trying to get pregnant and if I do it will be worth it, but it is kind of gross.	F	30	2  days	1/22/2010
2	Perimenopause	Excessive discharge requiring use of a pantiliner.Unsightly, pellet-like discharge of gel build-up during coitus.	I was prescribed Crinone 8% gel to be used for uterine protection, in conjunction with Vivelle Dot 0.025 patch.  Due to the messiness of the gel, I requested to be switched to Prometrium 100mg capsules after using it for only 3 days.  I liked the idea of physically applying progesterone specifically where needed without a full systemic effect.  However, it just wasn't worth the mess and inconvenience!	F	41	3  days	7/13/2006
