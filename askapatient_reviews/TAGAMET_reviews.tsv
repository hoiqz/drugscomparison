5	Warts	None noted	Our daughter started out with one large wart on her knuckle.  We sought a liquid nitrogen treatment (every two weeks) from a dermatologist.  Every night we applied a 40 percent SALICYLIC ACID PASTE (waste of time and money--labor intensive with little to no results).  We saw some progress after each two week visit, but at $25 dollars a co-pay it would have been a thousand dollars later before the wart would have gone away.  We stopped going to the dermatologist after four visits.  The wart then multiplied to 12 warts in a matter of six months--her right hand was almost completely covered by warts.  On her left hand there were two warts now growing...  I think the multiplication of the warts was spurred on and caused from the liquid nitrogen treatments!  We were losing the battle... we felt like there was nothing that could conquer the wart battle.  Then my mother came across an article that identified TAGAMET (CIMETIDINE) as having varying levels of success with wart removal.  Our daughter takes an oral dose of 400mg 3-4 times per day and after 45 days the warts are 90 percent gone! We estimate another 30 days of the oral regimen and we will have rid her completely of warts.  In my opinion it is nothing short of a miracle!  We spoke with two pharmacists, one doctor and one dermatologist--all four said they saw no problems with a nine year old taking TAGAMET.  They said the dosage was okay and if she was bothered by it she could back off the dosage.	F	9	45  days	7/21/2009
