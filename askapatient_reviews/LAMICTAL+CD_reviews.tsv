1	BIPOLAR AND ADHD	This drug made me stare out of the window, non social, people kept telling me I was not myself  and asking me what was wrong and I did not feel like myself. I was not thinking at all. There are alot of people who do not know I am adhd or bipolar, they just think I am a get her done type of person and am very social. Limictal with paxil made me a zombie, did not feel comfortable, my stomache always hurt- would try to make it feel better by eating,but that did not help. I forget all of my symptoms but I felt as if I were dying. I also have never had gory and mutilation dreams, being scared and trying to run away. I started having horrible seeming so real nightmares. I am thinking that I was misdiagnosed as bipolar and I am only adhd. Both run in my family and I did tell the dr. I went to that I don't believe I have strong bipolar symptoms. I know what a person acts like and the symptoms from speaking with 2 of my sisters that have bipolar. My sisters have said that they have those kind o		F	30	3  years30 MG 1X D	5/26/2012Email

5	bi polar II	I have had no side effects what so ever. This medication is like the missing link in my brain.	I got a diagnosis of bi polar II disorder in 2005. I have been treated for depression only in the past...unaware that the ssri's would make me hypomanic. Lamictal has helped me so much. It evens out my moods, which for the most part is good. I also take celexa. They even out my moods and dull them a bit, but it is better then crying all the time, insomnia, paranoia, and rage. It sucks having to be on medication. I wish I could go off them and be a normal person, because I have had periods in my life when I was "normal" but if I miss even a single dose I am struggling to function and if I miss a few days my world literally falls apart, can't work or function around people. Anyway, it has helped me a lot and it has helped me stay sober. Haven't had a drink in almost 6 years. 	F	48	5  years200mg 1X D	4/27/2012Email
2	Bipolar II with mixed states	Inability to orgasm, problems with talking, eyesight changes, confusion, short term memory loss, trouble sleeping	All in all, this drug has been a godsend for me and my relationships.  While I'm still struggling to become a better person, this drug has removed quite a few roadblocks.  I have side effects and they definitely bother me after having been on the drug for a few years, so I'm considering weening off after speaking to my doctor.  Two years ago you might have found me either exercising or crying uncontrollably any giving time of the day, even at work on breaks, but now I'm a pretty well adjusted person who's finally calmed down enough to pursue some interests other than drinking and laying around watching tv.  From what I've read about lamictal, it's nothing you want to stay on long term, especially if you having side effects.  As far as side effects go, (and pardon, i'm in a hypomanic state atm) I tend towards mixing up my words, forgetting what i'm saying midsentence (which makes me look like a total DA at work), I have swirly and sometimes static like vision, especially when I'm looking at bright objects like the sky and the computer.  I have residual images constantly, I have a hard time getting my brain to "work" sometimes, like during math, and some trouble sleeping.  I also have stiff muscles and find myself clenching my entire body during the day and at night.  So basically, it's worsened the normal effects of hypomanic states in bipolar disorder, in many ways, while keeping me completely level headed about it, if that makes sense.

1	Bi-Polar	Feelings of indifference, increased disasociation with reality, irrational thoughts sometimes stemming from "lucid dreams" that he is certain mean something. Sporatic and unpredictable aggresion accompanied by severe shaking. Disreguard for responsibilities. Warped sence of invincibility. Increased confusion and inability to cope with distractions.	I am writting this on behalf of my husband as a warning to other concerned spouses/children/partners/parents out there that are experiencing, second hand, the negative side effects that this drug may be having on their loved one. After my husband began taking Lamictal he started feeling "better" quickly. This led to sudden thoughts that he is in his right mind and should be focusing on him and his needs while his children and wife sit on the sidelines. He has now lost his wife and children and beleives that it is a good thing. He has left the house and is only paying for his room and board where he is staying and refuses to pay the bills he left with his wife and children. This is all very recent and who is to know if he will remain happy with these changes but he has very limited interaction with his children at this point and the effects on them have been huge. It does appear that he feels better but from what I see it is only better because he isn't reguarding any of the responsibilities that he has. Only time will tell how he responds when reality hits him but from what I have seen so far he will continue to withdrawl. He refuses to listen to my feedback about his treatment and has concocted a grand story in his mind that I am the root of his anger issues and with out me he will now be better. He has taken this to the extreme of simplifying our seperation saying that I just didn't want him to go hiking so I ended our seven year relationship and tore our children	F	32	3  months100 MG 1X D	7/11/2011Email
5	Epilepsy - Schizenchephaly	Initially trouble sleeping, more frequent urination, have to get up at night to go, need to clear my throat more often, heart palpitations.	I've had great results with Lamictal and have not had a seizure for 11 months.  I haven't had any serious side effects, probably the worst of which is minor heart palpitations but I am very pleased.  I have a rare congenital disorder and lived a completely normal life until I was 20.  I had 8 total seizures within a 9 month period but have not had one for 11 months now since being on lamictal as I approach my 22nd birthday.  I am back to a normal life about to graduate from college in May 2011.	M	22	10  months200mg 2X D	1/14/2011Email

4	Bipolar I, Hypomania & Depression	None at first, spontaneous and rapidly worsening symptons after 8 months.	After months of severe insomnia, suicidal thoughts, etc. lamictal was a godsend. Within a couple weeks my entire life turned around. No significant side effects, but I generally don't get side effects. It continued to work through the summer, wasn't affected by any pain killers from a few surgeries. What really made me realize it's full effect was how well it worked during a really disastrous breakup. Never been so sad in my life, but I was able to function, go to school, etc. I didn't have any suicidal thoughts like I would have had in the past. Mid-October, it suddenly stopped. It started with insomnia, restlessness, crying all the time, inability to finish work, lack of motivation, couldn't get out of bed, extreme hunger, etc. I was put on 300 mg... no change. I started getting weird anxious energy, like... when I was upset or stressed I started acting "scary." Spontaneous, very neurotic reactions to little things. Inability to connect to emotions, connect to physical actions. I'm so glad someone else reported this: weird, compulsive head-scratching. And my shoulders and collar bones. I picked at my skin until I had little scabs like bugbites, but I never realized it. I displayed all the symptoms of public anxiety but never ever felt paranoid or anxious. This December it's continued to get worse, severe depression and listlessness, crazy insomnia, apathy... I started Seroquell XR which was miserable. Still on the Lamictal until I start Lithium tomorrow.	F	19	10  months150-300 mg 1X D	12/24/2010

1	Anxiety BiPolar Depression	Bleedling gumes, rotting teeth, mouth sores and ulcers, rashed and hives, vision changes,hot flashesm bone aches, chest pains, extreme headaches, lack of creating tears, memory loss.	I have taken Lexapro and Xanax with much success but felt at 75%. I was so happy when the nurse practitioner stated "I can get you 100%." I was estatic. Last week I looked at my bleeding gums and loss of enamel and rotting teeth. I NEVER have had teeth problems in my life. I immediately went online for natural products (Celtic Sea Salt) to correct the problem. Itching I have to take Atarax. I took all of the pills left in the starter pack and flushed them down the toilet. DOT NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE. YOU WILL LOSS TOOTH ENAMEL AND YOUR TEETH WILL ROT. I CALLED DR AND THEY WOULD NOT RETURN MY CALLS. I am a writer and I wanted to stabilize my moods but now my energies would be better served writing an expose on this EXPENSIVE MEDICINE AND I HAVE INSURANCE. I have never had severe side effects with meds with the exception of  a headache or two. THIS MEDICINE WOULD KEEP ME UP ALL NIGHT AND THEN WHEN I WOULD SLEEP I WOULD HAVE THE STRANGEST DREAMS. I AM GOING TO RESEARCH NATURAL METHODS TO HELP ME WAVE MY KIDNEYS. OH AND MY MENSTRUAL CYCLE WOULD START WHENEVER IT FELT LIKE IT. THIS DRUG WITH KILL YOU AND ALSO I WOULD HAVE BLIND SPOTS IN THE CORNERS OF MY EYES WHERE I COULDN'T SEE. THROW THIS MEDICINE AWAY BECAUSE THE SIDE EFFECTS CAN COME IN YEARS OF TAKING OR WEEKS. I HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND IT IS THE SCARIEST MEDICINE AVAILABLE...	F	40	5  weeksbeginners 1X D	10/27/2010

5	Bipolar II	mild muscle weakness and blurred vision	It was the only drug I could stay on. The others either didn't work or the side effects were so bad that I had to stop taking them. It's been very effective in conjunction with welbutrin & stress reduction. 450 mg seems like a lot compared to what others are taking, but it seems to be how much I need.

I do not recommend this medicine	M	41	3  weeks50 1X D	6/12/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder.	great loss of sex drive when going from 75MG - 100MG	I started lamictal for depression and bipolar disorder..and I really wasn't noticing anything, like it hadn't helped my feelings and moods at all, and after increasing my dosage to 100MG, I completely lost ability to get wet, once we start I am able to get wet and then I'm fine, but initially, I can't get horny.

3	anxiety	Joint pain/arthritis, speech/verbal confusion,  difficulty focusing	Before I started taking Lamictal I was seeing a doctor who managed the County Psychiatric  Hospital. He had me taking alprazolam, ambien, xanax and adderall all at the same time.( WTF? )Before that I had tried lorazepam, Lexapro and Cymbalta. Nothing worked.  The thought was that my anxiety was triggering depression and I couldn't focus so I took something for that, and then I needed something to make me sleep. Didn't work. I was total zombie for months and I was suicidal. Up and down.. I was scared and paranoid all the time. I felt so terrible I wanted to die. I found a new doctor who put me on Lamictal. It completely evened me out and I felt like a human again. The anxiety I had was gone and I was so happy to have my life back. It really seemed like a miracle drug. HOWEVER... a few months ago I started experiencing joint pain and swelling. My knees give out. I sometimes have to walk backwards up the stairs and I am not over weight. I can hardly get out of bed in the morning. My feet turn inward - cant put them flat on the floor. I feel like someone threw me down the stairs when I wake up and I have a hard time gripping things. An example: I was carrying a gallon of water into the house and when I sat it down sharp pains started shooting up my arm. After just a short bike ride my knees give out and my wrists hurt. I can't put pressure on them. I have back pains. I have to be on my feet at work. I have a pretty physical job and now I'm in so much pain at the end of the work w	F	25	1  years150 mg 1X D	5/10/2010
1	epilepsy	Hair loss, depression, suicidal thoughts, lack of interest, easily confused, problems speaking, confusing left and right, aching teeth, irregular periods	Listen to your symptoms and yourself, NOT your doctor.

Stop thinking it won't happen to you...it happened to me and my hair has been falling out for 4 months	F	28	  1X D	3/25/2010

2	mood disorder	I have increased appetite-I've gained 20 pounds in the last 2 months since being on lamictal.  I have bizarre muscle and/or joint pains that come and go within minutes. I have terrible night sweats, I wake up soaking wet. And the last few weeks since my dose has been moved up to 200mg/day I have the most awful vivid nightmares all night long every night.

4	bipolar	weight loss of 15-20 pounds - wasn't really needed.  Less appetite.  Very, very vivid dreams.  Recent development of pain in two knuckles of right hand with a bruise like appearance.	My son is taking lamictal.  He had previously taken depakote with seemingly good results but he did not want ot go back on that.  I was excited for him to try Lamictal.  I can really tell if he has missed 2 or 3 consecutive doses - starts to develop a little agitation.  He seems pleased with the results of the medication.	M	17	2.5  months50mg 2X D	2/4/2010Email

5	bi-polar	Sounds weird, but instead  of age related night sweats, my sweats seemed to tell me to wake up to go to the bathroom at night. Had sweats before, but never syncronized with urination. Thought that was kind of strange. It happens ever time! Medication is working for me. Up to 300 MG a night and feel pretty good now. No other problems yet....		F	60	3  months	1/10/2010

4	Bi Polar	Has been working well for me at 200 mg.  Hasn't full stopped my mood swings. Back and Joint pain at 250 mg	I have been taking 200 mg for 2 years with out any problems.  I got a new doctor and he suggested that I ramp up to 300 mg.  After a few days at 225 mg I started getting back, muscle, and joint pain.  I thought I was getting a bad case of the flu before I found this website and found out that others are having the same side effects.	M	36	2  years	11/21/2009
4	depression	Night sweats, I guess word mix up (didn't really attribute it until seeing other comments), vivid dreams (some good, some really bad), memory loss, propensity for slurring (+alcohol)	Lamictal has really helped me.  I was feeling suicidal and this generally kept those thoughts at bay.  It has set a floor for my depressed moods.	M	38	4  months	8/26/2009
3	Depressive Bipolar II	Inability to focus vision on fine details, some discoordination with fine motor tasks, abnormal liver functions, high triglycerides and cholesterol, and CRIPPLING BACK PAIN.	I was excited to try this med as, like many people with BPD, I have a hard time taking SSRIs. It's claimed to be more effective against depressive episodes than more regularly prescribed BPD meds like Lithium, and it was. However, I gradually developed back pain during the slow dose increase used to start this medication. It started as a slight stiffness in my back, and I assumed I was just out of shape. Then it became painful, and I assumed I had hurt my back somehow, but didn't think the Lamictal had anything to do with it. By the time I got to 200mg, I was basically crippled and wondered each time I bent over whether that would be the time I wouldn't be able to stand back up- at 37 and fairly healthy, I knew something was wrong. In spite of pointing this out to various doctors and nurses, none of them seemed to make the connection, and it wasn't until I did my own research that I found that a VERY HIGH NUMBER of people have similar complaints, something like 1 in 12. At 200mg I had my blood checked, which revealed abnormal liver functioning, and high triglycerides and cholesterol. The doctors (all psych trained) didn't find that odd either. I have stopped taking the med and hope that sometime in the next month or so my back will recover and that the damage isn't permanent. So PLEASE recognize that your doctors are not all-knowing gods, and that the side effects of this med can creep up on you VERY slowly.	M	37	3  months	8/23/2009
5	bipolar I	short term memory loss, words get mixed up, some itchiness, dry mouth.	Was able to think clearly for the first time in my life, after beginning Lamictal. Was ultra rapid cycling daily. Finally feel in control of myself, thoughts, feelings. Anxiety, and severe depression 90% eliminated. Some "break through" days as with any medication. Definitely feel flat most of the time. Stable. No more extreme highs, however there is some depression when mania is triggered. Overall, life saving drug. Would recommend giving a try.	F	40	7  months	8/16/2009Email
4	bipolar	NO SEX DRIVE		F	26	3  years	8/12/2009
3	Bipolar	fatique, motor agitation, twitching in limbs and trouble with gait. Good med but broke out in rash.	First day I felt the med's working in my frontal lobe. Quick mood swings on the first day which I found interesting. I was laughing and crying at the same time. My moods started to calm down. Instead of quick mood swings....I would have a bad mood one day and good mood the next day. Always felt aggitated and irritable at night. I had to take 2mg of Clonzepam to get me to sleep. Felt my skin itching but no visible rash. That sensation disappeared after I got into my new dose level and it started again when the pdoc increased my dose. I felt he moved me too quickly into the dosages. First two week 25 mg, the 2nd two weeks 50mg, the 3rd dosage was increased to 100 mg for three weeks. I did felt it stabilized my moods but the initial dosages made very tired and it was hard to concentrate at times when people talked to me but that slowly cleared up. Experienced some headaches. Experienced in the sixth week some twitching at night in my limbs. Felt dizzy at times.Noticed in the seventh week motor agitation which came in spurts and came throughout the day. Also had trouble with my gait but nothing real serious. None of this effected my driving ability. I did experience flu systems which the pdoc thought was the regular flu. I thought it was the meds....then I broke out in hives. Pdoc told me to stop ASAP.  When the rash reached my face I went to the emergency room. Got a quick dose of allergy steriods and diphenhydramine. Took a whole week for my rash to clear up.	F	52	49  days	7/10/2009Email
3	Bipolar II	Back & joint pain, numbness in feet when exercising, fatigue, dental pain, circulation issues on left side of body, short of breath, dizziness, vision changes, trouble "finding" words when speaking	I have experienced many side effects on this med & none of them are what I would call "minor".  There is one very good thing Lamictal does for me that makes it worth taking: it regulates my sleep to around 8hrs per day.  Without it, I would rarely be able to wake up and function after 8hrs of sleep.  I strongly suggest taking calcium & vit D3 with this med due to the issues with joints & teeth.  I have taken it for 4 years and wish I knew about that when I started taking it.	M	33	4  years	3/20/2009
4	Epilepsy	Short term memory loss, dizziness, lack of strong feelings, weaving when walking	Previous to taking Lamictal I was on Dylantin.  The stuff had horrible side effects including what I have on Lamictal and more.  I could not function on my job and still had seizures.  My doctor put me on Lamictal and I take it 3 times a day - 150 mg AM/PM and 100 at lunch.  I figured out I had seizures in the late afternoon so the lunch dose is just a little push to get me to my night time dose.  I've been seizure free for 5 years this April.That said, sometime the side effects are pretty bad. They seem to improve or get worse with hormonal changes.  I get frustrated at the lack of strong feelings but I'm on this drug for the side effect of controlling seizures rather than the primary intention of helping bipolar.  So, I should expect no strong feelings since it is a mood controlling drug.  However... I miss them.  When I start weaving down the hallways I drag my finger against a wall and it helps straighten me out.  Lamictal recently went generic and I've read that people are hav	F	56	6  years	3/1/2009Email
3	Bipolar Disorder II, rapid cycling	Dizziness, weight gain, increased appitite, difficultly reading and concentrating, insomnia.	I've been on it for a few months.  The first month it felt like it had completely chanaged my life.  I was happier and higher on life than ever!  Unfortunately that didn't last.  My depression came back in full furry, but the hypomania didn't.  So basically I felt like crap all the time.  And now sleeping problems and weight gain have become issues.  I go for days without sleeping, but its not that I am not tired, my body just can't sleep, so I am sluggish and withdrawn during the day.  Kind of sucks. But, it has only been four months, so maybe it can still work for me.  Last time I visited the psych, she bumped me up from 100mg to 150mg and reminded me that it was important to take the meds.  Its not like I wasn't before, I just don't like taking them. . . but apparently I am a suicide risk, so people get all freaked if I don't take them.  I don't know.  Go luck to anyone taking it.	F	18	4  months	1/27/2009Email
4	yes	hives and small rash nothing serious.insomnia.but i take a simple sleeping pill and that does the trick.I go off in a daze sometimes when people are talking to me i hear them but dont know what they said.Tingling in my cheeks and jaw.This medicine has helped me a lot though so i could say i dont mind the side effects because i feel better when im taking lamictal when i forget to take it for a day or so i feel horrible so i know it works,considering ive been taking it for a good while it took me since i was 4 to find a medication that worked.

It changed my life completely, Then, by a cruel coincidence snatched away. I suggest trying it and see if it works.	M	39	2  months	11/30/2008Email
4	Bipolar II	Appetite loss, blurred vision, dizzy, "high" feeling at first	The appetite loss has been the most severe side effect (which I dont mind, I've lost 5 pounds so far), but the other side effects are eliminated completely by exercising immediately after taking the pill. I'm fortunate that I was already working out regularly before taking this medication, but I strongly recommend trying to exercise (even walking) if one were struggling with side effects. It works for me. The drug seems to be clearing my mind as I increase the dosages (started at 25 mg, then 50, etc.). I played the violin when I was young and at a very definite point about 10 years ago seemed to lose my ability. Luckily I kept my violin because I seem to have picked up where I left off 10 years ago! Could be coincidental? Feel free to email me.	F	28	4  weeks	11/2/2008Email
4	Anxiety, irritability, depression	sore throat, weight gain, irregular periods	I felt HUGE relief the first couple of days when I started on 25mg. Now I am on 100mg and I constantly have to drink water and tea as my throat hurts. Also have to keep clearing my throat. Got my period 2 weeks early. Overall though, a positive effect. Will have to wean off soon as I plan to get pregnant in the near future. Also on 20mg Prozac.	F	38	6  weeks	10/11/2008
2	mood disorder	anxiety, headache, head feels heavy and "stuffed up", ears feel plugged up, extreme drowsiness/fatigue, vivid dreams, waking up a lot in the night, mood swings.	I dont think I can do this.  I've never felt this weird on antidepressants. I've never felt bad enough that I start crying uncontrollably and get really scared to take another dose.  I was told this drug is well tolerated but I'm not tolerating it well at all!  Its only been a week but I'm going to ask my doc if I can ween off of it.	F	31	7  days	9/6/2008

The balanced periods are not too severe or out of bounds, but the depressions are paralyzing and suicidal.  i appreciate all the comments from everyone that has hadsuccess with this drug.  i am hoping it is an answer to a 25 year search for controlling the depressions i have had. Hang in there people.	M	45	7  days	8/27/2008Email
3	bipolar II	vision blurry, fuzzy-headed, loss of creativity and enthusiasm, sex drive MAJORLY decreased	I had the side effects described by others on this page regarding fuzzy-headedness, dropping words, etc., as well as vision problems, but I have noticed these are lessened if I take the dosage at night. I was at 100 mgs for some time and recently increased to 150, but my sex drive is literally ENTIRELY gone.  As this is creating problems in my marriage, I am dropping back to 125 and am going to hold there for a while to reassess.  Also general loss of creativity, although I wonder if the loss of sex drive and creativity are because I am missing the manic phases.	F	31	1.5  years	8/26/2008
4	Bipolor	Listlessness, increased appetite, fatigue, insomnia.	I've been at 200 mg for over a year now. It leveled things out. The raging ended and the quick swings into depression stopped too. It was almost miraculous. Lately, I have had almost no energy, don't get enthused about anything any more. I feel rather zombie-like. Sleep was a problem until the doctor put me on Ambien. No problem any more.	M	50	16  months	8/15/2008Email

The sideeffects are a mild nuisance compared to suicide and deep depression.  Had one bout of depression at 5 months this time andincreased the dosage from 100mg. to 150mg. and will soon try 200mg.  Also take 150mg. of wellbutrin upon waking and 150 mg. at noon.

But I have recently discovered that I have osteoporosis and that Lamictal interferes w/ absorption of Vitamin D and calcium.  I have also experienced severe cognitive deficits since taking the drug--memory loss, difficulty finding words, can't remember how to do basic arithmetic.  I am now re-thinking my use of this drug.	F	62	4  years	6/7/2008
3	bipolar 2	at first, none. now i am experiencing agitation, hostility, racing negative thoughts, dysphoria, emotional detatchment, "spaced out", loss of creativity and motivation	at first, no side effects and i felt better and happier than i have ever felt in my life. i was happy and confident but then i started to feel kinda detatched as i moved up on the dosage scale. then added lexapro and experienced severe agitation, hostility and dyphoria. stopped lexapro and those symptoms worstened and i take xanax to calm me down. it helps ease the anxiety but doesnt remove it completely-just helps me forget it and move on with my day- but i don't enjoy it. i don't enjoy anything i used to. music, movies... music used to get me through the tough times. i don't get excited about anything and my husband thinks i am unhappy in the relationship. that is not the case, i know that deep down. i just don't care about anything. now i am at 100 mg lamictal and just don't care. i have never felt so emotionally flat. i don't feel connected to my husband whom i am normally crazy about.  i understand this stuff takes time to work and i have only been at 100 mg for 2-3 weeks.

1	Mood swings	Severe back and joint pain, 3 spine fractures, high blood pressure, high triglycerides.	My 15 year old son started Lamictal 150 mg at age 12. He has suffered 3 fractures in his spine, terrible bone and joint pain, and high blood pressure. Hasn't been in school in 3 mo. Unable to sit. Been to Cleveland - Pittsburgh had spinal epidurals, facet injections, MRI, bone scans, spect scan, steroid inj, physical therapy, labwork, took many meds -put on Enbrel IM Injections for 3 mo hoping he might have arthritis. Doctors guessed arthritis or that his pain was in his head. Turns out LAMICTAL can cause. VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY which causes high blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, elevated ionized calcium /PTH, fractures AND MORE. Tapering off. Doc started 50,000IU vit D wkly. and 1000mg calcium daily. BE CAREFUL. Vit D Deficiency is serious. Have your blood checked. Lamictal can be helpful but the anticonvulsant family can cause Vit D deficiency.  Are very thankful that we know the source of his pain. We now have hope that the next weeks and months will bring relief. We thank God.	M	15	3  years	5/3/2008
4	moods swings BPll	I think my side effects were non existent, started off with very small doesage like others here, was increased slowly to 150mg, 75 twice daily...have experienced some weird things going on which i attribute to age and life...maybe the drug	For 15 months it was my wonder drug, lived a very even keel life and was very happy.  Past two months have had a slight hypomania and now think i am sinking into depression.  Figure it is time for a doseage adjustment?  Would luv to hear from someone, who has had a similar prob.

3	Bipolar	I have weight gain since risperdal was added to it. However, lamictal works well with me.	It's known that lamictal can cause cleft palate in new borns if the mother to be is taking the medication.  Get off it before having children.	F	28	6  months	4/16/2008Email
4	Bipolar II	short-term memory loss, fuzzy head, drowsiness, inability to articulate things, disinterest in exercise, possibly why I keep getting sick, lack of motivation, indifference	In many ways this med has been wonderful- my moods are the most stable they have ever been. That said, I am starting to feel like an idiot. I am a writer and I can't even call my children by the proper name, let alone combine correct verbs and nouns to express myself properly. It used to only take me an hour in the morning to start functioning; now I feel like it never happens. Also, I have little desire to do anything- I used to be physically fit and eat well, now I have little motivation to do either. And I keep getting sick, which never used to happen. All of this seems to be getting worse in the last four months. On 200mg, ready to reduce my dose. Definitely won't get off all the way. Don't get all that excited about anything anymore.

5	bipolar	Slight weight loss immediately after weening off depakote ER.	The drug is expensive & has potentially serious rashes as possible side-effects but I would gladly pay double because it allows me to work with a clear head & doesn't make me feel lethargic nor does it make me feel as though I have no true RANGE of emotions.	M	44	2.5  years	3/26/2008
4	Epilepsy	Acne	I switched to Lamictal after taking Depakote for several years.  I am currently on 100mg/day and I have no complaints other than acne.  I had flawless skin before taking this drug and it hasn't been the same since.  All and all though, its a good drug, especially in comparison with Depakote.	F	26	6  years	3/24/2008
4	1st DX: PTSD 2nd: Mood Dis NOS	At 25mg for two weeks I experienced: dull headache, dizzinessAt 50mg: dull headache, blurred vision, rapid eye twitch, nausea, very dry eye. Increased dreaming. Felt like I slept better.At jump to 100mg: Acute Insomnia, blurred vision, headache, eye twitch, dry eye. Went down to 75mg: Developed swollen bottom lip with 1 pencil erasure sized ulcer on inside lip, blurred vision in the morning, coordination problems, eye twitch, dry eye got worse.Lip swelled to twice it's size with some soreness. Stopped the drug immediately. Took liquid Benydryl for four days and it finally went down.Now going to rechallenge.	Despite the having the side affects, I was feeling better, less anxious, happier and much less hypervigalence. I noticed I felt rested in the morning before I jumped to the 100mg dose causing me to have major insomnia. Going back down stopped that. I again experience restful sleep. My partner noticed very positive changes in my mood while on the 50mg dose. You know, despite what people say is the theraputic dose, 50mgs might be fine for me.I'm re-challenging at a much slower titration up. I'm hoping it works because it's the only drug I've found to be helpful for my problem.I was wondering if others had similar experiences.	F	38	1.5  months	3/15/2008
3	Bipolar I	Inability to sleep	Lamictal is a good mood stabilizer. However, the effectiveness wears off with us. I had to switch to Lithium to stabilize my mood.	F	18	 	2/20/2008
3	bipolar I	I am also experiencing joint paint, but it is only on the left side of my body.  My elbow, shoulder, and knee all on the left side ache when I try to exercise.  Other than that I do have relatively low side effects, little shaking, little blood work.  I also lose my balance once in a while.  In a way I like this the best, but I can't work out and I do tend to eat more.	I also have a hard time completing tasks.  I start 50 projects and not finish 1.  I have a hard time concentrating and am having a hard time at work.  Before I added abilify to help this, but the side effects are unbearable.  I have a hard time swallowing, walking, and get sunburned easy.  The other problem is doctors are not open to discussing side effects, or possibility of.  Pharmacists are better for information, but they can't practice medicine.	M	29	5  years	2/20/2008Email
4	BiPolar and Depression	I have had(have)the memory thing, the clumsiness, constipation, and the intestinal pain. But this drug along with Vistral and Wellbutrin has changed my life.	I was scared to take the drug after reading all the posts, but I would have killed myself without it. I can tolerate the side effects to feel like my old self again. I am lucky that it works for me. It was like someone throwing a switch.	M	40	15  days	2/16/2008
5	Epilepsy	None, really! A slight weight gain (about 7 lbs), and a little extra drowsiness (it takes me a little longer to get going in the morning).  I'm extremely satisfied at how little it effects my life negatively, though.	This drug changed my life. I was having nighttime seizures and partial seizures many times a week.. it was ruining my social, school and work life. As soon as my neurologist started me on the slowest dose (gradually moving up), my seizures stopped COMPLETELY. I now feel great and don't live in fear of having a seizure. I'm living my life to the fullest and thank God every day for having Lamictal.	F	24	4  years	2/12/2008Email
4	epilepsy	while taking lamictal the only side effect is a little fatigue, and increase in appetite, about a five pound weighgt gain in four years.	I think lamicatal is a wonderful drug for treatmetn of epilepsy, I take 400 mg a day .  It also helps my mood. it's very expensive about $400 for 60 200Mg pills.  If you have no insurance and low income the epilepsy foundation will give you a 3 month supply of it .  Just go to epilepsy foundation .com	F	28	4  years	2/8/2008
4	Partial seizures+Absence seizures	Night sweats ( i wake up with my pajamas soaked through and have had to change them up to twice a night) Insomnia,and anxiety	I like this med, i was on Trileptal before, but had breakthrough seizures. The pill is tiny! compared to my gargantuan Trileptal pill. I take a lot of meds, so a smaller pill is nice.does anyone out there have a history of prematurity and has developed benign liver tumors?

1	Agression and Drepression	The first day that I started to take the medication from the Starter Kit, I experianced the normal side effects that it has said like dizziness and blurred vision. The other side effects that I have come across on the 3rd day is the whole left side of my face hurts so bad as if someone hit me with a baseball bat. The other one is that severe color blindness has set in to the fact that all my blacks are red and blues are purple.		M	36	3  days	2/3/2008Email

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

I cant afford a lawyer or I would sew. SERIOUS BRAIN DAMAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!	I wish i could sew them and make it to where these companies can not sell their poison to another child teen or adult.

1	addition to an anti-depressant	Oh my god it was terrible. A day or two after starting it I got sooooo dizzy I couldn't even stand I just wanted to lay down and die. Worst feeling ever-it made me not able to think clearly, and keep my train of thought. I got off of it within 1-2 weeks	Spare yourself and don't try it	F	18	2  weeks 1X D	1/9/2011
2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite.

At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.	F	36	7  days2 MG 1X D	7/15/2010Email
2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
