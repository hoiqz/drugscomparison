4	Adhd	This medicine helped my grades dramatically! I am doing so well in school and im so happy. The down side is ive had so many side effects. I have lost my appetite COMPLETLEY and at 3am i binge eat which is getting out of hand. I find it so hard to sleep, im lucky if i fit in 5 hours a night. I have really embarrassing nervous twitches, blinking really hard, scrunching up my face and clearing my throat 24/7. I panic alot at the smallest things and have basically lost all confidence to public speak or talk infront of huge people. I stutter my words a little bit lately and overthink alot too. Since i dont eat, i cant sleep which means at school i try to focus but im so hungry and tired i cant! Sometimes i wont take my tablet just so i get a good nights sleep and actually eat, but i am so unfocused without it. It helps but its a risk		F	16	1  years	4/1/2013

1	ODD/educational use.	I have to say that this is the worst medication I have ever taken or even created. First of all, when I first took it It felt alright, and then I started to feel crappy and not being able to eat. It honestly feels like methanphetamines, and I have done that and feels the exact same way. As well, this medication could be highly addicting, as well as abusive, I even abused it and yes it does add a high. Like really, I don't understand why doctors give this out when its not even healthy for you! If your on this get off immediately!		M	16	4  days54mg	3/30/2013Email
5	ADHD	Some trouble sleeping at night.   Best to take the second you wake up. 10 year old son on 72mg for 3 months.    only trouble is sleeping as well.	It is a great medication, providing you take consistently.   I don't believe in breaks.   I find if you break, the first couple days rough emotionally, and i find it works best after 2 weeks straight.   but thats just me.	M	36	4  years72MG 1X D	3/18/2013Email
5	ADD	The best description i have for effects of taking concerta is "Limitless" the movie that when taking this clear pill changes this guys life dramaticly. (with out it turning bad of course). 1 bad thing with me taking it is i have to stop. my insurance claims that me being 20 has no need for this medication. without it i get so bad that i irratate myself because i say things without thinking, i am bouncing off the walls, and i cant stay quit even if noone is around. another bad thing is that the 2nd year i was on it i got very depressed (not from the medication) and after that started anxiety then came severe panic disorder mostly because of the amount of caffiene plus my depresstion but now my mind works different bc of the concerta and i cant get away from the panic until i was prescribed colonzapam which now slows me down. great medication but caution when using		M	20	5  years54-36	2/24/2013Email

5	adhd	Stomach pains, diarrhea, anxiety, weight loss all in all good medicine! I can focus better, I feel great and I can complete my tasks like I'm supposed to. I have more motivation to do things. My memory has improved. My relationship with people has improved. The way I'm talking is more clearer. It's nice to feel your mind clear. I didn't know I had ADHD until my psychiatrist prescribed it. Works awesome and I'm very happy.		F	25	10  days18 mg	1/17/2013Email

5	ADHD	Loss in appetite, for the first few weeks I had an increased heart rate for the first few hours after taking my pill in the morning.	This medication has greatly improved my life!  I went on it for the first time when I was 15, because I was so depressed and counseling was not helping.  One doctor even put me on anti depressants, which just made me feel like a zombie.  Then a doctor tested me for ADHD, which might have been missed since I was such a good student, and it turned out I had most of the symptoms.  I was like a new person with concerta, learning didn't feel so exhausting anymore. Focusing wasn't such a metal workout. I was much happier.  When I was 21 I went off of it for a year because I felt pressured to by society, and I gained a ton of weight, didn't feel like myself, and became depressed.  I went back on after a year of being of it and felt like myself again, and became committed to a fitness routine and lost all the weight I gained and more.  I'll never be guilt tripped into going off of it again, it helps me to be more myself.	F	23	7  years36 1X D	11/5/2012Email
3	ADD	headaches, appetite loss, very fast heart beat, severe breathlessness, fidgity but only in the beginning.	My 15 year old son started because he was disruptive in class, poor concentration, terrible grades. So far he says he can focus better and he grades have improved and, he has lots of energy. Orginally he started on 27mg but was very frightened by the side effects, racing heart, tremors, extreme breathlessness and a very bad headache. He was only supoposed to be on this dose for a week then go up to the prescribed dose for his weight = 36mg. He came off for a week then dropped the dose to 18mg. Said it was much better; noticed it was very diffiuclt to come off it at the weekends as he experineced the symptoms again on monday when he re-started. After a month he said he felt the dose should go up and he started taking the 27mg. This dose seems to be working for him; suspect he could do with 36mg but he doesn't want to try this dose. Best advanage is he is no longer so depressed as his grades are better and he doesn't get into so much trouble at school anymore. He chooses himself to take continously, no weekend breaks and even sets early morning alarm so he doesn't miss. I think he must be seeing a big difference if he is so diligent about taking it!	M	15	3  months27MG 1X D	10/18/2012
5	ADD	Insomnia & decreased appetite  -  I've now been on this medication for 6 days and will increase the dose again tomorrow to 54mg.  So far, these are the only two side effects I've experienced.  I was really irritable on day 3, but I think this might be hormone related, not drug related.  I'm glad my doctor started me on a lower dose to begin with, and I'm a little nervous about doubling my dose!  I'm not sleeping much and I'm worried that it will get worse!  If anyone has any advice on how to cope with the insomnia, please let me know... I'm kinda tired!	I still feel a deep sense of calm on this drug and so far it's been a big help, even after just 6 days. I don't feel like I have to 'go, go, go' yet, but I have noticed that I'm not so overwhelmed with things I need to get done.  In fact, I feel for the first time in years, like I actually want to accomplish stuff.  I had started to find everyday life too much, and would end up getting very little done in a day.  My focus hasn't improved a whole lot yet, but I'm very happy with the overall drug so far.  Just being able to look at the dishes and get them done without feeling like it was "too much" is fantastic.  Everything stressed me out, and the feeling of being overwhelmed by most everything has diminished so much.	F	45	6  days27mg 1X D	10/9/2012EmailHistory
4	ADHD	I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, yes from my doctor. He set me up with 54mg of Concerta. He said take it everyday for the first week. Well today was the first day. I felt excellent. I completed a lot of my tasks with no distractions. I felt focused, relaxed, confident and had a sense of calmess. Mind you I was freaked out about trying this drug because I never took any kind of meds or drugs. It worked great. After around 5 hours the side effects kicked in. This include fast heart rate 90bpm, nervousness, headache, loss of apetite. I felt kind of scared because my heart was racing, it lasted for 4 hours. But slowly decreased in speed. I took 2 ibuprophens for my headache. Can anyone email me why my side effects were so harsh? Is 54mg too much. My doc said take on pill everyday but I feel like that's unhealthy. Please email me! I would Greatly appreciate it! And if anyone has any questions also feel free to send an email! I will answer back. :)		M	20	1  days54 MG	10/7/2012Email
4	ADHD	head aches, no appetite, no emotion, depression, no eye contact, no sleep, always worrying, looking around constantly, always have to be busy, and you feel like the drug is literally wastinng you away in the middle of the day.	i love concerta like the side effects are bad but ive been taken it for 9 years and im used to it. im at the highest dosage 72 MG and my grades are good and everything is good honeslty the side affects can be bad but if you need this to concentrate in school it will help.	F	16	9  years72 MG 1X D	10/1/2012
4	ADD, MDD, and Social Anxiety/Phobia	I am about as hungry as I always was, but now I can't eat nearly as much as used to. I've also noticed that I'm having a few more panic attacks. I'm a bit more suspicious of people, so maybe very mild paranoia. My OCD is a bit worse. I sometimes sweat like a pig or get heartburn after taking this med. Whenever I don't take Concerta, I feel like I've got the flu and experience severe anxiety/depression. Oh, and the drug is constipating.	Okay, here's a bit of exposition. See, I was always a good student. A B was typically the lowest score I'd get. However, when Ninth grade rolled around, it rolled over me. My A's and B's degraded into D's and F's. I was confused about this, and that confusion turned into rage. To put it bluntly, I was an ass. My family berated me for my inability to focus, which caused me a rather large amount of distress. Eventually, I plunged into despair and just gave up. Until I received Concerta last January. This med changed my life for the better. I was rather hesitant to take this drug, as I worried that it would worsen my anxiety. I didn't even know I had ADD, so that was a knock.So, the next morning dawned and I popped one of those yellow little pills. Within minutes, I felt my focus becoming sharper and my generally dark mood starting to lift.Let me cut to the chase: This drug changed my life for the better. My GPA skyrocketed, and is now at 3.0 and rising. I no longer harbor violent feelings toward others and myself. People like me now, and I find myself liking them, too. My anxiety rears its ugly head a bit more often now, but considering the benefits that this med gave me, I'd say it is a fair price to pay. So, to parents and patients of every age, I implore you to consider Concerta as a treatment option. This medicine gave me my life back.	M	16	9  months18 M.G 1X D	9/24/2012
4	ADHD	No Appetite. Dry Mouth. Hands always Shaking.	Increased focus and slightly calming. Makes it hard to eat a normal amount of food	M	19	11  years126 MG 1X D	9/21/2012
3	ADHD, depression	Enhanced effect of antidepressants, increased libido.  Improved attention for 1-2 weeks.	It has definitely enhanced the effect of the antidepressants I'm taking (150mg Webutrin SR, 2 in am, 1 in afternoon; Citalopram HBR 40mg, 1xday).   It helped with my adult-onset ADHD for the first 1-1.5 weeks. It seemed like I was back to "normal." I could go do several errands in one trip (instead of finishing the first one and not being able to bear the idea of doing another). I could stay focused on my work for 6-8 hours/day (rather than just 1-2 hours). Unfortunately, that affect wore off after a week or two and I'm already at the max. dosage.  My libido, which has been low for years (due to antidepressants?) is finally back, which has improved my marriage.	F	52	5  months36 mg 2X D	9/9/2012Email
3	ADHD	My side effects on this drugs were pretty much the same as the other comments i read, except for the fact that today i noticed myself having difficulty saying simple words.. It was really strange.. Im hoping this goes away. Though it isnt recommended, im gonna split my pills in half and try that out.. Having social anxiety is bad enough, but impaired speech?! Um no thanks		M	21	1  months54mg	9/2/2012Email
3	adhd	Loss of appetite. Headache when i first take it after a long time without. Mouth tics. I've been taking it for awhile and its the best adhd medicine I've been on I've been on a lot of different ones.		F	17	4  years54	8/31/2012Email
5	social anxiety inattentive add	This medication completely changed my life. Im so social now i can have fun without being worried about being judged by anyone. Im dating which i couldnt do before concerta. I can focus on my work and have kept a job for a year, before i was having nervous breakdowns and quitting jobs every3 months. I know everyone responds to medication differently but ive been on every anti depression and every anti anxiety med out there and this is the only one that has given me complete releif of social anxiety and my add and also the general dysthymia that goes along with having these conditions. If ypu have a true dopemine imbalance this mefication can and will change your life		F	32	1  years56mg	8/27/2012Email
5	ADD/ADHD	Loss of appetite, Headaches from time to time, most of the time do to not eating. Longer time to fall asleep. Anti social. Try to stay to myself. Started noticing that im not "Mr. Freak in the sheets" no more	I always compared myself to a squirrel, always turning my attention to different things in a room lol Now I can concentrate for the first time in my life! Very greatful. I think before I speak while on my medication.Overall im am totally satisfied with the medicine. The only big issue I have is not being able to performing well in bed. I lose my erection. Told my Dr. about it and he said that there should not be an issue with keeping my penis erect :/	M	23	4  months18mg 3X D	8/25/2012Email
5	ADHD	None that were worse than not taking it.I was always underweight due to forgetting or being too distracted to eat, but the Concerta helps me remember to eat even if I don't feel hungry, so I eat pretty much the same despite the loss of appetite. The mild insomnia has improved over the years. I am a perfectionist while on it.	Thank G-d for this medication.  Before, I had no friends, and was failing in school, and felt I was a failure. Now I've graduated college, have several job offers, and have matured socially. I hope to eventually use what I've learned on it and start going off it. Parents - it is not worth to risk your child's future. If your child needs this medication put them on it. The side effects are not that bad for many people, it is just that they are more likely to write about it if it doesn't work than if it does.PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU HAVE INFORMATION OR EXPERIENCE ABOUT CONCERTA DURING PREGNANCY. This would help me make an informed decision.	F	22	12  years54 mg 1X D	8/7/2012Email
5	To treat ADD	Racing Heart, Nervousness, Dizziness, Confusion, BUT these symptoms only persist for about 4 days after I start taking Concerta. After that it all levels out and I feel great.	This drug sucks for the first few days after you take it, but after that it's wonderful; you feel great and you can concentrate on things easily for hours. Once you start taking it though, try to avoid breaks in dosages, because then when you start taking it again you'll have to go through all the symptoms you did when you first started taking it all over again.	M	19	4  years27 MG 1X D	8/1/2012
3	ADD	It helps me throughout the day, I can stick to a task and finish it. My tip is that you take it immediately after you eat breakfast. I feel like a robot zombie at times. I'm not as creative as I used to. I would highly recommend to use this for school/work. Increase dosage if needed. But be careful.		F	16	2  weeks18 mg	7/13/2012
2	ADHD	I can't believe all the reviews about anorexia and weight loss, I had increased hunger and weight gain of about 10 pounds over the month I took Concerta. It also caused me to have visual hallucinations. Concerta is also addicting, I found that unlike Adderall, I found myself needing to take Concerta in the morning. It was actually good because I had a problem with taking medication every day, but it's still an addictive drug.	For those who have taken Adderall, I learned the hard way that Concerta is a much stronger drug. It takes a much smaller dose of Concerta to be equal to Adderall. Concerta also requires a build up over days to fully work. So, unlike with Adderall, if you don't take Concerta for a day or 2, it will take a couple days to build up to full strength again. Overall, it helped me concentrate, but I had a lot of side-effects. And as someone who doesn't normally take medication, I could tell it was the drug itself. Especially because if I would stop for a couple days, symptoms would cease.	F	23	30  days8 1X D	7/12/2012Email
3	Helps with school and driving ADD	Insomnia,trouble eating,nervousness, overheating, muslce twitches, rarely increased heart rate		F	16	3  weeks18 MG	7/2/2012
2	ADHD	Extreme rebound irritability - anger & defiance. Deceased appetite.	My son (then 6) started taking concerts after experiencing severe rebound irritability in the afternoons & evenings with Vyvanse. Concerta caused the same reaction. He now takes Focalin XR and after 7 months is still doing  GREAT!  Still has deceased appetite with Focalin XR, but I counteract that with a heafty breakfast (that includes protein) and a hearty dinner (he is starving by dinnertime). All 3 meds are stimulants, so it just goes to show that you have to be patient and persistent. Find a physician you trust who is experienced and will work with you.	M	7	2  weeks 1X D	6/30/2012

5	adult ADD	in the beginning, slight head ache, slight irritability	I've had ADD all my life, but went undiagnosed until now. My teachers would ALWAYS put on my report card "Needs to practice selft control", and "Needs to use time wisely".  I never knew what they meant.  At 37 I am now taking Concerta.  I finally know how it feels to focus, complete tasks, be on time and be in control.  Concerta works for people that really have ADD.  I love it.	F	37	10  days36 1X D	6/10/2012Email
3	ADD/ADHD	Pros: My grades improved from Cs to Ds to As and Bs  It worked very quickly (in about an hour or so)Cons: I'm lucky if I even have a small appetite for lunch (I take it at about 7am and at around 3pm I'm so hungry that I'm not hungry, if that makes sense). I get nervous and tend to fear the worst. I find it harder to carry a conversation than usual. I don't really have the will to do anything (I love horseback riding and have been doing it for 7 years but as soon as I started the medication I had little to no interest in it)		F	16	8  months36 MG	6/8/2012
2	ADHD	it sucks don't give this to your kids I had shortness of breath I thought I was going to die I didn't wana eat at all AND I LOVE TO EAT but I'm kinda under weight anyways shaking. depression. crying for no reason I rather stick With ADHD dan take this mess		F	14	2  weeks27mg	6/4/2012Email
3	Adhd	Concerta makes me very focused, my grades have improved from 2.8 to 3.8 GPA aha. BUT it does makes me feel irritable and on-edge most of the time, i have no appetite when I take it and have to force myself to eat. It also just makes me feel physically gross and kinda depressed. If you really only need it for school, take breaks on weekends and you'll feel better.		F	15	8  months36 mg	5/29/2012
5	ADD without Hyperactivity	- slight paranoia, but not overly noticeable. - if you take a second pill after 1 pm (allowed in my case), insomnia- Time perception a bit off	*It should be noted that I have an NVLD comorbidity along with ADD without Hyperactivity(to skip to the effects, go to paragraph 3) I suffered from undiagnosed ADD that went unnoticed due to my NVLD comorbidity. For years, I worked harder than my work reflected. I would get in trouble at home and school for being disorganized and for my grades, which were lower than my sister's. Both my parents went to top universities, and they believed I was being lazy. I became depressed.  Then, I figured out that I probably had ADD, and had the diagnosis confirmed by my doctor. Concerta changed my life.  I could focus in class.  My homework is super long and neat, my lab report was the most detailed in the class. It's only been a few days but I adore Concerta :) EFFECTS:  It took about an hour to kick in. I felt razor-focused. It peaked about two hours after I took it, and ADD symptoms came back around 7-8 hours after taking it. Time perception is off- for example yesterday morning feels like ages ago, like it couldn't possibly be in the same week. Focus is INCREDIBLE.  I 100% recommend it. 	F	18	3  days18 1X D	5/20/2012Email

3	ADD	Pro's: increased energy, "bull-dog" focus (lock onto task and stay until completed), sleep better, decreased appetiteCons: warmer body temp, muscle twitching (eye-lid, upper lip, side of nose), decreased sex drive, poor memory, dry mouth (which resulted in bad breath and chapped lips), lack of interest in hobbies, "bull-dog" focus (couldn't stop focusing on non-essential things), sensitive to caffeine, hard to think (felt like I was taking stupid pills)	I have stopped taking Concerta because I was focusing on the wrong things and would waste hours on no-essential tasks and not get my regular tasks done.  The muscle twitching started mild, but after awhile it got really annoying and was constantly happening.  Now that I have stopped, I am experiencing extreme tiredness and headaches and depression.  Not sure if I should try a different medication or a lower dosage?I really liked that I slept so much better, but I don't like the way it made my brain feel.....I would really have to think about what I was supposed to do next.  It really brought to reality that joke about, "Have you ever stopped to think and forget to start again?"	F	42	3  months27mg 1X D	4/19/2012

4	ADHD	The first week and a half, my son had a lot of insomnia and excessive talking (very philosophical). Sometimes he felt "melancholy" (his word) for no reason. Some days he would be extremely irritable after school. These side effects have lessened considerably as the weeks passed to where now I would consider them occasional.	My son is extremely bright and a delightful child, but he has struggled in school since kindergarten. He had an abnormally hard time (even for a little kid) sitting still and controlling his impulsive behaviors. You had to repeat directions about 10 times to get him to follow through. The bedtime routine was a nightly disaster. By second grade, his self-esteem was beginning to suffer and he would ask things like, "Why am I so stupid?? I am so dumb!!" I was resistant to the idea of putting him on medication, but from the second day he was on Concerta, his behavior improved dramatically and his teacher said he was "engaged,happy and eager to learn." At home, most days he is polite, pleasant and helpful. He is still silly and energetic, but not in inappropriate ways. He is much happier, and I am happy for him. We still deal with side effects sometimes, but I do find that if he plays outside a lot or gets a lot of exercise in gym class, the insomnia is much improved. I try to keep an open dialogue with him on his mood and how he is feeling, just in case anything changes.	M	8	30  days18mg 1X D	3/23/2012Email
1	ADHD	My son is taking this drug. Before taking this drug he was very loving and friendly. I never had any issues with his as a baby up until he was around 6. In school he had trouble focusing, so the school pestered me until I got him on medication. Since they upped his dose I have noticed very negative behaviors such as him seeming very angry most of the time, easily set off, not wanting to do chores and giving me a hard time about it, putting others down, being suspicious of others, trouble sleeping, etc. When I received the info on this drug from the DR the side effects did not seem major, so didn't think it had anything to do with the drug but today decided to look up the side effects online. These are some of the side effects that I found:-addiction-Craving cocaine-trouble sleeping-Behavior and thought problems-aggressive behavior and hostility-bipolar illness-slowing of growth (height and weight)-feeling suspicion and paranoia -psychotic symptoms-may later disrup	This is not worth it, the school counselor tried to say it may be puberty, but I don't think so. Most of the time a mother knows, plain and simple. This is NOT the child I knew, he is the complete opposite. He has an appointment today, he will be weened off of this medication. I did research on other medications as well, so he will not be put on any more, I do not want my son effected later in life. I would also like to mention that the schools pressure parents to put their children on this medication, I know ours did and as I was doing my research I found a lot of other parents who were placed in the same situation, this angers me now knowing the side effects.

4	ADD	I started taking concerta when I was really young, I'm now 20 & in college. This medication has changed my life dramatically. Though it also took a whole lot of hard work on my end, I went from failing student to graduating nursing school next year. However the side effects of this drug have limited me. I have ALWAYS had problems eating while on this medication. I would often eat 2-3 crackers in the AM, take my medication & realize its 8pm & all I've eaten we're a few crackers. It's been really difficult for me to eat, and I've stayed at the same weight for 5 years. I'm 5 9 and weigh 125. Often times it worries me how little I eat when on this medication, but the benefits outweigh the side effects. I was curious if anyone had the problem of feeling hungry but mentally you were unable to eat & had zero appetite? Anyways I'll take this medication on days where I have class or needing to study, other days I don't take it & feel great.		F	20	10  years54mg	3/2/2012
5	ADD	When i was younger and started taking it i didn't really have any negative side effects, although as ive gotten older (Im 18 now and started it when i was 8) ive had issues with ocd symptoms (very very mild) and eyesight, also normal hormone surges through puberty were dulled down and delayed a few years compared to my peers.	Its amazing when it comes to helping me focus and concentrate, but if i have nothing to concentrate on i catch myself getting obsessive compulsive with various random things, im still taking it now and whenever i have stopped taking it my lack of focus is impairing and i have instant weight gain, i havent had issues with sleeping but im sure anyone who's taking it knows if you stop it and start taking it again the day you restart you feel odd, like your floating out of your body or zoned out, but for me it only lasts that day.

4	ADHD	My family would have never thought that I had ADHD because I got a's and b's and rarely a c in elementary school. I went to the doctor because I had SEVERE memory problems. It seemed almost impossible for me to remember something somebody told me a minute ago. But I found out I had ADHD. I lost 16 pounds taking this pill, partly because I was growing up and working out. I was 96 (a little chubby) and I went to 82 in 7th grade. Now I'm in 9th grade and I weigh 86. I get hungry sometimes but I have a loss of appetite and sometimes I just don't feel like eating. I am now really skinny and people even comment about it. I havent started my period and I'm flat chested and very short. I have developed severe OCD. Everything I do has to be perfect. My room needs to be clean, my backpack, my makeup has to look perfect, my body, my school work, anything! I am less out going and I am sometimes awkward. I'm not confident at all. The good thing about the pill is that I am a straight a student looking to be a valedictorian and go to UCLA. I am taking an honors class as a freshman in high school currently and I plan to take at least 5 ap classes. I am one of the top students in all of my classes and i am very productive (even though i HATE school).Yes this is a lot of stress and hard work but I'm willing to do it. Insomnia has always been a problem for me. I feel like I have no energy and I feel depressed. All i want to do is sleep. But when I don't take my pill I cannot do anything.

2	Add	Took this medicine and felt great first couple weeks. However started waking up 230 and couldn't fall back asleep. I would be so tired and irritable that I decided to not take it one day to sleep that night. I was so depressed stayed  in the house for weeks!! Even with taking it after that day.  I have stopped taking it slowly and finally feel myself!! So I ask do we take concerta for add and anti depression medicine? Or just deal with it?		F	29	2  months35	2/19/2012
4	ADD	Headache (Almost everday,)Dizziness (When I forget to eat,Anxiety,Nervousness,Obsessive Compulsiveness,Restlessness,Unusual Libido, Decreased Appetite,Insomnia,Increased Heart RateDyspepsia (Discomfort in Upper Abdomen, peripheral coldness	I'm 21 and am in college/co-op.  Concerta is great for me.  I like to call it a "one hit wonder" because when I am in school for 3 months I only take it on days where I need to study. Now that I take it everyday before work it makes me extremely productive, my boss told me today I finish my work too fast.  When the drug is active I can't retain water, I pee probably 7-8 times a day depending on how much water I drink. When the drug wears off though I am lost. I feel like my brain can't produce happiness sometimes, like the dopamine is blocked or I produce too much during the day that at night I'm a zombie.  Also I can't sleep right.  Anyways, I still don't take it on the weekends, and that's because I don't want to be a zombie on a Friday night.  When I miss a day my brain is shot.  Often times my body feels the effects of exhaustion from lack of sleep, but my brain is still operating at 105%, and on that day I miss I'm a wreck.  Maybe it's good then that I don't take it on the weekends because it gives my body a chance to fix itself, but then again I don't know if I took it everyday if I'd be able to adjust and get more sleep and handle the emotions I feel (or don't feel) when it wears off.  If anybody has gone through the "take it now and then and skip some," to taking it everyday I would really love to know what it does for your side effects.	M	21	2  years54 1X D	1/31/2012Email
3	ADD	My son, who is in a boarding school, was off the Concerta for 3 weeks during the Christmas break and when he started back in feel into a deep depression that week that I never seen before or since.  During this time he attempted to hang himself.  He called me before the attempt and told me that he was felling something that he never felt before and asked me if I thought he could be possible bipolar.  He couldnt explain why he was feeling the way he did and indicated the he never felt that low before or since.  Has anyone seen this behavior when Concerta was reintroduced into the body?

3	frontal-lobe injury	Insomnia!  Reduced appetite, jitters, jaw-clenching	A dose of Concerta that is effective for my cognitive issues makes it impossible for me to sleep.  I didn't notice when I first started taking it because there were other contributors to my sleep problems, but now that I'm settled down enough to experiment more, I can see that the insomnia is totally bananas.

3	bipolar diagnosis after 25 yr lupus	extreme weight gain combination of depekote and ablilify  and trazadone for sleep severe depression and then slight stroke eight years ago. Lupus flair ups causes pain and not able to sleep i do not think i should have to take ablify medication for all these years, but want to decrease to 15 mg instead of 30 mg.  i went off the drug 18 months ago and ended up anxiety and panic striken and had to go to a week of health care around the clock to get back on medecine and then they added depekote because i was dizzy. during that stay at the help center i evened  out but they added a sleeping pill. I have no desire to do anything and if i let my mind get busy i start a lot of projects that make other family member crazy so it is best for me to  take several naps a day and stay calm. I eat compulsivley with out stopping to think about chewing and walk to the kithen to get a bite of food and would go back often if someone did not remind me not too.I do things in a hurry and shower half heart	has any one taken abilify as long as i have? over 2 years maybe three.and has any one mixed depekote that i have never had a seizure but they think this will control my bipolar actions. I think after my stroke and losing smell for 8 years.I visited a chiropractor last year and got my smell back, made my life a little better.  But i also take plaqenell, generic when my lupus flairs up and i have not had to take it the last three months. but someone said that they take celebrex for their lupus and i have always taken plaqeunell for the last 20 years when i have a flair up and i usually take it for three months untill symptoms subside. but i think when i went off the ablify on my own because of weight gain and being tired all the time is when it was really a bad week.  I was not rational at all and very anxious. enough that i wanted to go to institution and not ever come back home.  Said i would never go off the med again unless under a doctor that understood lupus and i was under 24	F	65	3  days	11/8/2006

4	severe depression	Insomnia, tiredness	I have been on Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal and Lexapro for severe depression for a little over a year. Recently, I went off the Abilify for two weeks in an effort to decrease my medication (under my Psychiatrist's supervision, because I want to get pregnant) and immediately became depressed and suicidal. Now I have been back on the Abilify for a week and I feel 'normal' again. The main problem that I am experiencing is insomnia at night and lack of energy during the day. Overall, it has really helped to balance my severe depression.	F	29	1  years	10/1/2006
