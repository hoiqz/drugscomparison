1	Acne	Dry skin, Red raw skin, Burning, Itchiness, Rash, Flaking	Applied on my chin for my cystic acne. Woke up and my chin was bright red, raw and very sore. My skin was flaking off and it was very itchy which made the redness and soreness worse. It also made my chin worse by bringing it out in very little spots allover my chin. Took 2 weeks for my face to go back to normal. NOT HAPPY!	F	15	2  months25mg 2X D	3/9/2013
2	teenage acne	I was fine for the first two week. Then one hot day i went out and enjoyed the Sun for a while. After about half an hour a rash started to appear on my chest where I had applied the Duac. I thought it was sunburn and ignored it. The next morning when i woke up, my whole face, chest and shoulders were bright red, sore and itchy. For the next 3 nights i coudn't sleep and i was in a lot of pain. DO NOT EXPOSE PLACES WHERE DUAC IS ON SKIN TO THE SUN!	I must say, at first the Duac was clearing up my spots slowly. But after this incident I WILL NOT be using it again.

1	acne	What a nightmare.  Duac caused horrible chemical burns on my face.  I painted a Duac smiley face on my cheek before bedtime and the next morning I had a painful severe sunburn-blistered smiley-face grinning back at me in the mirror.  My dermatologist apologized and said I must be sensitive to the peroxide in Duac.  The smiley face on my cheek agreed.	The next time I want to create chemical burns on my face I'll at least go for Hydrochloric Acid or Sulfuric Acid - - - at least they're cheaper and have a cooler name than Duac.

5	Facial Acne	No side effects AT ALL!	I have tried it all... Pro-active worked "ok" for me, but it eventually stopped working- i guess cuz my skin got used to it.. which happens alot with skin care products. But with DUAC topical gel, it completely cleared my face with in two weeks, and i have NOT HAD ONE PIMPLE SINCE THEN.	F	30	2  years45 grams 1X D	9/5/2010
