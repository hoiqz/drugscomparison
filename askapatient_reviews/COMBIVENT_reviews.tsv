				F M	 	 	    
4	Bronchitis	Week limbs, increased hunger, coughed directly after use		F	16	4  weeks	4/11/2012
4	Asthma	Cough after using, but that is more a productive effect than a side effect.	I use this with Maxair when my asthma is severe and it works well for me. It makes me cough right away and begin to clear the cottony mucus that comes with asthma out of my airways. Less heart racing than with albuterol.	M	53	6  years1-2 puffs 1X AN	12/7/2010
5	Asthma	None that I am aware of.	This works better for me than the regular Albuterol inhalers, like Proventil, ProAir etc. It has albuterol in it but also has Ipratopium Bromide.  This combination seems to be more effective to open my airways during an acute attack.  This is mainly a COPD medicine, but it is being more widely prescribed for asthma because for many it is more effective.  It acts much more quickly for me than Albuterol inhalers alone do. I can also use it up to six times a day, but Usually once or twice is enough.	M	53	2  years1-2 sprays 4X D	10/19/2010
2	emphysema and asthma	I could not inhale the drug without violent coughing. It did open the airways incredibly but within a few hours I got very painful joints [knees and arm bones] Pain bad enough to prevent sleeping. This pain would go within 24 hours of stopping the combivent.	It was wonderful for opening the airways after the initial bronchospasm on taking but the pain in the muscles and bones of arms and legs was unbearable.	F	70	7  days	5/22/2009
2	emphysema	It was very tough to take this med because even with a spacer it made me cough every time I tried to take it.  Had more success with Atrovent taken separately or nebulized DuoNeb.	Spiriva works much better for me than Combivent ever did & it NEVER makes me cough.  Never could figure out why Combivent made me cough & Atrovent even via MDI didn't make me cough nearly as badly.

4	son was taking for Asthma/pneumonia	coughing, but nothing out of the ordinary. Coughing may have been from Pneumonia. It seemed to do the trick slighty.	It seemed to work, but I am unsure. He was in the red or low yellow zone on his peak flow meter, this medication allowed him to get to the high yellow zone. May have been the medication, or he was just getting better.

1	to improve breathing	Dreadful pain in left lung, cramp in liver area actually the whole diaphram.  Pain goes in minutes but so painful when occurs approx. 20 min. after taking I'm tossing it.		F	62	 	9/4/2005

1	breathing difficulty	Severe coughing fits	Actual drug used is Albuterol which is a Combivent generic.	F	79	14  days	8/11/2004
2		Throughout taking this inhaler medication I noticed that it irritates the throat and causes a severe coughing fit with each use.  I had better results with the use of plain albuterol, however, my M.D. suggested I try combivent.  I am definitely dissatisfied with the results.		F	25	1.5  months	7/7/2004
