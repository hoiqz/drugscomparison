5	over active bladder	The only side effect is dry eyes and mouth	I use to get up 15 times a night and was so tired the next day and all through the day I would run to the bathroom every half hour and would leak not being able tto hold it in, now I only get up once  sometimes not even this drug has saved my life and sanity I would recommend this to anyone.

5	stress incontinence, leakage	drymouth	So far so good.  My underwear are actually dry for the first time in a very long time.  Only complaint is drymouth.  I was constantly wetting myself a little bit throughout the day..when I coughed or sometimes for no reason other than having the "urge" at inconvenient times.	F	38	5  days4mg 1X D	3/5/2010
5	Overactive Bladder	No side effects, even after 3 years on the drug. I take the 4mg dose. My frequency of urination has dropped from every hour or so to about 4-5 hours apart...this is a huge improvement in my quality of life. I also no longer need panty liners.	I recommend this drug. I recognize that there are others on the market that serve the same purpose. If Detrol causes side effects for you, consult your doctor and try a different medication. No one should have to suffer from overactive bladder.	F	60	3  years	12/21/2009
5	Frequent Nightime Urination	I've only been taking it two weeks and I notice my right eye twitches every now and again.	This has been a life saver for me.  I used to be so tired during the day because I'd wake anywhere from 3 to 15 times a night.  No matter how much I limited my liquids, caffiene, you name it.  I was at the mercy of my bladder.  Now I only wake 1 time a night.  I feel so much better because I can get a good nights sleep.	F	39	2  weeks	10/24/2009
4	Interstitial Cystitis / PBS	Bowel irregularity, some fatigue, dry mouth	Despite one or two uncomfortable side effects, Detrol has improved my quality of life immensely. I used to have to pee about once an hour throughout the day - sometimes as frequently as once every 30 minutes for hours on end. After about a week, I noticed a substantial drop in my trips to the bathroom. After two weeks, I was peeing with normal/average frequency. It also helped cut down on bladder pain. Both my mother and aunt suffer from IC as well, and neither can tolerate Detrol - they get skin rashes and feel overly restless. I would recommend at least trying it - it's made my work and social life SO MUCH BETTER.	F	26	2  years	4/7/2009
4	Frequency & urethral spasms	Dry mouth, especially upon waking.	Although it has not gotten rid of 100% of the frequency, discomfort and spasms, I only now have problems a few times a month (better than everyday). Although the medication tends to wear off by late afternoon/early evening (so getting to sleep is sometimes hard when the drug hasn't kicked in).	F	22	6.5  months	1/19/2009
5	Bladder spasms and urgency	The first few weeks dry mouth and sinus.  It did take a few days before it kicked in and took the feeling of always having to run to the bathroom away.	I have been on this medication for almost a year.  Even though it is a bit pricey even with my insurance covering some, I will continue.  I was miserable.  I would get up 5-6 times a night to use the bathroom.  Now it is once a night.	F	45	11  months	12/2/2007
5	urge intolerance	I started taking this drug a long time ago (about 5-6 years) so I do not remember any side effects I may have had.  But they could not have been significant side effects or I would have noticed/remembered.	There are still times when I have to go frequently or badly but they are not as constant as before I was on Detrol.  Even when I REALLY have to go, I don't feel like I'm going to have an accident like I did before Detrol.  This medication has made a significant improvement in the quality of my life.	F	44	5  years	11/26/2007
3	Overactive bladder and pain	Dry mouth, drowsiness, fatigue	This medicine seems to be working, but I'm not really happy with the dry mouth.  I take it at night but I wake up so tired, it ruins anything I had planned to do later that day.  I still get occasional pains in my bladder still.  I'm still getting up to pee at night at least twice.	F	25	8  days	7/19/2007
1	urination frequency and urgency	Severe back aches started after 3 weeks of slight back aches.  Caused discontinuation.  Dr was unfamiliar with that side effect but I found mention of this on internet under patient education for detrol.   Dry mouth only a slight problem.  Possible fatigue	Kept track of frequency.  No change and still often bouts of urgency.  Side effects no problem until 4th week.  This drug may work for others, just not me	M	60	35  days	4/26/2007
2	urge incontinence	Extreme dry eyes and throat.  So dry that I could not function through a normal day.  I had to stop taking the medication.	It did work for the incontinence - it was great.  But I could not tolerate the dryness.  My doctor told me that some people can just not tolerate anticholinergics.	F	36	30  days	3/21/2007
5	Lifetime bladder control, worsening	I have had bladder control problems since a child, aggravated with stress.  At one particular stressful time in my mid-twenties, my bladder shrank to the size of a pea (according to the uralogist who saved my life) and who conditioned my bladder to the point I have lived relatively normally for forty-some years. With age, and hypertension meds which relax the entire system, have come back some pretty serious bladder control problems.	About a year ago,I mentioned my leaky valve situation at my annual OB/Gyn visit and my dr. gave me a sample of Detrol-LA. My bladder is the most comfortable it has ever been in my entire life! I've been taking it for about a year and I absolutely swear by it. My dr. said some women just take it when they anticipate a difficult period (vacation, etc.) I take one each morning and live virtually carefree. Do still wear a very small lightday pad for security purposes. I highly recommend Detrol-LA to anyone with a leaky valve or worse... How I would have loved to have had it in my early life..

4	bladder control	none		F	38	2  years	11/8/2006
5	bladder control issues	Uncomfortably dry mouth with 4 mg. which largely went away when switched to 2 mg.	I am amazed at how well this drug works. After having bladder control "issues" for about ten years, I finally spoke to my doctor.  No more damp panty liners!	F	59	3  years	3/27/2006
2	Frequent urination, bladder spasms	It made me mentally unstable.  I had suicidal ideations.  It was awful.  I was so anxious and irritable.	Mine was a rare reaction but severe.  I would approach this medicine with caution	F	43	5  days	6/21/2005
5	frequent urination	dry mouth and a bit tired late in the afternoon	It has helped me to stop urinating every 15 minutes.  Now, I only urinate once every two hours.  It is great.  I have been taking this medication for 5 years with no reported problems.	F	36	5  years	2/13/2005
5	frequent urination	It makes me a little thirsty.		M	54	4  months	8/23/2004
