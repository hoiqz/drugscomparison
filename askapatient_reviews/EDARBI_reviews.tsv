1	Hypertension	Skipped heartbeats,inability to concentrate,muscle spasms	Was taking Diovan 160.Many side effects but Diovan controlled my blood pressure.Cardiologist switched me to Edarbi 40 saying it's a more powerful ARB drug.Tried it for a month.It didn't control my bp as well as Diovan.Edarbi produced annoying skipped heartbeats,made it difficult to sleep,burning skin sensation,inability to exercise,increased pulse,it also raised,not lowered,my bp,and finally,made it hard for me to think/concentrate which never happened on any other bp med.
