3	Weight Loss	No Side Effects	Well, my doc prescribed 37.5 1 x day last week to aid in weight loss. He said it would increase my metabolism (don't see where the label says that) and decrease appetite. I haven't noticed a single change and my weight has gone up 3lbs in this week like it's been doing for months. I have gone from 110 to 146 in just  few months. I have been vegetarian for 20 years and even started Weight Watchers again back in October. It worked before to get 40lbs off fast and my weight is still going up this go round. It's highly unusual. Am I not responding to this medicine because I do not have enough weight to lose? I think it's only 30lbs to lose and maybe I wont respond. I have felt exactly the same, perhaps MORE hungry! Please someone email me if they have knowledge or advise! Erica_spain@hotmail.com	F	31	8  days37.5 1X D	2/26/2013Email
4	Weight loss	I experienced severe mood swings and anxiety while on this medication. My heart felt as though it were racing, and I sometimes had trouble sleeping. The side effects, however, were worth it for me, because I ultimately lost 90 pounds on this medication.	Side effects are extremely unpleasant. Anxiety, racing heart, insomnia, mood swings, euphoria, dry mouth, and a bad taste in mouth were the most common. Luckily this medicine isn't used for long-term and it is EXTREMELY effective in helping with weight loss. I lost about 20 pounds per month on average.	F	20	4  months37.5mg 1X D	12/6/2012
4	Weight Loss	Was unable to sleep when first started taking it, possible stomach upset at times, temperature changes (go hot and then cold easier than usual).	I started off taking the generic (phentermine) 37.5MG, and due to this not working as well as it should, my doctor increased to 37.5MG in the morning, and then 18.75mg at lunch (half a pill).  It works very well for me.  I have no appetite, lots of energy, and generally feel pretty good.  I've lost over 50 pounds taking this medication. I have never taken the brand name, so I can't speculate as to the differences between the brand name and the generic.	M	30	2.5  months37.5 1X D	3/10/2012
5	Weight Loss	Dry Month, Insomnia, Constipation - Increased symptoms of Existing Anemia Condition.	I'm taking Adipex/Phentermine in combo with Medically guided Nutritional Counseling. I've lost 35 lbs. in nearly 7 months (203 down to 168.  I have noticed its decrease in effectiveness after about 4 months. The key here is to adjust your diet and vitamin supplements. i.e. protein shakes, lemon water(natural diuretic) B-12 shots AND B Vitamin supplements.  I am anemic and iron supplements were a must for me.  Bulk fiber and careful diet are a must with the already added constipation side effect.Bottom Line - My obesity was far more damaging to my overall health and well-being than these short-term side effects.	F	31	7  months37.5 1X D	10/30/2010
5	Phentermine	Dry Mouth, Feeling Hot, Increased Heart rate when I worked out, Increased Energy, Increase libido!	I love it! I take it first thing in the morning so this way I could sleep at night. I have increased energy at work. I don't feel tired all day. To conquor dry mouth I drank lots of water and had gum handy. When I was feeling hot I used my AC or fan. The only thing was when I worked out my heart rate would jump from 127 to 180. I had to take it slow at the gym to get the full effect but I had so much energy and I sweated for the first time working out. Plus I loved the energy while having sex. When my husband took it was even better!	F	33	2  months30 mg 1X D	8/14/2010
5	Weight Loss	Severe Dry mouth, Insomnia, Increased Sex drive, little to no appetite.	I lost 35 pounds in 2 months with moderate exercise and a low fat, high fiber, low calorie (1000 calories a day) diet. I am currently in my 3rd and final month of this drug and the weight loss is slower the third month, (my doctor states that this medication only works for 2 to 3 months at a time and use needs to stop after the third month.) He also says you must stop taking it for 6 months before you begin again (if it is still needed.) You can become addicted to it if taken too long. I am extremely happy with the results. A friend has been off of it for a year now and has even lost a few more pounds. You must continue a healthy life style to keep the weight off.	F	33	3  months37.5 mg 1X D	5/5/2010
5	weight loss	in the first week I couldn't sleep well at night but that wore off.  I cut the pill in 3's and only take that amount at around 3pm( since my craving are worse at night) and continue that until I feel I need to move to a half pill.  Doing it this way will not make you feel like you're gonna drop out of your own skin when you first start taking it and makes adipex last longer for you since it's known that your body adapts to it and it stops working after awhile.	This is a great medicine to drop start a weight loss program.  It takes away craving and hunger a ton and lets you get used to eating small meals thus shrinking your stomach so once you go off of it, you are somewhat used to eating that way.  It's not addicting but Ween yourself off so you get used to eating good without it. It also gives you some energy and working out soon after you take it increases it's effects and will make you work out way longer or better!  Dry mouth is the main side effect I got and I just chew gum and drink tons of water!  This drug motivates you and even if you have a job or go to school it makes you way more alert!  It's awesome!  The best there is out there no doubt!  I went from 195 after having a baby, down to 134!	F	26	6  months37.5 mg 1X D	2/26/2010Email
4	Weight loss	dry mouth, withdrawal was very bad	I was taking this medication for 6 months and lost 30lbs. It worked great. I had a lot of energy and generally felt good. The only thing was that I stopped the medication, because I could not make it back to my regular doctor's office and the withdrawal was absolutely horrible. I had paranoid episodes, severe depression and anxiety and gained back 20lbs in 2 months. If you do come off this medication make sure you ween yourself off. It was entirely my fault that I went through this withdrawal and I just want to warm anyone who takes this that they need to come off of it under their doctor's supervision.	F	26	6  months	12/15/2009
5	Weight loss	Loss/lack of appetite	I love this medicine.  In 3 months, with out doing 1 bit of exercise, I lost 22lbs.  I know if I would have walked a couple of days a week or some little bit of exercise, I would have lost more weight, but I think that's pretty good for not doing anything.	F	22	5  months	12/13/2009
3	For weight loss	severe itching  after first couple of weeks.  Head face neck chest and shoulders	Great for controlling cravings.  I felt motivated but calm.  Love adipex .  I am very disappointed to have developed the itching problem.  Lost 15lb in approximately  6 weeks	F	51	2  months	7/6/2009
4	weight loss	insomnia if taken later in day, dry mouth, tinny taste in mouth, SEVERE CHEEK AND LIP BITING, the biting causes trauma to the tongue which creates those really sore white taste buds and canker sores, oh yeah...weight loss!	My goal was to lose 30 lbs. I have lost 20 of those in just a little over two months! Am dealing with the severe mouth problems, as I see the finish line. A word of advice....for your first few days....take only half a tablet! As the weeks progress, supplementing your morning dosage with a second pill around 2 pm will keep you on track.	F	43	10  weeks	6/5/2009Email
3	to lose weight	It made me edgy and irritable.  I did lose weight (about 5 lbs.) without doing anything.  But I couldn't handle the side effects.  I had trouble sleeping and felt depressed and moody.  I quit taking it after about three weeks.  I like Tenuate much better!		F	35	21  days	5/12/2009
3	weight loss	Hair loss, anxiety, irritability, anger, acne, hypertension.	I loved adipex, i hated the side effects. adipex helped me to drop 20 lbs very quickly. i could still eat but it must have raised my metabolism so much that i was dropping weight no matter what i consumed.  I had to stop taking it because I started to lose my hair, started breaking out, developed high blood pressure and became very angry and irritable.  If i didn't have so many side effects, i would still be on it today. oh and of course, once i stopped taking it I gained weight back immediately.	F	33	6  months	4/16/2009
3	to shed a little weight	No side effects for the first week or two.  After the 3rd week, I was only taking 1/2 tablet 3 times a week, started having breathing problems, shortness of breath, like I am not getting enough oxygen.  I quit taking them, I've keep the weight off, but I still have the breathing problems.	Works good, great level of energy.  Keep you from feeling hungry.Lost close to 10 pounds in two weeks.	F	32	21  days	3/19/2009
5	weight loss	50 lbs weight loss in a few months. Need to non stop clean lol. Energy from a 2 yr old lol. Had to MAKE or remind myself to eat.Urge to smoke was way stronger (like when you drink alcohol and smoke more lol) in the beginning. BUT over time it would die down to almost not wanting to smoke. Higher plus (expected)	I have been on and off this med a few times. Usually I would take it for 3-4 weeks at a time (fear of addiction after reading up on it lol)PLUS I would notice it would start to lose effects after a few weeks to.I did pretty well on it. And in the beginning you will lose ALL urges to eat. You have to remind yourself to eat lol. I could stand in front of a all you could eat bakery buffet and walk away lolI had already lost 70 + on my own before I tried it. A dr referred me to it to help me finish my goal (i was a lil past half way)I lost on a average of 10 + lbs a month. Give or take on how much I pushed with it. The more you exercise the more you get from the pill. You may lose some doing nothing BUT if you work hard the pill will work hard to.It wasn't to expensive either. The price could range from 28 a month down to 12 with certain discount cards. (insurance usually dont cover it)I lost 50 lbs on it. I tried not to stay on it longer then a few weeks at a time so I cant gi	F	31	6  months	1/27/2009Email
5	Weight loss		Another thing I gotta note. THIS ISNT a med for "vanity" weight. You MUST be over weight to morbid obese for this pill to work. In the beginning I lost FAST. But the closer I got to my "medical" proper weight it almost didn't do crap lol. Ive noticed in the ppl that say it don't work are not that much over weight or are basically losing vanity weight. Id say at least be 40 lbs over weight before trying this med.	F	31	6  months	1/27/2009Email
4	weight loss	sleeplessness, loss of appetite, energy, major increased smoking desire	I have been taking this medication for about a year on and off. I had gastric bypass in 1999 and after a pregnancy and gaining 58 lbs, I could not get the weight off. Phentermine helps me not gain anymore weight. I have not seen a major decrease in weight loss.	F	38	1  years	12/29/2008
4		headaches, decreased appetite, sensitivity to light, feeling wired, short term memory loss, irritability sometimes extreme, feeling anxious, nausea and vomiting	I was on this med for a little less than a year and it worked wonders.  I stated out at 15 which was too low, moved up to 30 mg which worked great for months and then moved up to 37.5.  After moving up to 37.5 I noticed most of the side effects like the irritability, nausea, memory loss wired feeling and anxiousness.  This med only works for 2 weeks and then stops.  Then you have to stop taking it for a couple of days and start back up again.  I lost over 40 pounds and after stopping the med, I am starting to gain weight back.  I tried to take it again in June and I started having rapid heartbeats and panic attacks.  I don't know if I can attribute the effects to this med, but I have not taken it again since. My sister took this med and it made her irritable and anxious too and she stopped taking it. My sister and I both lost a tremendous amount of weight on it. I like what it did for me when I was taking it initially, and it does work, but I caution everyone to be careful.	F	28	11  months	11/21/2008
4	weight loss	sweating, insane need to clean my house SPOTLESS. no other side effects. no racing heartbeats or anything.	my doctor prescribed this for two months because the drug begins to lose its effectiveness and the inclination is to "up" the dosage. i took one pill once a day (30 mg) In a month, I lost twenty-two pounds. I decided to take it for one month. Go off of it for a month and go back on. Today is the first day of the "new" month. I'll keep you posted.	F	26	30  days	10/1/2008
3	weight loss	dry mouth, feeling of uneasiness,	Started taking drug 3 months ago and have lost 12 lbs.  Loved it in the beginning.  Did not feel like I was on medication. Curbed my appetite. After 3 months began to feel different in middle of day.  Doc said it was due to build up of med in blood stream and switched meds.	F	45	3  months	8/1/2008
5	weight loss	None	I love this medicine I started taking it on 2-14-08 almost has been 4 weeks and I've lost 18 pounds.I eat about 800 to 1000 calories a day eat lots of fruit veggies, protein shake for breakfast, nuts and at least 64 oz of water a day. It took away my junk food cravings completly and I have my normal energy back but I would'nt say I'm bouncing off the walls like a lot of ppl do.I love it I would highly recommend it. I started out 5'3 156 as of today I weigh 138 :-) I also do 50 minutes on my eliptical almost every night.	F	32	25  days	3/10/2008
5	Excessive Daytime Drowsiness	None	Very good at daytime energy... and it helped with weight loss.  Went from 270 lbs to 230 lbs in a month.  Continuing to lose weight is a great side benefit, but the main reason I'm taking it is to overcome daytime drowsiness.	M	31	4  months	2/23/2008Email
5	lose weight	insomnia and dry mouth	LOVE!!  Lost weight and had energy!  Sort of had a euphoric feeling right after taking it.  LOVE it!	F	34	 	2/14/2008
1	weight loss	severe headaches,  stiff neck , nausea-  I could only take 3 days because I was so sick	I had heard great things about this drug and really was excited, but it made me feel like I had the flu	F	46	3  days	12/9/2007
5	weight lose	DIFFICULT TIME SLEEPING. I LOVED IT AND LOST 34 LBS IN 3 MONTHS WITH LIGHT EXERCISE. Total lose of appetite, EXCESSIVE DRY MOUTH. LOTS OF WATER NEEDED.		F	33	3  months	6/20/2007Email
5	Weight Loss	First couple days i had a "buzz" from the medication i.e. racing heart, tingling of hands and feet, euphoria. That went away within the first week. Dry mouth, occasional insomnia.	Ive lost 20 pounds in 2 months on this medicine. I take one pill in the morning and generally have a lack of hunger most of the day. I make myself eat breakfast, lunch, dinner...because meds seem to wear off alittle bit during the late evening and on an empty stomach had the urge to snack. Learned that drinking something (milk, tea) seemed to curb the snacking urges at night.Ive had good results on this med, would recommend only taking a one pill daily dose though, dont let your Dr. up your dose, if its not working with one pill... its not going to work for you, try something else.	F	28	2  months	1/4/2007Email
1	weight loss	Chronic dry mouth, racing heart, shakes, dizziness, insomnia, poor circulation, back aches, headaches, racing thoughts, mania, heart palpitations	I have taken this drug off and on for the past 10 years for weight loss. It works, but the results NEVER last, it makes you feel great for about 6 months, you loose weight, you have awesome energy to work out and then it begins to not work anymore.  Its like you build up an immunity to it or something. I first took it in college under a dr's supervision along with Phenfluramine (sp?) as a part of the phen/phen diet.  I lost 40lbs. but eventually gained it all back plus 20lbs. I took it again 4 years after that and again lost 40 lbs., but this time I became addicted to it and tried to take 2 or 3 pills a day when it began wearing off.  I eventually stopped taking it (after visiting the emergency room twice at 3am because I thought I was having a heart attack) and then gained all my weight back plus 40lbs.  Just stay away from this medication, it isn't worth it!	F	31	10  years	4/4/2006
5	Weight Loss	Dry Mouth, lots of energy.	Adipex is unlike anything I've ever taken to lose weight. I have tried every pill out there and they ALL made me feel sick, gave me heart palpitations and headaches. That is NOT the case with Adipex. I took 1 pill in the morning, and about 30 minutes later I feel happy and energetic. It takes away food cravings (I don't eat sweets at all anymore), and does not make me feel sick or manic at all. I lost 20 pounds in 2 months, and have kept it off for a month. After I saw the dramatic weight loss, I was motivated to keep it off, so with proper nutrition and excercise this is GREAT! WARNING: I do have a friend who is SEVERELY ADDICTED to this medication. PLEASE heed the warnings and take only as directed!	F	27	45  days	1/19/2006
4	weight control	dry mouth some sleeplessness, after a while of being on it it made my complusive behavior more so. It lowers my blood pressure.  depressed after extended use... YEs addidictive you have to go off of it slowley.	Lets be honset, I have been on this drug off and on for a few years. You have to have a life stlye change or you will gain back the weight. I made a decision that if I went on this drug I would also exercise and control my diet. also I found a doctor that didnt simply give me the higest does but adjusted it for my needs. if your on the right dose your heart doesnt race and the side effects are minimal. I think this is a great drug combined with food control , and exercise! with the right dose.  Once again I have to point out that YOU WILL GAIN THE WEIGHT BACK if you dont exercise and change your  eating habits and mind set.. I was on and off this drug for a while until I got the whole lifestyle change through my head. IT  is like anything you have to add personal responsibilty and do your part or you will end up a skinney fat person on this drug and gain everything back and mess up your metablism. If your haveing bad side effects the does probley needs to be adjusted you should only fe	F	31	5  times	11/20/2005Email

4	To loose weight	Burst of energy, feeling great.  I could care less if I ate or not.  Actually when you did feel hungry, you would look at eating like only if I have to, but didn't really want to.  Crazy huh?	I have to be honest though.  It is very addictive and it can damage your heart valves.  It makes your heart race, like it is going to beat out of your chest.  It is hard to quit, you go thru so many withdrawels.  LIke anxiety, and anger.  You could tell the whole world to fu** off. +	F	34	4  months	12/11/2004

Unfortunately, this drug is very addictive!!!! I stopped taking it for 6 months and I gained back all my weight plus some and was tired and depressed all the time. I started taking drug again and have lost the weight but am scared to ever get off of it.	F	33	3  years	2/29/2004
4	weight/depression	sense of well being.  Too tempting to abuse this drug.	I had been self medicating with this drun on and off for ten years, until I finally began seeing a psych for depression.	F	44	10  years	8/17/2002
