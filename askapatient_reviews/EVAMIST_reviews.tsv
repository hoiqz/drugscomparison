1	perimenopause	low estrogen symptoms of worsening arthritis/headaches/chills/hot flashes/muscle aches/	Revising my review of 3/22/11. Within a month after starting it, I noticed it wore off after about 8 hours. At 12 hours I had to spray it again (per doctor's okay).  The bottle only has 75 sprays and if you are doing 6 sprays a day it gets very expensive, and it didn't relieve all my symtoms even at that dose and the arthritis in my fingers worsened to where they are now bent and deformed from lack of estrogen. Plus, I couldn't hold my pets without long sleeves on (to protect them from the estrogen spray).  Currently, back on the estradiol pill taken twice a day (only $4 month out of pocket cost) and not happy with the weight gain and dizziness on the generic estradiol pill, so will be looking to start Premarin soon.

5	Hot Flashes, Insomnia	No side effects. I had horrible hot flashes that were once an hour at least and terrible insomnia. It does not work instantly. It took about three weeks to fully get rid of them but now I am fine. I too lost about 5 pounds and have good energy again. It's a lifesaver to me!		F	51	1  monthsOne spray 1X D	3/28/2011
5	perimenopause	Started this after having rashes from vivelle-dot and climara patches.  It is considered low dose (each spray equals about a .025 patch, so 3 sprays are equal to a .075 patch). The patches gave me migraines, headaches, rashes, extreme bloating, hunger, dry eyes and weight gain.  So did the estradiol pills. Evamist caused none of those problems, and I felt like I was 25 y/o again! Brain working right, sleeping great, no bloating, no hot sweats at night, did not gain weight and in fact I lost weight on Evamist because I wasn't feeling like I had to have brownies and potato chips all the time (like the patches and pills caused).  The downside is how expensive this spray is. But I love it and am going to start it up again.  I had stopped EVAMIST to try the pills (estradiol) to save money. The pills (estrace generic) were the worst for side effects. Love my Evamist!		F	51	60  days3 sprays 1X D	3/22/2011
5	Menopause	Tender breasts during the first week of use	Evamist is a wonderful bioidentical estrogen that has totally gotten rid of my hot flashes and allows me to sleep at night.  Started on 2 sprays a day and had to go up to 3 to get rid of symptoms.  After 9 months, went back down to 2 and am doing great. You may want to consider using some natural OTC progesterone cream (like Progest)to oppose the estrogen if you still have your uterus.	F	55	18  months2 sprays 1X D	7/9/2010
