2	Hypertension	Dry Ejaculation	With0ut BP 210/110, with 110/70. Does cause adverse sexual side effects with me.  If you are active, I am married, it is a real bummer.  Other HBP medications that affect can effect potassium I can't use, so I live with the labetalol.	M	44	1  years400 Mg 2X D	8/8/2011Email

4	High Blood Pressure	The first few weeks or so, I was extremely tired.  I adjusted to the medication though & never experienced any side effects after that point.  This drug is extremely safe to take during pregnancies and while breastfeeding. I have been taking since I was 29 due to HBP.  It ran in my family & other lifestyle changes did not help reduce my blood pressure (low salt diet, exercise, diet, etc.).		F	40	11  years	8/15/2007
3	high blood pressure	I feel tired after just walking up steps.	I was taking it twice a day, but had to eliminate the dose in the morning because it pushed my blood pressure to a level that made me dizzy.	M	59	3  weeks	3/17/2007Email
1	hypertension; palpitations	Tingling in scalp--almost a burning sensation; dizziness; upset stomach; muscle pain; extreme fatigue; unexplained weight gain...increased after first week.	My doctor wisely started me on the lowest dose--50 mg twice a day--to supplement Diovan since I was having frequent palpitations. On the fifth day, my scalp began tingling oddly and it hurt to touch my head or comb my hair. I had muscular pain in both arms and some nausea and discomfort in my stomach. I was tired all the time--occasionally dizzy--affecting my work. My doctor told me to stop immediately, stating that some people cannot tolerate beta blockers. I will be starting a new drug this week to address the palpitations. the side effects would seem to outweigh any benefit of this medication.	F	56	2  weeks	9/8/2006
3	hypertension	Extreme tiredness, coughing, dry throat, stomach upset and frequently causing vomiting even with food or milk. Gained well over 20 pounds in 6 months, 15 more since then, even with the loss of appetite caused by med.	It does work on my blood pressure so Dr refuses to take me off it. Last Dr I had refused too but they don't understand how horrible it makes me feel. So I guess since it lowered my BP I am forced to give it a 3 but if offered something else I would be first in line.
