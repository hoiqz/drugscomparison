2	Tooth infection	After 3 days of taking Clindamycin HCL 300 MG three times a day my joints and arm muscles are killing me. I feel like I have a Lyme disease. Besides this, I started having chest pain in the heart region.I stopped taking Clindamycin for a day and pain in joints and arms muscles started going away. I repeated this couple of times and each time my pain slowly over one day was milder.I reduced dosage to two times a day and side effect is still there but not as sever. Hope my tooth infection will be gone with only two capsules per day.   		M	59	7  days300 MG 3X D	3/25/2013
1	infection in 10 yr old root canal	nothing until day 8 woke up with a severe red rsh on entire upper body, not face, by next day had spread to legs, after getting a Triamcinolone Acetonide cream from Dermotol. DR., stopping clinda, rash on legs is now almost purple!	Dentist office today, (Sat), said call Monday, nice, if you saw the rash, you would be scared too	M	57	8  days 4X D	3/23/2013Email
2	possible leg infection	My case is complicated.  I have had 3 pulmonary embolisms.  My leg had a lump.  Dr. Thought maybe an infection.   He prescribed 10 days.  150 mg 3 x a day.  Also told me to take probiotic 4 a day.  I became tired snd exhausted.  I am on Oxygen temporarily.   I had to turn my oxygen way up.  On the 3rd day I had the most horrific gastric issue possible.  Black burning bowel movement hit me so fast that I could not make it to the bathroom in time.  This was not diarrhea but it was sudden onset and explosive.  After this horrible event my breathing stabalized and I felt better.  I noticed after burning in my chest after taking medicine.  There is also a nasty taste in my mouth and general feeling of not being right.  I am not taking this any more espically after reading this site.		F	51	4  days15O mg	2/26/2013Email
1	Abscessed tooth	I was pregnant while taking this. I was fine, but 3-4 weeks later I developed horrific stomach cramps and severe diarrhea. It has been 8 days now and I am miserable and I am so worried about my baby/ pregnancy. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. Also, it took a while for me to make the connection between these symptoms and this medication. I thought I had a severe stomach flu, but then it just wouldn't stop.		F	32	7  days150 mg x 3	2/7/2013
1	minor root canal ibfection	My dentist prescribed this medication to treat minor infection under the crown, root canal was done 12 years ago. I google this pills and got terrified by side effects it could cause. I have sensitive stomach and had I cade of diarrhea in the past, otherwise I am healthy. I took two doses but felt uncomfortable taking it, I just went to him and ask for amoxicillin. I am not risking my health over minor tooth infection! Amoxicillin worked just fine without those side effects. I wonder why manufacturer don't banned this medication, its seems to me that side effect clearly overweight the benefits.

1	tooth infection	Have I got a severe headache, dizzy. I'm eating yogurt and drinking tons of water. Taking it at good intervals. And I have weird bowel movements. Long thin feces. I feel like I was on a rollercoaster. I have shortness of breath as well.		F	19	10  days300 mg	1/19/2013Email
2	Cellulitis	Explosive bowl movements , terrible leg cramps (different than normal leg cramps  ) these were shotting pain, and woke up with severe weird type of headache like brain was swollen. Then started to feel sinus fullness with the headache.	I'm a dentist so I have some knowledge. Just stopped right away. Did not second guess.	F	57	1  days500Mg 3X D	12/29/2012Email
1	Tooth infection, preparation for ro	Constantly in the bathroom, very soft, long (really really long) thin stools, not diarrhea.  Can't go anywhere because I need to be close to the bathroom-gas feeling is not gas -it's bm. Stomach ache.  Was supposed to take for 10 days. I'm stopping now, after 7 days.	This drug is no bueno.  I've eaten yogurt everyday but probably should have had it at least twice a day.  Can't take penicillin or sulfa (bactrim) drugs.  Why not z-pac or cipro?  I won't take this ever again. it's going down on my list of drug allergies.	F	44	10  days300 mg 4X D	11/2/2012Email
5	Dental Infection	Very slight tummy problems.  Nothing major.   Softer stools, but I took probiotcs and ate yogurt each day.  Tummy settled down after a few days of finishing the course prescribed.   I usually have every side effect known with all drugs I take, but thankfully I've never had anything major with Clindamycin.	I've taken this drug at least 10 times in the last 5 years.  I've had a lot of dental work done and am allergic to penicillin, so I have to take something in a different antibiotic 'family'.  I need to pre-med for any dental procedures, so I always take Clindamycin.  I have had several infections (I'm prone to them, through no fault of the dentist), and they've always started clearing up within 48 hours, no matter how severe they were.  One infection was so bad that I had to go to the hospital.  48 hours later, after the Clindamycin was started, I was a LOT better.  Can't say enough good things about this medication.  I'm sorry others have not done so well with it.	F	51	7  days300 mgs 3X D	6/28/2012
1	BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS WHILE PREGNANT	My OBGYN prescribed this while I was pregnant for a yeast infection.  I was 5 days post delivery and never finished it.  But, it already did enough damage...on my 2nd day post delivery I had contracted C. diff.  A very horrible bacterial infection.  I had uncontrollable, nonstop diahrea for two weeks (not fun to have after a vaginal delivery).  I was hospitalized for dehydration and malnourishment.  Was then prescribed Flagyl.  It did the trick to get rid of the c. diff.     From now on I will definitely do some research on any prescription before taking it.  I thought I was going to die.	SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THIS ANTIBIOTIC BEFORE TAKING IT!!!!	F	26	14  days? 1X D	5/21/2012Email
4	wisdom tooth extraction infection	bloating, fatigue, loss of taste	Developed a subperiosteal infection 3 weeks after wisdom teeth removal and was given a week's supply of clindamycin. I have also begun taking probiotics 2 hours after every dose to prevent lower intestinal problems. Since starting this medicine, I have been carrying a tremendous amount of water weight (+3 pounds) and have been sleeping 14+ hours a day, which has not alleviated my fatigue and loss of concentration-- pretty unusual for me, as I am normally very active and alert. However, my infection seems to be disappearing-- the swelling and pain have both subsided. For those starting this medicine, I recommend a hefty dose of sleep and probiotics-- good luck!

1	dental infection	Severe headache. Felt like my head was in a vice. Couldnt function. After once dose! Stopped immediately.		F	60	1  days500mg 3X D	12/4/2011
4	infection after wisdom extraction	Metallic taste and increased bowel movements but not diarhea.  I had a minor rash develop on the 10th day of taking this medication.  I also took probiotics 2 to 3 hours after taking a pill and continued to for about 6 weeks after I stopped taking this medication.  C-difficle is not present in everybody's gut. I think only a minority of people have c-dificile naturally present in their gut.  It's in those who already have c-difficile in their gut that are prone to a c-difficile infection from this medication.  I drank down about 4 glasses of water with each pill so did not experience any heartburn and I sat up for about an hour after taking each pill.	I was floxxed 3 years prior from Cipro so was almost hysterical that I had to take 10 days of Clindamycin.  I had some of the same reactions I had to Cipro(burning skin, nerve pain, insomnia, muscle pain)  That is probably only because I had been floxxed previously by Cipro.  They were way way less intense and they went away within about 1 week of stopping this medication in comparism to almost 6 months after I took Cipro....yeah, not fun!

1	Removal of wisdom teeth	Developed severe C difficile infection at age 18 after having my wisdom teeth removed, I was in the hospital for one week. 10 years later I have had C diff. one more time. I will never recommend this drug to anyone. It has ruined my life. I have permanent IBS and stomach problems now because of it.		F	24	2  days 3X D	12/14/2010
5	peridontal infection	metallic taste in mouth	10 days of taking Augmentin every 8 hrs. did not clear up my dental infection, so I was prescribed Clindamycin. I was anxious about taking such a powerful drug, especially after reading the comments of this site. Good News folks...I had no side effects or gastro-intestinal issues. The drug eliminated my serious infection - a miracle in my opinion. I always took the dose with food, spaced the doses as far possible, and drank a cup of Kefir liquid yogurt once or twice a day. The week following my last dose I drank 2 cups of Kefir daily. A month has passed since then and I am healthy and suffered no ill effects from the antibiotic. Good Luck to all...hope my experience helps.	F	58	7  days300 mg. 3X D	10/25/2010
1	Wisdom teeth removal	None other than the typical antibiotic side effects, which is basically just diarrhea.	I am so freaking pissed I had to take this for something as minor as preventing an infection after wisdom teeth removal.  It gave me c-diff, which just really pisses me off.  Pharmacists need to warn you to at least take probiotics while you're on this antibiotic.	M	25	7  days 3X D	8/15/2010
5	staph infection	None.  Expected diarrhea but took a probiotic and drank 1 Dannon Active each day.  Had no problems.  Did take exactly every 8 hours to help avoid problems.	The moron doctor I took my son to first didn't diagnose his staph infection - so when the new doctor I took him to did diagnose the staph skin infection it was bad, covering 3 different areas, each about 6" x 6", which is why it took 20 days of medication.  I didn't see an improvement until the 5th day, but after that the skin infection got noticably better each day, until it was gone.	M	11	20  days300 mg 3X D	7/9/2010
1	Absess tooth	Bloating, naseau, increased bowl movements, just didnt feel right		F	24	7  days	4/14/2009
4	Abcessed tooth	Metallic taste in my mouth, stomach cramping, diarrhea,	My doctor suspected an abcessed tooth because I kept having pain after getting a crown.  He gave me an extremely high dosage of this stuff and it's wrecking havoc on my stomach.  I will be glad when I'm done with this.  I can't take it much longer.  It does seem to be helping my tooth though.  For the first time in over two months I can bite down and not have any pain.	F	27	 	8/6/2008
5	root canal infection	none yet	Already had c-diff so taking plenty probiotics and hope nothing happens....On day 2 of 7 day course  300 mgs x 3 per dayAlso, I am pregnant	F	38	2  days	6/16/2008Email
4	Root Canal	None at all	No problems taking this medication. Followed the directions that accompany the prescrip.	F	37	7  days	6/9/2008
3	root canal treatment	Loose, burning and frequent stool but not diarrhea.  It was as though I had eaten hot peppers the night before.  Bad taste in mouth and nothing tasted right.	The pharmacist's notes on this medication warned "diarrhea may occur weeks to months after taking".  I stopped the medication 2 days ago and my system seems to be getting back to normal.  Food tastes good again.  It was difficult to gauge its effectiveness because I couldn't tell I had an infection in the first place.	F	60	7  days	3/14/2008
4	Throat infection	nonstop bowel movements, headaches	I cannot stress enough to take a pro-biotic with this!! If you don't you will be in serious trouble. Drink probiotic yogurt type drinks or take the probiotic in pill form. Clindamycin saved my life but it is a heavy duty drug.	F	34	10  days	1/30/2008
4	Tooth Infection	None	After reading up on this drug on this site, I was very nervous to begin taking the course of antibiotics.  I was fine though and I think its b/c I loaded up on Probiotics during and after the course of treatment. It was annoying b/c I felt like I was popping pills all day (probiotics are more effective if taken  2 hours after the antibiotic) but all worth it as I had none of the usual side effects.  Also, follow the instruction and take with a full glass of water (and/or food) and don't lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking a pill.  The one time I didn't follow those instructions I felt the burning in  my esophogus.	F	35	10  days	10/31/2007
5	Tooth infection	When I read the side effects from others who has taken this, I fully expected to have worse diarrhea. I had diarrhea really bad before taking this and it stopped. I felt like I had to "go" alot when in fact I didn't. That was the only side effect I had. When I was done with the medication, I was back to having diarrhea.	Did its job.	F	39	7  days	8/13/2007
1	tooth infection	Stay away from this drug and run from anyone that prescribes it! This drug caused chronic diarrhea that has been going on for over 10 months and that has not responded to Flagyl. Any doctor that prescribes this obviously isn't doing their homework. There are other antibiotics that are safer than this. The manufacturers should be put out of business.

4	Gum infection	Headaches on the side of my head, not to crazy.	infection seems to have gone away, swelling in gums down	M	31	2  days	4/17/2007
1	Bacterial Vaginosis	Developed C.diff after 5 days of treatment.Did not cure original infection	I was put on this due to the fact that I had a bad reaction to Flagyl (I have a review of this med on here too).  I was prescribed 300mg twice daily for 7 days.  Everything was fine until day 5 when I developed watery diarrea, my doctor sent me to the ER and they confirmed C.diff, I am now taking Vancomycin for that (part 3 of medication my review series coming soon!)Seriously, ask for something lighter if your doc can give it to you.  The side effect of c.diff is not worth taking this med.	F	29	7  days	12/27/2006Email
1	bacterial vaginosis	Clostridium difficile- persistent diarrhea and pain, which is very difficult to treat... because it is caused by antibiotics wiping out the natural flora in your bowels, symptoms can be alleviated with medication, but it is very very hard to CURE.	Clindamycin is on of the main antibiotics that causes C-diff because it is a broad spectrum antibiotic.  Ask for something else.Better yet, don't take it unless your life depends on it.	F	40	10  days	10/3/2006
2	bacterial infection in vagina	I got antibiotic induced colitis. I found out afterwards that Clindamycin is one of the main antibiotics that is guilty of causing clostridium difficile, which produces toxins that cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, urgency and so forth.	It cleared up the bv, but I wish I could have taken something else, or somehow avoided the bv. I was pregnant and I had to wait several weeks (until I got out of my 1st trimester) to start a new antibiotic to clear up the c-diff. I hated having this problem while pregnant, because I did not gain weight and worried about the baby constantly.  This problem is more widespread than one would think. I was a very healthy young person. I just want to say don't take antibiotics (esp. Clindamycin) unless you ABSOLUTELY need them.	F	31	10  days	7/21/2006
4	root canal infection	none		M	31	8  days	9/5/2005
