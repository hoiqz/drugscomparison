2	HBP	weight gain, hormonal changes, vision changes, skin rashes, hair loss, stomach pain	I was taking Betaxolol, and I REALLY wanted it to be the one and my hopes were pretty high as I could not for the life of me find a bad review of the stuff. Almost instantly my weight changed, which I'm guessing has a lot to do with water retention but around my midsection it's the worst...clothes don't fit right anymore. The stomach pain I seem to get with this is very uncomfortable and it's constant. It def had an effect on my cycles, delayed it almost a full month and when I finally did get it was extremely painful. Skin rashes and near the end of the 2 months on it my hair started to fall out. While I guess it's ok for anxiety I also noticed (as well as my husband) that I developed a "I don't give a !@#$" attitude towards everything and certainly no longer took joy in things. I have no heart problems, if I took any dose higher than the 5 mg my heart rate would go down to 50...not ideal for my age. Beta Blockers are terrible so I thought I'd pick one with little side effects, however I'm not happy in the slightest with this and am sad that I have to be the one and only bad review I was ever able to find.

5		Occasional fatigue	Works great in controlling HBP. It also has no effect on my glucose and cholesterol values,like other beta blockers did.	M	52	1  years10 1X D	2/19/2010
5	high blood pressure	At first, I was drowsy for a few days.  After that, I had no side effects whatsoever.	Before I took Kerlone, I had weekly migraine headaches as well as daily hormonal headaches.  Kerlone has been extremely beneficial in alleviating these headaches.  In addition, Kerlone controls the tachycardia I had previously, too.  It also keeps my blood pressure under complete control.	F	59	18  years	4/15/2008
2	high blood pressure & arrhythmia	Severe depression, irritable bowels, hemmoroids	Initially this drug worked wonders for me, lowering my blood pressure and aiding in the reduction of arrhythmia together with an anti-arrhytmic, but within 2 months of use I had a severe depression and my bowels were so irritable I worried about making it to the bathroom in time on a daily basis.
