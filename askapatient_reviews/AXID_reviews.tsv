4	heartburn	None	This works very well.  I take 150mg/day. I used to have heartburn before and after each meal & I rarely have flareups now. It's made a big difference.	F	51	5  years	1/15/2009Email
5	Acid Reflux	None	My son, 8 months old, has been on Axid since he was two months old as well.  It does not stop his spitting up but it does seem to make him less uncomfortable.	M	0.8	6  months	4/19/2007
5	Acid reflux symtoms	I experienced no side effects from using this drug.	My doc initially prescribed Prilosec and Prevacid, each of which caused me stomach pain, diarrhea and other side effects.  Axid gave me relief with absolutely no side effects.   I was curious why AXID which has no known side effects is prescribed after first trying others which each have several KNOWN side effects.   I suspect that it's because AXID doesn't have a a billion dollar ad campaign and an army of drug reps hyping it to the nation's doctors everyday.   If you've experienced side effects with Prilosec, Nexium or Prevacid which are equal to or worse than the symptom for which they are prescribed, ask your doc to try AXID for you.

4	Reflux	None	My son has been taking Axid for about 5 months (since he was 2 months old).  He has Reflux and while the Axid doesn't do much to eliminate the Reflux, it has made his discomfort much better.	M	0.5	5  months	9/4/2005
