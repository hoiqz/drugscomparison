2	MRSA	After 2 weeks of HIGH dosage one day started itching from head to toe, was told to take benadryl. Extreme headache, hives, rash, dizziness, nausea, fever, chills, uncontrollable shaking, low blood pressure (at times), and worst of all was the extreme pain in my arms neck and shoulders, which I am still feeling a week later, I can hardly move my left arm which is also numb, but the dr said I will regain use within 3 weeks.	It cleared the MRSA but I had terrible reaction to it! I recommend the drug because it will eat MRSA for breakfast lunch and dinner but PLEASE PLEASE don't be afraid to let the nurse know IMMEDIATELY if you start to feel any of the above symptoms especially the itching. Redman syndrom is not too big of a deal I guess but in my case it was pretty extreme.	M	28	2  weeks1700 2X D	6/29/2012

2	Suspected CDiff	MAJOR hairloss.  Lost about 80% 2 months following treatment.  I was hospitalized & given the drug in November.  My hair began falling out in January and continued through March.	I was given the drug via IV for 5 days.  The dr. suspected CDiff, which I later found out I did NOT have.	F	31	5  days 1X D	3/30/2011
4	MSRA or whatever its called xD	Felt very weird, instant ichiness, that's about it.	This worked very well for me, I had a horride staph infection that i let get out of hand and thank goodness they had this big bad boy antibiotic to kick its tail around.  My wounds healed up nicely and im now on bactrim to finish up.	M	20	7  days	7/4/2009
2	MRSA	It seems to have handled the MRSA, but caused a rash over most of my body.  Feet, hands, and groin especially.  2 weeks since coming off of the Vancomycin and still peeling in areas, feet and hands are still sensitive.	I only give this a "2" because the MRSA seems to have been cured.  A "1" would probably be more appropriate, but since the MRSA is as dangerous as it is, I will leave the rating a "2".  The skin reaction has definitely extended my recovery.	M	38	7  days	4/12/2009
1	high white blood cell count	My mother developed a whole body rash with severe huge blistering from vancomycin. Her blood pressure dropped significantly and never made it out of the ICU.  A terrible experience.   It happened months ago and still cannot get those images out of my mind. And this was a person who never took much medication.		F	53	3  days	4/7/2009
