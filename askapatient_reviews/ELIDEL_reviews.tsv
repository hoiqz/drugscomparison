4	Perioral Dermatitis		I was prescribed this medication for perioral dermatitis (POD). It is the only treatment so far that has helped my symptoms. After 1 week of applying a thin layer to the effected area of my face, nose and eyes, the itchy, bumpy, red tight, dry rash was almost entirely gone. Just a faint redness remains around the sides of my nose and mouth. I have been applying the cream once daily for the past 9 months. I have tried discontinuing the Elidel for 2-3 days, but the POD begins to return. I wish I could identify and treat the root problem of my POD so that I am not dependent on this medication. But I am happy that I have something that helps. Neither my dermatologist nor I have been able to determine what the underlying cause of my POD is. A 2 month trial of 100mg doxycycline 1x/day was not effective in reducing any of the POD symptoms. My derm. was very surprised by this. I am going to try topical adapelene and azelaic acid. Hopefully one will calm down the POD enough so that I can discontinue the Elidel, which has an application site cancer warning. Update: My dermatologist said that Elidel is safe to use despite what the FDA guidelines say about not using for longer than 2 weeks. My derm. also said that the black box warning it carries for increased risk of melanoma is not true. My derm is a very smart guy who I know personally, so I trust his judgment. I've increased the dose and my POD is remitting again.	M	25	 thin film 1X D	7/3/2012EmailHistory
1	rosacea	I quickly developed allergic hives all over my face. Each hive had a small liquid whitehead in its center. I had to use both topical and systemic antihistamines for 5 days now, and it still has not completely resolved.	If you have sensitive skin, think twice before using this.	F	49	2  days 1X D	6/2/2010
