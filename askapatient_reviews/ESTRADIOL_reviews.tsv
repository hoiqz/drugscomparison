2	Post-Full Hysterectomy	Joint pain, sever muscle aches and pain, sudden onset of anger and frustration, unable to form a thought, painful burning sensation of upper arms, difficulty sleeping, super hot hot flashes, night sweats remain.	First night I took Estradiol, I woke up feeling great for the first time in weeks. Prior to the pill, I had been using the 0.5mg Patch, which was not only useless but a waste of money due to it falling off in the shower. I would have to say that the pill has to many nasty effects on me physically. I didn't have this joint/muscle pain prior to taking the pill. I'm literally in pain that not even my usual pain killer will get rid of! Time to talk to my Oncologist about a natural alternative. I skipped my last dose and feel a thousand times better. Residual pain is fading, but this stuff is wicked on my system.	F	37	7  days2MG 1X D	12/20/2012Email
4	Menopause	I've noticed odd and vivid dreams.  I have a bit more energy which is awesome. Noticed hot flashes are a bit decreased.  I don't feel quite as outgoing.  We'll see.  Hopefully no depression will set in.		F	51	5  days0.05 1X D	5/29/2012Email
3	Hot flashes sleep problems	Migraines, acid reflux, gas pains in chest	I am also taking Prometrium 100 mg at bedtime. My Gyn instructed me to put estradiol under my tongue and let it dissolve. I have a history of migraines & acid reflux so not sure if connected to starting this new combo of meds.The gas pains in chest near heart happen once daily usually in AM and feel like something terrible is happening then it stops.

2	Post-hysterctomy Menopausal Symptom	Constant Vaginal Discharge, Frequent Mood Swings, Depression, Loss of interest, Migraines, Cramping, Increased Appetite	This medications literally makes me feel as if I am losing my mind. I have struggled with feeling hopeless, depressed, indifferent, sad, and angry within minutes of one another. I came to compare my symptoms with other women but I am having a tough time gauging since I am a younger patient than what it typical. I am very concerned with it's effects. I think I am going to try something else.	M	26	3  weeks1 mg 1X D	5/23/2011Email
3	Post menopausal symptoms	Just wondering if others had very vivid dreams on this		F	57	9  months.05mg 1X D	2/6/2011
3	Menopausal symptoms	Migraine, anxiety and high blood pressure	I'm in the process of weening myself off of Estradiol which I hate because it worked wonderfully for the symptoms of menopause.  Unfortunately, my blood pressure started to rise after being on it for less than a month.  Then the headaches started until they become migraines.  Also, this last month I started to get crushing anxiety to where I had severe chest pain.  I had previously attributed all of these symptoms to my high blood pressure.  However, after doing research and finding other women discussing these same issues, I found many who attributed it to being on estrogen.I plan on using phytosterols and other Chinese herbs and hope they will work as well as Estradiol without the bad side-effects.  If they don't work, I'll ask my doctor to let me try EstroGel since it has fewer side-effects.	F	52	3  months2 MG 1X D	4/26/2010Email
2	I never stop bleeding	None	I was prescribed estradiol 2mg/day for 25 days, with the last 10 days also taking prometrium 200 mg/day.  I have been bleeding almost every day for 10 months.  This did not help.	F	30	20  days	1/14/2010
5	MTF transsexual hormone treatment	Breast discharge, breast tenderness.  I am taking this with spironolactone, which seems to counter the fluid retention and weight gain that it might cause otherwise.  But the estrogen seems to counter some of the unpleasant side effects of Spiro, which increases the feminizing effects of estradiol, making for a very good hormone regimen.	Wonderful!  I take 2 mg of Estrofem (Novo Nordisk) sublingually (under my tongue) every evening.  Causes breast tenderness, but I expect that and it does not bother me.  My breast discharge doesn't really bother me either, except that I worry about it possibly being a sign of a serious side effect.  Fortunately, two doctors who I have asked about that possibility say that it is unlikely.	F	24	2  years	2/23/2008Email
4	HRT,vaginal dryness,no libido	none	Taking Estradiol after taking (AWFUL) Premarin for 5 years. Feeling better on Estradiol! I think I may be gaining my libido back,too soon to tell. I feel much more normal on it...Premarin was AWFUL!	F	35	6  weeks	12/20/2007Email
5	menopausal symptoms		Lowest dose (0.025 mg) controlled symptoms just fine, no side effects.	F	66	5  years	9/25/2007
5	HRT for primary amenorrhea	Breast growth, menstruation, increased sex drive, breast tenderness, light cramping, light moodiness, improved overall mood	I have been diagnosed with primary amenorrhea.  Taking a combination of Estradiol and Prometrium allowed me to function more normally.	F	25	1  years	2/9/2005
