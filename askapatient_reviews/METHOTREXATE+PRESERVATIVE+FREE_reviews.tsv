4	RA	None noticed, possible fatigue, headaches	Have been using for about a year and a half. One 17.5 mg injection weekly. Helps with joint pain, but does not completely make me pain free. Need steroids or another RA medicine in addition. Does not prevent flare-ups but DOES prevent inflammation which leads to deterioration of the joints and deformity which is the greatest thing about this drug and why is extremely important.

4	Rheumatoid Arthritis	No side effects that I know of.  I give myself a 1cc injection weekly.  Some people don't like needles, but this doesn't bother me.	It is hard to find the 40ML big bottle.	F	65	6  years	4/12/2008Email
