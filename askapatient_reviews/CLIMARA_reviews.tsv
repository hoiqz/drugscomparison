5	Complete hysterectomy	Weight gain	Suffered from migraines for about 20 years and no one would listen when I told them I thought they we're hormone related. Imitrex was a life saver but since I've been on climara  NO MIGRAINES! If I don't change the patch when I'm supposed to, I can feel the migraine start to come back, I've tried to wean myself off but I refuse to go back to having migraines again. Climara is like a miracle, no hot flashes or sweats	F	55	10  years.05 1X W	1/9/2013

5	total hysterectomy	Was really effective and easy to use.  Didn't have any side effects until recently.  Not sure if it is due to Climara patch.	Doesn't stick very well.  I usually end up running out of patches before my script is due.  Went without it recently for two weeks and lost weight and body and joint aches seemed to disappear. Just put one back on this week and I have a burning sensation in my hip like nerve endings and the pain in my feet started again. Also my legs and feet swell.  Thinking about talking to my doctor about what would happen if I stopped it altogether and just put up with the hot flashes and night sweats.	F	56	9  years0.1 1X W	8/8/2012
5	Total Hysterectomy	Slight weight gain but had to quit smoking in order to go on it.	I feel younger, stronger and healthier than before. I had total hysterectomy prior to ever experiencing any menopausal symptoms. I refer to it as my happy patch. I have more energy. My skin looks great. I deal with stress with ease which was an issue for me prior to usage.	F	50	3  years.05 1X D	7/18/2012
3	Menopause Symptoms	Hard time losing weight.	I think the drug benefits for my hot flashes and sleep interruption are very good. The problem I have is the patch doesn't stay on. In less than 24 hours there are large air bubbles in the middle and the edges are peeling off. Prior to using Climara, I used the Vivelle dot patch and it always stayed on. It is somewhat smaller, but thicker. It stayed on even when I sat in a hot jacuzzi for pretty lengthy periods of time.	F	52	5  weeks.75 patch 1X W	7/11/2012
4	mood swings, hot flashes, bones	light skin reaction	Dr. wants me to "wean" off, but husband can tell when I am about 3 days out - I can tell by hot flashes, irritability and hands ache, so side with husband on this one at least for now. I had hysterectomy at 30, no problems until early 50's - tried herbals, helped but not as well as the Climara (not the generic, that was awful).	F	66	10  years.05 1X W	7/10/2012Email
4	Surgical Menopause	I've been pleased with Climara as I deperately wanted to stop taking Premarin and this seemed like the answer.  I have had thinning of my hair, breast tenderness and developed tinnitus within a few years of using Climara and had no idea it was related.  I've also experienced difficulty with my contacts and again due to my lack of research and not mentioning it to my gyn,,, I had no idea the relation between that and Climara.  I tried the 0.375 and the hot flashes and not sleeping sent me right back to the 0.05.  I'm now 65 and have done the research and realize it's time to start weaning.  My next upcoming appt is in Sept, so today I cut about a third off my patch and will see how I do.  I've also put on some weight since my surgery and being on hrt....although in recent years Lexapro has been added to my medications and that has added more weight.  At the time of my surgery I weighed 120, I'm 5' 6" and was 45....within two to three years I gained about 10-15 lbs and maintained th		F	65	8  months0.05 1X W	7/9/2012Email

5	hot flashes after hysterectomy	No side effects; only gained some weight in the last couple years since I retired--got to get that off!	My doctor said that I should wean myself by cutting the patch in half, and then when my supply runs out, to try getting along without it.  He mentioned that the possibility of heart attack and stroke goes up with long-term usage.	F	68	15  years.025 1X W	5/26/2012Email

5	hot flashes mood swings no sleep me		this was a life changer for me...no more hot flashes, great mood, good sleep, and could actualy remember what I did the day before....I stopped using them about a year ago because of something I saw that said it was causing heart disease and breast cancer.  My Dr. said it was low dose and as long as I came for my regular check ups once a year it would be fine....My question for you that have been on it for years...have you had any heart problems or cancers???	F	52	 .045 1X W	5/23/2012Email
4	Hot Flashes, anxiety	Breast swelling and tenderness.  Weight gain.  but less with this Climara Pro.  Was on Activilla for 2 years previously.  I am going to try cutting the patch down to reduce some of the side effects.	Could not keep patches on.  Use a large tegraderm to keep on the skin.  My insurance does not pay for all of the medication and I cant waste money on doubling up on the patches because they wont stick. Controls hot flashes and anxiety well.

3	Menopause Symptoms	Not everyone knows about this new dosage, even my ob/gyn was not aware of it. I have not been on this new dosage long enough for my body to react. So far so good. The sensitivity to glucose is what I believe adds to the weight gain. Watch your carbs!	I am committed to wean myself over the next year or so. I want to take the lowest dosage I can tolerate.

3	Menopause Symptoms	Hair loss and has lost vitality: dry, brittle and falls out constantly. Finger nails have become very brittle, split and break easily. Skin sensitivities, localized dryness and psoriasis around ear and eyelid areas.  Increasing asthma symptoms. High blood sugar (glucose intolerance).	While this expensive product is very effective for menopause symptoms it seems to have a very negative effect on the health of the hair follicle. Perhaps throughout the entire body.  Asthma symptoms.  I have also been diagnosed with pre-diabetes.  These symptoms are consistent with the warning side effects on the label. I will start weaning myself asap. I've had enough. Any one have some success with other treatments?	F	56	8  years.05 mg 1X W	4/9/2012Email
5	had total hysterectomy	None.  My skin is soft and no wrinkles at age 64.	I have been cutting the patch in half for about a year to try and get off.  Then off for 2 months now.  Have an appointment with the Doctor on Tuesday to get a refill.  Hate the night sweats,hot flashes and dryness.  Can't wait to be back on them.. They are so nice to use.  Had no problem with them staying on.  Don't get the generic they are thick and icky.  Very happy with them not so happy without.	F	64	16  years0.1mg 1X W	3/16/2012Email

5	Hysterectomy	I had a hysterectomy at 40 and have been on Climara ever since (now close to 56). The insurance company once made me go to generic, but I felt awful, so have requested name brand Climara ever since. My doctor said we should give a try to wean off of it, so he will reduce me down to the .035 for a year, then down to the .025, and then off. I feel really good, so hope that I won't have major symptoms going off it. He said if I am miserable, I can be on it longer. I am overweight, but can't really blame that on the patch.	After wearing the patch for 16 years, there was only a few times it didn't stick. I had one box where all of them had a problem. But most times it didn't stick because my stick was damp. Put it on dry skin, hold your hand on top of it for 10-20 seconds and it will stay put for the week!	F	56	16  years.05 1X W	2/9/2012Email
5	Hot flashes	None so far. I am fit, don't smoke, and weighed the pros and cons of HRT.  I was really hoping that I wouldn't need any 'help' during perimenopause, but I am so glad I talked with my MD. I am on the lowest available dose but, truly, Climara has been life-changing (in a good way!) for me.	Prescribed for horrible hot flashes that soaked me during the day and woke me repeatedly during the night.  Was losing weight despite eating ridiculous amounts of food, probably from flopping around in bed all night long.  Within 24 hours of applying the Climara patch, the hot flashes decreased significantly and I got my first good sleep in over a month.  Since then, my hot flashes have mostly vanished and those I do experience are few and very mild.	F	47	10  days0.025mg 1X W	1/26/2012

3	Radical Hysterectomy	Began having annoying side effects about 3 months into using the patch.  Tingling in hands and feet, pain in feet, migraine headaches and weight gain.  The patch does not stay on consistently which is a real drawback.	I plan to phone my gynecologist to discuss the side effects.  Prior to using the patch my estrogen level was extremely low following the radical hysterectomy even though my ovaries were left in tact.  I also felt awful prior to using the Climara patch.  I initially felt wonderful after a month on Climara and I really like the fact that mood swings have disappeared, although I still have some trouble sleeping.   I've been exercising daily but am still struggling with my weight gain of about 10 pounds.  I don't blame the weight gain on the Climara but rather menapause and eating the wrong foods.

5	Klinefelters (XXY)MtoF Transexual	only a very slight itch after about 6 days on a single patch. Slight Redness if used on arm, changed to small of back and all is ok.	Adhesive is horrible, usually have to apply Water proof Tape over it to keep it on. Putting a new one on twice a week helps, and results are very very good, I feel so much better, no Hot flashes now my Estradiol level is closer to 200. Klinefelters really did me in, and this helps so much allowing my body to run as smooth as it did in High School! If they make ht adhesive stronger, and the patch nearly half the size.. it would be a perfect product.	F	35	3  weeks.1 2X W	10/20/2011Email
1	surgical Menopause	major weight loss, cold hands and feet, major fatigue, overall general feeling of "sick", lumps in breast, vaginal bleeding, vomitting, panic attacks, this medication made me feel so horribly sick that I thought I was dieing!!!	This was absolutely the worst most horrible experince of my life. I kept telling my doctor that the med was making me sick and he kept insisting that we lower the dose and that I was feeling so bad due to something else. Finally toward the end I found a new doctor and took myself off the medication. It seemed to have built up because I still had "lingering" effects of the medication but it seems to be all gone now.

I also take a .05 Combi patch for the progestron and it works great.  Never have gained any weight.  I [find that if you rub alcohol on the site then place the patch it stays on  I wear it for 3 then replace it.  It is NOT A 7 DAY PATCH  .

5	Complete Hysterectomy	heaviness feeling in back of knees/hair loss in middle of head/ mustache grows if too many days pass between patch replacement	Sad my primary care givers at Kaiser could never tell me how long I could or should use this product. That is still my number one question. Thank you to all the women on this site - especially the Lady thats been on the patch for 20 years- for sharing your information. I still have a slight to low normal libido. The dryness happens at times but - thanks to KY (love the heated one) problem delightfully solved. Also found out Ginseng helps my husband (also 58) libido - so no Viagra needed at this time! smile	F	58	12  years 1X W	2/8/2011Email
5	total hysterectomy	Overall after a period of adjustment, life has been wonderful with this product. I had horrid night sweats, hot flashes and aggressive mood swings and was on a roller coaster of emotions before using it. After using it about 8 years I thought I'd try to get off of it, but the hot flashes flared up again, so I started using it again. Now after 16 years, I have successfully been off of the product about a week and have been symptom free so far. Side effects were minimal during my use. I did notice when I applied it to my backside where instructed, I had pain in my sciatic nerve. I remedied this by applying it to my lower abdomen on either side below my panty line and this also kept clothing from rubbing it off. I found that removing it before a shower then making sure the area was completely dry before reapplying helped because any type of moisture trapped beneath the patch prevents it from adhereing well. I did notice even with precautions, some patches simply would not adhere for the e	Because I have a long list of allergies and for some reason my system will not absorb pill forms of many drugs, Climara was an answer to a prayer and helped me keep my sanity as well as be a functional person. I realize everyone reacts differently to medications, however, I would recommend Climara patches to any woman experiencing post menopausal symptoms. Hopefully they will have the same results that I did.	F	53	16  years0.1 mg 1X W	1/22/2011Email

5	Total Hysterectomy	On the .1 mg I had miserable Migraines daily, cutting the dosage in half has relieved me of those!	Honestly, I have no other drug to compare this too.  I was on Lupron to "help" prevent my hysterectomy.  I gave up and had the surgery fearing menopause at my young age.  The fist dosage of 0.1 mg was too much for a migraine sufferer like me.  I was in daily headache hell.  So the switch to .05 mg has been much better.  Yeah, the little black circle sucks, but I keep the thing on my butt, so I don't really look at it.  LOL  I am suffering from the onset of mutliple kidney stones and trying to deterimine if it was the Lupron therapy that did that or just menopause in general.

5	Perimenopause "issues"	None--I was very pleasantly surprised, as I usually experience some side effects w/medications.	This patch (not the generic) has been a lifesaver for me...I was experiencing hot flashes (10-12 average per day), sleep disruption, lack of sex drive, unexplained dark days, moodiness and a general inability to focus--feeling like I was in a fog, as others have described it. Almost immediately, all of the above has disappeared or been greatly reduced (hot flashes are now almost non-existent). The one thing about these patches that no one talks about is the dark muck (skin oils) that accumulate around the edge, which I dislike and is pretty disgusting. I work out a lot and sweat a lot but shower very often so I don't see a way around this. As far as the patch coming off, which others have complained about, I have only had that happen once 2 days before I was due to replace it. I believe that was a result of my tearing off sweaty gym clothes in a hurry....Being in good health and not at high-risk for stroke or other major side effects, my husband and I are really happy that this is an option for me. Pleased to say also that my sex drive is coming back and my husband isn't afraid that I'll bite his head off as he was for awhile there....	F	52	1  months0.025 1X W	5/15/2010
4	Supracervical Hyst W/ 1 Ovary rem.	Various	I was on climara back in 2001 (27yoa)after my hyst. I still kept one ovary but was experiencing low estrogen symts. My Dr gave it to me for temp use until my body adjusted after surgery and it was wonderful. Now 9 years later I am in perimenopause. Anxiety, Nausea, fatigue, night sweats, hot flashes. I was put back on it once I convinced my military drs what was going on i was sure was related to hormones! I am only 34 but had the hysto early. Now that i have been back on it, i do feel better. Not 100% but getting there. I know it takes several months to level out. I tried to add progesterone cream on my own and it wasnt a good mix for me.Especially since I no longer have a period, dosing days is tricky. I have no problems keeping the patch on. I often shower 2x a day because of my work out routine. Never comes off, but on occasion I have had to change it early because the effects seem to wear after 5-6 days. When that happens I get moody, anxious and hot flashes that feel like my skin is burning. I am hoping to be on it only temp again, but we will see. I know the risks, but quality of life means a lot to me. I have a family and they need me too.	F	34	5  weeks.025 1X W	3/25/2010
3	Menopause	Get my period every 2 weeks (I hadn't had it in over a year) = bloating = cramps within the first few days when my period is about to start. No more hot flashes.  Was completely exhausted all the time and it has helped with that.  Major decrease in vaginal dryness but having my period every 2 weeks kind of kills sex so that doesn't matter now anyway.	On the Climara Pro Patch.  Going to see my doc next week.  May change.  Can't handle the period every 2 weeks.  ****SPECIAL NOTE FOR THOSE WHOSE PATCH WILL NOT STAY ON******I've always been a big bath taker in lieu of showers.  You can imagine what that does to the patch.  After my first bath it was history.  I purchased clear waterproof bandages (3"x 5") and put that over the patch.  Poof!  Stays on and it's waterproof.

Can't remember what I did a minute ago!...tested out and found that I have a thickening of the lining of my uterus. Saw this warning on the Climara website (or was it Wikipedia?)...I may have cancer of the endometrium and if already Stage 4 cancer, or a fast-growing cancer such as anerobic...I could die.

5	total hystorectomy	I probably have experienced weight gain, itching around patch, patch falling off.	I have been very happy with this product. I had a total hysterectomy 6 years ago due to horrible pms symptoms. My doctor had me take Lupron injections for six months to see if this would help alleviate my symptoms. Sure enough...I felt much better when I was not having periods. After my surgery he put me on the patch. And I tease people saying I am worst than a Heroine addict. I must have my patch! If I don't get it I start to become very moody, irrational and irritable. I have put on about 20 pounds since that time and I never thought about it until I read all of the other comments that it may be due to the patch. I thought it was because of the surgery. I still can keep my weight down with a lot of focus, self discipline and following weight watchers. The weird thing is that about three nights ago I stopped sleeping so well and started having night sweats. I made an appointment with my doctor for this Friday. Maybe she will change the dosage.

4	urinary tract infections	Decreased libido.	Initially on 0.050 mg/day but recurring infections continued, however no other menopausal symptoms. Dosage of 0.075 mg/day eliminated the infections.  Recently a doctor suggested I try to come off the patch as it is intended for short term use.  I must admit I noticed an increase in my libido within a few days, but also noticed my skin appeared less firm.After 2 months there has not been a reoccurence of infection but due to frequent hot flashes, night sweats and the associated loss of sleep I have just gone back on. Since I want to use the lowest possible dosage I am cutting the 0.075 patches in half to see if 0.0375 mg/day will be sufficient to get rid of the hot flashes,let me get some sleep and maintain my libido. If it works I will try using 0.025. Here's hoping!	F	52	5  years75 mg 1X W	2/7/2010
5	total hysterectomy	Horrible hot flashes (day and night) and mood swings.	I have used Climara for about 19 years. After my hysterectomy, at age 43, the hormone replacement offered by my GYN basically drove me out of my mind.  This patch was prescribed by a specialist GYN-endocrinologist.  Almost immediately I experienced relief from horrible hot flashes and mood swings.  Besides being bio-identical-I believe the only way to go-the patch makes the medications use very easy.  I have recommended this product to many women over the years and will continue to do so. It's great!	F	61	19  years	1/20/2010

I think that I am going to go off this medication.  I do not like the side affects. The sweats and hot flashes have gone away, but maybe they would be better than the weight gain.  Do like this at all.  I struggle enough myself without help from a medication.			47	4  months	1/8/2010Email
2	transgender MALE TO FEMALE	Severe rash. Possibly SEVERE headache.	This patch has a long way to go to be equal to Vivelle-Dot.

I am a regular user of weight watchers and exercise at least 5xs per week so the weight gain of 5 lbs can only be explained by the patch because it wont go away and keeps going up.

5	hot flashes, night sweats,	none	I have been on the patch for 1 month.  Night sweats, hot flashes are gone.  I also seem to be sleeping better - actually have been able to go back to sleep if awakened.  This was not the case before the patch.  Although, I was not affected by mood swings, I do seem to notice I feel calmer.  Could be the sleep I am finally getting.  I have not noticed hair loss and will continue to monitor.  As far as the patch staying in place:  I followed a gal's suggestion on this feedback page where she applied the patch at night, used a hairdryer to make sure skin was dry, hair dryed the area after applying rubbing alcohol.  She also covered the patch with a transdermal bandage which I believe helps tremdendously.  I work out 6 to 7 times a week, take lots of showers and the patch has held.  I am taking the lowest dosage of .045 and am very happy with the results.	F	52	1  months	11/13/2009
3	complete hysterectomy	Especially hair change. I had beautiful bouncy hair. Now dry and listless. Also, I feel grey hair has come in heavier than prior to this medication. Lack of sex drive. I was 37 when I had my surgery.	PRior to taking climara, I was on estradial. Quite a while. Went several years with nothing after that but the sweats and hot flashes were SO severe I finally had to go back to the Dr., even with the risks, and go back on something. CLimara was it. The sweats and flashes after a week or so do disappear. However I agree that the patches MOST OFTEN DO NOT stay on for a week. I properly put them on and am careful in the shower or other water activities. Then you cannot refill before its due or the insurance will not pay even if the patch is defective. They do make a patch that you can put on twice a week, but get this, the insurance Companies will not pay usual amount. We have VERY good insurance. I even checked into other insurances policies re this problem, and all were the same. The isurance woulnd't have you go without heart medication, blood pressure meds. If the 2 X week patch has been prescribed why do they makea you pay higher price. If there were a pill out there you only had to take once a day or 3X a day, there is NO difference in price re co pay amounts.Most women will go without for that period until you can refill again if the price is 3X usual. That does not help the moods. Positive note though, I had to see another Dr. re some other health issue and did find out something interesting. I was at the Portland University Hospital and a specialist told me that the medicated patch bypasses the liver as the oral medications DO NOT. If you have to take something re hormo	F	50	3  years	11/7/2009
3	Hot Flashes, Sweats	Bleeding almost non-stop after the 2nd week.  Also after going off the patch heavy bleeding for a week.	The patch was effective for the hot flashes but the heavy bleeding that occured was a lot to take. It was almost non-stop and I also had bloating. I've been off the patch for 4 months. Initally upon stopping I bled heavily for a week. I am having the hot flashes and sweats again but am trying to manage them, live with them. I've tried a homeopathic remedy suggested by my doctor...lacheses.  It seems to take the edge off.  I discontinued taking these after a time (unemployed and could no longer afford)...probably stopped taking them too soon as it takes time for homeopathic meds to work. When I have insurance again I will try the Climara again at a lower dosage after reading the posts here. I was taking the .045/.015mg dosage, 7 day patch. Also a side note, there is no generic for this drug in the U.S. as I am aware. Are the post about a generic for Climara Pro from another country? Very curious.	F	54	10  months	9/20/2009
5	Total Hysterectomy	Compared to the oral dosage of Estradiol,next to none! Slight hair loss, but nothing major. Slight weight fluctuations, but controlled with diet. For those of you in full blown menopause you know that this is a fair trade off for the relief you get! Best wishes!	I LOVE this patch! After hysterectomy I was put on Estradiol 1 mg. Really high blood pressure! Then on 0.5 Estradiol. Still too much! Still high blood pressure. After taking matters in to my own hands, I was able to come off all replacement therapy and GRADUALLY start from scratch. Turns out I only need 0.0375 which equals out to 37.5 micrograms!My advice is to know your body. If the symptoms are too unbearable, chances are it's just too much for you.	F	36	1  years	8/21/2009
5	menapouse	No side effect at all.	I've been using 0.025 mg climara for the past four years, with no side effects.It works for me, because I do not suffer from hot flashes anymore, and it's much better then taking a pill every day.	F	57	4  years	8/9/2009Email
5	I am a male it lowers my sex drive	hi, an answer to your problem with the patch staying on. after you apply the patch on, try placing a 3 inch by 4 inch strip of duct tape over the patch. it will stay on for a long time. you can excersise, shower with it and it wont come off giving you your moneys worth. you can buy some inexpensive duct tape at any home depot or walmart.	If it works for you, maybe you can help me by donating a dollar to help me pay for my bills. im out of work. 11104 w. calle del sol phoenix, az 85037 thanks	M	50	2  years	8/8/2009Email
5	Total Hysterectomy	No side effects so far!	I suffered terrible PMS, bloating, moodswings and onset of early menopause. The Climara patch has helped me so much and I would recommend this to others. Mostly the patch stays on for the 7 days, but I have had to replace it twice.	F	41	3.5  months	8/2/2009
5	full hysterectomy	Just trying to figure out how to make it stick all week without bubbling	My military OB/GYN wouldn't prescribe the patch after my hysterectomy.  It's been almost a year since my surgery and my hot flashes and night sweats were unbearable.  I went back to my PCM and she gave me this miracle patch.  My night sweats are gone and my hot flashes have subsided (not gone but close to it). Now if I could just get it to stay on!!!	F	39	3  weeks	8/1/2009

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself.

4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011

Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed.

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight.

3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor.

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.

3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010

I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.	F	36	7  days2 MG 1X D	7/15/2010Email
2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

2	depression	WEIGHT GAIN! I couldnt concentrate hardly at all, increased appetite, lethargic.	I hated the inability to concentrate.	M	27	4  months10 1X D	6/27/2010

3	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Anxiety, can't stop moving legs, incontinence, change of voice tone.  I am taking seroquel as well at nights to help me sleep.		F	44	1.5  years30 1X D	6/20/2010
5	GAD & Depression	Uncontrollable appettite with accompanying weight gain.	It helps.	M	42	8  months50 mg 1X D	6/15/2010
4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
4	BIPOLAR 2	Severe Hiccups, lasted for 3 days.  Nausea, severe burping, felt like I was going to throw up, lasted for a week.  Slight mania, abbreviated sleep cycles, still having these.  I feel the side effects are worth it because of how well it keeps me from short cycling, which causes way more problems in my life than a little Nausea		M	36	8  weeks15 MG 1X D	6/2/2010
