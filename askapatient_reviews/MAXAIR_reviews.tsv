1	Asthma	MaxAir (PIRBUTEROL ACETATE) actually made my acute asthma attacks worse.  My doctor had to switch me back to ProAir (Albuterol Sulfate).	Made my breathing worse (see Side Effects section).  ProAir (Albuterol Sulfate) worked for me with no side effects.	M	49	4  months2 puffs 2X D	10/25/2011
5	Asthma	None	Wonder drug. Best rescue inhaler ever! I use it before exercise or up to 6 times a day during asthma flares. No palpitations! No heart racing! Easier to use than an MDI. I really like the autohaler.	M	53	5  months1-2 puffs 6X AN	12/7/2010
5	Asthma	none	same as another comment, all other inhalers made my heart race, this one doesn't- it's great	F	37	2  months	1/11/2008
5	athsma	none!	I really liked the old maxair and it is a shame it was discontinued. kind of expensive but was worth every penny.	M	20	4  years	8/21/2006
2	Rescue inhaler	None.	If I had the strength needed to get the medication out of the Autohaler, I wouldn't need it.	F	66	1  days	10/30/2005
5	Asthma	none	A good (light) medication. highly effective. With other inhalers I had to deal with	M	39	7  years	6/12/2005
5	Asthma	None	Maxair is the best inhaler I've ever used!  Other inhalers made my heart race; Maxair is the only one that doesn't.  I especially like the Autohaler since it releases the drug as you inhale.  No need for coordination  :-)	M	52	5  years	4/28/2005
4	Mild asthma problems		I really like maxair because most of the dose is not wasted in my mouth. it all goes to my lungs	M	12	2  months	10/13/2004
5	asthma from exertion in cold/alergy	way back when I first started taking it, I would get light headed, but that went away after a little over a year.	Maxair realy helped me through my last few years in the Marine Corps, and is a great help  to me now as a Sheriff Dept Rescue Diver before I go in the water. I have been using Cingulair, & Advair for 9 months now, but I'm glad I still have a couple of Maxairs for scuba diving.	M	42	10  years	2/8/2004
3	exercise-induced asthma		I have mixed feelings about Maxair. As a medication, it is absolutely the best asthma medication I've ever used.  However, in mid-2002 the manufacturer discontinued the trusty old metered dose inhaler with a new thing called an Autohaler. I absolutely hate the autohaler, and I think 3M really screwed up by discontinuing the metered dose inhaler.  I spoke to one of the product development people at 3M and they insisted that they have no plans to bring the metered dose inhaler back. So I'm looking for a replacement for Maxair.  If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.  Currently I am trying Serevent. I'll let you know what I think.	M	40	4  years	11/8/2002Email
