3	migraine headaches	-Itchy skin and scalp-irritable-addictive-variating effectiveness-difficulty concentrating-nausea-after headaches *I have been taking them on and off for many years. If I take two at the first sign of a migraine it dulls it down to tolerable but does not rid them completely. I have also found that one day it will help my headache and another occasion it won't do anything. Then on another occasion it makes me very intoxicated when its begining to work. So much that ive had to stop everything to just lay there like a teenage stoner. It also takes 30 mins to work and weara off well before 4hrs. Highly addictive as well. It takes a reaponsible person to realize this when using them. I also experience a lot of itchy skin and scalp.		F	26	10  years	3/18/2013Email
4	post fusion back and muscle pain	It helped take the edge off from the physical therapy required to regain strength and mobility. Lasted through most of the night so not as stiff and sore upon waking.		F	59	1  months1-2 daily	11/13/2012
4	Arthritis, RLS	Extreme dry mouth, itchiness all over all the time...very addictive...need to wean off		F	47	10  years	10/21/2012
1	Post Jaw Surgery	Was hardly effective. Very weak Narcotic. Had to take it a few times a day and even then, it only took the edge off. Constipation. Sleepy.	I was 18 when I took Codeine 3.	F	21	1  months300/30MG 1X D	10/4/2011Email
3	Infected Wisdom Tooth	mild itching. Cotton mouth after day 1. White tongue	Not for anyone in real pain. Unless you go over the recommended amount, your not going to be seeing a very good result of complete pain removal. I'm taking the correct amount, take about 30 min to kick in and the peak only lasts about 20 min. Just using it when the pain is to much to mentally deal with.	M	22	4  dayst3 4X D	7/16/2011
2	Sore throat due to mono	Itchy, itchy scalp	This medication didn't relieve my sore throat. Sugar pills would givin me the mind power to fight the pain. The itching didn't hurt it was more like annoying tingled like tickling no bumps though. And the dose is what the doctor had entered on my medication sheet. There is no dosage printed on the label.	F	19	3  days300-30mg 3X D	4/11/2011
3	neuropathy	Mental confusion		F	50	7  years 1X D	12/16/2010
1	car accident-broken sternum 4 place	nothing...no pain relief, was like baby asprin.	Broken sternum 4 places, 6 broken ribs, broken nose in 4 places, broken collar bone and tail bone. Went to the ER about a month after accident and out of pain pills (percocet) and in much pain, needed something until my next Dr. appointment-and they gave me 20 pills of this crap!!!	F	37	2  days#3 every 4 6X D	9/27/2010
3	stabbing pain from kidney stones	Nothing else helped with the pain as much as T-3. HOWEVER, after 4-5 weeks, itching began, mostly on scalp.	I like to have it around, but only for intense pain of short duration. Also, it is likely to give me migraines.	F	64	1.5  months60 mg. 4X D	9/13/2010
2	herniated discks in back	itchy everywere	terrible	M	34	  6X D	9/13/2010
5	migraine / general pain	addictive.	tylenol with codeine is very effective in treating my migraines. I take tylenol #3, and when caught early enough I can usually get by by taking tylenol #1 only. be cautious, this drug works well, but is addictive...	M	35	5  years 1X D	8/24/2010
4	back pain, foot pain after fusion	Tired for a couple of hours after taking it. Woozy sometimes.	It kicks in after about 20 or so minutes, and takes the edge off pain which can become significant without it. I am grateful for it.	M	50	8  months 3X D	4/6/2010
3	throat and ear	Sleepiness and itchy scalp		F	17	 	6/26/2009
3	Pain with Endometriosis	A bit of nausea, itching, sleepiness at first.	It worked when the dr first prescribed it to me but when I got my second refill I noticed it wasn't doing the trick for my pain and I had to take it sooner than before. It worked though at making it easier to through the day.	F	25	4  weeks	5/13/2009Email
3	back surgery, foot pain	Blurry vision at times, sometimes itchy all over, drowsiness	This is a pain drug with fewer negative side effects than most, and it helps with moderate pain, especially initially. I feel relief within about a half hour of taking a dose. However, I am noticing that the effect, after taking for 30 days (2-4 tablets a day) is lessening, meaning that relief isn't lasting as long in between doses. It was about 8 hours of relief, then 6, now, only about 4 hours. I am supposed to be weaning off, and was just taking 2 a day. . .now I am up to the max of 4. So now what?	F	50	30  days	9/18/2008
5	Shoulder tendonitus	Drowsiness.  Dry mouth, although that may have been caused by the Naprosyn and Flexeril I was also taking.	It seemed to work really fast and well for my severe pain.  In order to do the home exercises, along with physical therapy, I had to take these medications to get through the pain.  If I didn't do the exercises, I'd have lost some range of motion in my shoulder.  This seemed better than Vicodin, which gives me some queasiness and dizziness.    I think I took it about 2 weeks, but I don't remember the dosage.  It wasn't daily, but on a "as needed" basis.  Sometimes the pain was moderate, and in that case, the Naprosyn worked.  I was taking that daily.	F	46	2  weeks	5/24/2008
2	taylor spatial frame on tibia	none	i felt as if i wasnt even on any pain medication. I had no benefits and no side effects. It was like it never happened.	F	16	2  weeks	5/22/2008
2	Lower Back Pain	Dizzyness, nausea, Itchy Nose (doctor said not a side effect. Hah.) Dry Mouth,  Sucks the moisture out of your body, Constipation.  Sleeplessness	No noticeable major relief, possible that it took the edge off.  You need to drink major amounts of water when taking this med and carry a water bottle with you or you could get dizzy and or have nausea.  This is not for headaches or minor pain.  Only for deep pain I think.  I only took it when pain became unbearable.  Needed to take valium to get to sleep when taken late in the day.	M	41	6  years	4/25/2007
1	bruised ribs	itching,slight nausea-without curing the pain	I don't think this medication could take away a headache, let alone a serious pain!!	M	36	5  days	11/13/2006
3	IT band injury from running	The medication worked excellent for my knee pain. It was a big relief from my pain.  But the side effects were not worth it.  It made me completely nauseous, and I felt like I had to pass out every time I took it. I also noticed runny stool and dry mouth.	I'd take it again if it didn't make me so nauseous.	F	33	4  days	10/20/2006
2	Recovering Broken leg/ bad shoulder	Worked somewhat for pain. Gave me lots of energy for a few hours after thing two three time a day. When I took two a short time later my muscles would feel like I dranke 10 coffees, much tension in muscles. After a month or so I started to have problems sleeping.	I have not taken any now in four days and I am definetaly addicted to them. My stomache has bee extremly bloated every since ( a lot of trips to the bathroom ) very tired, I slept for pretty much the first two days. Every musle in my body still completly aches. ( very uncomfortable). My Advice do not play with this drug as it seem to be very attictive. I do not know how much longer I have to wait the side effects but I am really not havinga a good time of it.	M	35	2  months	9/5/2006Email
4	post-surgery pain	It worked well, a little lightheadedness and giddiness though.	Highly addictive, the more you take it, the more you have to take it, and in higher doses and more often.	F	21	1  weeks	5/25/2006
1	Pain	Nausea	Doesn't help the pain at all, even after taking 3, I just fall asleep. This sucks.	F	25	1  weeks	4/20/2006
3	toothache pain	itch feet and hands were just as miserable as toothache.helped somewhat but hate the itching		F	39	3  days	9/3/2005Email
4	sprained ankle	itching on soles of feet and between fingers, orange urine	it helped quite a bit with the pain	F	21	3  days	7/13/2005
2	Pain associated with biliary colic	itchy	This drug did not help me at all, they should have given me something stronger. What a joke. Im still in pain.	F	29	4  days	1/25/2003
4	Migraine	Mild dry mouth, mild constipation.	The most reliable and effective aid for migraine relief after trying all the other alternatives my doctors (Western and Eastern)could find (drug, therapy, acupuncture, etc).  I have taken it responsibly for all these years, but doctors frown...	M	45	22  years	7/24/2001Email
