3	long periods of heavy menstrual flo	I had nausea, headaches and extreme fatigue. This could be because of he heavy bleeding but I felt it made my symptoms worse. It never stopped my period like my doctor claimed it would.		M	22	4  days500	3/24/2013
1	heavy period	A burning sensation inside my bottom & nausea.		F	45	2  days500	3/17/2013
2	control heavy periods.	15oo mg a day and it only slightly helped control amount of bleeding. Had to stop taking it after 2 days as it caused severe nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Felt like a bad case of the flu and I could not get up. When I stopped taking it, symptoms cleared right up within hours. Glad it helped others but personally would not recommend it.

2	heavey bleeding and clots	No side effects, I take 3tablets 4 x daily. Stopped bleeding on provera, but due to a bad reaction was prescribed these and my bleeding and clots have now worsened and now I have unbearable cramping, I cannot live a normal life as my iron is very low and I also suffer from alpha thalasaemia.

5	heavy hemmoraging period was given.	None. i was in hospital for heavy bleeding this drug was injected in my drip.		F	49	1  daysby drip	8/31/2012
5	heavy extremely long periods	I have yet to feel any negative side effects after 3 months of use.	I have huge fibroids (my uterus is the size of a 5-month pregnancy because of them), so my periods were lasting up to 3 weeks and were so heavy I was completely anemic and lethargic (not to mention unable to work or lead a normal life). I was slated for a full hysterectomy, but my doctor decided to try cyklokapron first and these first 3 months have been HEAVEN. My period is SHORT AND LIGHT! I have my life back! I hope it keeps working this well!	F	38	4  days1000 MG 4X D	5/2/2012Email
2	heavy period	none, but the reduction in bleeding only lasted 9 months and it's now heavier than before		F	38	 30 3X D	5/30/2011
3	heavy period	worked for the first 5 months like a charm then my period came back with vengence.  After taking the drug (as prescribed by the doctor) my period was heavier (if that is possible) and 3 times longer.	No medical proffesional I have seen can understand how debilitating this problem is.  I usually walk out with the same advice:  eat more red meat and get a hysterectomy	F	46	3  days30mg 4X D	3/18/2011Email
4	heavy period due to uterine fibroid	No side effects	does anyone experience spotting or heavy bleeding when you stop taking the drug? I have been told to take it only during my period and to stop when the bleeding stops (hopefully it will!).	F	46	3  days1000mg 3X D	3/3/2011
5	Heavy Periods & clotting	Have had no side effects at all	I can now go to work & not worry about have to change every 1 1/2 hours or so	F	51	5  months30mg 3X D	5/4/2010
5	for really heavy periods	I am still unable to feel any side effects related cyklokapron	It has made a huge difference to amount of blood loss during menstruation. These tablets have made my periods lighter.  I have become anaemic all my life due to really heavy bleeding. I wish i could of been taking these years ago.  Now I can restore my Iron count back to normal with the help of Iron pills.	F	42	4  months	1/13/2010Email
5	Very heavy periods/cramping	Cannot directly relate anything to tablets.	Taking 2 tablets, three times a day for 3-4 days of period.  Has given a much needed respite from flooding and very painful cramps.	F	45	3  months	8/4/2008
5	Very Heavy Menstrual bleeding	I have been taking this medication for over 2 1/2 years now due to severly heavy menstural bleeding and cramping.  Before being prescribed this medication , which I take  2 pills twice a day for every day of the bleeding, I was bleeding so heavily that I wound up in the ER/A&E.  Not a pretty sight.	This medication is a god send.  It has cut the amount of bleeding down by about 25-30% and the cramps by about 25%.  I used to not be able to get out of bed before when I was on my period, now I can just about make it through the day.  And for some reason, either this medication or my moon cup(www.mooncup.co.uk) the length of my period has gone down by at least a day as well!!	F	23	2  years	11/10/2006

5	Uterine bleeding from fibroids	painful bowel cramps	stopped heaving bleeding in a matter of a week	F	49	6  days	12/29/2005
5	excessive menstral bleeding 21 days	a little bit of a upset stomach, but otherwise, it was very effective.		F	37	3  days	4/14/2005
