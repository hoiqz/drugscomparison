3	severe mood swings	The hot flashes are gone (but they were not severe) and I am sleeping better, BUT I have been bleeding (except for a few days off here and there) since Dec.1st and it now Feb. 17th. It is reeking havoc with my romantic life. I'm calling my doctor tomorrow so I can set up an appt. I want off of this! There has to be something else I can do for the mood swings! (Which is the reason he put me on the patch in the first place).		F	53	3  months50/250	2/17/2013Email
4	hot flashes/insomnia	bloating and back pain (although I don't know if this is because of the patch) could be other factors but I didn't have this when I was not on the patch	I am using it for post surgery (hysterectomy) menopause. It stopped the hot flashes, helped with insomnia, and better focus, energy and libido.  But now I have bloating and back pain (like right before a period).	F	46	2  weeks 2X W	2/5/2013
3	Menopause for 3 years	Itchy patch site, periods I was not expecting, weight gain, extreme thirst, face break outs	Hot flashes are GONE! But after 3 years of no period suddenly having one is yucko. Itchy at patch site. I use this med every 7 days. Face breaking out like a teen. Sleepy at 2pm even though I take B-12 shots once a month. Used Prempro before from other Gyno. Loved it. New Doctor said no. I dislike bleeding again and don't know if I'll stay on this med. Wonder how it works during the high heat of Summer.	F	50	1  months 1X W	2/5/2013Email
4	Hot Flashes/Osteoporosis/sleep prob	Update to my previous review: Some dark bleeding, breast tenderness, otherwise still very happy and feeling much better than w/o it.  I will be 51 in a few days. I am kind of worried about using HRT at my age but my doctor felt it necessary as osteoporosis runs heavily in my family and I have it already.	Someone tried to email me w/questions but I accidentally deleted it and can't seem to recover it! Resend and I'll try to answer your questions!My hot flashes and night sweats were severe and I was always so uncomfortably hot but it's 98% better now.

4	Adrenalin like symptoms	Initially, normal period like bleeding, which became more frequent to almost daily. A constant mild headache, weight gain, breast tenderness. I like a lot about the patch but ultimately discontinued it because of constant bleeding and headache.		F	54	3  months2xw	12/8/2012
3	Hot Flashes	Hair loss, itching at site of patch.	Initially worked very well for hot flashes. I went from 19/day to zero. After about 4 months I started noticing an unusual amount of hair loss, my hair is definitely thinner. Stopped taking 3 wks ago, hot flashes back, not as frequent, still seem to be losing a lot of hair.	F	54	6  months 2X W	10/28/2012
1	Menopause	Horrible breast tenderness, bleeding all the time, bad cramps. Was on Femhrt prior but they stopped making it. Dr. put me on this patch after I had taken  nothing for 3 weeks and hot flashes had returned. Did not bleed at all on Femhrt. Now bleeding all the time and my breast hurt all the time. Today is last day on this patch. Starting a new pill tomorrow.		F	56	10  weeks	10/20/2012
4	Hot Flashes	After first year the patch site started itching and producing a red spot. I reported to Novartis & Dr.  No one has any suggestions thus far.  Adhesive problem. INCREDIBLY annoying.	Patch is highly effective. Dr. said can only use for 5 yrs. No side effect except intense red itchy spots that take a while to heal after i remove patch. Sometimes i can't stand it and move patch to another area after 1 day.	F	55	3  years50-250 2X W	10/6/2012Email
1	Hot flashes / night sweats	Serious HAIR LOSS: 1. Several major sheds. 2. Ongoing daily hair loss. 3. Noticeable thinning of hair and widening part.**** I have stopped the patch and within 8-10 days the daily hair shed has noticeably tapered off*****	I posted on 04/28/2012 re: Hairloss. I thought I would wait a few months to see if the hair shed would slow down. So it has been one year since the shed began: July 2011 to August 2012.Since my April post I have found the following information posted by a medical doctor/hormone specialist on an HRT forum - Baldtruthtalk.com:"Combipatch has a progestin in it that has slight testosterone-like activity" So I would take this to mean if the patient has Androgen sensitivity /DHT sensitivity the progestin in this particular patch may trigger their hair loss. This side effect is not disclosed in the literature included with Combi-Patch from NOVARTIS Pharmaceuticals. WHY IS THIS NOT INDICATED by Novartis??  ****"CAN CAUSE NOTICEABLE HAIR LOSS" ***** THIS ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE DISCLOSED! I am stopping this patch now. I have had all the Thyroid and other panels and they are normal so the only possible cause for my thinning hair is the patch. '	F	55	21  months5/500 2X W	8/22/2012
5	hot flashes	Quite a bit of bleeding (sometimes dark, almost black, some odor) first three years, then began wearing it on my back only (had been wearing on front only) and bleeding is much less and more like normal menstrual blood when it does occur. It now lasts only a few days per month if at all.	pros: increased muscle tone, I am stronger than I've been in years (workout with kettlebells), better skin tone and hair.  cons: increased middle fat until I became mostly vegetarian, cut out all refined foods.....eat only fresh veg and fruit, some protein like tofu, walnuts and almonds, dairy.   It seemed like I had a little hair loss at first but now hair is shinier and thicker. Zero hot flashes, less dryness, a few pimples as I had when younger. This has been a miraculous drug for me, but am beginning to have bad heartburn and wonder if patch is contributing, and/or diet?? Or just the baby aspirin my gyne prescribed at the same time? So happy to see this website. And how interesting that the middle weight gain and hair loss experienced by so many are not listed in the adverse side effects of the so-called experts. On the other hand, middle weight gain and hair loss are quite common for those in this age group who are not on HRT, so we need more studies to sort it out.	F	64	4  years50/140 2X W	7/4/2012Email
4	perimenopause/ hot flashes	Having severe itching at patch site. Some hair loss just recently. Mid section weight gain. Trouble making patch stick although following instructions. Otherwise pleased.		F	53	9  months0.05-0.14	5/30/2012
4	Menopause symptoms	I'm not positive these come from the combi patch but I do know they happened after starting to take it. 1-Headaches. I get a dull headache if I don't change the patch as prescribed (1 every 3 1/2 days) 2-Constipation. Not terrible but noticed a change in my bowel movements for a short while. 3-Hair loss. Again, not sure this is from the combi patch but after reading other comments I'm thinking it is.	I noticed that the hot flashes are much milder and the night sweats tolerable. Neither are extreme as before. I haven't noticed a weight gain per say but do work out and try to eat right. Although after reading comments THAT may be coming! Yikes! My biggest concern right now is the hair loss. The reason I came to this site was to "just see" if there was any connection between the combi patch and hair loss. The comments tell me there IS! I can't believe how much hair I've lost in the past few month. My daughter even said "Mom, that's not normal" and I took pictures of it to show my doctor. I'm scheduled for a physical in a month and will discuss this with him. Darn...I may be wearing a wig soon!	F	53	7  months 2X W	5/7/2012Email
4	Hot Flashes, Night Sweats	HAIR LOSS!   Weight gain in waist and boost in breast size..	I wish I had found this board earlier. I started losing noticeable amounts of hair about six months into the wearing the patch. I thought it was because of the summer months or the fact that I used cleansing conditioners on my hair. But the loss is ongoing unless I stop wearing it for a few weeks.My hair is much thinner. I have to decide whether to have peaceful nights with no  hot flashes / sweats and fuller breasts OR keep from going bald..		55	18  months5/500 2X W	4/28/2012
4	Peri-Menopause/hot flashes HORRIBLE	Weight gainBloatingSome bleeding,tolerable though	Use high + low dose in conjunction, only way the hot flashes would slow down. Had them so bad I looked like I just got out of the shower everytime one occured.	F	47	300  days.05-.25 ++ 1X D	3/12/2012
4	Hot flashes, fuzzy thinking, energy	Started having bleeding due to thinning endometrium.  So,  discontinued in Dec. 2012.  Having hot flashes, night sweats, & great hair loss!   Help!		F	64	8  years0.05-0.14	2/16/2012Email
3	Balance estrigen	Started 2/5/12 after one week lapse in estrogen only, on esttogenyou only for2 3 mos. This period of without hormones was a good test as MP symptoms returned.  Night sweats, anxiety and skin crawling. On patch symptoms were rapid heart rate, some irritability, significant hair loss, fat increase middle, but gradually reduced heat, skin crawling symtom. Cut patch in half, doing better, some sex drive returning. Talk to doc next Monday.		F	54	6  days50/140	2/9/2012
4	Hot flashes, Insomnia	Still not sleeping, always hot, hair loss, bloating in the middle area, weight gain.		F	56	2  years50/250 2X W	1/21/2012Email
4	menopause,hot flashes. Osteopinia	no side effects at all unless the joint pain I am having is from them. I don't think it is. I teach aerobics and have been teaching over 22 years. I will say that since taking the patch my bone density numbers have increased A LOT but I have also been better lately about taking by Calcium.	I have gotten more fat around my middle in last 2 years and I exercise very intensly 5 times per week...(minimum!)	F	53	18  months.05mg/.14m 2X W	1/14/2012Email
4	Hot Flashes and Severe mood swings	My periods are back to normal. (I wasn't having regular periods prior to Combipatch for the last year) I like having periods, it makes me feel young again.  I've also notice last month I felt the familiar pain of ovulating.  My Hot flashes have decreased significantly and just 1-2 days prior to my new patch due date, they return In full force.  AND as well as my erratic mood swings.  Once I place a new one I feel great.  I haven't had any hair loss, but my mid section has increased.	I will try it for a year and then ask my Doctor what she thinks when I go for my annual next June.	F	47	4  months.05-0.14 2X M	9/6/2011
2	Menopause primarly for night sweats	Vaginal bleeding every day. Developed a month or so into start of it and never stopped, also developed an odor. Had to go off the patch, but bleeding still continued for a while after stopping. Nothing wrong per MD. So?	Loved it because I could sleep well and moods were better, but I couldn't take the bleeding every day anymore, and the odor. Even though the bleeding was generally light, it was EVERY DAY. Put on stomach weight also.	F	56	10  months 2X W	8/31/2011
4	hot flashes, night sweats, dryness	Starting to have hair loss, almost in clumps.  Also, weight gain (middle area), some bleeding but tolerable.	I started to apply 1/2 patch at a time in hopes that this would help and it has not.  It has helped night sweats, and dryness tremendously but I'm afraid I can't live with the weight gain and hair loss.	F	57	4  months 1X W	7/27/2011
4	menopausal symptoms	Weight gain in my belly.  Feel bloated all the time.  Have also noticed hair loss	I feel more alert, have more energy, sleep better and the hot flashes are gone.  I'm having a real problem though, with the belly & back fat that seems to come with using the patch.	F	57	2  months50/250 1X D	7/19/2011
5	hot flashes,dryness,insomonia	Weight-gain in hips and legs.	I have been working out, eating right for 11 years, just to stay between 130-135, 5'8", and now can feel and see I have gained in my hips and thighs, the worse area I have been suffering anxiety with most of my life.  I constantly am looking in the mirror and can't believe that I again, am one more time, annoyed that I still have to watch what I eat just to "HOPE" that I can wear my jeans.  Honestly, does it ever end.  Had the same problem with BC pills and used IUD in my 30's and 40's, which definitely relieved the weight gain.  What more can I do??  I cannot go back to the way I felt, but this is so frustrating.  Had the same problem with HRT oral meds, and stopped, but 3 years of non-hormone replenishment has put a toll on my well-being.	F	58	1  months50/140 2X W	2/12/2011Email
3	Flashes, mood, sleeplessness	Hair loss, face bloat, weight gain	This product greatly relieved all menopause symptoms, but made my irritable bowel syndrome worse.  Tried controlling side effects by cutting patches in half, no help.  The other side effects were unpleasant but doable;  the worsened IBS was a deal breaker.	F	51	1  years50/140 1X W	10/21/2010
4	hot flashes, loss of sleep	weight gain, hair loss	works well for my needs. Just dont know if the weight gain is pre-menapause or not, gained 10 lbs in a year, hair loss may make me wean off eventually.	F	53	1  years.05/.14 2X W	9/15/2010
2	hot flashes..lack of sleep	HAIR LOSS	After being on the patch about 6 weeks, I noticed I was "shedding",  It has gotten much worse, my hair looks terrible.  Had my thyroid levels checked as I do take synthyroid...my levels were perfect.  This is the only thing I've done differently and I feel it is the patch...It has totally stopped the hot flashes and I am sleeping so it is a bummer that I am starting to wean myself off.  However, I would rather have flashes than lose my hair...I just pray it will grow back!	F	56	4  years50/140 2X W	7/28/2010Email
5	Hot flashes	Major hair loss.	It stopped my hot flashes but the hairs loss is really scary  My doctor is doing blood work to see if it is related to my thyroid.	F	49	7  months0.05/0.14 1X W	5/12/2010Email
4	Menopause	I feel as though I have gained weight and just overall blubber, since being on the patch.  Could be menopause too, so who knows.  One thing that has been disheartening is the hair loss/thinning I have experienced over the past year.  My hair today is nothing it was 2 years ago. I have been to my Gynecologist & Dermatologist and they blame it on age.  I am searching to find out if any CombiPatch users have experienced hair loss or changes in their hair.  Otherwise the patch has been great and I haven't had a hot flash since being on it. I would prefer, however, to NOT be on it....someday, I suppose.		F	45	1.5  years.14 MG 2X W	3/7/2010Email
4	Irritablility, sadness, hot flashes	Developed mean rash at application site after 6 months of use, I'm wondering if the dry, winter months have something to do with this. Spotty bleeding comes and goes.	I'm going to try hydrocortisone cream, see if that works, and then I'll see my Doctor if it doesn't.	F	49	6  months	1/15/2010
5	severe hot flashes	slight rash at patch site; controlled with hydrocortisone cream after patch removal	It's saved my sanity--hot flashes and lack of sleep were completely debilitating.  Used the patch for 2 years, gradually cutting it down (literally cutting it with a scissors) until I weaned myself off it.  Within two weeks the hot flashes were back as bad as ever.  Went back on it at 1/2 patch twice a week--still have very mild hot flashes mostly at night but it's a good compromise for me--hot flashes are largely controlled and my dose is low enough that I don't worry as much about the cancer risk (my mom died of breast cancer so I am high risk--but my quality of life was so wrteched with the hot flashes that I am willing to take the increased cancer risk).	F	61	2  years	12/15/2009
3	help body pains postmenopause	Bleeding, both spotting and period-like bleeding, even after 1 year.	Previous HT (climara patch + prometrium pills): had no bleeding, but depression and fatigue during progesterone cycle. Combipatch evens me out, reduces body(nerve) pains, increases sex drive and sleep hours. Bleeding is a problem, had several days of bleeding 9 months of 12; may try climara pro patch next.	F	59	1  years	11/19/2009Email
3	symptoms of menopause	cramps, breast tenderness, yeast infection, bleeding, bloating, stomach pain	Helped my mental symptoms of menopause but I stopped using the Combipatch because of intense bloating, gas and abdominal pain.	F	58	6  months	6/9/2009
4	perimenopausal severe hot flashes	None that I can attribute to combipatch...	I was hallucinating from lack of sleep after months of 24/7 severe hot flashes, and went literally crying to my doctor to give me "real drugs"! Within 12 hours the hot flashes had COMPLETELY vanished and I called my Dr to tell him he was a genius. He claims this patch helps osteoporosis and he can tell women who are on the patch because they have less wrinkles. I probably shouldn't take it many more years, but for now, if I forget to change into a fresh one, the hot flashes start back up, so I obviously still need it.  Supposedly it's "bioidentical" and safer than the old bad hormone drugs.	F	47	2  years	3/5/2009
4	Hot Flashes	I have been using this patch for over one year. In recent weeks, I have had severe itching, swelling, and redness at patch site. It takes a good 2-weeks before I can apply patch to same area.	I will be seeing my gynecologist to discuss this matter!	F	59	1  years	1/5/2009
3	POF	Developed acne and unpredictable spotting.  I have stopped taking this because my face started breaking out.	Changing patch twice per week was convenient.  The patch stays on fine and isn't uncomfortable.  Does leave sticker residue on the skin, however.	F	37	1  years	7/17/2008
5	menopause, osteoporois	none	my bone scan improved from -2.4 to -.8, I sleep well at night, don't have mood swings,night sweats, and never gained any weight. I'm 5ft. 5 1/2 in. and weigh 113 lbs.	F	61	5  years	1/27/2008Email
3	pre menopause; hot flashes	vaginal bleeding	The hot flashes are gone and my sexual desire is back.	F	42	3  months	2/1/2007
5	osteoporosis, hot flashes,"crazies"	weignt gain. not sure if from combipatch or just menopause in general. pain in hips and legs but could be from a brief time I was taking Actonel, and later, Miacalcin for my osteoporosis.	started using primarily for hot flashes but found out I have osteoporosis so now primarily taking for that. anyone have any side effects with this? or any comments about taking this primarily for osteoporosis? Would appreciate any feedback. Thanks.	F	53	6  months	11/28/2006Email
