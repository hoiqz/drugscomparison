4	Eczema (face) on top of acne	medicine flakes off after it dries	I am still currently using this on my face, but the eczema is almost completely gone! I have eczema on top of acne which poses a great problem when trying to get rid of them. The acne medication flares up the eczema but the eczema medicine (hydrocortisone) does not get rid of the acne. I am also on Doxycycline to clear up the acne while I use the hydrocortisone cream to clear up the eczema.	F	27	1  weeks0.025 2X D	7/7/2010
1	Adrenal Fatigue	irritability, depression, anxiety, rage.	I only took 15mg a day for 6 days but after I physically assaulted my daughter's teacher, I realized that I need to stop taking this.  I completely lost control.  I have all the symptoms of adrenal fatigue and have been desperate to find a quick remedy. I think that I will try herbs and vitamins instead. The bloating kicked in on day 5 and that's what made me realize that my "explosion" was also related to this drug.	F	47	6  days	12/22/2009
