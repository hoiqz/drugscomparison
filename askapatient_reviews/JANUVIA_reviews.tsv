3	type 2 diabetes diagnosis recently	I can't really give an answer, as I have been on and stopped after 1 day. However, good things came from learning I was Diabetic, so there are many possitive side effects from that.	After finding that I am Diabetic & that my Dad (75) takes Januvia with great results,& finding that there is a Pancreatic Cancer risk, I decided that at my age of 46, that I best control my A1c level which was at 6.5, with diet changes instead of a pill. I eliminated McDonald's Sweet Tea, Dollar menu food, Ice Cream, I stopped going to fast food for lunch and started eating more Home cooked foods for lunch, along with lots of Cheese and wheat thin's and no longer drink the typical Diet Soda's.-These changes have dropped my A1c over the last 9 months to 6.2 & according to my Dr. will continue to drop.  My weight has stayed at 250 lbs which is still very heavy, but I was at 263 lbs with no stop in sight. Now that I have my Blood sugar under control without Januvia (http://www.pancreaticcancerlawsuit.org/januvia/) and warnings of Lawsuits due to increased Pancreatic Cancer, I am so glad I opted out of this drug & decided after the classes on Diabetes and how it destroys your body, I was scared straight! -Also, with 3 Back Surgeries and Stabbing pain in my quads and lower back, Hip, Calf & Feet Pain, I am shortly going in for a 4th Back Surgery, after trying Nerve Cut Rhizotomy, which seemed to work initially but we found that I have so many underlying pains that Dr. Rao could perform these continually with the same poor result.  The good news with Rhizotomy's is that the nerve grows back! in 6 months to 2 years. So I did a trial with the "Boston	M	46	1  days? 1X D	3/24/2013Email

5		I am a 72 year old woman with type 2 diabetes. When diagnosed I was put on the drug from hell--metforman. It was then changed to Januvia. I have had no side effects from this drug. Combined with a low carb diet it controls my Blood Glucose very well. I think anyone who relies only on medication no matter what the medication is and fails to limit carbs and doesn't exercise is asking for trouble. I feel better than I have in a long time. Dropping some weight has brought my blood pressure down and my low carb diet has lowered my cholesterol.In my opinion if your doctor just issues pills without telling you to diet and exercise he is doing you a disservice. If you don't take control of your own disease then heaven help you		F	72	 100MG 1X D	2/3/2013
1	type 2 diabeties	this caused severe sinus congestion, bloody noses, leg cramps, loss of appitite, rise in blood sugar levels and excessive sleepiness. given with metformin, these symptoms increased. and dizziness and fainting.	be very careful what you take these drugs with like cholersteral lowering drugs. they're time bombs! and make sure your doctor educates you on how to lower your sugar levels with diet and excercise too!

1	TYPE 2 DIABETES	severe body pain, sore throat, fatique, naseau, constipation and off and on  head aches and felt very drowsy. Yet could not have good sleep since body pain caused me to wakeup every 3 hours	I am a 63 year old type 2 diabtetes patient for the last 6 years. I also take medication for hypertension since 2001(lisnopril and Olmesezt). I have been taking amaryl(2mg) with Metformin(500mg) and Gilprimide for the last 5 years with good control of blood sugar levels. However my doctor prescribed 100 mg of Januvia with metformin-500mg made a veras a more efficient alternative to Amaryl. I started taking this Januvia since marhc of this year and I noted in the first 2 months some general tiredness and my fasting blood sugar was high -130 mg/dl compared with 90 mg/dl with amaryl. More importantly after 3 months of Januvia i started having intense body pain, constipation tiredness, headache, sore throat in the morning, nauseua and trouble concentrating. i was advised to take vitaminD-3-2000iu every day. I did that for the last 2 weeks and it has not reduced these symptoms. I stopped Genuvia since last monday and my tiredness and body pain has reduced considerably. I still do not have the energy I HAD before starting on Januvia. I switched back to Amaryl and my blood sugar is back under control. Is this a common experience to the side effect of Januvia. I am convinced that Merck introduced a dangerous drug in the market and someone should take this up with the FDA. I hope that I do not have permanent damage to my system due to 3 months of januvia.

1	To reduce blood sugar.	Tingling and numbness in both legs and left arm.   Extreme fatigue.    Zero appetite.  Tachycardia.	While taking this drug I felt terrible.   After four weeks of being unable to sleep because of pain/tingling/numbness in legswhich felt as if the blood flow had been cut off,I discontinued it. It took 2 weeks for symptoms to subside. It took many visits to the doctors investigating my symptoms before I myself decided to come off the drug.    My Family Physician had no idea of these side effects.	F	70	4  weeks100 1X D	2/24/2011

Sitagliptin (marketed as Januvia and Janumet) - acute pancreatitisAudience: Diabetes healthcare professionals, patients[Posted 09/25/2009] FDA notified healthcare professionals and patients of revisions to the prescribing information for Januvia (sitagliptin) and Janumet (sitagliptin/metformin) to include information on reported cases of acute pancreatitis in patients using these products. Eighty-eight post-marketing cases of acute pancreatitis, including two cases of hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis in patients using sitagliptin, were reported to the Agency between October 2006 and February 2009. It is recommended that healthcare professionals monitor patients carefully for the development of pancreatitis after initiation or dose increases of sitagliptin or sitagliptin/metformin. Sitagliptin has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Therefore, it is not known whether these patients are at an increased risk for developing pancreatitis and the medication should be used with caution and with appropriate monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Considerations for healthcare professionals, information for patients, and a Data Summary are provided.[09/25/2009 - Information for Healthcare Professionals1 - FDA]	M	48	8  months100 MG 1X D	2/18/2011Email
2	T2 Diabetes	Completely stuffy nose and head for an entire month, which was so bad I could not sleep. This led to my taking all kinds of sudafed and other cold meds to try to counteract it. The stuffiness started to subside after a month, but by then I stopped taking the medication.	My blood sugars have been very high and januvia was added to the lantus and glucovance I was already taking. The medication had no effect on lowering my blood sugar, so I chose to stop taking it. With my insurance it still was a high co-pay. My doctor told me afterwards she was not surprised it did not lower my blood sugars that much.	M	43	30  days50 mg 1X D	2/16/2011
1	Type 2 diabetes	Constant headache and nausea, sore throat, runny/ stuffy nose, severe mood swings, higher than normal blood sugars esp. morning	My doctor decided to add Januvia to help with my morning highs (~ 130 - 175) which glucovance alone was not correcting... while on Januvia, not only did i feel terrible but I started noticing very high blood sugars both in the morning (175) and 2 hrs post meal (180 - 255!!)... I would typically drop and become hypo in the middle of the day and was forced to eat more carbs than typical to get the levels back up... stopped taking it after 18 days when the mood swings and irritability got really bad and close monitoring of blood glucose show much better results now that I'm off Januvia (90 - 130 in the a.m. and 110 - 160 2hrs post meal!)

3	type 2 diabetic	Very heavy sugar laden mucous drainage in throat when laying down. Nose stopping up a lot and hard to clear head of mucous. Sometimes using up to 150 tissues at PM to rid throat of mucous and this is very tiring, Runny nose when up and about sometimes.	It does a good job of maintaining my sugar levels I need, and I take it along with 2 each 6 mg. Glyburid tabs pills each day. The Glyburid does appears to do nothing by itself.

1	type 2 diabetes	Initially I did have lower blood sugars but I am experiencing swelling, numbness and pain in my hands and forearms, has anyone else experienced this?  I have had to take lortab just to sleep at night because the pain is so intense! I have quit taking it (as of 2 days ago) to see it it will go away.  The pain isn't as bad but my hands are still somewhat numb and very swollen! This drug scares me!		F	48	6  weeks100 1X D	7/9/2010Email
1	type 2 diabetes	Totally useless, increased blood sugars.	My blood sugars were running at about 200 all of the time (prednisone induced diabetes), started Januvia and although it decreased my hunger somewhat, it caused my blood sugars to go up to close to 300. Discontinued Januvia and started taking Actos, which is much, much worse!	F	43	4  days20 1X D	6/30/2010Email

2	Type 2 diabetes	Bloating, headaches, joint problems, sleep issues, extreme tiredness.	I stopped taking it 4 weeks ago and for the first time ever my A1c is 9.7 and my nonfasting BSL was 324...is it possible that this drug actually caused my pancreas to stop producing insulin altogether?	F	61	5  months 1X D	5/11/2010
5	Type 2 Diabetes	During the first month I experienced symptoms similar to flu or sinus allergy...was aware of this side effect beforehand and took an antihistamine to help tone down the symptoms until the side effects wore off after 1 month.  After the first month no major problems.	I switched to Januvia last year due to too many problems with the side effects of the Actos diabetic drug that I was on before-weight gain, carb cravings, myopathy, etc.  I had taken Actos for over 18 mths and despite different types of strict exercise and diet routines the weight gain piled on and I felt like I was losing muscle strength on top of it.  So I did some online research to find another diabetic med and narrowed it down to Januvia and Byetta-I chose Januvia because I didn't want to deal with the injection routine of Byetta.  I knew about the side effects that some people had with Januvia before I took it, so I took an antihistamine the first month for the flu like symptoms and added extra CoQ10 (conenzyme 10, a necessary enzyme for energy production) for the myopathy like symptoms to my diet.  Since the first month I haven't had any problems and Januvia helps to keep my blood sugar in better control, suppresses the carb cravings and I got my muscle strength back.  Maybe for some of you adding CoQ10 may help you to stay on Januvia-please discuss it with your MD and research this important supplement.  After being on Januvia for just over a year, I got my life back and have no other major problems with it.	F	48	1  years	10/3/2009
1	Type 2 Diabetes	My blood sugar numbers did not improve by taking Januvia, in fact they increased.  I attributed it to the overall pain that I had after I started taking the drug, it started with hip joint pain that made it impossible to walk up stairs, followed by elbow joint pain, a complete and utter feeling of fatigue and constant pain.  When I woke in the morning, sometimes it felt like I had been a punching bag all night.  This led to mild depression.	Two days after I stopped taking Januvia, the hip pain was gone, I was able to walk stairs again, I have a renewed feeling of well being again AND my blood sugar numbers are so much better, by 30%	M	43	7  months	5/14/2009
5	type 2	None this is the best thing that happened to me since I was diagnosed 9 years ago.	I'm small 102 pounds and maintain my weight. Even with all of the testing, exercise, and small meals my sugar was high while on 20mg glyburide and 30mg Actos daily. I had a bad time with the actos swelling, aggravated sinus, allergies. I never felt it really was effective, plus bone loss was evident after four or five years.I insisted that my doctor let me try something new so I could get off the actos. I was perscribed 100mg Januvia one time a day and stayed on glyburide. The Januvia was affective immediately and lasts 24 hours. AIC dropped from 7.6 to 6.4 in six months.	F	61	1  years	5/7/2009
5	Type 2 Diabetes weight gaine	I have been steadily losing weight since switching to Januvia from Avandamet. Average weight loss for the past seven months has been about three pounds a month. I have not changed my diet or been exercising more since switching to Januvia. My doctor did have to double my dose of Januvia after the first three months because it wasn't controlling my blood sugar as well.	I have not experienced any other side-effects other than desired weight loss. Since starting to take Avandia and Avandament 5 years ago, I had gained about 40 pounds, averaging 8 pounds a year. I have already lost half of that weight in the past seven monhts. I feel great.	M	52	7  months	3/20/2009
3	type 2 diabetes	muscle cramps,sore throat	At 1st this was a great med. for me then I developed muscle cramping that I had already had taking Metformin and this drug made it worse....My BS #'s are low but I cannot handle the pain....	F	49	2  years	3/2/2009

4	diabetes type 2	mild sore throat, runny noise, increased post-nasal drip, increased appetite (especially for starchy food)	Took 100mg/day and while it was a relief from the excessively smelly flatulence from the Metformin, didn't really help my blood sugar as much as I had hoped.  Also, the cold-like symptoms I got were somewhat annoying because I never knew if I was catching something or not.  The change before/after meal was actually better than that for Metformin (ie, not as much of a change in before/after when I ate a lot of carbs), but it made my fasting and post-exercise blood sugar a lot worse.  I also felt more sluggish on Januvia, possibly from the higher blood sugar.  I'm hoping that maybe the combination of Januvia + Metformin will work out really well -- the Januvia for the meals and Metformin for all the other times.	F	29	3  months	12/18/2008Email

1	type 2 diabetes	Pnemonia, pink eye, sinus infection, these side effects are all over the internet....	I took it for about 8 months and was sick all the time and I am usually never sick.  It really depleted my immune system- be careful, if it is doing this you are more susceptible to other illnesses, maybe even cancer....I stopped taking and have not been sick since.

1	Type 2 diabetes	No side effects that I'm aware of.	Was taking Metformin (worked like a charm) but had to change meds due to kidney problems.  Have taken Januvia for 2 months and my glucose readings are VERY high.  It obviously does nothing ........	F	69	2  months	9/28/2008
3	type 2 diabetes	Increased blood pressure, heart pounding	Once I stopped the 100mg daily dose I was taking my blood pressure normalized from 156/100 back to its normal 125/80. I think that the reports of headache might be people with high blood pressure. This medicine did help my blood sugar readings but I found it was not all that effective for me, now taking 2000 metformin (I was taking this while on januvia) and .05 prandin. The prandin is great, works really quickly and a very low dose dropped my levels down fast, but it is almost too strong. Also I am concerned about having to make my beta cells work too hard so I am going to get off the prandin asap	M	43	21  days	8/1/2008
3	type 2 diabetes	My glucose went down and was often normal but I started feeling congested all the time. Then I caught a bad upper respiratory infection and twice my throat closed up on me making it very hard to breathe. I normally do not catch anything. Now I have a cough that won't go away still after 3 weeks. I suspect the januvia caused these troubles.		F	56	3  months	6/20/2008

2	Type 2 diabetes	glucose readings went up	After taking it for about a year I weaned myself off and now my readings are better. I don't think it works unless you have type 2 bad, mine is more on the insulin resistance borderline side.	F	51	1  years	6/12/2008
