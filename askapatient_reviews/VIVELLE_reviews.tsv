1	yes	was on estraderm patch for 10 years   Vivelle dot was replaced  since they no longer make  estaderm any more  A  COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY, NO  ABSORTION, NO RELIEF!!!	All my friends agree. They hate it!			3  months0.1 2X W	1/17/2013Email
1	menopause	got ZERO absorption compared to Estraderm patch which was discontinued by Novartis. More than half of my patients got no response either. Filed complaint with Novartis and FDA. Wore Estraderm patch for 23 years with no problems. RIP Estraderm. Am now using Evamist. Absorption excellent.	WASTE OF MONEY! Pharmaceutical fraud!	F	57	30  days0.1 mg pat 2X W	5/7/2012Email
5	severe hot flashes and insomnia	the only side effect for me is back pain but versus the severe hot flashes and night sweats I will take back pain any day		F	49	 unknown 2X W	3/4/2011
4	Post-op uterine septum resection	Some insomnia in the beginning, otherwise nothing, still concerned if it's working as I am not feeling ANY different :)		F	29	23  days0.1mg/day 2X W	9/3/2010Email
4	hormone replacement	none	stopped mebopausal effects such as hot flashes etc had total hysterectomy at age 31	F	36	60  days1.5 1X D	7/13/2010
4	Menopause	none	Sensitive to adhesives but no problem so far. Bloating and digestive issues are diminishing and memory lapses,leg pain and hot flashes are gone.Sleep is much better. No migraines since starting the Vivelle Dot. I have a feeling the Vivelle Dot would have eliminated all my premenstrual headaches too. I've used BHRT with progesterone and just progesterone alone but I had weight gain, depression and puffiness  using progesterone and it did nothing for my migraines. Finally decided to try BHRT without progesterone and that has made all the difference for me.	F	57	4  weeks.05mg 2X W	5/21/2010
1	Menopause	Joint Pain in feet and hands.	Started Estradiol/Prometrium 6/2007, noticed syptoms within 2 weeks, pain in feet. Stopped taking medication. Consulted with Dr. "absolutely no connection" was her response. Consulted with PCP "absolutely no connection". A year later still experiencing joint pain. I was totally healthy and pain-free prior to taking this medication. Beware!	F	48	21  days	7/20/2008
5	Hysterectomy	None	I recently had a complete hysterectomy due to a tumor and many cysts on my ovaries. I was having a lot of cronic pain in my side, heavy periods, headaces and mood swings. Since my surgery all of this has gone away, It was the best thing I ever did! The patch is very easy to wear and keep up with, I would recommend it to anybody!	F	38	2  months	4/27/2008
5	Hysterectomy	None	The Vivelle dot is fantastic.  I had a complete hysterectomy in 2002 and went on the patch pretty quickly after.  It nipped the hot flashes, sleeplessness, anxiety, and night sweats in the bud; my sex life is great; and my husband has noticed that I seem to be more even-keeled, moodwise.  I started at .1 mg. and am now at .5 and am still doing fine.  That and the hysterectomy has improved my quality of life immensely.  I have had problems with my periods since the day they started--very heavy bleeding, clots, extreme pain, sometimes almost fainting, terrible mood swings, pain during/after sex, pain even when not on my period. I had a complete hysterectomy and was found to have endometriosis, adenomyosis, and generally a messed-up reproductive system.  I am now pain free and enjoy my life ALL of the days of the month!  For me, the hysterectomy and going on the Vivelle patch enhanced the quality of my life immensely!	F	53	4  years	4/20/2007
5	hysterectomy	I was on this for 13 years and toward the end of my use of it, developed a little redness around the patch. I would still be on it if not for that fact and the scare of breast cancer from using hormone replacement.	I was very pleased.  I did gain weight, but I cannot swallow a pill and this was excellent.  I was on this from 1991-2004. It adheres very well and feels most like your skin. Also, you do not have to worry about the increased chance of gall bladder problems with this patch.	F	65	13  years	3/17/2007
5	perimenopause	Some breast enlargement and a small degree of breast tenderness.  This was not problematic.	The patch is very small and barely noticeable against your skin.  It adheres extremely well. I found it to be most effective when changed every 72 hours. Alleviated perimenopausal symptoms within first week: hot flashes, night sweats, bloating, "mind fog", and irritability. Also noticed a marked decrease in appetite/food cravings.  I am currently using the 0.025mg Vivelle patch in conjuntion with 100mg Prometrium capsule on days 1 through 12 of each month (for uterine protection).	F	41	2  months	7/11/2006
5	diminished ovarian reserve	Vivelle dot best patch to take overall.  Other patches don't stick as well and the size of vivelle is small. Would recommend changing every 3 days instead of the 3 1/2 days that is recommended in instruction insert.		F	37	8  months	6/29/2006
