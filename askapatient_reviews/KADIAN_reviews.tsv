5	Disc degen fibro mitiple breaksBACK	Constipation controlled with stool softners and occational exlax of some type i was switched around several times and finally settled on an extended release MS. My doc retired and upon switching care givers i asked to stay on my exact same mexication i dont feel stoned even taking 60mg IR as needed daily which pushes me to 500mg a day of mprophine it just helps take the edge away.  I work 12hour shifts in oilfield supply and this drug makes that possible. I know some people want that punch in the face from Narcs this will not do that.BTW they are close to killing pain without opioids))) SIGN ME UP I HATE TAKING MEDS!! GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL		M	32	3  days1602 day	11/14/2012Email
3	Chronic low back and left leg pain	Constant constipation, sleeplessness, dull pain all the time, sharp pain in low back and down left leg if I stand or squat down for long periods, like trying to work on my lawnmower.sweating, nausea and blurred vision.	I actually took MS Contin and it made me deathly sick. I had to stop taking them and was introduced to Kadian as a substitute. I worked for awhile and then I had to increase the strength several times until I got to 80mg. He then put me on Lyrica 150mg twice daily to help the nerve pain in my left leg. Along with Celebrex 200mg and Zoloft for depressiion and pain, I don't hurt too bad. I feel spaced out most of the time and I have been taking these drugs for about 15 years.

2	3 protruding cervical disks, DDD,	Constipation, sweating, dizziness, confusion, thoughts of dieing (not suicide, just that i am going to die), feeling of loss, sleepiness, sleeplessness, overall feeling of laziness	If this drug works for you, great... more power to you! It is terrible for me and does NOTHING to help with the pain. Unless of course you consider that the side effects have taken priority over the pain, sort of like smashing your foot because you arm hurts and now all you can think about is how your foot hurts.

3	Spinal cord srimulator	Blood Sugar Drops Every Day	10 surgeries in the last 12 months. Spinal Cord Simulator keeps moving off the nerve and the Dr. made a few mistakes.	M	43	2  months100mg 2X D	5/22/2012Email

4	spinal stenosis, ddd, degenerative	bad constipation, night sweats, fear of being without , sex drive has disappeared	after reading other comments, I realized just how much of my discomfort, not pain discomfort, is directly because of Kadian.  My dr. prescribed morphine sulfate er this month and I was researching the difference between them.  certainly the cost 900 Kadian I don't know yet the cost of the  Morphone sulfate er.	F	59	3  years100mg 2X D	8/3/2011Email
4	DDD, spinal stenosis	constipation. Take MiraLax for it. MiraLax is great.	Was on ms contin but after taking over a year I would get about 6hrs of relief instead of nearly 12 hrs. Seems to be doing great. What I like is that there are no peaks and valleys with it. Its the same as ms contin. Only difference is the way it is released into your system. It feels more even, smoother.	M	40	3  days 2X D	2/17/2011
4	Fibro, herniated disc	Constipation	I was on the duragesic patch for 2 1/2 years--it worked but I had a truly bad experience with a bad patch. Per my request my doc took me off of the patch & I needed to be on something and she recommended Kadian. I wish I new about this years ago--this works well for me. I am able to do a lot more--I don't have to worry about anything falling off and not getting the meds. With Kadian and any other controlled medication u must take it as scheduled -- don't miss a dose or you risk withdrawal symptoms. Great medication for those who need it--you must have chronic every day pain & have tried several other narcotics prior to using Kadian. Kadian is a great medication when prescribed ton the right person and taken properly.	F	36	6  months60 2X D	2/14/2011
4	DDD, spondylosis, herniated disc	Maddening constipation, but taking fiber pills & eating Shredded Wheat, apples.	I can actually get out of bed! I also take Vicodin for breakthru pain. The only drawback is very few pharmacies carry this med. I had never heard of it before. Had taken MSER in the past & the difference is Kadian doesn't give you the high feeling, a GOOD thing.

4	Severe Neck and Back Pain/Injuries	Constipation resolved with stool softener/laxative.	I was injured in 2000 and again in 2008.  I am 38 years old and I have severe neck and back pain which basically took my life away from me.  I have been on many medications and tons of Physical Therapy and chiropractic work.  Nothing gave me as much relief that I get from Kadian.  I also take it with Amrix (one nightly) and have Norco 10 for breakthrough pain.  Since starting the Kadian, there has been a HUGE increase in my activity.  I can walk around the block twice or ride my bike for about 20 minutes. I still have breakthrough pain, however, not near the pain I've been in for so many years. I can sleep through the night without pain waking me up any longer. I also don't notice much drowsiness as I did with other medications, however, the constipation is no fun. I took a laxative/stool softener nightly with no luck x 4 days.  I finally drank MOM. Nothing.  Drank MOM the next night and ohhhhhh let me tell ya...major incontinence on my way to work the next evening!  Oh my gosh what a horror!  So...I use the stool softener/laxative but will stay away from the MOM! All that said, I feel that my doctor has given me my life back by prescribing me Kadian and Amrix. Thanks Doc!

5	extreme pain	constipation and the solution is: I take pysullium husks mixed with juice which helps with this issue. I take two heaping tablespoons every other day. You mix it and drink it quick(its a bit unpleasant tasting so I use juice not water) before it gels. I buy the pure husks at whole foods or trader joes!	This med helps me lead a almost normal life. I would have a hard time without it!! I take 15mg oxycodone 3X's a day in addition!	M	57	  2X D	8/25/2010
5	several auto immune diseases	mild constipation, nothing otherwise	i have several auto-immune disease causing severe/constant pain - systemic cns lupus & vasulitis affecting my heart, brain, connective tissue, pulmonary fibrosis, and suspected MS. i take enough meds as it is, only had to take it 2xday, great pain control, no stomach or fogginess issues, rarely needed my 'rescue' immediate release dilaudid.	F	42	1.5  years60mg 2X D	8/18/2010
3	Chronic low back pain	Constipation(pretty normal with narcotic pain killers) blurred vision(reading close up)and urination problems(starting).	My local DR eventually had me taking (3) 7.5/750 Hydrocodone 3X a day. While it worked pretty well it lasted 2 hours and the doses just keep increasing. I HATED the ups and downs of the pain with this medication. I felt I was always planning my days with my kids based on my medication. Even planning days at work such as waiting to take my meds so I can sit through an hour meeting. I really liked the "time release" aspect of Kadian although it took a couple hours to kick in and NEVER lasted 12 hours like it was supposed to. I was given Morphone Sulphate Immediate Release (MSIR) 15mg, 2 tablets 2x a day and that helped with the delayed "kick in" but didn't help with the voids created with the Kadian not lasting 12hrs. While Skelaxin worked best, I had to switch to (2) 10mg Flexiral 2X a day. I still struggle with everyday tasks  (20 mins on a riding lawnmower) resulting in a full day sitting in my chair "recovering." I guess I have to decide when enough is enough and seek surgery but until then this is better than it was. I have seen my father go through 3 surgery's, my oldest brother have 1 surgery and the middle brother go through 2 surgery's all with minimal temporary relief only to be worse off after the fact. I will put off surgery as long as possible.	M	43	2  years60mg 2X D	7/31/2010Email
1	Multiple DVTs, Gallbladder stones	Dry mouth, constipation and night sweats.	Did nothing for my pain, absolutely nothing.  Vicodin and Percocet worked better.	M	46	30  days10mg 1X D	7/20/2010Email

4	Low Back Pain	Constipation, sweating, rash when combined with some other drugs. Eat high fiber foods like Fiber1, AllBran that control constipation.	This works for low level constant pain, but when I walk more than 10 minutes without stopping, I get a horrible stabbing pain that nothing touches so far. Recently had to stop for 1 month, had no withdrawal symptoms except for sleeping alot for 1 week.  Low level pain returned & went away when I started Kadian again.	F	64	4  years30 mg 1X D	5/16/2010
3	spinal degeneration	Constipation	Stopping caused major side effects	F	62	6  months60 2X D	5/4/2010
2	FMS, Periph-Neuropathy, Chron Pain,	DRY MOUTH CONSTANTLY - Especially if I wake up during the night or wake-up in general. Always Constipated & Constipation causes more abdominal pain. More Fatigue than I already have from the Fibro, inconsistency w/length of effects. Sometimes it lasts 8H, generally only 9-10H tops. Have to use BT meds (Percocet 10/325) in between doses while waiting for next dose and/or when it starts wearing off. Sweating ALWAYS during sleep - sheets soaked. While it does well w/pain relief 2H after dose - 8Hrs, there is no consistency with continuous relief. I've had to put up with Kadian due to Medicaid mandates (Minimum 90 day trial) before I can switch back to Oxycodone ER 40MG. FAR BETTER RELIEF AND CONSISTENCY with Oxycodone ER 40MG.	I don't understand why Medicaid would pay $450 more for this drug for 3 months instead of continue the Oxycodone ER 40MG. Why make us patients suffer MORE than what we already do. I can't stand how insurance/gov't dictate what is better for you than our Doctors!! There is NO difference between Kadian and Morphine ER - just a name difference. Morphine ER is $150, Kadian is $650, Oxycodone ER 40MG is $272. Go figure....	M	32	3  months60MG 2X D	3/27/2010Email
4	For back and leg pain	Constant itching. Constantly needed benadryl. serious blurred vision.  Doing and completing meaningless tasks.  Thinking hat you are always correct.	Strong drug. A good combination with existing medicine.  Absence of pain.  Canno function in real world activities. Wondering if I'll ever get a tolerance.  Thinking that the world is actually flat.	M	36	3  months120mg 1X D	3/7/2010Email
2	severe arthritis pain	honestly felt i received no pain relief from this drug.  i had taken vicodin and percocet previously.  the percocet was far more effective.	very disappointed.  thought it would be better than previous meds tried.	F	76	3  months 2X D	3/6/2010Email
4	Spinal degeneration	Of course with this type of drug withdrawal symptoms like sweats tend to come along with the medication. My physician has me on 0.1mg of clonidine 4 times a day to relieve these symptoms. Don't know what I would do without it. Many physicians unfamiliar with pain medications seem to be unaware of how helpful Clonidine is for sweats and other side effects of narcotics.	Kadian has helped me live a somewhat normal life. I cannot do the things I would like to do but the severe pain is relieved. I also take Percocet 10/325 prn for break through pain. As my condition worsens I am afraid the dose of Kadian may have to be increased as walking is becoming increasingly painful.	F	56	8  years130mg 2X D	2/12/2010Email
1	Herniated Discs and Surgery	Not an effective RX for long term pain in my case although the doctors said it was for long term relief.  I took 30mg twice daily with Norco for breakthrough pain.  Doctor changed to 50mg once daily.  I asked to be taken off of it and stay on Norco only	CONSTIPATION	M	29	2  months	1/26/2010
3	Herniated Discs	Constipation	Taking one 60mg capsule 24 hour slow release at bedtime, gives me a good few hours sleep but pain control not last all day.   Think doctor needs to give me something for the bad periods to take as needed during the day	F	67	6  weeks	1/12/2010
2	Back pain	None that I expirenced	I had bad back pain for about 6 years now. I first started with Kadian 30, one pill a day for a month and it seemed to do noting for my pain. I then went to Oxycodone, two 10/325 mg tablets a day. This seemed to help quit a bit, but still I was in a lot of pain while doing certain things.Yesterday my doctor put me on Kadian 20 which kind of disapointed me knowing Kadian 30 didn't work before. But this time I was to take the Kadian 20 plus my Oxycodone and thought that maybe that would help. It didn't as of yet, 24 hours later. The only reason I wanted someting different other then the Oxycodone is the Oxycodone don't last long enough and I have to go 14 to 15 hours with out any medication and I'm always being wakened from my sleep in pain. So I haven't goten a good night sllep in years, well ,maybe a few nights. I really don't think doctors give patiants a high enough does of pain killers so that a patiant can led a more normal life, and thats my problem.... any time I try to do anything I end up in pain for days and I'm pretty much a useless piece of meat.....So this is the seconed time I took Kadian, the first time for a month with no improvement in pain, and I didn't expect much with a lower dose this seconed time. Maybe I'll see an improvement in a few days, but I'm not counting on it.	M	55	1  days	11/26/2009Email
2	Neuropathy, OsteoArthritis	Difficulty urinating is the weirdest, just have to relax and think about a waterfall. Constipation, every morning drink a liver cleansing potion of warm water, lemon juice with fresh squeezed ginger root, small splash of cayenne pepper sweeten with agauve nectar.  And drink a few ounces of Aloe Vera juice every day.  Really helps maintain a nicely formed stool daily nothing like that messy Miralax.  If I take more than 20mgs Kadian three times a day I get uncomfortably sweaty with the least amount of exertion.	Kadian works for a certain extent but get breakthough pain in my lower back and feet with no other meds for it, Doc just wants me to take more Kadian!  Medicare won't pay for Skelaxin which works wonders. Sometimes get weepy & morose if I sleep 2 hours past dose time which can happen at times because of the lethargy.  I have tried to detox myself off but it is hard and I don't recommend it to anyone.  In the end there is no perfect drug although I am going back to the Pain Clinic to see what else might help.  All of our bodies react differently to pharmaceutical chemicals and I wish our Doctors would be more aware of it. This site is a great way to self-evaluate my pain needs.	F	50	2  years	11/26/2009Email
5	neck, back, bilate shoulder pain	Constipation, relieved with stool softners	I have never taken Kadian but have a friend who is on it and she is doing great with 40mg BID.  I take Opana which is a similar type of med (schedule II) The difference I see after reading the comments is that I never got the drowsiness, cotton mouth of the "high" that many experience.  I take 40mgs every 12 hours and Norco for breakthrough.  I have had 16 surgeries since 96 and can honestly say the my Pain MD nailed it.  I now have what is considered an active life and play with my 4 grandkids without being bedridden the next day.  If Kadian doesn't work the Opana might.  Good luck to everyone as being in constant pain can really ruin a life.	F	50	2  years	11/19/2009
5	Chronic Back Pain	Severe constipation cured by diet and Miralax,Cotton mouth - drink lots of water and sugarfree gumDrowsiness - keep going and let body adjust	NO HIGHS which is important to me.  The pain JUST disappears.  Hydrocodone 5-mg/350-mg for break thru pain.  Not all doctors know how to prescribe pain med's.  I worked with a pain specialist (Voted Best Pain Dr.) to find what worked for me and what didn't.  Kadian much better than pain patches for me! I've had to increase the amount over time but this amount is working for me.  I'm not pain free but I now have a life.	F	65	4  years	11/2/2009
5	chronic back pain, 4 back surgeries	constipation- controlled well with Miralax	Have searched for 10 years for pain relief,Physical therapy,accupuncture many different drug combinations,patches etc. Taking 80mg twice daily along with oxycodone on rough days for 9 months and I am a different person. Kadian has been a God send for me. Be careful not to miss any doses of Kadian or Miralax.	M	60	9  months	10/23/2009
3	Firbo and failed back surgery	Dry mouth, trouble urinating, dropsies with my wrists when holding something, terrible constipation...grrrrrr	For the last 7 years I have been on 30 mg. MS contin with 15 mg. morphine IR 3 x'day.  My pain Dr. put me on 1-100 mg. of kadian per day.  Kadian is not near as effective as the MS contin and the morphine IR was.  I am going to ask to go back on them and quit the kadian.  My pain was pretty much at a 3-4 on a daily basis, but with the kadian it has jumped up to a 6.	F	54	5  days	10/2/2009Email
2	severe back pain	constipation, forgetfulness, thinning hair,no libido,repeating myself constantly after one week, depression,very sleepy,cant get a full breath of air.100 mg. per day-on apiates 4 years-better than anything else-fear withdrawal,wish had never started.		F	61	600  days	9/20/2009Email
3	Kidney stones	Intense vomity "rushing" feeling when it kicked in (and not in a nice way, not at all), sleepiness, constipation	Worked very well indeed the first time - the pain was entirely gone very quickly. The second time about 2 days later it worked a bit but not nearly as well as the first time. It feels very unpleasant when it kicks in, not at all pleasant like I was expecting (given it's so frequently abused I was expecting to feel lovely and "high" and I didn't in the slightest). It's only worth taking if you're in a LOT of pain, and then only once or twice.	M	29	3  days	9/15/2009
1	back pain	my life was all but gone.	This drug practically killed me.  My doctor had me on 130mg. of Kadian along with 8 15 mg. tablets of oxycodone a day, and up to 1600 mg of Skelaxin, and 4 1 mg tablets of Klonopin.  Pretty much all I did was sleep.  It is extremely addictive, and way too easy to undo the capsules and take out a few extra pellets.  Your body will continually crave more.  There is no way not to become addicted to it if you are on it for more than a short time.  I was on all this stuff for 9 months, and finally went to a detox center for ten days to be taken off all of it.  A month later, I am finally well enough to drive, walk, eat normally, but not sleep,  my psychiatric doctor says it will probably be several more weeks before I'm back to normal.  It was awful getting off the stuff, even at a place where they take good care of you and give you things to make you feel better.  When I got home I was still in major detox, hallucinating, throwing up, everything including water tasted like cigarette ashes.  I can't stress it enough- don't take this drug!	F	53	9  months	9/3/2009
3	3 herniated disks cervical & lumbar	sweating that soaks everything, gastric statis that leads to sudden vomiting, unending battle with constipation, break through withdrawl symptoms, like I'd missed a dose when I haven't	Chronic pain rules my life. After trying everything I started 20mg once daily, no relief until I got to 50mg 2x day, I still had break thru pain but only rec 4 tylenol #3/day for that due to my Dr.'s paranoia, I intially rec'd 6 to 8 a day & that worked well but he dec all his patients down to 4 a day lest someone injures their liver (why he can't prescribe it with aspirin I don't know).  My life was tolerable for 2 1/2 years on this program but for last few months I develop withdrawl symptoms at 4am (from my 7pm dose) that last until about 10am, same thing in the evening, sometimes it covers & sometimes it doesn't & I cannot see what is making it so.  I've tried eating, not eating, etc.  I go today & I don't know whether to ask him to up it to 60mg twice/day or just to shoot me!	F	49	3  years	8/24/2009
4			I came to L.A for a short three day vacation and only brought a five days supply of Kadian with me, we have been have for eight days now and I don't have any medicine left. For the pass two dyas I havn't been able to sleep and my joints hurt like crazy, I have a refill at my pharmacy but calif won't accept my script from my out of state CVS. They stated that it's a state law that you must have your original script in order to fill it and be prepared to what at last a week for them to get it. I called at least fifteen stores and nobody stock Kadian out here so bring extra if your going on vacation and hide it will because it's a very popular street drug out here.	M	54	4  years	6/30/2009
3	cancer pain	It made my mouth dry, and my skin all over my body, was SO itchy, even AFTER taking Benedryl. I was able to get high as a kyte, but the side effects were awful.		F	36	365  days	6/17/2009
4	fusion, 3 hern. discs, fibromyalgia	Constipation is the most noticeable issue for me.  I have also begin to have severe, untreatable itching all over my body; I had itching in just one spot for many months, and now it has spread (this is a side effect of morphine). Slept 12 hours or more per night for the first many months, but now I start to hurt severely all over if I stay in bed for more than 9 hours, so I *have* to get up!	I was on generic morphine sulfate 3x/day for years, and switched to 130mg of Kadian to avoid gaps in pain control with 2x/day dosage. It does not control the pain as well as MS or Oxycontin.I was able to reduce my dosage slightly without any problems, one time when I wanted to try to quit (heh). I have not tried to quit completely, but it gives me hope.I wish doctors would prescribe Kadian for more than 30 days' supply.  I drive four hours round-trip every month just to get 30 days' worth of pain medicine, and sometimes have to fight for getting it at a pain doctor's office I have been going to for five years!Of course, some of the problem is people who abuse morphine, but denying it to people who actually do need it is inhumane, and making patients pay for an office visit every month is greed on the physicians' part.To Actavis, the maker of Kadian :  please find a way to make Kadian less abuse-able for those who would do that, so that maybe actual pain patients will have an easier time convincing doctors to prescribe it for mail-order amounts (90 days).  Thank you!I did not choose a 5 rating here because it has not gotten rid of the pain, only lessened it.  The rating chart says a 5 means "this medicine cured me" ... pain medicine does not CURE anything!	F	37	8  months	5/19/2009
4	spinal arthritis, fibromyalgia	Hot flashes/sweats, constipation (controlled with Miralax), occasional sleepiness.	Kadian has been effective in reducing pain, with some malingering. Previously prescribed oxycontin for more than a year and was then was switched to Kadian, 50 mg. I didn't notice a big difference in managing my pain.  Also take breakthrough meds (Norco), which seem to work more effectively, but not long lasting. I also experience migraines which are controlled with generic Imitrex.  Finally, I am also taking Celexa, which I feel may add to the hot flashes/sweats.  The combination of meds may be exacerbating my menopausal symptoms.	F	48	10  months	5/8/2009

It does not make me sleepy or high but have problems getting to sleep so using Melatonin for that.I do have Acne breaking out and only new thing has been the kadian, so assuming that is it..and it is getting worse..but I will keep trying it for now.	A month ago started me on 20mg once a day , just increased to 2x a day. So far I have not seen much pain relief..in fact none really. Try it another month with the increased dose and see.

I quit it cold-turkey after ~3 months. No side effects of quitting it, to my (and my doctor's) surprise! I now take it infrequently for really bad days. I have finally gotten some significant relief thru traction treatment. I've tried every other treatment out there, short of surgery (Im not a 'surgical patient'). Kadian definitely helped me thru some rough times.	F	40	3  months	3/26/2009Email

1	Chronic pain from previous injuries	PAIN, LACK OF RELIEF	I have been approved for Rx Assistance through Kadian Pharmaceticals (previously prescribed MS Conitin 60 mg, plus Percocet 10/325's for breakthrough pain) & this is my first day taking this brand of medication & in all honesty I must say that I am very disappointed. I have been suffering from chronic pain for many yrs (was injured in an automobile accident, have had multiple surgeries, in addition to developing Rheumatoid Arthritis & later Endometriosis) and have taken many different pain relievers (various generics/etc.) & before taking the Kadian brand of extended release morphine, the 60mg actually helped me, so long as I took oxycodone (Percocet) for breakthrough pain~but, this is like taking a placebo/sugar pill! Let me state for the record that I, like most people suffering from chronic pain, do NOT take opiate-pain-meds to 'feel good' or get high~it's a quality of life issue.

5	Pain management hysterectomy	Little bit of constipation. Make sure to eat plenty of fiber and take a stool softener. Very addictive. For me there was a high for the first couple of days, but that is over. Relieves the pain greatly for 6-8 hours.  Also taking this along with Oxycodone. Dosage of Kadian is 20mg I am hearing that Kadian has bad withdrawel. But haven't reached that fun time yet :P This one makes me really sleepy!  I take this before bed and I am out like a light within 10 minutes!	I am on a low dose of 20mg.Suppose to take one in the morning (since I am still pretty much in bed all day, the tiredness is okay) and another one at night.  Sometimes I have to cheat though, my tolerance has already gotten used to it, plus it is a very low dose.  Helps manage the pain for 6-8 hours okay I guess.  The doctor put me on this because after having a hysterectomy 7 weeks ago, I was still having a lot of pain and the oxycodone was barely helping anymore.  I think my body has a high tolerance for pain meds.  But I have a very low tolerance for pain!!  I sure will be glad when this story of my life is over. :) This is one of those addicting drugs that takes a lot of will power to not take too many of to control the pain completely.  And I am not even going to get into how bad it is with the oxycodone with the will power!  I can sure see how people get addicted to it! The body goes nuts for it.  At least mine sure is.  I have had to be on so many pain meds for my health in the	F	39	6  days	10/29/2008Email

3	Restless Leg Syndrome/Leg Pain	Really bad nervous jittery feeling. Felt like my heart was trying to jump out of my chest. Could not sit still. Profuse sweating with chills. Seems more like taking speed than a narcotic.	Does eliminate the RLS pain and discomfort but not worth the trade off of the side effects. After discontinuing Kadian RLS came back with a vengeance.	M	50	5  days	9/19/2008
5	Fibromyalgia	trouble concentrating, sweating	This stuff has been a miracle!  Nothing else has helped me as much. I'm now on 30mg a day, with Oxycodone IR for breakthrough pain (which I almost never need.)  I wish I had started this stuff ages ago, when I first got sick...it might have spared me a lot of suffering.	M		1  months	9/11/2008

2	Fusion L4-L5 and L5-S1	Constipation is horrible.  I take OTC MiraLax to get rid of it.  I started eating apples and they help a lot.  I have headaches that wont go away by taking any OTC drugs.  I have to sleep through my dosage or headaches get worse.  I get a shaky feeling inside and I feel sick to my stomach quite often.  I notice if I take the pill at 8pm and sleep until about 11am I feel pretty good the rest of the day.  If I take the pill at 8pm and wake up at 8am I feel terrible for the rest of the day.  The pain is not relieved from taking the medication.  I also take Oxycodine 15mg immediate release for breakthrough pain.  I stopped taking the Oxy because I thought that was what was making me feel bad, but now I know that it is the Kadian.		F	41	6  months	8/16/2008
3	low back/sacroilliac & hip pain	CONSTIPATION & SEVERE ITCHING WITH RASH AND FINE BUMPS ALL OVER. Cannot sleep through the night, sweats and chills, wierd dreams,foggy slow thinking, 'don't feel like doing much' attitude. Mainly, the constipation, the terrible itching, and feeling like I have morning sickness 24/7. I don't even like eating anymore...my tongue feels tingly, low appetite, nausea and fear of the dreaded CONSTIPATION!	Kadian does the job...HOWEVER...I need to make a judgement call on overall feeling. Yes the pain is reduced yet the rest of me (my mind, body and spirit)is suffering one way or the other. Kadian 40mg/day. I also take 75mg of Lyrica 4xday(good for the nerve pain). I am so tired but can only grab cat naps.	F	47	2  months	6/16/2008

I have been taking 80mg Kadian  2x a day, 8mg Tizanadine 2x a day and 150mg Lyrica 2x a day. Before Kadian i was on Darvocet. Darvocet didn't help my pain at all so my MD switched me to Kadian. Kadian brought my pain level down to a 6.5 out of 10, but if i miss a dose i am down for the day. THE BENEFITS OF KADIAN ARE NOT WORTH THE SIDE EFFECTS!!	M	27	2  years	5/8/2008
5	RA, L4-5, L5-S1 fusions,	Some constipation, helped with high fiber fruits.  Mild, occasional headache.	I was on fentanyl patches but could not keep them on.  Kadian relieves about half of the pain.

5	Herniated disc, spinal fusion	SEVERE constipation, dry mouth, reduced libido, diminished thought processing, forgetfulness, difficulty urinating	Since my daytime dose was increased to 90mg (evening dose 60mg), I HATE this drug! My pain relief is better but I can't function mentally, I can't go to the bathroom, I can't function as a woman with my husband most of the time (which he doesn't know), and I forget what I have said to people all of the time. I am absolutely miserable.  I have tried every drug and every procedure except a morphine implant and I don't want to do that because of the risks.  My current pain doc refuses to prescribe oxy to me because of threatening law suits. My family physician gave me a trial period and it worked wonders.  I have got to find a doctor to prescribe that for me.  NO MORE KADIAN FOR ME!!!	F	47	3  days	3/10/2008

Fullness in the ears, night sweats, interrupted sleep patterns, loss of libido, headache, moodiness and upset stomach	The constipation was so bad that I thought all the other symptoms were a result of the constipation.  Dr. put me on prescription MiraLax which helped the constipation but all other problems persisted.  I went to Dr twice to ask him to take me off this nasty durg.  He said he would not prescribe anything else.  He thinks this is a wonder drug.  I took myself off after the last visit and will never take this drug again.  Now I am starting over with a new Dr and will go back to Percocet which does not cause these terible side efffects.	F	47	2  months	2/12/2008

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS.

1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011

Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present.

I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie).

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

I cant afford a lawyer or I would sew. SERIOUS BRAIN DAMAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!	I wish i could sew them and make it to where these companies can not sell their poison to another child teen or adult.

Worst feeling ever-it made me not able to think clearly, and keep my train of thought. I got off of it within 1-2 weeks	Spare yourself and don't try it	F	18	2  weeks 1X D	1/9/2011
2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite.

1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.	F	36	7  days2 MG 1X D	7/15/2010Email
2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
