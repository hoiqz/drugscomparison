5	IVF	bloating and fullness	WOW! I stimmed for 11 days and at 38 yrs old produced 27 eggs! Got 4, 6 day blasts, transferred 2 and put 2 in cryo. Lost the first 2, thawed the other 2 and now have perfectly heathy 7 yr old twin boys. Do yourself a favor, use Antagon for downreg b4 transfer. Lupron is horrid.	F	45	11  days	2/19/2008Email
5	Infertility	None, I tolerated the medication well.		F	27	 	11/21/2006
3	IVF	nothing at first,then growing pressure from follicles,day 7 suddenly vomiting, belching,burning sensation of skin. Nurse said it is normal reaction to estrogen. Doctors overstimulated me as I went from 95 to 11,000 on my estrogen count within 9 days (max should be 4,000-7,000).  Estrogen will peak in in further 7 days but no tests to be done to know.  I have 9 + 6 follicles to be retrieved so their interest in my sky-high estrogen level and its side-effects is over. It did what it was suppose to do stimulated ovaries to pop follicles.	I am worried about long term effect, as estrogen exposure is linked with breast cancer.  Of course I found it out towards end of IVF as I started to vomit and took interest in holistic medicine oppionion.	F	38	10  days	4/1/2006
