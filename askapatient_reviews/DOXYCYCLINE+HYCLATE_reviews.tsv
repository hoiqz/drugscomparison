1	Upper Respiratory Infection	Severe vomiting, severe stomach pains, total loss of appetite, weak feeling, bloody diarrhea, muscle cramps, rash which burned on contact with water.	I was given this medicine in the hospital emergency department after being taken in with a asthma attack and suspected of having a chest infection. Within one hour I was vomiting bright green vomit, and kept on doing this even when I had nothing inside me to vomit anymore, which caused immense pain. This lasted for hours and even anti sickness medication did not work. I then developed a rash which burned when it came into contact with water. I only took ONE dose, and I am still having to force food down my throat two days later. Each mealtime is now a battle between me and my stomach which says 'I'm full' after one mouthful. I wonder if this will end or if I will land up needing more painful investigations.	F	27	1  days100mg 1X D	3/13/2013Email
1	Acne	Severe dehydration, heart palpitations, dizziness, felt drugged, thick tongue, severe anxiety	We didn't connect this drug and the problems our son was having until he had been passing out regularly and had been referred to a cardiologist.  Scary drug.	M	16	2  months100 MG 1X D	2/14/2013Email
4	acne	Nauesa without food,  nails and hair started to grow		F	26	2  months100mg	1/25/2013
4	Acne from testosterone therapy	I take it for huge boil like acne on my back and chest. On it now for two weeks and seems to really be clearing my skin up. All old boils are now shrinking and puss has turned clear instead of white or dark brown.   I take it an hour after eating as it says in the script. I do feel like I just got off a carnival ride that turned me green if you know what I'm saying. But at night I take well after dinner and I don't notice a thing. I hope it continues to be tolerable as it seems to work for the acne issues.		M	40	2  days100	1/7/2013Email
4	UTI	stomach cramps	Didn't have the nausea like alot of people on here are saying, but I did get really bad cramps on the last 2 days that lasted all day. I thought it was just because my period is due soon but the cramps stopped as soon as I stopped the medicine so I'm thinking it was the medicine.	F	24	7  days100 MG 2X D	11/10/2012Email
3	chlamydia	nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, chills, fatigue, disorientation		F	23	7  days100 mg 2X D	7/23/2012Email
4	UTI And candida	Increased Hunger, Nausea, and vomiting.	Taken with every Three day dose of Fluconazole 150mg	F	23	10  days100mg 2X D	5/29/2012
4	Acne	Heartburn on a couple occasions. Be sure to take with food and not with milk products.	Has helped my acne clear up on forehead. I am taking it in conjunction with Ziana. I seen an improvement after 11 weeks. It gets a little worse before it gets better.. proven fact.	F	32	65  days100 1X D	3/19/2012
4	mycobacterium chelonae	Fatigue the first few days - then reflux, GI tract problems and loss of appetite for several days	I am taking doxycycline along with azithromycin for a lung infection and, at a minimum, I will need to remain on medication for a year.  It is extremely important to take probiotics when you're on antibiotics (take two hours BEFORE OR AFTER the antibiotics).  I took the doxycycline with food and also followed all the recommendations -- i.e., drinking a full glass of water, not lying down for a while after taking the antibiotics, etc.).  Despite this, there were days after starting the doxycycline where I was unusually fatigued, had reflux and other GI tract problems, etc. so it takes a while for your body to adjust to this strong antibiotic.  However, in my case, this is one of the few antibiotics that can be used with the azithromycin for my  particular condition.	F	62	14  days100 mg. 1X D	1/1/2012
5	moderate acne	mild nausea, alternating increase and lack of appetite, dizziness, increased perspiration	I began taking doxy after having endured years of light to moderate to severe (depending on the time of year) acne, and was simultaneously put on retin-a micro and Yaz to treat the various causes of my acne. I take the doxy with meals, because despite the bottle directing me to take it on an empty stomach, my doc told me this would bring about dreadful nausea as the doxy corroded anything around it, and food would be a barrier between the med and the stomach lining (or wherever it dissolved). I eat it with yoghurt, as this is supposed to prevent yeast infections, b/c frankly, I can do without those. It's been great clearing up my skin, but has alternating weeks made me so hungry I could eat my hand and so nauseated by food I could toss my cookies at the thought of cookies. So, my body isn't terribly pleased with my weight fluctuations. Plus, every time I stand up, I get very close to blacking out, literally my sight fogs up with grey and gets spotty with colour as happens when you get that woozy, and although it has been rather hot here lately, I seem to sweat more than past summer weather has induced, and more than most people I see on the street. Despite all these irritating side-effects, the end result is worth it, because the perspiration only makes my clear skin glow!	F	20	6  weeks100 mg 2X D	7/26/2011
2	Reduce severity of acne infection	Nausea, extreme anxiety, depression, quakes, profuse sweating, highly varying blood pressures, random muscle pains.	The side effects severely outweighed the benefits of taking this drug, as there are plenty of other equally effective antibiotics available. The depression got bad enough at one point where I had it in my mind that cutting my hand would feel good and that I should drink the blood after I cut my palm open. I'm still scared by these memories today.	M	15	3  weeks100 2X D	6/22/2011
3	Prevent infection after HSG test	By the 4th day, I had a constant feeling that I needed to urinate.   Occasional mild metallic taste in mouth.	Take this with food!  Even though the directions say to take it on an empty stomach, the nurse who gave it to me cautioned me that taking it on an empty stomach can cause severe nausea.	F	41	5  days100 MG 2X D	5/3/2011
1	Eye infection	extreme anxiety, it hit me all at once, I took this medicine for 3 weeks at a low dosage and quit taking it almost 2 weeks ago and am still suffering extreme anxiety	I will not take this ever again	F	25	3  weeks50 mg 1X D	4/26/2011Email
1	urethritis	throbbing headache, swollen throat, itching	The side effect really scared me. I stopped taking it and my doctor gave me cipro. I thought I was going to suffocate. The headache was intense.	M	58	10  days100mg 2X D	1/31/2011
2	uteran infection due to IUD	Anxiety, depression, nausea, itching, severe stomach pains, burning under skin, shakiness, brain fog, blurred vision, constant feeling of needing to urinate, yeast infection	Taken along with Flagyl.   Not sure which medication is causing which symptoms but together, I feel like I'm going crazy.  The side effects are Worse than the original problems.	F	34	14  days100 2X D	1/9/2011Email
1	Acne	Stomach cramps,extreme nausea, vomiting, weak, itching.	I absolutely hate this drug! Worst thing I could have ever been put on. I started off with the 50mg but since my acne seemed to have come back with a vengeance my doctor increased the dosage. With the increased dosage the side effects came along and what do you know more acne. I need clear skin for my profession but this is ridiculous and the symptoms occur in the worst times leaving me feeling like panicking.	F	22	 100mg 2X D	12/2/2010Email
4	ear and throat infection	maybe a little fatigue but can't be sure because i already felt crappy.	did it's job!	M	38	7  days100mg 2X D	10/15/2010
4	Adult acne	Upset stomach, nausea	When taken with food I experience no stomach upset.  No other side effects noted.  My acne is pretty much gone, but I am using Epidural gel once daily in addition to this drug.  I would highly recommend it, unless you are a sun worshipper.  Direct sunlight is a no-no with this drug.	F	45	3  months100 mg 2X D	2/23/2010
2	UTI (undiagnosed bacteria)	brief uncomfortable stomach10 day 100mg twice a day	I've taken multitudes of tests and every test comes back negative.  So doctors haven't found the type of UTI I have.  The low rating doesn't mean I think this is a bad drug for the right type of bacteria, but it didn't solve whatever bacteria I have.  Unfortunately I have to try another.  The side effects of Doxy are heaven compared to taking cipro...which is my last option if all else fails.	F	29	10  days	1/31/2010
1	misdiagnosed inner ear infection	Mild itching, then bruising to valves in veins, then total weakness, dry skin, skin not 'recovering'.  Back 'giving out' felt as if all connective tissues were dissintegrating.  Took two years to recover.	Would not take, especially if you have ever been suspected of having any auto-immune conditions, or fibromyalgia.  I do not have any, but still ended up with sjogren's and underactive thyroid etc., for the last few years. now recovered.	F	49	7  days	11/21/2009Email
1	Infection related to ripped toenail	Extreme back pain!!!	Taken to treat a mild infection in my toe nail after I ripped it off the nail bed by accident, on day 4 of taking this medicine I experienced muscle seizure and excrutiating back pain.	F	27	4  days	11/16/2009Email
1	salpingitis	nausea, unbearable diarrhea, insomnia, depression, matalic taste in mouth, increased thirst, itching from no where. i will never take this antibiotic again!	taken alongside metronidazole	F	20	15  days	9/11/2009
1	Sinis Infection	iching ,rash, days after  first rash went away new rash with no iching lupus systoms	It was awful rash was bad and sysptoms of lupus for a week or so after, rash across my face.  Did not work for me.	F	52	3  days	3/21/2009
3	sinus infection	none	took twice daily for 15 days, only to have the sinus infection resurface two weeks after finishing the prescription. on the plus side, there were no side effects, but it didn't cure my sinus infection.	F	16	15  days	3/11/2009
5	bronchitis and sinus infection	Nausea if not taken with food	I am very sensitive to many antibiotics but this one works well for me.	F	29	14  days	3/9/2009
1	Lung infection	Nausea and vomiting.	This medicine made me very sick even though I took it with meals.	F	36	3  days	10/24/2005
5	Ovarian abcess caused by IUD remova	None that I know of. I am taking this side by side with Flagyl and while that stuff is foul, this med is giving me no problems.	Bonus, it seems to clear up zits!	F	30	14  days	5/24/2005
