3	Acne Treatment	Absolutely no redness.  Peeling just at middle of nostrils and bottom sides of nose.  Not sure Finacea is doing anything.  Using a combo of Panoxyl, Differin, and the Finacea.  Face became even more oily.  The Finacea/Differin use seems to be healing new pimples quickly.	Don't see dermatoligist for another three weeks so let's see how my skin is doing by then.

2	Mild Roseacea	Itching, redness	Has made the redness on my face worse.  Made my skin dry.  Itching right after application is intense-pt info that came with it said this side effect would go away but it has never subsided completely.	F	39	2  months 1X D	4/27/2012
3	mild rosacea	stinging, burning.	It seems to reduce the redness slightly in the affected area. I don't like the fact that the burning makes it so difficult to apply powder to my cheeks that I need to conceal the redness. This medicine is really a catch 22. I need it to make the skin look better long term, but using it makes it so that I can't conceal the skin effectively in the interim. I don't think I will continue using it.
