5	Post Heart Attack & Heart Failure	This medicine really helped improve my overall heart function, aided in my chronic heart failure post infarctus, and reduced my shortness of breath.  I have had virtually no negative side effects except some male breast enlargement.	The only negative was some noticable male breast enlargement.  I am not happy with that but it is only cosmetic.  Small price to pay for the excellent benefits that this medicine has given me.  Far superior to Spiro.		58	11  months25mg 1X D	4/23/2011
