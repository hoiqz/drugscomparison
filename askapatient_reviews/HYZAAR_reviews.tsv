5	HBP	I had to cut my dose in half & add pottasium gluconate to my pill regimen, because I was feeling very weak with no energy.   Now I have developed a slight shake in my hands, which makes it difficult to do some things.	Hyzaar is the only thing that has controlled my BP without major side effects.  Instead of being 190/90, I am running right around 120/70.  If I do not cut the pill in half, however, my BP plumments to extremely low numbers.	F	58	6  months50-12.5 1X D	3/30/2013Email
3	High blood pressure	It has controlled my bp to this point but I've gained about 20lbs since I started taking it in August of 2012!		F	37	1  days50mg 12.5	3/18/2013
2	high blood pressure	Terrible pain, cramping and tingling in lower legs. Back pain around sides. After 3 weeks on it, i am miserable. Blood pressure has been good and headaches are gone. Some tradeoff!		F	42	4  weeks50	2/26/2013
3	Hbp			F	60	10  years100/25	2/25/2013
4	High blood pressure	Weight gain, tired, loss of sex drive	This medicine lowers my blood pressue, but is going to break up my relationship with my girl friend. Totally killing my sex drive.	M	64	18  months 1X D	11/30/2012
4	Blood pressure	I switched from generic hyzarr to brand name my blood pressure went right down too low what do I do now..they told me they worked the same....after research I opted to go back to brand name...I know it works better but will probably have to lower the dose		F	67	2  days100/50	10/24/2012Email
1	High Blood Pressure	Extreme fatigue, dry mouth and eyes, itchy ears, constant thirst, weak arms and legs, waking up during the night.  Can't wait to get off this stuff!		F	48	30  days 1X D	10/17/2012Email
1	Blood pressure	Starting taking hyzaar.... First thing got a cold... Didn't think much of it... The coughing started. Went to the doctor for 3 months almost every week...lost my voice for a month and could not sleep from the coughing... Finally went to another doctor... Lung test showed my lungs were only working at 73%.. Took me off of hyzaar... Never had any others problems since..		F	43	6  months30	6/1/2012Email
1	High Blood Pressure	Weight Gain, ringing in ears, fatique, joint and muscle pain, gastrointestinal problems.  The weight gain became worse when switched to a generic brand.	I never put two and two together until I started reading what other's were posting about side effects.  I'm going to slowly take myself off Hyzaar and see what happens.  If I still need BP pills will ask for something different.  Never had any issues with Beta Blockers.	F	56	4  years100 MG 1X D	5/11/2012Email
4	hypertension	I've been on BP meds for more than 10 years. Altace gave me a nagging cough, Norvasc gave me horrible edema in my legs. Hyzaar is the best for me, although I've gained 15 pounds since starting it. I'm now over 200 pounds and I hate it! Although, the weight gain could also be attributed to doubling my dose of anti-depressants. Who knows?	Despite the weight gain, Hyzaar controls my blood pressure very well (BP consistently averages 125/70) and I've had few other side effects, except maybe a little dizziness here and there.	F	55	1  years100 1X D	4/22/2012
2	HBP	Worst is the throbbing leg pain and back pain.  The ringing in my ears is extremely loud.  Weight gain just keeps happening.  I had gastri bypass several years ago and don't eat very much.  On this drug I just keep gaining.  If I exercise, I don't lose any weight. I've had HPB for 30 years and am scared to stop taking this drug, but I cannot put up with the muscle cramps in my legs any longer.	I think docs need to read this page as there are a lot of people having the same side effects from this drug.  I will have to find another alternative for reducing my BP.  I think I was fine with just Norvasc.  First I'm going to cease all the prescription meds I take and see if I feel better before starting up with anything new.	F	54	10  years50 1X D	3/19/2012Email
3	High Blood Pressure	I have experienced nothing like the severe side-effects mentioned by others on this page. I am not allergic to sulpha drugs. However, I do have a runny nose daily, and I believe this stops when I've forgotten to take or run out of Hyzaar. I have many aches and pains, but since I have osteo-arthritis, I attribute these pains to that. In the last year, my eyesight is getting blurry. I thought it was age, but now, after reading these comments, I'm going to ask my doctor if it could be the Hyzaar. I also have thinning hair and weak fingernails. No one else has mentioned this as a side effect.	Hyzaar controls my blood pressure well. My doctor prescribed it after my previous BP medication resulted in my having a continuous cough. I am overweight, but no heavier than when I started the Hyzaar -- probably less heavy. I have no cough from the Hyzaar.  I wonder about the thinning hair, slow-growing fingernails, and eyesight problems, though.		60	5  years50mg/12.5m 1X D	3/7/2012Email
5	High Blood Pressure	Sweat stinks.   5 showers a day would almost not be enough - effect goes away when I do not take hyzaar - but it works so well - I take it anyway.	Hyzaar is a miracle drug for me - it works perfectly with only one bad side effect - your sweat stinks.   Called the hyzaar stink.   Captopril only gave me headaches and did not work.  Beware - $20 at Costco - $250 for same thing at Walmart.	M	62	20  years100/12.5 1X D	2/2/2012Email
5	Hypertension	No side effects.		M	42	8  years100mh	12/7/2011
1	high blood pressure	Took for many years, the side effects appeared to have crept up on me. Eventually headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, tiredness, weakness in general, effected me. My doctor ignored my complaints. Switched doctors- they ignored my complaints, too! Finally I took myself off for a month, felt 100 % better, then confessed to the doctor, who then put me on a beta-blocker, which works great! Hyzaar felt absolutely fine at first, but eventually felt like poison. Watch out if you are prescribed this! The side effects are not well documented, and your doctor may not believe your symptoms are from the drug! Awful medicine.		F	39	5  years50/12.5 1X D	7/10/2011
5	High blood pressure	No side effects.	I was on Cozaar for several years, then added HCTZ.  I decided a single pill combining the two was better, so now on generic Hyzaar (Losartan HCTZ) which keeps my blood pressure under control at 120/70 with no problems.	M	66	3  years50/12.5 1X D	7/9/2011
4	High B/P	This is the only drug I've found that controls my B/P. I have a slight dizziness which last only moments, but the symptoms that most of you are experiencing I have never had.  Weight gain usually comes from lack of exercise, and it is common knowledge to drink a lot of fluids when taking a drug that causes frequent urination.  As long as this drug works for me I will continue taking it.  The generic works fine.		F	70	12  days50 1X D	6/11/2011Email
4	High blood pressure	No adverse side effects except for weight gain. I exercise 4 times a week, so it is not that I am lazy, but I am gaining approx. 1 lb/week. Need to go on a strict diet to maintain my current weight.		F	69	30  days100-12.5 1X D	3/10/2011
1	HBP	Nightly calve cramps while I slept.  Dehydration every day,always drinking something.  Hacking cough, so bad that I would wet myself.  These symptoms are when I use brand name AND/OR generic.		F	51	2  years50/12.5 1X D	2/14/2011Email
1	High BP	Have been on this drug for 6 years and was switched to genetic several months ago.  Since then I have had repeated episodes of extremely low heart rate 41 with pressures 155/98.  Makes me feel awful.  I am going to try to wean myself off all med as my activity level has impoved dramatically and have lost 15 pounds.		F	55	6  years50/12.5 1X D	2/9/2011Email
2	high blood pressure	i have ringing in the ears, but taking this drug has made it more pronounced		M	73	3  weeks50mg 1X D	2/3/2011
3	HBP	I woke up, dressed and went downstairs for a cup of tea. After which I found that I had to rush to the toilet, where I had the runs; and then I started to feel hot and perspiring, so much so that I thought I was going to faint. I manage to get to bed, where I calmed down after a time.On waking I again rushed to the toilet, where again I had the runs, but no sweating, after which I noticed a numb feeling in the left side of my face (cheek), and my left arm felt weak e.g. no strength or grip.Really felt panicky, scared and tearful throughout the day; by the afternoon, the strength retuned to my left arm and my grip was fine, although the left side of my face was still numb as if I had an injection at the dentist.	I have not experienced panic attacks for some time, so I guess I was sitting back on my laurels a little  anyway I had been feeling really anxious on the lead up to Xmas, workload, combined with the extremely poor weather, a close friend having been rushed into hospital with a suspected mini-stroke, and many other concerns?I have booked an appointment with my GP in 2 weeks, with another round of blood tests and the like coming - never had any panic attacks before Hyzaar	M	56	2  years50mg 1X D	1/2/2011
5	high blood pressure	no side effects	i love hyzaar.  it keeps my bp under control with no side effects.  had tried several other meds that not only didn't do a good job, they had side effects. thank goodness i have a doctor who kept trying till we found the right medicine.	F	63	1  years100-12.5 1X D	12/12/2010
5	Hypertension	Mild leg cramps once in a while	Works very well, i use this in conjunction with metoprolol and my BP stays about 110/60.  Have switched to the generic and it works just as well for me.	M	53	2  years100/25 1X D	12/7/2010
2	hbp	severe ear ringing, backache, leg cramping		F	68	29  days100-25 mg 1X D	11/19/2010
2	high blood pressure	Dehydration, frequent urination, hacking cough, ringing in ears.	My insurance company would not pay for my continued treatment with Micardis, which worked well, I am a diabetic. This stuff is on my insurance companys approved List. My MD said he quit writing script for this stuff years ago. I can see why.	M	62	6  months50 mg 2X D	10/20/2010Email
1	HBP	Twitching/cramping leg muscles, especially calves. Constant fog and hard to concentrate. Blurry vision. Sometimes it seemed to help my blood pressure, other times it would still spike, and other times it would drop so low that I would get light-headed.	I have been miserable. Depression, irritability, anxiety, shortness of breath, muscle spasms, itchy scalp, eyes, ears, felt like I couldn't wake up in the morning. Living like this was AWFUL! I eased myself off of the drug and am now exercising, changing my lifestyle. I'd rather have slightly higher BP than ruin my life with this drug.	M	55	3  months50/12.5 1X D	9/25/2010Email
1	high blood pressure	Very bad neck & shoulder pain off & on but mostly on. Also had spells that are still difficult to describe, i often would get this dull pain go down my arms & weakness as though maybe heart attack.I would shake it off and go back to work.My doctor is likely sick of me i have been there so many times with these problems.He always would tell me it was something related to overworking. I could go on & on about different side effects and doctor visits .	This drug ruined my life for three years ,can't believe it is sold to us, IF I Had not found this site i would not have suspected it to be my blood pressure pills.After one week of a drug change i could jump for joy, feeling good is so ,i can't think of a word to describe it.	M	53	3  years100/25 1X D	9/10/2010
1	hYPERTENSION	FIRST OFF I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THAT I HAVE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE WITH THIS DRUG. THE HEART PALPITATIONS IN THE LAST YEAR ARE HORRIBLE. AS A SIDE NOTE TO ANYONE ELSE IF YOU ARE TAKING THIS MAKE SURE YOUR POTASSIUM IS UP. THERE IS A DIURETIC IN THIS AND THAT CAN CREATE LOSS OF POTASSIUM WHICH IS THE CASE WITH ME. I HAD TO TAKE POTASSIUM SUPPLIMENTS WHICH GAVE ME SEVERE.. AND I DO MEAN SEVERE GASTRITIS.. ALSO NOT HELPFUL FOR THE LOW POTASSIUM. I AM CALLING MY DOC AND DEMANDING TO BE TAKE ON OFF THIS DRUG MONDAY. I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN NATURALLY TO REDUCE MY PRESSURE. IF I NEED MEDS STILL FINE.. BUT IT SURE WONT BE THIS ONE ANY LONGER.. I DONT NEED THE RAPID HEART RATES AND SUCH.	ALSO I WANT TO ADD THAT GENERIC OF THIS DRUG STINKS... MY PRESSURE SOARED! I SUSPECT IN A SHORT TIME IT WILL BE PULLED FROM PHARMACY SHELVES.. GOOD RIDDANCE.	M	50	6  years100/25 1X D	8/28/2010Email
1	High Blood Pressure	Constant lightheadedness, fatigue.	I kept telling my Dr I wanted off this drug but she insisted I stay on it.  I ended up going to a cardiologist, failed a tilt table test because my blood pressure was getting too low.  She took me off this miserable drug immediately.  My bp was 101/62!  So now I am just on toprol-xl 50mg and feeling MUCH better in a matter of days.	M	43	4  years50/12.5 1X D	8/3/2010Email
1	hbp	Was previously on Cozaar for 6 months with same side effects. Side effects were daily severe headache lasting 6-8 hours which OTC painkillers didn't help, very sore muscles in back of neck and shoulders, particularly right shoulder. Some edema in legs (which was why I was switched to the Hyzaar from Cozaar). Side effects were actually more pronounced on generic Hyzaar then they were with the brand name version of Cozaar.	6 months on the Cozaar, 3 weeks off (during which the headaches went away and the neck/shoulder pain lessened), then 1 week on the Hyzaar where symptoms returned even more severely convinced me that these medications just don't work for me. Also - they never did bring my bp down as well as generic HCTZ does - so I insisted I get switched back to HCTZ by itself.	F	49	7  days50 mg 1X D	7/30/2010
2	HBP	Symptoms are very much as previously mentioned, I also tend to get panic attacks on occasions; and the symptoms tend to be more frequent when taking the generic.Also noticed giddiness and panic attacks are more pronounced on days when it is warm and very humid  thank goodness for a/c	Being on this stuff is hell, but it does keep my BP down  what do you do?	M	56	3  years50/12.5 mg 1X D	7/22/2010
3	hypertension	diziness, low blood pressure & excessive hand peeling since switching to generic.	I took name brand Hyzaar for 6 years...worst side effect was excessive weight gain (40 lbs.) but have felt like crap since switching to the generic.Has anyone else experienced adverse side effects with the generic?	F	49	6  years50/12.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010Email
1	HBP	Have gained 37 lbs., experiencing cramps in stomach, back, and calves. Just recently start experiencing muscle aches. Have dizziness, heart flutters, dry cough, and sometimes a sore throat.  Expressed my concern to my physician and she claims that Hyzaar does not cause muscle aches. Tiredness, no sex drive, short term memory loss, not thinking as quick as I was prior to medication.	Thank you all for sharing and your comments.  Now I know that I truly have reason for concern.  I knew something was out of the ordinary and often wondered if it was all related to the medication "Hyzaar" you all have confirmed the things I have been experiencing are definitely side effects from this medication.I recently read that Hyzaar attributes to muscle breakdown which in turn can ruin your kidneys.	F	41	4  years100/25 1X D	6/20/2010Email
5	hbp	no side effects	Effective with no side effects for me. My doctors have told me that the combination has been shown not only to reduce blood pressure but reduce the potential for a heart attack.	M	57	5  years100/25 1X D	5/24/2010
2	hbp	I've taken this drug for 5 years and never really noticed any side effects until a year ago and they were very diverse; constant bloating, pain in upper and lower abdomen, extreme fatique, dizziness, nausea, joint pain and depression.  Complained frequently to my family physician who had prescribed Hyzaar and he put me on medication for IBS.  My gastrointerologist gave me a colonoscopy and endoscopy..everything fine.  Due to the lower abdominal cramping, my Gyn sent me to the hospital for all kinds if tests...all normal.  My last year has been miserable with pain, nausea and depression so bad that I usually had no interest in even leaving my house.  After reading the complaints of others on this site, I stopped the Hyzaar for two days and felt better than I had in a year.  This medication is horrible and none of the doctors I went to even considered that my agony could be caused by this miserable drug.		F	64	 100 mg 1X D	5/20/2010
1	to control high blood pressure	Started feeling lethargic, almost comatose, with constant bloating. Weight went up. I eat healthy and exercise. Next, chest congestion & headaches. Skin became dry and crusty. Face hot and itchy,  large patch of scaly rash over one eye. Frequent shortness of breath, chest pressure, erratic heart beat. Felt like I was going to die. Almost called 911 several times! Became nervous, anxious and depressed. Brain went completely to mush, in a constant fog. Couldn't focus or perform simple tasks. Developed pain and tingling in the arms, fingers went numb. Went to neurologist for many expensive tests, everything was fine. Constant menstrual-like cramps. I am 64! Tossed and thrashed all night with legs twitching and severe cramping in calf muscles that woke me up screaming in pain. All  joints started to swell and hurt. Eventually couldn't walk or use my hands. Knees and hips were so bad had to use a walker to get around. I used to walk several miles a day. Now I couldn't walk to the mailbo	Be warned, the side effects creep up on you gradually and they are so diverse you will probably not think to connect them with the Hyzaar. Your doctor will deny that Hyzaar is the cause. If you are not sensitive to sulpha you will probably not have a problem. Only 2.5% of users have a problem. If you ARE one of those, this stuff will ruin your life! You don't have to be a genius to figure this out. If you have sensitivity to sulpha DO NOT TAKE Hyzaar!  A year ago I was prescribed Bystolic in addition to Hyzaar. It almost killed me. I threw it away. Guess what, it is a sulpha formulation. My BP is very high, 186/120. Hyzaar brings it down somewhat but I will not live like a brainless invalid in constant pain, so I am looking for another doctor and another medication.	F	64	3  years100-25 mg 1X D	5/9/2010
4	Hypertension	I did not notice any side effects while taking the 50 mg. dose, except for dehydration. When my dose was increased to 100 mg. I developed a dry cough, mostly at night but it became more and more a day problem. I also noticed a memory problem. However, my blood pressure can go as high as 300/250, and Hyzaar controls it pretty well. Now I am taking 50/12.5 and was fine until they switched me at the pharmacy to the generic,and that is not controlling my BP well and, thus, gives me a headache and makes me not feel well. I also use Resperate. It is a small, portable machine that plays music and guides your breathing. It always lowers the blood pressure immediately, about 20-30 mm/Hg. systolic and 10-20 diastolic. The treatment must be done daily for 15 min. for three weeks to have the effect carry through the whole day and sometimes for two or three days. I used that in conjunction with the Hyzaar, especially when my BP goes high.I have tried also Norvasc, Lisinopril, Atenolol, and severa		F	69	10  years50/12.5 1X D	5/1/2010

2	HBP	Dizziness, continual ringing in my ears, loss of sex drive, anxiety attacks, and blurred vision.  Since I started taking Hyzaar, I have newer symptoms develop about every 3 months.	My doctor changed the dosage, so I don't get dizzy as much and have fewer anxiety attacks.	F	37	1  years50mg 1X D	3/9/2010
1	HBP	Dizziness (scary at times), constant ringing in the ears and general tiredness.

2	high blood pressure	Been on Hyzaar for 3 months- my life has really changed- severe joint aches, severe fatique, foggy feeling(cannot concentrate at work), runny/stuffy nose, loose cough. The list goes on-too many negative side effects - I'm calling my cardio today to try something else. This drug shouldn't be given to humans!!!!!	Is there anyone who can suggest another ACE inhibitor besidesHyzaar?? Sure would appreciate it!!!!	F	64	3  months	12/29/2009Email
2	high blood pressure	I've been taking hyzaar 50 mg for 3 months.  Haven't felt good since starting it.  Achy joints, back ache, nausea, gained10 lbs since first taking. Overall not feeling well, severe fatigue to the point of forcing myself to get out in mornings.Would not recommend this medicine.  Only good thing is it lowered my blood pressure and that's it. Stay away from it. I'm getting off of it & talking to my cardio.	Too costly to put up with all these side effects.  No worth al the aches, & pains, etc.	F	63	3  months	12/17/2009
4	HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE	NO SIDE EFFECTS		F	62	3  months	12/14/2009
2	HBP	Anxiety, dizziness, fatigue, particularly late afternoon/evening; a little weight gain.	The medication has lowered my BP, but the side effects are intolerable and were getting worse. I have reduced the dosage by half and the effects seem to have declined and I now have better days. I am carefully monitoring my BP each day, I take the tablet at night and my BP is 110/70 in the morning  I WISH there was a natural way to reduce BP.	M	55	3  years	10/11/2009
3		Frequent urination, dry hacking cough, swelling in lower legs, some occasional leg cramps, weight gain and trouble with concentration.	The first couple years I experienced only frequent urination which I expected and decided I could live with.  I suppose along about this time I really started to gain some serious weight which I attributed to my office job and just being less active than once.  However, thinking back to before I started taking Hyzaar, I had always maintained my weight fairly well.  Nonetheless, it was helping manage my high blood pressure to near normal levels. The last two years or so I have experienced an increase in problems that I attribute to Hyzaar.  There are two that I am very troubled over - 1) trouble with concentration, 2) dry hacking cough.  Both have had an impact on my job.  The cough comes on in the late afternoon and lasts until I cough myself to sleep at night.  I know it bothers my co-workers and my wife and kids.   I have also noticed that my concentration level and ability to recall routine information has diminished in the last few years.  There are some days that I remain in a "fog"  from sunup to sundown.  You might wonder why I attribute this to Hyzaar?  Well, several months ago I ran out of medicine as I was switching to a new doctor.  I did not take my Hyzaar for three days.  During this time I did not experience any coughing and I felt completely alert and was able to deeply concentrate on my work.  The problems returned upon taking the medicine again.	M	44	6  years	7/7/2009
2	HBP	50/12.5;  tablet at night and  at mid-day (cannot cope with one tablet, the effects scare me); it has lowered my BP, although BP is variable throughout the day, I measure it at 08:00 every day and its 105/70.	It is the constant panic attacks and giddiness, some daily and lasts for @ 1 hour, when I have to go into a cool area and control my breathing, it passes. I do not like crowded areas any more. I am also tired and have no sex drive.That chemical taste in the morning is normally an indicator that you expect the symptoms mentioned above during the day.  I wish I did not have to take this treatment.	M	55	2  times	6/22/2009
1	High Blood pressure -#2 med	Where would I start; most of the ugly stuff has been stated already Within 2-3 hours to taking it, I'm exhausted and anxious. If i go outside in any heat at all, I get dehydrated rapidly and my heart rate climbs. Many"phantom pains in legs, numbness in toes, mild checst pains, sometime feels as if I'm having a heart attack. increase in GERD with relief, etc. Terrible drug and my doc thinks its great!	Track changes in your BP as I do (I check twice daily), keep track of new side or worsening side effect., printout this report and take to your Doc. If he/she doesn't want to deal with it, find a new one. I'm sick of being sick! This drug is in addition to Terazosin which I take at night, and is bad enough that it can't be taken during the day.

1	Hypertension	Weight gain, bloating, gas, muscle and dental pain, stomach and menstrual like cramping, worsening of bursitis.	I took this drug for exactly four days.  I felt absolutely miserable and could not see myself using this medication for an extended period.  In the brief time that I used the drug, I gained nearly three pounds.  I had previously used Triamterene for 12 years with no extreme side effects.	F	57	4  days	5/25/2009

Also the cost is high = $70-$90 a month.	F	55	15  years	5/20/2009Email
1	Hypertension	Dizziness, Nausea, Joint pain, Palpatations.	Although the medication did lower my BP, the side effects were intolerable and getting worse. I have stopped taking this drug and feel 100% better. I am carefully monitoring my BP which seems to have only slightly increased. i understand the health risks of high BP, but was miserable while I was on Hyzaar!	M	55	4  years	5/5/2009
3		dry cough, sneezing, fatique, chest pressure, shoulder and neck pain/stiffness.	I was on Norvasc for 5 yrs, then my Diastolic BP went up to 90 so Doc added Cozaar.  After 3 weeks of no improvement he added the diuretic. Been taking Hyzaar 100/25 for 4 days. Within 2 days I had these side effects. The worst is the pain in the shoulders and neck - feels like I have whiplash.  I take the drugs in the early morning, feel fine most of the day, and then the side effects all appear in the late afternoon/evening.  I'll try to give this 3 weeks to see if the BP goes down and side effects diminish.	M	54	4  days	4/26/2009
1	Hypertension	Anxiety, chest flutter, rapid heartrate, depression, loose stools, no sense of well being and most of the other symptoms listed.	Ended up in the ER dehydrated.  This was a soul robbing drug for me.  Never felt right on it and it was not that effective plus expensive. Lisinopril far more effective at a tiny dose.  I will put up with the occasional tickle cough and feel like a human.  I wish there were more natural remedies, although I am hearing a lot about upping the nitrous oxide in bloodstream.  I also may be borderline parathyroid which is tied to high blood pressure.  Most negative symptoms disappeared within 2 days of discontuing.	F	62	3  weeks	4/25/2009
2	Hypertension	Increasing feeling of dizziness and sick-to-my-stomach queeziness. I also experience occasional palpatations. My physician can't seem to pinpoint if its the Hyzaar or other meds I take (Toprol, Lisiniprol). Does lower my BP though.	I can't believe others are having similar experiences. I'm glad I found this web page.	M	55	3  years	4/22/2009

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.	F	41	5  months15mg 1X D	1/2/2012Email
3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..	F	25	1  months 1X D	11/14/2011Email
3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

1	deppression	shaking twitching over emotional		F	23	60  days30 1X D	11/3/2011
5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

I cant afford a lawyer or I would sew. SERIOUS BRAIN DAMAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!	I wish i could sew them and make it to where these companies can not sell their poison to another child teen or adult.

1	addition to an anti-depressant	Oh my god it was terrible. A day or two after starting it I got sooooo dizzy I couldn't even stand I just wanted to lay down and die. Worst feeling ever-it made me not able to think clearly, and keep my train of thought. I got off of it within 1-2 weeks	Spare yourself and don't try it	F	18	2  weeks 1X D	1/9/2011
2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

3	Bipolar I	Increase in appetite (gained 2 lbs in 2 weeks), GI upset initially, migraines so bad had to discontinue it	I'm bipolar with mixed states. After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated. Who knows if it "helped my depression" because it made me an absolute basket case!	F	21	14  days2.5 mg 1X D	9/27/2010
2	GAD	RAVENOUS, INSATIABLE HUNGER!!!!	When I see my Doc I have to tell him I MUST come off this med or I will be the size of a house in a month!	M	33	2  weeks 1X D	9/25/2010
2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).	F	42	16  months30 mg 1X D	9/7/2010
3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.	F	35	4  weeks15 MG 1X D	8/29/2010Email
5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
