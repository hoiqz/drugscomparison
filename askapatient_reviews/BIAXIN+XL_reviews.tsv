1	sinusitis	Severe muscle ache from feet to neck, I feel like someone beat me with Tiger Wood's golf driver. I can hardly walk without a cane or support. No relief at all from headaches or sinus congestion. No bad taste, or diarrhea or stomach cramps but I am experimenting insomnia.	I have chronic fibromyalgia, migraine headaches, osteoarthritis, severe hearing loss, and rheumatoid arthritis.		65	4  days500 1X D	3/15/2013Email
5	Sinus infection	None	I am on day 7 of 2 500mg once per day, I have not experienced one single side effect	F	55	10  days1000mg 1X D	3/12/2013
1	Sinus infection	HORRIBLE lower abdominal pain.  The pain was so bad I broke out into cold sweats and could not function.  My sinus pain was gone after two days but I can't even function with this level of abdominal pain.  The pain is very, very low - almost at my pelvic bone. I also had bouts of lower back and side pain. I have diarrhea which I expected but the pain is really unbearable - an 8 out of 10.  At times it just took my breath away and I was doubled over.  Called the dr today to change meds.  I will never take this medication again.		F	45	2  days500 mg 1X D	3/7/2013
1	Sinus infection	Severe anxiety/panic and irrational fears, extreme stomach pain, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, insomnia, tremors and nervous system shivers, racing heart.	I took this drug in July 2012 for a sinus infection. Once on the drug, I could not sleep, eat and or stop vomiting. It took 3 months to start eating and sleeping properly again. I lost 25 lbs and had extreme stomache pain for 4 months. Nervous system tremors/shivers are almost gone 8 months later. I also developed a severe panic/anxiety disorder after taking this medication, that I am still dealing with today.  Prior to taking this drug, I never had any history of anxiety or panic attacks. Drs say this drug could not be the cause of anxiety but it all started after I took this drug.	F	32	6  days1000 mg 1X D	3/3/2013Email
3	Acute Sinusitis	The worst thing is the taste it leaves in your mouth.It is almost as bad as the taste you get if you take lunesta.I also experienced nausea,bad stomach cramps,and my stomach was actually sore like I had done an excessive amount of sit-ups.This is the first time I have been prescribed this medication,and for now the jury is still out.It isn't feeling like it cleared my sinusitis up.

1	Bronchitis	Worst painful gas of my life, diarrhea, headaches, light-headed, loss of appetite, cannot sleep, stomach cramps.  Did not help my bronchitis at all!		F	41	6  days1000	1/23/2013
5	Sinus infection and Bronchitis	Biaxin worked within a day of starting the medication..  I'm on day 6 and feel great!.  My doctor recommended that I take a probiotic with the medication and it must be working as I've had no stomach issues.The only side effects I've experienced: strong metallic taste in my mouth and a few nights of insomnia.		F	33	10  days	1/9/2013
5	Sinusitis,otitis media,bronchitis	Metallic taste, did seem to make just about everything taste different. Stomach upset occasionally. Did put me in a better mood, gave me energy. After not being able to kick this crud I have had for the last month after being on decongestants and other antibiotics (amoxicillin and omnicef), I will take the side effects. I am about half way finished with my 10 day dosage, it is a very strong antibiotic and high dosage. But overall, I'm satisfied as long as I am feeling better and kicking this crud I have had!

1	chest and sinus infection	I went to the walk-in because it is the holiday season and my family dr. was not working. Was prescribed biaxin xl. 500 mg. 2 tablets once per day. I am going to stop the medication today and go to my family dr. because I have not slept in three nights! I am a very sound sleeper and this has never happened to me before. I have the most awful taste in my mouth and pain in my stomach and around the kidneys. The cough seems to be drying up but the nausea is making me feel as though I am pregnant. I threw up from the nausea on the first night. I detest this medicine and will never take it again. Hopefully I will be able to sleep tonight after I get something else for this infection. It's 4:45 in the morning and I am wide awake! I went online to see if insomnia is a side effect of biaxcin xl and am so glad to know I am not the only one experiencing similar side effects.	Will NEVER take biaxcin xl ever again.	F	42	3  days500 mg 1X D	12/28/2012
2	Bronchitis	Metallic taste in mouth, BLOATING, gas, diarrhea, headache, intermittent racing pulse	I have a tendency to get bronchitis 3x per year - usually results from a cold, or sinus infection. I've taken this before and vaguely remember the side effects, but I instinctively knew this medicine would make me feel yucky. With this prescription I took a round of prednisone, and had some cough syrup. I finished the prednisone, only took the cough syrup as needed, and took 9 days of a 10 day dose of Biaxin XL. I can't stand the distended belly, gas, diarrhea and the general discomfort all over my body-- it's UNBEARABLE!! so I quit taking it yesterday and I am STILL waiting for my belly to return to it's normal state!!	F	48	9  days 1X D	9/4/2012
5	Chronic Bronchitis	Metallic taste in mouth.  I get this every time I use this antibiotic,  but other than that,  nothing.  It works like a charm for me.		F	35	7  days500mgs 2X D	7/12/2012Email
1	Infection in the Lungs	Awful Taste in my mouth, White Foam when I wake up in the morning, severe chest pains, severe stomach pains, and I have become a Snapping Turtle, This drug affects Anxiety Medications.	I am leaning towards suing the makers of Biaxin XL in a class action lawsuit or I wonder if their is a lawsuit against the makers already.	M	31	4  days1000mg 2X D	7/2/2012Email
5	Bronchitis	Has cured me twice with no side effects.	My respiratory system can be likened to my achilles heel. When my body comes down with a chest cold the liklihood of developing bronchitis is very high regardless of what I do to curb the sickness. My body seems to produce an uncommonly high amount of mucus making my lungs feel as though they are heavy filled with glue. I've taken Biaxin XL twice for bronchitis and experienced positive results with no side effects. On a side note the doctor also prescribed 'liquid expectorant' to help clear my stubborn mucus.	M	26	7  days500 2X D	6/1/2012
3	Respiratory infection	Loss of appetite; wild dreams; lack of energy	Half way through the 10 day course. I can bear the effects if they don't get worse than now, but it's not pleasant.	M	54	10  days500 MG 2X D	5/12/2012Email
1	Bronchtis	Very bad heart palipitations.  Feeling almost out of body at timesToo wired to sleep	The heart palipitations are the worst.  I do have WPW which is a heart condition so I asked both the doctor and pharmacist if this medication was ok for me and they both said there is a slight, low risk of heart racing.   Mine is beating hard like a drum.  I stopped afer 2 days.  I wonder how long it will take to get out of my system.  A scarey thing to say the least	F	32	2  days 2X D	4/13/2012Email
1	Chest infection	Biaxin causes my heart rate to go up, and my blood pressure is up. I think I have my throat swollen as well. I am also taking aerius (allergy pill) with it. I do not think I can take the last dosage. The side effects are just too much!		F	35	6  days500x2	4/9/2012
1	Sinus infection	Horrible anxiety, racing pulse, depression, uncontrollable thoughts, problems sleeping, could not calm myself down, constantly nervous, shaking hands, confusion, dizziness, trouble focusing	Taking this drug was honestly the most terrifying experience in my life. I have absolutely no record of previous mental illness or instability, but this literally made me feel as though I was going insane. I called the pharmacist and he claimed there was no reason it should cause anxiety or anything of the sort but I can assure you it did. I was only on the pills for two days, but I also cut up the pills the first day since I have trouble taking large pills which may have put it into my system a lot faster. Last night was absolutely terrible, I could not calm myself down I was convinced I was going crazy and I did not feel like myself at all. My heart was racing because I was so terrified, I could not control my thoughts or calm down for a second. It was impossible to sleep until finally I was just so exhausted that I passed out. It persisted until the next day (today). When I went to class I could not focus on what the profs were saying, I felt totally out of it and just could not slow down my mind. I would describe it as a numb feeling, I wasn't happy nor sad, just scared out of my mind. I thought I was having a mental breakdown. I've never in my life experienced anything remotely like this. It was the most terrifying experience ever. The second I got home I flushed those pills down the toilet. I would way rather have a sinus infection than risk feeling this way again. I had been taking the pills around 12 pm each day, and obviously skipped today and am already feeling a lo	F	19	10  days500 MG 2X D	3/5/2012Email
1	Sinus infection	Racing heart, metallic taste, anxiety, major insomnia and then manic dreams when I could sleep. No history of mental illness, but symptoms bloomed with the BIAXIN XL and then went away after the drug was flushed out of my system. I stopped taking it after 5 days - thank goodness. It was scary.   		DON'T TAKE THIS DRUG!!!  The adverse side effects are VERY serious. It is NOT worth it. Note: The adverse side effects of BIAXIN XL may be WORSE than the adverse side effects of the regular BIAXIN.   		M	40	10  days500 2X D	2/28/2012
3	Sinus infection	Okay, I commented yesterday saying NO side effects. This is the first time I am having side effects on this medication. I DO have a metal taste in my mouth, insomnia and heart racing a bit. I have 7 days left however, I might stop this after 7 days instead of 10.		F	35	10  days500 2X D	2/16/2012
1	Sinus Infectio	Severe nightmares, anxiety, and racing thoughts.	DANGEROUS DRUG.  DO NOT TAKE IT!!!  It will build up in your system.Check out similar comments here regarding adverse effects of BIAXIN, in addition to adverse effects of BIAXIN XL.	M	35	10  days500 mg 2X D	1/24/2012
5	sinus and ear infecttion	First day was diarreah and stomach cramps.  Now it's just horrible gas, makes me fart a lot, and bad taste in my mouth.  But I am farting all day long,  constant.  It's wild,  but it really helps clear my infections		F	38	10  days500 mg 2X D	11/27/2011Email
1	sinus Infection	Racing thoughts, anxiety, tremors, insomnia, suicidal thoughts	Awful experience on this antibiotic. I have no history of depression or anxiety. Once I stopped taking the medicine the above side effects went away.	F	24	3  days500 1X D	11/27/2011Email
2	Bronchitis and Pneumonia	Awful taste, severe headache not relieved by Ibuprofen (feels like someone is crushing my ears together), nausea, loose stools, loss of appetite, loss of touch with reality, panic and anxiety, vivid nightmares, uncontrollable crying	I rated this drug a 2 because I can tell it is kicking the infection but the side effects for me are unbearable. I already suffered from depression & anxiety prior to taking this medication but those issues were stabilized.  Now I'm in a mess and wondering when the effects of this medication will wear off.  I'm sharing my experience not to keep someone from taking the medication but just to tell an honest rating.  If you suffer from a mood disorder or BP and take a SSRI, you might want to discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist prior to taking this drug.	F	32	3  days1000 MG 1X D	9/21/2011
3	chronic sinusitis	Slight nausea, gas and loose stools, dizziness, confusion, anxiety, increased heartrate, headache, insomnia, vivid dreams, metallic taste in mouth, hungry constantly (holy hunger pangs, Batman!), and extremely thirsty.	With corticosteroidal nasal spray, seems to be resolving the sinusitus -- it's nice to be able to breathe again!  The side effects almost make it not worth it, though.  Because it reduces productivity (a lot!) during the day, and causes insomnia, I take it in the mid to late afternoon.  I can get enough done earlier in the day, and the sleep-related side effects are somewhat mitigated by the delay between taking it and trying to sleep.	F	29	10  days1000 1X D	4/6/2011Email
1	sinus infection	insomnia, racing thoughts, anxiety, manic dreams, metallic taste, nausea - DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!  (Note: I have NO history of mental illness!  Once the drug cleared out of my system, I was fine.)	BIAXIN XL IS A VERY DANGEROUS DRUG!  PLEASE DO NOT TAKE IT!  REVIEW ALL OF THE POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS AND DON'T EVEN START TAKING THIS DRUG; IT IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE RISK, NO MATTER WHAT IT WAS PRESCRIBED FOR.If you research this drug, you will discover other people have had horrible side effects like I did.  It is very potent and not all doctors and pharmacists are aware of the tragic side effects.  It was a totally horrifying experience being on this drug.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.  YOU MAY HAVE DANGEROUS SIDE EFFECTS.	F	40	5  days 1X D	4/6/2011

F	25	7  days1000mg day 1X D	2/6/2011Email
4	Bronchitis	Stomach upset, diarrhea, and a little cramping, little dizziness	The DR prescribed this medication, for early set bronchitis, IT WORKED VERY WELL!! Have I not taken this drug I probably would've been in the hospital with severe bronchitis. This drug helped me within the first 24 hours of taking it! Also, I am on a low dose of Xanax I take at night before I go to bed for some minor anxiety, and trouble sleeping. I didn't get any nervousness, or psychotic thoughts while using this drug. This drug is a Godsend for people with chronic asthma and bronchitis.	F	33	5  days500 2X D	1/31/2011
1	sinus infection	THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS DRUG.  DO NOT TAKE IT!  PERIOD.  IT CAUSED NASTY SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING WILD DREAMS, DISTURBED SLEEP, AND SYMPTOMS SIMILAR TO MANIC BEHAVIOR.  (I HAVE NO HISTORY OF ANY MENTAL ILLNESS.  OTHERS HAVE HAD SIMILAR SIDE EFFECTS, WITH NO HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS.)  THE BIAXIN XL SEEMS TO BE THE WORST, WITH LESS SIDE EFFECTS FROM REGULAR BIAXIN.  NO INFECTION IS WORTH THE RISK OF THESE SIDE EFFECTS.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.  IF YOUR DOCTOR IS CASUAL ABOUT PRESCRIBING IT, FIND A NEW DOCTOR.		F	42	  1X D	1/27/2011
2	Bronchitis	On the first 2 days I experienced severe headaches. I was told to stop taking the drug for a couple of days. However, I didn't want my infection to get worse so on the morning of day 4 I decided to cut my dose in 1/2 from 2 tablets a dose to 1 tablet and within 2 hours I started having neck pain and muscle discomfort which lasted over 24 hours.	I think this drug should be taken off the market. I was told by my physician to stop taking the medicine and was prescribed another antibiotic.	F	38	7  days500 MG 2X D	1/20/2011
5	Chronic Bronchitis with Asthma	Slight nausea and loss of appetite, slight diarrhea and stomach cramp right after I take the medication.	I have taken this drug 3 times (for three different exacerbations of bronchitis due to a cold or flu). It worked well and I felt better after a day or two but followed the doctor's orders and took it each time for the full 10 days. I didn't feel much like eating and was slightly nauceous but that could be from the illness. I have a chronic problem with asthma/COPD and when I get sick, my doctor pulls out 'the big guns'. He usually gives me prednisone as well but didn't this time, as taking a steroid continually has serious side effects. I read all the horror stories but Biaxin just helps me. I always sleep well. I did have a strange dream but big deal, who is to say the drug caused that? I always drink buttermilk with this medication to try to maintain the normal flora of the digestive system and eat a bigger breakfast than usual to keep the nausea to a minimum. Maybe the people who wrote the horror stories are either sensitive to this drug or downright allergic. It has helped me 3 times so far, I trust my doctor to give me the appropriate drug and my side effects are no worse than when I take any antibiotic and most of those don't help me.	F	57	10  days1000mg 1X D	1/16/2011
3	strep throat	AWFUL BITTER TASTE IN MY MOUTH, WEIRD THOUGHTS WHILE SLEEPING	I stopped taking this drug after the 5th day even though I was supposed to take it for 10 days.  I had a horrible sore throat and couldn't swallow and it definitely got rid of it in one day but I had weird thoughts at night, depression and cramps with diarea, I would never take this drug again.  The worst was the bad taste, I couldn't brush it away with toothpaste.  I had never taken this drug before as I had usually been prescribed amoxacilin.	M	41	5  days 1X D	4/28/2010
1	Sinus Infection	Insomnia (Did not sleep at all for 42 hours), anxiety, paranoia, auditory & visual hallucinations, increased blood pressure & heart rate (heart rate nearly doubled), heart palpitations, myalgia (aches & pains), headaches, severe nausea, dehydration, abdominal pain, gas, metallic taste, tremors, and fatigue.	First off, I should mention that I currently take Remeron as an antidepressant, and both Clonazepam and Seroquel to control anxiety disorder.I know that a lot of antibiotics cause nausea, vomiting, flu like symptom etc., but what I went through while taking Biaxin XL for only 48 hours was pretty scary. I eventually called health link after being awake for about 36 hours and was told to discontinue using the product. The health link worker then transferred me to a pharmacist who transferred me to Poison Control who suggested I go to the ER. I instead discontinued use of product and began to feel better. Neither my doctor or pharmacist, nor the people at health link claimed to have ever heard of these types of symptoms, yet here we are with hundreds of posts by people who have experienced similar symptoms. It felt very similar to being on a stimulant, such as cocaine or speed, and Wikipedia (take it for what it's worth) claimed that the drug could even cause false positives for cocaine tests. I was prescribed Biaxin XL 500mg for 10 days, but discontinued after 48 hrs (4 pills) because of how it was affecting me and because of the advice of the people I spoke with at the time.I don't want to sound like an alarmist, and from what I have been able to undercover the majority of people do not experience the types of symptoms I, and others here have listed, but I do find it alarming that insomnia is not listed as a side effect. Would NOT recommend.	M	25	2  days500 MG 2X D	4/10/2010
1	Sinus Infection	Metallic taste in mouth, bad stomach cramps, burning sensation in stomach, nausea, flatulence, hunger pangs.	I was prescribed Biaxin for a sinus infection.  Be warned...it is potent!!  I was advised to take it on a full stomach to aleviate any gasto side effects....but after taking only 2 pills I was already doubled over with the worst stomach cramps ever.  My stomach burned like it was on fire; it felt like the drug was eating my stomach from the inside out. I was unable to sleep much of the night due to the cramps and bad gas.  My husband couldn't believe the sounds coming from my gut. I was supposed to take it for 14 days, but decided right away to stop for fear of worse side effects to come. I have never reacted this way to any drug in my life!  Despite only taking those two pills, I still felt sick to my stomach all day today, was unable to eat, and am still suffering from gas and cramps.  I will never take this drug again; the side effects are not worth the cure.	F	34	1  days500 2X D	3/8/2010
4	pneumonia and sinusitis	Effectively got rid of the pneumonia and other infections but the god...the diarrhea! Every damn 5 minutes I had to evacuate. Next time i'm buying Immodium with it.		M	27	7  days1000mg 1X D	2/18/2010
1	brochitis	This drug is awful. It gave me a horrible taste in my mouth and stomach ache. I always felt like I was hungry, but I didn't want to eat anything. Also, I always felt jittery and disoriented. My heart rate increased and I often got sweaty for no apparent reason. Dizziness and uncoordination were some of the other side effects.	This drug is the worst. I have never had a bad reaction to medication and this one did a number on me. I was prescribed 2 tablets once per day for five days. I quit on day 3. I just couldn't take it anymore. Stay away from this horrible drug.	M	42	3  days	11/28/2009Email
1	Bronchitis	Ringing ears, pounding heart, anxiety, panic attacks, crying and depeession.	This med made me feel like I was going insane I do not have a history of depression or anxiety worst experience of my life.	F	22	3  days	11/4/2009Email
2	sinus infection	NASTY taste in mouth which worsened upon coughing, dry mouth, trouble sleeping-frequent waking at night, vivid dreams, lethargy, loss of appetite, stomach pains, headache   (?sinus vs. med?),	Not feeling much better - but sinus pressure lessened- started  the med 3 days ago.  Can only  lay in bed and watch tv. Can't even focus on reading. Side effects becoming intolerable. Part of me wants to stick with it; don't think I've ever stopped an antibiotic mid-course, but just called my regular Dr. to see about switching (got the med from an after-hrs clinic).	F	45	3  days	9/29/2009
5	sinus infection	did not mix with crestor, so had to stop since I was getting terrible muscle pain, once I stopped crestor temporarily, muscle pain subsided	have used for all my sinus infections and works very well	M	55	21  days	8/18/2009

3	Bronchitis	Naseau, Diahrrea, head-ache	I had to sleep like 12 hours a night or else i was dead tired all day while on this. It made my throat and sinus feel better after a few days.	M	23	10  days	4/10/2009
3	Strep throat	My appetite has been poor, but every time I do eat, I immediately have diarrhea. My stomach is upset, mostly a nauseous feeling. I've had some dizziness. No nightmares or bad taste in my mouth, though - yay!	This is day 8 of 10 for me. I've been taking 2 500mg pills a day. My infection is gone, but I don't think I'll take the last two doses; my stomach has felt so yucky and I don't think I can take it anymore. I thought these were just residual feelings from the original illness, but after doing some research I'm sure it's the medicine.	F	30	8  days	3/16/2009
2	Sinus Infection	Hunger pains, awful taste in mouth, dizziness, faintness, abdominal pain, chills, excruciating head ache, diarrhea, nausea & vomiting.	Day 2 on the medication I started to really feel awful. I was light headed, nauseous and dizzy and was experiencing terrible hunger pains even when I was full. Not to mention the disgusting taste this medication leaves in your mouth. 2 Hours after my 3rd dose I had extreme abdominal pains which lead to diarrhea and then vomiting. Only after I threw up everything possible in my stomach did I feel better. I have discontinued and will never take this drug again.	F	27	3  days	3/3/2009
4	Sinus infection	Some unpleasant taste.Restless light sleep during first 2 days.All else good.	Taken during meals in the evening.I ate probiotic yogourt twice daily and drank lots of water.Began to feel better within 24 hours of starting and every day thereafter.I found some of the comments here to be very alarming and was somewhat aprehensive about taking Biaxin.I believe the yogourt and water helped immensely in keeping most of my systems up and running during Biaxin's bacteria massacre.

1	Chest Infection	Mental and Physical.  Tremors, Psychosis, severe generalized anxiety.  It took a very long time to recover from my reaction.	another website for information and to share your story is antibioticawareness.com	F	34	3  days	2/7/2009Email
4	acute bronchitis	Bad taste in mouth, waking up to pee a lot. Some intestinal cramping when I don't eat enough of a meal with it. 10 days 500 (8 so far)Taken with Methylprednisolone for 6 days. Prescribed inhaler and cough medicine but didn't need them.	Sure bad taste, peeing and wooziness are bad but I was sick for 3+ months with serious bronchial infection that was deceptive -- went away -- came back -- but always worse. It racheted up to the point I collapsed in the street, had heart palpitations, could NOT breathe (try that for discomfort and embarassment).  I cannot take penicillin. I had tried Azithromcin 250 for 5 days at the outset of this mess. I did not take care of myself (seems to be a modern thing to never be sick in bed).At least this drug has so far kicked out whatever was in my lungs. I can climb a flight of stairs and not worry about gasping and passing out at the top of them.	F	56	8  days	1/7/2009
5	Sinus Infection	Very little stomach discomfort - take on full stomach. I have been taking it for 11 years as I develop sinus infections flying or in the office environment. By the 3rd day I feel great. The generic brand gave me a very bad reaction - be careful if you are prescried that stuff. I have had very good luck with the 2x 500 doses per day!!!	I woke up Monday with lots of sinus draniage, sore throat, ear plugged - had 3 500's left from last time. Took one every 12 hours - going to the doc this afternoon for another 2 week supply until it clears. God bless this stuff. I am allergic to everything else.	M	53	3  days	10/1/2008
1	tonsilitis	psychosis schitzophrenia, insomnia, halusinations, hearing voices, sweating, chalky taste in mouth,	do not take this medication, if your prescribed this drug RUN SCREAMING...	M	17	5  days	9/27/2008Email
4	Strep Pyogenes(pharynigits)	Not great taste in my mouth but just rinsing with water mixed with salt and baking soda help get rid of that and soothe my throat.  I feel very lethargic but no worse than I felt when I wasn't on the pills!	Cleared up my painful canker sore after first day! I was quite happy.  I like the smell and taste (smell like rockets or vanilla)!   I found it odd that the doctor gave me chlarithromycin considering I had no allergies to B-lactam antibiotics.  A cheaper medication would have been ampicillin but Oh well.	F	21	7  days	7/21/2008
1	chest infection		Go to www.lawyersandsettlements.com to lodge a complaint.  The mental effects of this drug nearly destroyed my life.  And it didn't take just a few days to recover.  It took nearly a year.  You are not crazy if you are having severe anxiety and mental issues.  It's this drug.	F	34	3  days	7/17/2008
4	Lung infection ans sinus infection	My husban and i where both on this med at the same time, we both had upset stomacks and hot/cold flashes, difficulty eathing and had gas more then usual.  My husban kept telling me it was the meds but i didn't belive him till i read this site. He tryed taking half in the Am then the other in the PM it didn't help.	Both of are infections are gone but the empty gut feeling is still there 2 days after the meds are done.  My husban feels better and is able to breath better but in the end he's not a pill person and i don't think after this he'll be willing to do it again.	F	28	10  days	3/25/2008
1	strep throat	DISCUSTING taste in my mouth.  Nightmares (actually dreamed I was being poisoned...probably because the stuff leaves that taste in your mouth).Very light headed and jittery.Mild stomach upset.Looking for an alternative to treat my strep...I WILL NOT TAKE BIAXIN AGAIN.		F	33	1  days	3/20/2008
4	sinus / respiratory infection	metallic taste in mouth, extremely mild loss of taste, mild nausea day one, groggy/drowsy feeling.	This is one of the most powerful antibiotics out there and consistently rely on it to get me through those tough infections.. however it does really suck.  The metallic taste in my mouth is REALLY annoying, but not enough to make me want to stop taking this stuff.  I do get a little groggy and tired but..all in all, i felt better within 2 doses of this medicine and it has worked great for me consistently.  I have never experienced any of the other symptoms these people write about.  i also ALWAYS take with a full meal.	F	32	4  days	3/9/2008
4	chest/sinus infection	I have a HORRIBLE taste in my mouth.  Hopefully it will go away as soon as I'm finished!  I can't fall asleep at night and when I do, I have very vivid dreams.  I'm also experiencing drowsiness, but I feel like someone has propped my eyes open with tooth picks.  It's strange.  I feel wired and tired all at the same time.	seems to be helping my congestion	F	31	7  days	2/25/2008
4	Sinus infection	Some stomach discomfort. First time i took the pills i didnt ate enough. Today is the 2nd day and i ate a lot more, but i have to keep eating all day or i'm getting nausea. In fact, it's pretty strange but i'm always hungry with this stuff. Losse stools also here. This drugs makes me dizzy/lightheaded. Use of alcohol seems to have no interaction. Metallic taste also.	It seems to work. I anticipated side effects, but after 2 days, i feel a lot better overall. Will post again if something bad happens. Prescription is biaxin xl 2*500mg once a day.	M	27	2  days	2/3/2008
5	sinus infection	Taking 500 mg 2X per day.  Side effects very minor - some difficulty getting to sleep, long vivid but not unpleasant dreams (hadn't thought about that girl in high school in a long time), seemed to get a good flush of the lower GI but nothing out of control.  Cannot take flouroquinolones without going totally crazy and miserable for months, and for me, this was perfect.	Sinus infection had probably been occurring for 2 weeks before taking medication.  Within 1st 24 hours, discharge from sinus was massive (dark mucus and blood) with hard nose blowing, lasted about two days, and felt totally clear.  Accompanying nagging cough went away as quickly.  I will not take anything else if this happens again (although I will get treatment earlier).	M	55	7  days	1/8/2008Email
1	Bronchitis and Sinus Infection	Very fatigued.  Zombie like.  Shaky almost dizzy.  So sleepy that I couldn't stay awake, but then at night I would wake up every 30 minutes to every hour just shaking.  Also, diarrhea on the 6th day.	This drug is not one that I will ever take again.  My sinus infection/coughing is not gone after 6 days of 1000 mg.  I have felt shaky, jittery, sleepy, zombie like for the entire time.  I have not slept well even though I can't hold my eyes open.  I do not have the metallic taste, but I just feel very fatigued.  It bothered me so much that I found this web site and felt much better knowing that I wasn't the only person that felt this way.  I will NEVER take this medicine again.  On day 6 after all of these side effects, I now have had diarrhea 4 times and feel sick to my stomach.  Never take this medicine!  Most medicines do not bother me, but this one has!	F	36	6  days	1/2/2008
5	sinus infection	the metallic taste and abdominal pains.	This is the 2nd time I've taken Biaxin XL...both times for sinus infections.  This time I requested my Dr. to prescribe it!! Everybody gives it a low rating...but honestly, it takes care of the infection. The other side effects I know about and can live with.	F	60	3  days	12/21/2007Email
5	Sinus Infection	Metallic Taste (but not bothersome)And VERY VERY VERY happy happy happy moods while on Biaxin XL.Each and everytime I am prescribed Biaxin XL, the second day on it, I get suddenly very giggly, happy and euphoric! I love this drug so much! Its too bad I dont get sinus or ear infections any longer since I had Gallbladder surgery (stomach issues are related to ear and sinus infections)cause Id love to have some happy Biaxin!	LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!	F	40	14  days	11/16/2007

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011

4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.

3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR.

5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

2	depression	WEIGHT GAIN! I couldnt concentrate hardly at all, increased appetite, lethargic.	I hated the inability to concentrate.	M	27	4  months10 1X D	6/27/2010

3	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Anxiety, can't stop moving legs, incontinence, change of voice tone.  I am taking seroquel as well at nights to help me sleep.		F	44	1.5  years30 1X D	6/20/2010
5	GAD & Depression	Uncontrollable appettite with accompanying weight gain.	It helps.	M	42	8  months50 mg 1X D	6/15/2010
4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
4	BIPOLAR 2	Severe Hiccups, lasted for 3 days.  Nausea, severe burping, felt like I was going to throw up, lasted for a week.  Slight mania, abbreviated sleep cycles, still having these.  I feel the side effects are worth it because of how well it keeps me from short cycling, which causes way more problems in my life than a little Nausea		M	36	8  weeks15 MG 1X D	6/2/2010
2	Bi-Polar	Lethargic, Weight Gain and Depression has gotten worse.  I want to be taken off this medication.  Having indecisiveness (more than usual) and my OCD has increased.  Not seeing many benefits after being on Abilify for 2 months.  Feeling sadness daily and lack of energy.  Seems to slow me down to a sad halt.		F	53	2  months10MG 1X D	5/29/2010
2	bipolar 2	sleepiness or death tired during the afternoon even after 9 months of taking this med also i'm waking up in the middle of the night; also i decided because of the drowsiness i would go off of this cold turkey- bad decision because he had sweats, nausea and severe headache.....	the doctor wants me to stay on this but the daytime drowsiness is ruining my life and the nighttime waking is too much	F	50	9  months2mg 1X D	5/29/2010
