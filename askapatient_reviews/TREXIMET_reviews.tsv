5	Migraine Headaches	Achy body, sensitivity to hot water, a tingling throughout my body - feels like the medicine is working/generating through my body, and exhaustion - but I think the migraine just takes so much out of me that I'm exhausted by the time it's over. Also upset stomach if I don't eat a little something with taking it.	TREXIMET has been a life saver for me! I get migraines so bad and nothing touches them aside from taking Treximet and I used to use Imitrex, did not work as well for me; so I was thrilled with the results I had from Treximet. Some of the side effects can seem overwhelming but, for me the benefit of migraine relief is so worth it and I feel they are minimal in comparison to the migraine itself.

1	Migraines	Hallucinations, Nausea, uncontrollable muscle spasms in limbs, fingers, toes.	The side effects I listed lasted for more than 12 hours after taking this medicine.	M	15	1  days500 mg 1X D	2/14/2012Email
5	Migraines	Jaw pain, moderate nausea if I take it without eating.	For me, this is truly a wonder drug. It completely knocks out migraines within an hour or so of taking it, and keeps them away for about 24 hours.	F	26	  1X D	12/21/2011Email
3	migraines	all over achy "flu like" worsened nausea, swollen glands in neck, sore throat	this takes away my migraines, but I find the side effects often worse than the migraine itself. I take it still because it is much better than spending days in bed with a headache	F	30	6  months 1X AN	10/23/2011Email
5	Migraines	Moderate nausea for ~ 2 hours after taking, aching jaw	This medicine is FANTASTIC. I've been having migraines for the last five years, and this is the first drug that's really worked for me. A+	F	25	2  months 1X AN	6/6/2011Email
5	Migraines	I cut mine in half due to the side effects from the imitrex. I take the half of pill then lay down and take a nap, when I awake the migraine is gone. I usually take motrin when I get a headache but with this I can't so I try tylenol first then this. Cuts down on the tightness in my limbs I feel from the imitrex.		F	30	1  years 3X M	1/5/2011Email
2	Migraines	Cold sweat, vibrating arms, stomach ache	With in 30 minutes of taking this I started to sweat and my arms shook and my stomach hurt. Headache was gone but came back four hours later. I wont take this again. Dr gave me a sample of Maxalt will try that with next headache.	F	31	1  days500mg 1X D	10/17/2010
5	to reduce migrainess		too expensive!  Not that much better than imitrex.  Wish they would come out with a nasal spray	M	64	1  years 1X D	7/10/2010Email
5	migraines		seems to relieve most of my migraines using just 1 dose...  often with other triptans (Relpax & Maxalt), the headache would return the next day, but Treximet gives me better results (it is sumatriptan combined with naproxen)	F	58	1  years1 pill 1X AN	6/30/2010
5	Migraines caused by sinus infection	Small feeling of nausea	This medicine worked extrememly well, and my migraines were gone within 2 hours of taking the pill. I would advise taking the pill with phenergan to combat any nausea you may feel. But the medicine WORKS!	M	27	4  days 1X AN	3/4/2010
5	migraine	None	I have tried various medications for migraine over the past 35 years, including Fiorinal and Imitrex.  A neurologist (and fellow migraine sufferer himself)recently recommended Treximet to me, when I complained that other medications had left me feeling spacey for approximately 12 - 16 hours after they had stopped my migraine pain.  Treximet is the first and only migraine medication I've ever tried that not only relieves my pain, but also leaves me with no lingering "post-migraine" after-effects.

5	migraines	Depending on the time of day and if I have eaten, I can feel dopey and out of it and have trouble putting words to my thoughts.  This isn't really a side effect, but I can feel the medicine working...I get this flooding feeling across my chest (like the blood is working over time).	This medicine has been a lifesaver.  I have tried A LOT of things for my migraines and this has been the only one that totally knocks them out (and doesn't totally knock ME out).  Axert also worked, but Treximet is much faster (not instant, but faster).  I had tried Imitrex before and it didn't work at all, but this particular coupling of medicines (Imitrex and naproxen) to make Treximet, works for me.  I am not sure what I would do without this medicine.	F	30	1  years500 MG 1X AN	2/4/2010
5	migraine	A bit sedating.	Treximet works better than any other triptan I have used. I have never had to use a second dose.	F	36	4  months	9/10/2009
