ACANYA	5	Clear acne caused by staph.	Mild flaking, too much turned my skin pink (I learned that lesson the hard way). CLEARER SKIN!!!	Basically, the drug is wonderful. I kept breaking out from a staph infection that wouldn't go away. When my skin finally healed, my doc told me to apply this every morning (I do night instead)to prevent this from happening again and my skin looks much better. Even though it worked instantly for me, I'd be patient and give it a few months.	F	21	2  months 1X D	11/30/2010
