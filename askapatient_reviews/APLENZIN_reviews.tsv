2	Depression	None	This medication made my depression worse. My doctor added it on to Pristiq. I have since added Zoloft to the Pristiq and feel great!	F	47	30  days378mg 1X D	2/24/2011Email
4	Depression	mild-to-moderate insomnia, slight nausea for the first few days, flashes of irritability for the first week, then subsided.	I first tried Wellbutrin as a teen in an inpatient hospital 20 years ago (serious, chronic depression), and it worked wonderfully. Over the years I would go back to it now and then when the depression welled up again. About 4 years ago I had serious side-effects from generic Wellbutrin, and was unable to afford non-generic. Fast forward to now...I read about Aplenzin as being a "tailored" version of Wellbutrin - so (now that I have good insurance) I wanted to give it a try. I have to say that this medication has almost ZERO side effects - I'm so pleased with the results! I started really feeling better two weeks into treatment, so I'll continue with the 174 mg. dose.

4	chronic depression	loss of appetite, decreased sex drive, still feel depressed sometimes, but it seems to pass more quickly w/this medication than others I've tried	This med was tried in desperation because I haven't had much luck w/antidepressants over the years.  I also have rheumatoid arthritis & ankylosing spondilitis so there are those meds to add to the mix.	F	50	10  months522mg 1X D	10/3/2010Email
3	for depression	None that I know of.	I'm unsure of whether it is helping or not but if I have to say one way or another I'd say it's helping. I'm still somewhat depressed at times. Other times, not so much. (I'm also taking 10mg of Lexapro every day)	M	60	1  years348 MG 1X D	9/19/2010
5	Depression	No side effects	My 15 year old was put on aplenzin after trying several other medications. This has worked wonders!! He is a different child. Highly rec.	M	15	3  months378mg 1X D	6/22/2010Email
5	depression	weight loss	yep, that's right. I actually started loosing weight! Not only do I feel soooo much better (more energy, happier, not as moody)but I lost like 15 lbs. wierd. good wierd.Even if I didn't have the added weight loss joy - the drug itself has greatly improved my life. I've tried other drugs. This one worked for me :)I don't know if I'll ever try to stop taking it (if I did, my husband would probably slip it into my coffee!)	M	44	9  months348 1X D	4/22/2010
