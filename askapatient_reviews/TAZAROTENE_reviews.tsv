The purge was the wildest thing that's ever happened to my skin! You would not believe what came out of my pores...flat greasy flakes came out of my pores - they were so big, I didn't see how they would fit coming out of a pore. I even had fluffy flakes, dried white heads and these strange, amber colored, flat 'crystals'. They looked more like thin sheets of amber glass coming out.		F	58	4  months 1X D	3/4/2012Email

5	Acne	Peeling, Redness, purging	Tazorac is taz-o-riffic. You may notice that I have only been on this medication for 1.5 weeks but that is just this time around. ( I will update this as the journey continues) When I was in junior high, the derm. prescribed me Tazorac as a last step before accutane. This was actually before the cream had come out so my skin went through extreme peeling and purging. After the purging was complete, I basically would have layers of skin falling off my face. I won't lie, this was incredibly embarrassing in junior high but it didn't last forever. Initially I was using the gel every night but because of the peeling my derm. suggested I only put it on for 15 minutes then wash it off. This reduced the peeling and redness greatly and seemed to work great on my acne. When the cream came out, I switched to that and was able to leave it on all night with little to no peeling. This stuff saved me. I survived the peeling, redness, and breakouts and returned in the 8th grade to people complementing me left and right. I literally had a girl run up to me to tell me how great my skin looked- Man, that was awesome. I went off Tazorac because I was convinced it was having a bleaching effect on my face. I had a tan body and pale face.  I have never experienced acne so bad as I have been in the past 6 months. I went off birth control and my skin has had a hell of a time adjusting. I'm 23 now and perhaps this is Adult acne but it is painful, huge, and takes forever to go away. I have even missed c	F	23	1.5  weeks1% 1X D	8/23/2011Email
5	Acne	I'm an aesthetician who has been on Tazorac 0.05 for about a year.  I use it every other night.  I have found that the key to success with Tazorac is combining it with the right skin care products.  I use Obagi Clenziderm Step 1 ( for oily skin with 2% salicylic acid) and Step 2 (Pore Therapy with 2% salicylic acid) twice a day along with my Tazorac 0.05 every other night.  What my saving grace has been is a product called Cicalfate by Avene.  Originally a post laser product, Cicalfate is gentle enough to apply to bleeding, oozing skin (sometimes caused by a CO2 laser treatment) and has soothed my skin nightly.  It really keeps the side effects of Tazorac at a next-to-nothing level.  Here's the kicker -- I'm a dry, sensitive skin type who is very acne prone.  All of these products are strong but are very tolerable with the use of Cicalfate, which by the way, is pretty inexpensive.  Only $24 retail!  Good luck to everyone on Tazorac.

4	Bad breakout	Bad initial break out, greasy/oily skin	I've always had pimples here and there but a few months ago my skin turned it worse it has ever been. I was on differen prior to this that my doctor had gave me but this made my skin worse. So I went to the dermatologist and he prescribed tazorac to me. I'm also taking clindamycin and minocycline.  The 2nd week on this product I had the worse breakout I have ever had. I couldn't believe it and hated looking in the mirror! I was so discouraged so I called my doctor to tell him I was stopping the product. He told me that this is what the product is suppose to do and he told me to continue using it. So I did. And let me tell you it has actually been worth it. It has been about 7 weeks and my skin is so much better than before. My skin is finally starting to feel like it use to be. I do have a lot of scarring now because I picked but they will eventually fade or makeup works fine. But you have to be very patient with tazorac. And it will get worse before better..but it's worth it!	F	22	7  weeks 1X D	5/5/2011Email
3	Acne/Pore Minimizer	Dry Flakey Skin, Very dry lips!	I started using this product back in November.  I have a friend who is 42 years old and has the most beautiful skin!  She uses a similar product called Retin A (I'm sure you've heard of it).  When I went to the derm, she suggested I try the Taz.I have very large pores, and have had mild to moderate acne since I was about 13.The moisturizer used first makes the product less harsh.  I started out using it, as directed(pea sized amt) for the first 2 months, about 3 times a week.My friend suggested I go full speed ahead and use it 5 days a week (minimum).  I thought she was nuts but at first, I'm not gonna lie...it was rough.  My skin was blotchy, flakey, and not pretty.  I covered it as much as I could with makeup but sometimes that made it look worse.My suggestion is to wash your face at night, put a small amt of moisturizer on (the suggestions here for Cereve are correct...it is a good moisturizer!).  Wait about 15 mins, and then apply your pea sized amt of Taz.  I do this Monday night-Friday night.  I give myself a break Sat and Sun night.  I think my fine lines around my eyes are going away too.  People will suggest you stay away from the corners of your nose, and the 'puppet lines' (the lines from the corners of your nose down to the corner of your lips), but these are the areas that need it to...so i say....suck it up and give it a chance.  I'm 3 months in, and I'm just starting to see results.	F	35	3  months 1X D	3/22/2011
2	Acne	Burning, itching, peeling, severe soreness (tenderness) of skin	I started using Tazorac on January 7th, it is currently March 8th. Over all, I'm not sure if I would recommend this drug. It hasn't did much to clear up my acne at all so far. I started by using BP pads on my face at night followed by a moisturizer and then the Taz. When I was doing this regime, I didn't have any harsh side effects, however, I was getting absolutely no results either. Then, I eliminated the moisturizer and was just applying the Taz after the BP pads. This actually started working better for my skin and I noticed the peeling but my acne was slightly getting better..minimally. However, I've been doing this for about a week and a half now and my face hurts so bad! I can't touch my face without it burning and hurting really bad. I just washed my face and it was stinging so bad that I think I'm going to skip the Taz and BP pads tonight. I just applied a lot of moisturizer and hopefully it will feel better soon. I read that you should apply moisturizer before applying Taz and I also read that the moisturizer doesnt alter the effectiveness of the Taz but I'm not too sure if this is true. The Taz seemed to work so much better without the moisturizer, maybe I just need to incorporate the moisturizer more into my routine. I'm not sure how to fix this, I just know I've been using Tazorac for two months now, my acne is still there and even a little worse, my skin peels and my face hurts. ....not satisfied.

5	Acne	Redness, Dry Flaky skin, Irritation, Burning	I have used Tazorac gel in the past, applying it at night. It caused me severe burning and irritation. To cope with the dry and peeling skin I use Aveeno natuarlly radiant mosturizer with spf, which works excellent and well worth the money. I also use Triaz foaming cloths both day and night before applying tazorac. I was never told to use a mosturizer before applying tazorac. I completed the process in about 5 months I used Triluma to get rid of the scaring. My face was flawless and I always received compliments. However, I got lazy and stopped taking such great care of my face, and my acne returned. I am currently going through the process once again and it has been four weeks and the improvements are drastic already. I recommend always using a benzol peroxide cleanser to maintain great skin even after acne is gone.	F	18	1  years0.1% 1X D	2/28/2011

3	Acne, prescribed by dermatologist	Peeling, itching, iritation, more breakouts, darkening of spots	I've been using Tazorac for about a month and a half and I am getting a little discouraged. For a while, about three weeks in, I noticed that things seemed to be improving, but then I'd have phases of more breakouts. Right now I'm in one of those breakout phases that seems to be worse than before. So bad in fact that I actually made the decision to go on Proactive to see if that would work faster/better. I changed my mind after reading that I still may go through some of the same side effects as Tazorac. After reading everyone's comments on this forum, I've decided to stick with Taz for at least another three weeks, which is when I go back to the dermatologist to let her check my progress. This whole process is definitely about being patient, even though I'm very self-conscious about my appearance right now and want something to fix it all NOW. I hope that Tazorac is worth the wait and stress. Besides, Taz is more cost effective than Proactive and that's a very good thing. Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories.

Here is some other tips if you really wanna clear you skin and you are serious about doing anything in your power.  These have made my skin glow and perfect1. Drink:2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in half a cup of water. You can read online the amazing benefits for acne and just your health in general     Supplement: instead of taking so many medications for acne that are damaging your skin and overdosing it with chemicals I advice natural vitamins that help the skin.  Tumeric pills morning and night and Spirulina are amazing for acne and your body's health! You can also read their benefits online.	MORNING: 1.  use quarter size of jojoba oil and massage into the skin for 30 seconds this will soften peeling and combat dryness, jojoba oil is also great for scars and acne in general. Hop into shower with jojoba oil on if you take a shower in the morning                   2. Wash with water, there will be a film of jojoba oil still on skin.  At this point add your gentle cleanser and massage for another 30 seconds to wash away the oil.  If if still remains you can GENTLY massage with a washcloth.  This should wash away the jojoba oil                   3. Apply a thick layer of moisturizer and let it soak in before applying any makeupNIGHT   1. Same as morning #1 with jojoba oil.  Hop into the shower with jojoba oil still on if you take a shower at night               2. Apply gentle cleanser and massage very gently with washcloth or cleansing cloth to remove dirt and dry flaking skin.  DO NOT BE ROUGH.  Do this for 30 seconds and rise with warm water               3. dry face and wait 5 minutes and apply a pea size amount of tazorac to problem areas!! not areas that are completely fine because that will just irritate them for no reason.  After applying tazorac wait 1 minute for it to sink in and then apply a thick moisturizer.  Keep applying till the skin feels calm and not cracked and dry               4.

It's been 2 months and a half on this my face as gone from severe acne to very little I'm happy with the results my acne left scars but this also treats that so I'm happy but I hope by the third month the scars would be gone.

4	Large pores, blackheads, acne	Mild redness, moderate dryness, irriatation when washing face/applying lotion	I have tried both strengths of retin a micro over the last 2 years with moderate effectiveness, but my skin was still very oily. My derm put me on taz gel 0.1% and just after 2 weeks my skin looks much more clear (my sister even thought I had makeup on when I had none on at all!) I had enlarged pores on my cheeks, and blackheads on my nose. My enlarged pores have shrunk & are nearly invisible now, visibly less blackheads as well. My once oily skin is now actually dry, so be prepared to use a good moisturizer. I never used a moisturizer even when on retin a micro. My biggest problem with this medication is that it is so drying and irritating that it stings when I wash my face & apply moisturizer. I use cetaphil which is supposed to be gentle. Everyone is different, but taz is much more effective than retin a micro for me.	F	20	2  weeks 1X D	12/17/2010
4	Moderate/Severe Acne	Some dry, flaky skin	This medicine is great if you use with a moisturizer to counteract the side effects. I tried Tazorac cream a year ago, but had to stop using it after a week, my skin is sensitive and it was getting so red and irritated it was even kind of swelling. Recently, my acne was getting more out of control so I started using it again 3 weeks ago. I bought Aveeno Ultra-Calming Daily Moisturizer. It is a bit pricey ($15-$18) so I was hesitant to pay that much for a moisturizer, but it is worth every penny. I use it every morning and at night, 15 min before putting on Tazorac. It has cut the side effects down significantly. My face is just a bit flaky and drier in some areas, but really not that bad. I am convinced that this moisturizer has saved me from most of those dreaded side effects. Probably the only way you will not be suffering from severe dry, irritated skin. I know my skin is still supposed to flake somewhat before my acne can get any better so Im just waiting for that 3 month mark to start seeing really clear skin, but Im very confident it will work because it already dries up my pustular acne after 1 night. Note about what make-up to use: If you are having problems with make-up looking horrible putting it on flaky skin, try Maybelline SuperStay foundation. I have tried many department store and drugstore foundations and this is one that does not emphasize that flaky skin as much. Plus, it looks super smooth on and doesn't settle into lines or wrinkles!

3	Acne	I really had not much acne before, and right now, I have horrible breakouts on my chin and forehead. At first, it gave me dry skin and peeling, now it is not as bad, but there is still some dryness along with the pimples.	When I was prescribed this, I actually had pretty good skin, a few pimples every so often, that kind of thing. My doctor apparently thought otherwise, and randomly prescribed me Tazorac. So far, there is nothing but negative side effects, but I am going to stick with it until the end. My sister used it for about 3 weeks, and hers was getting worse too, but when she stopped using this medication, it went back to her normal skin, which is the typical pimply junior high girl (love you!). Anyway, I'm going to stick it out, even though it seems like the negative side effects are going on past the typical "purging" period.	F	16	1.5  monthssmall dot 1X D	11/28/2010

I cant begin to tell you how much it cleared up my face is almost completly clear, except for the occassional pimple. I use clearasil sensitive skin during the day and Cerave moisturizer. and apply tazorac at night or sometime if i just have one problem spot.

5	Acne on chin and forehead	Peeling, redness, brought a lot of deep acne to the surface.  Groups of pimples would form overnight.	I've never had terrible acne but I would still breakout, or get a few pimples on a day to day basis.  MY skin was never 100% clear and I never knew if I would wake up with a random pimple, especially on my chin.  Tazorac definitly made my skin far worse for two months.  It was terrible and embarassing but after EXACTLY two months my skin is far better and almost 100% clear, with just a little scarring that will probably go away completely after continued use.  If you're experiencing side effects now and it's making you want to stop using the product I deifnitly reccommend staying with it for 2-3mnths.  I never used lotion before applying the tazorac, and applied a pea size amount at night to all affected areas.	F	23	2  months.05 1X D	9/24/2010
5	severe acne	peeling, itchy, dryness, and redness	2 years ago I had severe acne. I cried all the time due to low self-esteem. My acne did get worst before I got better. However, I do believe it just depends on the person's health, history, and skin in general. Tazorac was a miracle!! My face literally was so clear people thought I had on make-up, and I didn't. Recently, my face began breaking out again so I went back to the dermatologist and they prescribed me Tazorac since it worked a miracle in the past. My face isn't near as bad as it was 2 yrs ago before I used the product, but I definitely believe it's not all that great now. I advise everyone who uses this product to continue using it whether your face gets worst or not. Believe it, Tazorac truly works, but the only way to find out is to actual go through with it. My suggestion is to put it only on the irrated areas, put moisturizer ON TOP of it ONLY WHEN needed, if peeling worsens, apply it every other night, and wash your face every morning and night with warm water and pat dry. I promise you, Tozarac will not only change your face, but it will change your life!!	F	21	2  years30 grams 1X D	9/19/2010

5	acne anti aging	thinner skin  red spots peeling  brings deep acne to the surface	This product breaks out your face, causes severe peeling, flaky skin and then after a month the redness fades and you have glowing skin. The first week for me was a living Hell because of the huge deep zits on my chin. I also used finacea during the day and I use emu oil to moisurize. This moistrizer sinks in and stops the flakiness. I have not seen a change in wrinkles but the Taz has cleared up the deep cystic acne on my chin that was so deep and the bumps hurt. It is so wonderful to wake up with smooth skin. I can not wait to see results after 3 months. I also will be using a clarisonic brush to keep up with getting rid of the dead skin cells that taz exfoliates off. I am 59 and have finally got rid of the bumps along my chin which caused me to cry-I have never had acne except during my late 50's .

I had A LOT of bumps all over my face, which got worse and i'm at that point where the really bad acne is starting to clear up and i'm sort of back to where i was before my face got worse b/c of the medication.

It looks like I have a chemical burn. I hope it will subside soon? But doesn't look promising.	F	21	1  times30 mg 1X D	8/1/2010Email
4	Moderate Cystic Acne	I started using the tazorac cream and it made my face look like an oil slick!  Also, it dried out my face so bad (yep, at the same time making it super oily) and my face hurt to touch and was super bright red. It peeled so bad I was embarrased to leave the house.  Not to mention, my acne was never worse in my life during the first 3 months!!!  I looked like a joke!	The first 3 months were horrific!  My skin was red, peeling, acne-ridden, and oily!  I was so upset and depressed about my face the first 3 months, but was told that was the magic number of months to wait as far as results go.  Since my face was still gross after 3 months, I asked my doctor to switch me to tazorac gel 0.1% and it started working better.  I think it must have been the mineral oil in the cream that made me sooooo greasy.  Anyway, tazorac gel is working fine now.  I get a few deep cystic pimples now, but not as bad as before.  I never touch my face, clean it with Mary Kay cleanser for oily skin, and clean my face 2 times per day.  I occasionally use toner and use Mary Kay moisturizer for oily skin.  I always apply the moisturizer 1 hour prior to using Taz at night to keep from horrible peeling.  I don't recommend skipping the moisturizer, no matter how greasy you think your face is.  I also use Duac cream each morning.  This has been working for the past few months, but isn't super affordable.  I've tried everything you can imagine Rx and OTC, except for Accutane.  Not worth the side effects for me.  I hope this blog was useful to others struggling with acne.	F	35	7  months0.1% 1X D	7/6/2010Email
5	acne	lots of peeling, acne was redder than normal	I've only been using taz for about a week and I already see an amazing improvment. Just before I started using taz I was on duac for about a year with no improvment and my acne was getting worse, so I'm hoping this works!!	F	14	1  weeks 1X D	6/21/2010
2	Acne	Before stumbling upon this site I used this product for 2-3 days, and stopped due to excessive peeling, itching and burning of my skin.  Little did I know there was a solution to this problem.	I am 35 yo AA female and I've been cursed with acne for as long as I can remember. I've tried just about everything to help rid myself of acne, and the horrible blemishes left behind due to my picking. My initial experience with taz was not very good, I stopped using within 2-3 days. I am truly grateful for whoever created this website.  It has been very helpful in providing useful information on how to prevent the excessive peeling, and burning of my skin. I re-started taz about a week ago after reading all of the postings.  It seems as though everyone has experienced pretty much the same symptoms, which was good news to me b/c I thought it was just me. My daily regimen is wasing my face with Cetyphil at night, apply moisturizer, then the taz.  In the morning, I just wash my face again and apply moisturizer. No more excessive peeling, minimal itching, and no burning.  I will admit my acne hasn't gotten any better, as a matter of fact it's worse.  I will continue to use taz given the fact just about every posting states their acne got worse before it got better.  My biggest problem was the peeling, and the burning of my skin, which has been resolved.  Hopefully, in the next 2-3 months I will have a wonderful success story to post about how wonderful my skin looks!	F	35	2  weeks0.1 Gel 1X D	6/11/2010Email
5	Acne	Slight redness, sun sensitivity, skin appears slightly thinner.	Tazorac has worked extremely well. It took about 6 weeks for my skin to get used to the medicine and about 3-months before my skin cleared up completely. I use the cream at night after washing my face with Cetyphil facewash and applying Cetyphil mosturizer. The medicine keeps my face clear of pimples, but I still have blackheads. My blackheads are really deep on my nose, so maybe they will just take more time. I do have a question...does anyone know if it is safe to continue to use Tazorac for an extended period? I love this medicine, and want to continue using it as long as it doesn't loose it effectiveness or build-up in my bloodsteam.	F	28	10  months.05 1X D	6/2/2010
5	Severe Acne	Extreme dry skin, peeling, extreme sensitivity, burning, redness.	Tazorac literally changed my life. I had severe acne in Junior High, and at that time, all of my other friends had perfect skin, so it was really embarrassing for me to look like that. I had no self esteem, and I just felt ugly. I would always wear make up to cover it up, and none of my other friends had to wear makeup! My dermotolagist prescribed Tazorac and for the first few weeks, my skin was dry, burning, red, and peeling, it made everything look worse. My acne began to clear up a little bit, but the side effects of Tazorac made things look 10 times worse. About 5 weeks later, the side affects dissapeared and my acne did too. It was literally a miracle, my skin looked amazing! Many times I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. I felt great and I finally began to think I was actually pretty. It worked amazing for me for about a year, before I ran out again and I so from the on I just stopped using it, and surprisingly my acne didn't come back for a very long time. Now I find myself in highschool, and I've noticed my acne coming back so I've got a new presciption and I'm starting it again. The symptoms (redness, dryness, burning) are back but I can't wait to see my skin clear up again!	F	15	2  years 1X D	5/28/2010
3	Adult Acne	First 2-3 weeks i experience peeling, redness, dryness, also burning when i apply lotion, but 4weeks it seems to even get worst.  I'm getting new breakouts in different spots. I have scars & red marks all over my face.  I Did noticed that the pimples were drying up but the red marks are still there.  I just can't wait for everything to go away.	I'm using Tazorac every night and also use 'clindamycin' twice a day. I'm not sure if it's my hormone related for cuz I'm overweight, It just doesn't seem to work for me just yet.  has anybody know if being overweight can trigger to breakouts?

5	sun damage & fine lines	Redness & drying, some irritation. I have been using Tazorac for approximately 10 years. My dermatologist prescribed it to improve skin texture, tone, and color. He also prescribes Premarin Estrogen cream as a night moisturizer. I have been seeing this Dr. for 30 years now. I am now 60 years old and have the skin of much younger woman. Smooth and soft with very minimum fine lines. As a sun worshiper in my youth I was concerned about sun damage. Tazorac has removed it all, even on my neck and arms. The estrogen cream has kept my skin supple and does not have that thinning skin we ladies get after menopause. Girls, use this product & don't give up, you will have wonderful benefits.	If it is too strong for you to use everyday. Start out with 1-2 times a week mixed in with your moisturizer.	F	60	10  years.1% 1X D	5/10/2010
4	cysts on face	tightness, burning and peeling	I have always had acne... but it was in college when I started getting cysts on face. I was put on Accutane, which work well. Then after that was given a cream the following year after taken the last dose. I was told after the year was up, I could go back to the basis. Cleanser, Toner and Moisturizer... Now, I'm back to square one... I have been using Tazorac for a week now. Day 2, It started peeling and getting worst. Day 3, More peeling, burning and drying occurs. I'm at Day 7, most of my acne has dried up, leaving red marks and scars but I'm praying that I will see an improvement in a month. I won't lie... It is depressing but after reading everyone's post. I have hope...	F	26	7  days 1X D	5/7/2010
2	Acne	My skin became fairly dry and I began peeling on spots on my face	I was given the Tazorac cream by my dermatologist and, overall, I would say it didn't work. I have a combination of dry and oily skin and I'm using this prescription along with Minocycline pills. Since I've been using this cream I would say my acne has become significantly worse and now my zits seem to be scarring. In addition, my face has become drier so it's difficult to cover up the marks with make-up. It seems to work really well for some but not for others : (	F	16	8  weeks30 g 1X D	4/25/2010
5	Amanda: Prescribed by Dermotologist	The first 6 weeks were hell. HELL! My skin got extremely worse basically right away, side effects including redness, itchiness, MAJOR peeling, burning, and adding redness to my already existing pimples and also creating new ones.But then, on the 6th week, everything changed. The redness was gone. All the pimples were healed and the dry skin has slowly but surely been moisturizing itself. I wake up in the morning worried that it was all just a dream. But it was not. My skin has not looked this good in over 2 years (around the time my pores started clogging up). I am so happy with this product now. My skin used to be terrible and I was literally depressed during the first 6 weeks when I thought I was doomed to bad skin for the rest of my life. That is far behind me. My skin is smooth and clear again. I am so happy I committed to this product. It works.		F	29	6  weeks 1X D	4/18/2010
2	Acne on my face	I have been on Tazorac for 4 weeks, and it made my face extremely worse. I have pimples everywhere and it is just very depressing and it makes me embarrassed to walk outside. I have not worn makeup since I've started tazorac. At first it made my face extremely dry and peely but it is not anymore, but I have had this patch of acne on my chin that has been there for weeks!!! It doesnt seem like it will ever go away! I'm about to give up on this :(		F	19	4  weeks.1% Gel 1X D	4/15/2010
5	to lighten skin hyperpigmentation	I have been using taz for about two weeks now.  I am using it with the Obagi skin blender to lighten sun damage on my face.  i am very fair with freckles, and after spending years in the tanning booth, my skin is really damaged.  I have dark freckles covering my whole face, along with a few larger dark spots.  I have never really had acne, accept for the occasional monthly pimple, so I was using it in order to allow the skin bleach to penetrate my skin better.  I did break out initially (within the first week) and I got a few pimples...which completely freaked me out, but they went away very fast and I haven't had a zit again.  overall I am very happy with the results.  my hyperpigmentation is lightening a ton already, and my skin is very smooth and glowy.  I did get a little dry, but I just took a few days off to let it calm down a little.		F	27	2  weeks 1X O	4/5/2010
4	Adult Acne, Scarring, Pore Size	I'm currently using Tazorac cream at night, Duac gel in the morning, taking Doxcycline, washing with M.D. Forte II glycolic acid cleanser, and using Purpose SPF 15 Moisturizer.  During the first week I had more breakouts than before going to the Derm.  I'm finally starting to see results in less than 2 weeks.  I am getting really small bumps around my chin and neck area, but no dryness or peeling has occured (maybe because I'm African American?).  I'm curious to see how it goes next week when I switch to every night.	Taken every other day, then will switch to every night next week	F	39	10  days.05 1X O	3/18/2010Email
5	wrinkles, mild breakout	I started using tazorac for acne when it first came out in the 80's.  I have been using it ever since.  I am now in my 50's and my skin is almost wrinkle free.  My dermotologist can't believe how great my skin looks. No crows feet, laugh lines etc. It did cause peeling when I first started using it, but I have developed a tolerance to it.  I just started to use a face cream in addition to my tazorac.  It is by a company called yonka and it is fabulous.  I would say stick with the tazorac.  You can combat the peeling by using aquafor...believe me this really works!!  People always ask me why my skin looks so great and I have to say I owe it to tazorac.	If you are really peeling, use the cream form.  I used the .5 for many years in the cream.  I now use the 1.0 in the gel but use it sparingly and add the yonka cream.

4	acne	peeling, dryness, some redness	I have been on and off of Taz several times over the last few years. I do like how it will clear my skin and even get rid of the "smile line" on my face. I found that the moisterizer technique works well. WATER WATER WATER is another great way to cut down on dryness and peeling. Hydrated skin looks better and can handle the harsh effects of the medication. DRINK YOUR WATER!! Overall, I use it every other day for a little while then take a break then start up again if i start to notice more breakouts.	F	32	14  daysordered 1X D	3/13/2010

In the morning i wake up and my skin is flaking so i jump in the shower and gently rub my face and all that dry skin is removed and i am ready to start the day!	Its Amazing everyone i see wants to know what i did to my skin. I had very un even skin tone and texture. I used to hate looking at myself in the mirror in sunlight because it made my skin's rough texture so obvious. Now I love looking at myself in the sun and i wear my hair up, such freedom! I used to love the sun but now that i get this fresh start I want nothing more to do with frying my skin to temporary look good.	F	31	1  months30mg .01% 1X D	3/2/2010
4	adult onset acne	redness, mild itching and irritation for the first week or so	my nightly regimen consists of 5.75% benzoyl peroxide wash, .05% tazorac cream, and doxycycline capsules (100 mg).  the tazorac was irritating my skin and causing breakouts so i stopped and resumed using epiduo (.1% adapalene/2.5% benzoyl peroxide - gel) from a previous derm rx but continued with the bp wash and doxy.  after 2 months my skin had improved and when i went for my follow up the derm told me to start on the taz. i did and my skin had none of the side effects.  i think the epiduo, which is less potent, helped my skin adjust to any irritation.  my skin is pretty oily so using the taz daily is actually great for controlling shine, etc... now it's been about 4 months, my skin is not breaking out anymore, not even during my period!  still have residual discoloration - my skin seems to be prone to hyperpigmentation and takes a long time for dark spots to fade.  am now on a regimen of bp wash, taz and now topical 1% clindamycin (antibiotic).  so far so good.  if you experience severe side effects from the taz, maybe your derm can start you on a lower intensity rx like adapalene (epiduo) and let your skin adjust gradually to the meds?  (i wash my face morning/night with neutrogena face wash. also used the clarisonic brush but stopped bcuz thought skin was breaking out due to excess exfoliation)i gave taz 4 stars instead of 5 because i feel the combination of taz, bp wash and antibiotics is what helped my skin.  just taz alone probably would not have been as effective.

3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.

Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight.

3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work.

However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time.

This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.

It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010

Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life.

Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.

1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).	F	42	16  months30 mg 1X D	9/7/2010
3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug.

At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying.

I am taking 50 mg of lamictal concurrently with 7.5 mg abilify.  Affect is flatter, less mood swings, but more non-reactive than anything.  I'm not sure this is where I want to be. I have been able to get projects done that I had difficulty starting.  Some days I have energy, some days I don't.  I a fasting blood draw yesterday and haven't heard the results yet.  Continuing to take abilify is a quandary -- do I feel worse or better if I factor in all the weird side effects?

Before taking Abilify she was on Geodon and had terrible akathisia. It also interfered with her ability to learn, and she had to withdraw from college courses to avoid failing. (She wound up finishing college with a B average, so you can see she's normally able to learn. ) Once she got off the Geodon, the irritability and stupidness went away but she became suicidal and self-injured. Since starting the Abilify she hasn't tried suicide even once. (Before that it was 14 times in six years.) I am grateful to the Abilify, but I wish she wasn't so hungry all the time.

1	depression & anxiety	I took this and right away I had more energy. Even joined a Gym for the first time in my life. But than within a week my blood sugar sky rocket, I mean I was in the hospital with sugar over 600, my meter couldn't even read it, and the hospital had trouble bringing it down with fast acting insulin. Then my legs started shaking couldn't keep still. I had to go off it cold turkey because of my dangerously high sugar. It might work for some people but be careful of the side affects.		M	26	1  months	11/9/2009
4	major depression and anxiety	the first night i felt like i was coming down from meth. i adjusted the times i took my meds, because i take asprin, reglan, nexium, and effexor 75's.  i took the asprin, nexium, and reglan with dinner, and the effexor and abilify, plus a half of a klonopin at bedtime, and i sleep through the stomach upset.	the second day i felt much better.  i was able to clean a room, take care of bills, and just never thought of negative things more than twice.  this is my third day, and i was able to joke around with my husband at the store, and though i still haven't showered, i may do that tonight, after i clean the bathroom.  i have great hopes for this med, and hopefully, i won't have to take it very long.	F	47	3  days	11/8/2009Email
5	Bipolar depression	Some weight gain and insomnia.	This drug saved me from the darkest, deepest depression I have ever had to endure.  For over two years, I lost my will to see people, clean house, get dressed, etc.  After just three days on Abilify, I was able to get up, shower, go visit friends in New England (I live in South Florida), clean up my messy house and talk on the phone again.  I have gained a great deal of weight over the years from all different types of medication.  I accept the fact that medication makes me heavy and I am grateful to be heavier and sane than thin and crazy.	F	54	30  days	11/2/2009
5	Depression/Anxiety	Occasional headache.  Woke up in the middle of the night a few times but that got better.  Still sleeping well.	Doctor added 2 mg Abilify to my 10 mg Lexapro because I was still having suicidal thoughts despite the Lexapro.  Its worked great so far and has been a real boost in energy and mood.	M	17	5  weeks	11/2/2009
4	anxiety, paranoia and major depress	restlessness at 20 mg, eye tic at l5 mg, now down to 2 mg daily.  No weight gain at all on any of the doses.	Because of side effects including diabetes risk tried to go cold turkey at l0 mg.  Okay for about 2 weeks then experienced major nervousness, disorientation, jaw clenching, etc.  Now taking 2 mg. daily and feeling much better.  Still worried about side effects.  Not taking any other drug along with it.  Still experiencing anxiety but it is manageable.  You must wean yourself off this drug and not try to quit at once.	F	62	3  months	11/2/2009
3	ADHD	uncontrollable muscle movements, especially when in the car.	My son has been on Abilify (1 mg) for over a year.  We started on .5 mg because of his weight.  I did not want to medicate my child but I had no choice.  He was diagnosed at 2 with ADHD, but I didn't believe the psychologists because it's hard to diagnose something like that at age 2.  He is also ODD.  Last summer he was almost kicked out of daycare because of impulsivity, aggression, and inablility to sit still.  The Abilify worked for him then and continues to work.  I would love, however, if he didn't need it but now he's in kindergarten and has to take it to get through the day.  I was also able to get him a 504 plan with the school since I got another diagnosis at age 4 which was ADHD.	M	5	1.5  years	11/2/2009Email
2	add on for depression	none except rapid and major weight gain	I was very hopeful at first. I felt improvement after the 3rd day when this was added to my Wellbutrin. But in 5 months time, I gained 40 lbs on a petite, 100 lb frame!! I'm really struggling to lose it, and am currently discontinuing because of it. People that I bump into at stores and such ask when I'm due!!Really too bad, I had no other side effects. but now I'm left with this big mess with my weight to clean up.	F	34	5  months	10/29/2009
1	GAD/Depression	weight gain, extreme fatigue, depression worse	I was taking 2 mg of Abilify last Spring after Paxil didn't seem to be working as much any more. I felt ok then I felt bad again. Dr put me on 5 mg of Abilify. I feel terrible!  Extremely tired- so much so that I can barely move. I am going to ween my self off immediately.	F	47	6  months	10/28/2009
3	Mood stabilizer along with Zoloft	I took 1 mg daily and it helped but caused too many side effects. I'm very med-sensitive. I've stopped Zoloft at this point.	I was on Zoloft and Abilify but stopped both due to weight gain. After a lot of research I'm adding Abilify back at 1 mg every three days. I'm very med-sensitive and tend to respond at lower doses than other people do. Will be back to post how this goes. Something has to help. I'm a wack-job right now. Can't control my thoughts and I dwell on bad stuff too much. Can't get sad events out of my mind etc. I have to give Abilify another chance at a reduced dose.	F	62	 	10/27/2009
4	Oneiric states	jittery at low doses, sleepy at high	It has helped me stop feeling like I'm in a dream all the time                                   but my mood is only a little better so far	F	59	3  weeks	10/25/2009
2	Depression	Insomnia, chest pain, blurry vision	Only on 0.5 mg. for three days.  Horrible insomnia no matter what time of day I take med.  Makes me drowsy during the day, hard to tell if my mood is improving due to the side effects.	F	35	3  days	10/24/2009
5	major depressive episode	Energy and hope restored.  Insomnia, head ache, speedy, shaky,visual disturbance,constipation.	Hopefully the side effects subside as my body gets used to the med.  I'm not willing to stop taking the med as I feel so much better with just 2mg of Abilify as an adjunct to Lexapro.  I have hope again.  I got my butt out of bed by day 3 (went shopping) then cleaned the house on day 5.  What a change from the depths of deep epression to my old self in less than a week...WOW!	F	46	10  days	10/23/2009
3	bipolar II	agitation, shakiness, acne, loss of libido, weight gain, inability to urinate	This med helped stabilize my mood a bit, but I could not get the full benefit because I could not increase the dose.  Every time I would go up on the dose, I would be hit by an avalanche of side-effects.  Had to get off eventually.	F	26	5  months	10/23/2009
3	To help my mood	Strange itching in my nose. I made myself bleed by trying to scratch it but couldn't help myself. It tasted good so I'm okay with it.	I've had depression of one kind or another most of my life.  I wanted to feel normal.  But, I ran out of samples after a week.  It wasn't long enough to find out if it would help.	M	56	7  days	10/22/2009
3	Mood Disorder	My son is 9 years old. He started in June on a mood stabilizer.  Abilify 5 mg, worked on mood, however he has gained 25 pounds. He can not stop eating.  He even sneaks food!! I don't know what the doctor is thinking.  We are taking him off.		M	9	4  months	10/19/2009
5	Bipolar Disorder	Very hungry, but able to manage it. Some difficulty sleeping, usually for an hour in the middle of the night. Spending money a little more than usual. Initially had a few days of headaches, not major.	This drug immediately snapped me out of low-grade depression that was steadily worsening. I started taking 2 mg of Abilify each morning and all of my depression symptoms lifted. I only realized how bad my concentration had been because it was so improved on this drug. Like others have said, I lost my hyper-sensitivity to people and situations and replaced that with a high tolerance for life's challenges -- big & small. The side-effects are very minimal at this point, but I'll be paying attention to see if this continues. Lastly, the fact that it works so quickly is a powerful asset if it works for you.	F	39	2  weeks	10/17/2009
1	depression/schizoaffective	can't stop pacing, feel like someone is inside me trying to get out of my skin, insomniac, no sex drive, having to put car into park at stoplights to keep from ramming into someone in front of me; insane.	i stopped taking this today and hope to G-d it doesn't last long in my bloodstream.	F	29	2  weeks	10/16/2009
2	possible bipolar	feel like a crack addict, hard to even sit here and type, hitting wrong keys, clenching jaw, restless beyond belief	on 10 mg...gained about 5-7 pounds, doc swears I need it, am bipolar but w out mania, just very low lows.......need to get off this but afraid of geodon...feel like a speed freak.  sleep is my only relief.............	F	38	6  weeks	10/7/2009
1	Mood stabalizer	makes me gain weight, tired, not sure if it is what causes memory loss, fatigue, moodiness, irratability.		F	35	2  years	10/7/2009
5	Anxiety, depression, mild mania.	Jitters, sleepiness, stomach distress.	This drug is very strong and very good.  I am taking 2 mg in conjunction with 7.5 mg of Lexapro.  It has reduced my severe PMS and helped me with my previous need to sleep 11 hours a day.  Note that I am on one tenth of the recomended starting dosage for someone who is bi-polar; I can only imagine the side effects, however for my purpose it has been a god send.	F	29	1  months	10/3/2009
1	Bi-polar	pacing, high blood sugar, foamy urine, severe thirst, fatigue, pancreatitis, kidney damage	Please stop taking the Abilify immediately.  My husband was prescribed Abilify and it almost killed him. He was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis for 10 days and then on home care hooked up to ivs for another 2 weeks. He is now diabetic and needs to take insulin shots 4 times a day. He is on a very strict low-fat no-sugar diet and may never have even a sip of alcohol ever again. His pancreas is permanently damaged. We are very lucky he is alive. Abilify is evil. Please do not take it. It will kill you.	M	30	 	9/30/2009Email
5	depression, OCD	more alert, motivated, racing thoughts greatly diminished, some nausea, no weight gain!	I was leery about taking this, others make it sound like a nightmare drug. I have no doubt that it affects some people badly, but for me, it made a huge difference. I do wonder if this will wear off after a few months, but so far 5 mg have allowed me to think clearly, get off the couch and accomplish things. No weight gain but dr has me on Metformin to regulate blood sugar and cravings, so that might be the trick there. Important for everyone to monitor their own reactions carefully, or ask family members to help, because every drug works differently for every person. YOU know best what helps YOU.	F	45	2  months	9/19/2009
3	depression/ bipolar	flattening/apathy, word-finding problems, short-term memory loss, trouble concentrating, not able to articulate thoughts and feelings, muscle weakness. To be fair, it made me manic for the first month I took it, which was wonderful, and I say I'm not depressed now, but is apathy really that different from depression?	When trying to stop taking 5mg, severe akathasia that literally kept me from sleeping at all. I'm tapering, now on 2.5mg, but still fearful that I will have the same symptoms when I discontinue again. Feeling a little trapped.	M	35	7  months	9/17/2009
3	Childhood Bipolar, ODD	WEIGHT GAIN, MUSCLE PAIN/STIFFNESS	My son has shown improvement in mood, decreased mood swings, more even temperament, however, he constantly complains about pain in his feet and legs. He describes as burning, stinging pain, mostly in his feet. We have observed more nasal stuffiness. He appears short of breath, at times, however, we are linking this to his weight gain (approx 12 lbs) and history of asthma. We are still observing and waiting to gauge any affect in cognitive abilities (school grades). Time will tell if the side effects are actually worth taking the medication.	M	11	3  months	9/16/2009
1	Bipolar 2-PTSD	Eating abnormal amounts - lethargy - no libido - no personality - sweating	This shit, and yes I say this profanely because that's what it is. It made me more depressed than ever. Yes the headaches and voices went away. But it made me socially anxious , paranoid , ripped me of my self esteem and made me gain weight because all I did and wanted to do was eat. I am an athlete, model, and full time mom. I kissed my life goodbye when taking this shit. Desparate, I stopped taking it. Which made life even more worse. I wanted to kill myself so badly because I wanted the pain to go away. It's all in my head. Mind over matter. I'll be the moodswingin crazy gal I am than risk my life. Also causes muscle weakness. Lucky to be able to carry anything up a damn flight of stairs. All in all, just stay away!!! Spent the whole summer in bed sleeeeping getting fat and suicidal. Whack!!!	F	25	2  months	9/14/2009
1	GAD/BPII/PTSD/OCD	Severe depression/out of touch	I was on Abilify for three weeks.  I started with the 10 mg for two weeks and up to 25 the third week.  On the 10 mg I started feeling "funny" and experiencing some side effects.  By the third week I was self mutlilating (something I have not done in 15 yrs.  I was so depressed I could not function at any level, very irritable and people just were too much to deal with.  All I wanted to do was sleep and just disappear.  My Therapist said it was like I did a 180 in two weeks and was so concerned she called my Psych.  After seeing my Psych, she immediately took me off it and put me on Geodon...not sure if that is a possitive change or not.	F	37	3  weeks	9/14/2009
3	Bi Polar 2	Akathesia, insomnia, anxiety, weight gain, head aches	The Akathesia was awful.  I would lie in bed thinking I was weak or flu-ish, but once in bed I could not get comfortable.  My workouts decreased as I felt weak, dizzy, short of breath, lost balance while stretching. My face would sweat way more than normal.  I could tell I was starting to gain weight and would pack on the pounds rapidly if I did not stop taking this. Since exercise is therpeutic for me, the abilify took that away from me.  BUT it did help control my mood swings (by making me feel like an emotionless zombie) and the need to act out my irritability. However, inside I felt increasing anxiety and irritability.  The side effects just aren't worth it.	F	30	2  months	9/8/2009
3	Depression/Anxiety	I have gained 20 pounds and am not eating any more than normal.  The medicine definitely lifted my depression, but the weight gain now has me looking like a pig.  And, it seemed to increase my libido.	Started off with 5 mg; now am down to 2.5... but, because of the weight gain, I am asking to get off of this medication.	F	40	4  months	9/5/2009
1	anxiety	Akithesia	Do not take this med. I had severe akithesia whereby I had a constant feeling of having to 'move' It was exhausting and I thought it would never leave which made me feel even more panicked. It was the most scared I'd ever felt on a medicine. Before this I truly never paid attention to side effects on labels, now I do.	F	38	 	8/29/2009
4	Bi-Polar	Akathisia, increased libido, insomnia	Loved it the first week until the Akathisia kicked in.  Then I wanted to jump out the car while it was moving... Halfed my dosage, no help.  Halfed the dosage again, no help.  Now I am on 1/8 of the pill.  Akathisia is gone, but increased libido went away.  Still have insomnia taken care of by Ambien.	F	46	1  years	8/28/2009Email
5	for incentive, to mk decisions	none except lots of hope, energy, lack of fear,loss of procrastination, able to make decisions, ability to focus just an all around zest for life with unlimited happiness	If your anti depressant or anti anxiety meds work but you still have no energy, ask your Dr to add Abilify. I had never heard of it but now instead of thinking of everything I need and want to do I am optimistic and bubbling with enthusiasm and energy. Now instead of reading all day long I am cleaning and doing hobbies, kyaking, running, dancing and marching with my grandchildren Whats next a sea plane ride and travel. Was just weeks ago I was close to Agoraphobia. If your meds only get you to the bottom of the mountain looking up and wishing you would, try Abilify, you will climb that mountain, maybe even run up it and then dance on the top!!!	F	62	3  weeks	8/23/2009
2	bi polar 2	weight gain, sugar cravings, excessive sleepiness, inability to exercise (no stamina, gasping for breath)	It helped with irritability (because nothing seemed to matter) but left me unable to live normally and my friends all asked if something was wrong because I was so quiet and getting more quiet with each passing day.  Because the side effects were so crippling, I have stopped taking Abilify and switched to Geodon.	F	60	4  months	8/18/2009
1	Bipolar I	Akathisia, loss of interest in life, Always sleepy, high anxiety, catatonia	Got really bad Akathisia after only 3 days on 10mg. Was taken during a bad manic/pschotic state so was forced to stay on it. Initially was bumped to 20mg which made me catatonic. Back to 10mg kept hallucinating. Added Cogentin, made Akathisia go away but severe anxiety came in it's palce along with lack of motivation and no interest in anything. Severe confusion followed. This sucked my will to live. The Akathisia was so severe I was suicidal.	M	32	7  months	8/17/2009
3	depression; withdrawal aid	VERY rapid weight gain (10 lbs in a month!), constipation, swollen legs and feet, back pain	GOOD NEWS: This drug helped me in the horrible phase of discontinuing Cymbalta.  I was no longer moody and nasty-tempered.  BAD NEWS: the fact that my face is so puffy I now look like a fatter, older version of myself and I now have GOBS of fat in places I never gained weight before (back of arms, waist) proves this stuff is POISON.  It may inhibit thyroid function, because I am not eating more than I usually do (in fact my appetite is less than normal--wierd!) yet I am piling on weight. The constipation, nausea and fatigue aren't fun either.  And I look like CRAP: bloated, haggard, pale, and unhealthy. Phasing off this med asap!	F	31	2  months	8/14/2009Email
5	depression	I have experience swelling of the calves. This may not be related to the Abilify, as I have had a kidney transplant.	My family has a history of serious depression to the point of being institutionalize. For many years now my brother and I have tried one drug after another. Nothing helped us 'open the curtains'. Two mg of Abilify each morning, after just a couple of days, has given us our lives back. This is a miracle drug for both my brother and my self. I must include, we have only been on this medicine for two or three weeks.	M	60	18  days	8/8/2009Email
5	wellbutrin	somewhat more tired, some difficulty urinating..	A Great help.. relieved pain in my shoulders and elbows.. and has rid me of most of my suicidal or weird thoughts and voices.	M	57	25  days	8/5/2009
4	bi-polar 1 disorder	nausea, vomiting, insomnia	I am 5mg, for just about a week, first 2 days I was very hostile, last 4 days restless with insomnia and cant eat much.However I have energy, I get things done, I am back to being social which I was not for over a year and half. No fears of public and can focus to read, play games etc.  My patience level is much better.  Just would like to know when the insomnia and nausea will pass.	M	41	1  weeks	8/5/2009Email
2	Possbile Bipolar 2	Extreme sweating, extreme nausea, weird chest movement, insomnia	Been on Celexa for 10 years now, up and down in dose as lifes stresses went up and down... 40mg now for past 2 years. Doctor added abilify for possible Bipolar 2. I took at 7pm and within 2 hours I was sweating profusely and kept doing so for the next 24 hours, then it started to go away. I wasn't hot, I even cranked up the air conditioner, didn't help at all. I soaked my clothes and sheets. This caused some dehydration which didn't help the nausea. That was also extreme. I never actually vomited but still laid on the bathroom floor just in case. The first few bouts of it I could barely move. I was flushed and weak and trembling it was so bad.I also couldn't sleep, which I'd already been fighting insomnia the past few months. But this made it worse as I couldn't sleep more then 10-30 mins at a time. The constant sweating didn't help when trying to sleep.I'm not saying don't take this med. I dealt with bad nausea for weeks when I first started it, and also when I went without for over a week. Just wanted to share what happened to me	F	32	1  days	8/2/2009
5	major depression/Bipolar	None really..Some initial insomnia but got better with time. Sexual sides are minimal and never a problem	A great medicine.It worked the 1st day I took it (5 mg)..I felt so much better..NOTHING has worked for me except Abilify and Parnate. People love to rant and rave when something is not working for them. Fine. But please don't tell other people to stay away from the drug because it doesn't work for you. If your having a hard time finding something that works, try this med. It works quickly so you'll know if it's for you without having to wait 2-4 weeks.	M	49	60  days	7/31/2009
1	Bipolar Disorder	Weight Gain	I was taking this medicine for about half a year and was recommended to not go off of it. In this six month period I gained 67 pounds. It also made it very hard to lose the weight afterward. Here I am almost two years later, and I am five pounds away from getting rid of the 67 I initially gained. Although the weight is gone, the stretch marks remain and still will. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE.	F	22	6  months	7/27/2009
5	schizo personality disorder	I LOVE ABILIFY!!  It is my favorite antipsychotic.  Side effects range from mild tiredness and hunger spells to insomnia at bed time.  But that helps with Ambien CR which my doc loves to prescribe like candy to me!  Abilify helps tremendously with voices and does not give me the akathisia movement disorder like the "dones" risperidone and ziprasidone antipsychotic do 100% of the time.	This medicine is a mild antipsychotic when it comes to side effects when compared to other antipsychotics.  I would recommend ABILIFY (aripiprazole) over the other atypical antipsychotics any day.	M	29	6  years	7/23/2009

1	major life long depression	I had a STROKE after 9 days on this awful medicine. I've been on wellbutrin for years and started to feel a deeper depression than normal. My psychiatrist put me on Abilify as a boost. Within 3 days I became very confused and very tired. It was the weekend, on Monday I called the doctor. He said it was the side effects and would clear up, that I had only been on it 6 days. On Thursday, I called and told him that I was stopping it. In addition to the confusion, I was having a hard time talking. He said the side effects would probably be gone by my appointment. They got worse! I couldn't remember how to use my utensils, my toothbrush etc. I couldn't spell or write, was mixing up the phone number even if I was looking at it. Monday, he still felt that it was side effects but at my insistence he sent me right to a neurologist, who ran me through a number of tests. He agreed that it was side effects. If I wasn't better in 3 weeks, he'd do a CAT scan. After 1 week insisted on the scan and lo	I was 62 years old and do not have dementia. My doctor did not consider me elderly. At what age does the drug company consider elderly? My doctor said that this shouldn't have happened. I am better but not back to the way I was before Abilify and the stroke. After 13 months I don't feel that I am getting any better and I honestly feel the problems I am still having are permanent. But it could have been worse, I wasn't paralyzed! Even with the computer, this write up has taken me 2 1/2 hours to compose.	F	63	9  days	7/15/2009Email
2	Some psychotic disorder	Akathisia. Insomnia.	Tried Abilify for a while and was hoping the initial akathisia and insomnia would go away, but after a month there was no change, so I gave it up.	M	34	1  months	7/14/2009
1	depression	I had bad nausea and vomiting. Very bad acne. Super drowsy.	It didn't even help with my condition. I have been trying it out for about 4-5 weeks and the side effects are horrible. I was still the same person I was before takin Abilify if not worse.	F	21	5  weeks	7/10/2009

I took it for about 6 months in 2003 and was taken off it by my psych. at my sister's urging. She came to see me at Christmas and was shocked at what she found. I was not even aware of how bad it was until I was taken off it.	F	41	6  months	7/3/2009

5	Schizoaffective Disorder	I initially experienced Akathesia, Nystagmus and sleepiness. Then my dosage was recently upped from 20 mgs to 25 mgs due to break through depression, after that I did feel some nausea. Other than those few side effects I've felt fine on Abilify. I would recommend Abilify to others who are being carefully monitored by their Psychiatrist. I just happen to have an excellent Dr., which does make a difference.	I take Abilify along with Divalproex Sodium ER 1250 mgs for migraines, Clonazepam, Cogentin 1 mg for Akathesia, 2 grs of Armour Thyroid for Hypothyroidism.	F	47	5  years	6/28/2009

3	anxiety/pmdd/depression	I have tried all the SSRI's and am currently taking Cymbalta 60 mg daily.  I was told that abilify helps so many people in my situation but so far the side effects have been miserable.  Yes, I am more mellow and not as irritable, but I have a constant headache/eye pain (like a migraine), I cannot sleep and I'm nauseous.  I'm reading all these other comments and I'm terrified of gaining weight, so I think I'm going to stop.		F	39	3  days	6/21/2009

Never have I been suicidal, but I wanted to die just to get rid of the akethisia it was LIVING HELL. I have permanent side effects... i'm way slower in the head...memory loss...stuttering... I would lie down and not be able to get out of bed I was SO tired at times.	POISON! google AKETHISIA and read the hell it could bring you and your loved ones.DO NOT TAKE ANTI-PSYCHOTICS ... they WILL make you CRAZY so they can keep giving you more pills when you complain about the side effects they will more than likely tell you it's symptoms of something else and just put you on more medication that will permanently damage your brain and life. I can't believe they give this to people knowing what harm it can do.	F	19	6  weeks	6/18/2009
2	Major Depression	weight gain, fatigue/tiredness/drowsiness, loss of concentation	I have ADD and even though I am on Adderall the abilify counteracted it and I had a lot of trouble focusing in school. I am tired all the time getting 12 hours of sleep a night and still taking a 3-4 hour nap in the afternoon. It did help with my depression but recently I have been having suicidal thoughts. I also gained 15 pounds in just a few weeks.	F	20	2  months	6/15/2009
4	Schizophrenia	Problems with my legs. Sometimes they are restless, other times I can't feel them. I go to the gym a lot and have found I cannot perform as well with my legs. There are no problems with my other body parts.Blurry visionRandom changes to my tone of voiceFeeling sick (this went after a couple of days)	Works well so far. My symptoms are not as bad, I just hope the side effects stop	M	26	2  weeks	6/8/2009
1	schizoaffective	I gained 55 pounds in the 3 months i was on abilify! i have been thin my whole life now i no longer have a functioning metabolism. and am unable to loose all the weight		F	26	3  months	6/8/2009
2	Anxiety	Hallucinations, seeing spots (colored), toothaches (the whole right side of my mouth) I know this because when I stopped taking, it was way improved. Headaches, angry outbursts, very very tired 24/7.	Did help the anxiety. However, I couldn't tolerate the side effects I listed. It seemed each day was worse than the day before.	F	35	1  months	6/7/2009
1	Depression	Insanity. I know that sounds wierd, crazy or whatever, but that is the closest word I know to describe it. For three days I went into a world where I couldn't understand what was going on aroung me. I would start to speak, the words were clear in my head, but gibberish would come out. I was terrified for much of the time, curled in a ball, feeling I was about to die at any second.	This drug is now advertised as an add on supplement to anti-depressants. This is crazy! It's an anti-psychotic! It has a side affect profile that if fully revealed to patients would sent them running for the nearest exit.	M	28	4  days	6/7/2009
1	wrongly diagnosed	So, I am posting this message mainly to help others with their emotional/psychological struggles.  I would like to give people who have been put on anti-psychotics some pointers and guidance that might help.  I was on abilify for six years and regret it completely.	Honestly, Abilify works wonders for some people and for many others I can make matters worse.  I have a strong desire to help others so they hopefully don't have to go through what I went through to get to a state of well being.  Everything is anonymous!!  E-mail me if you would like some help with your situation.  Especially if you feel like you are just stuck.	M	23	6  years	6/7/2009Email

1	depression	movement disorders....feeling suicidal and crazy....	This poison should be illegal...thanks for the brain damage,  abilify.....you have blood on your hands, as does the fda...	M	33	1  months	6/1/2009
4	Bipolar II	Love this medication.  I finally feel like me again and can handle things.  However, I am EXTREMELY hungry.  Does this go away?  Also experiencing severe muscle aching.  I don't want to go off the Abilify, but can't take the hunger pain.		F	43	4  days	5/30/2009Email
4	Major depression w/ psychosis	Something similar to restless leg syndrome, fidgeting	I've now been diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features along with some other things.  Abilify was prescribed to me because my initial diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder. The two disorders are somewhat similar.  Abilify has more or less completely eliminated my psychotic symptoms and I do well on this medication.  I have not experienced any negative side effects in the past 2 years.  For the first 6 months I had restless legs and some fidgeting problems where it was hard to sit still.  Those symptoms passed and I feel pretty much fine at this point.  I also take Effexor XR, Lamictal and Librium.	F	31	2.5  years	5/29/2009
4	Depression & Paranoia	I've been taking 2 mg Abilify for 2 weeks now, along with my usual 40 mg Prozac and 900 mg Lithium. I feel like I'm on speed or something with abilify! I have no appetite (a good thing-could lose a few lbs), I feel restless, but I feel like I see things differently now. I also have a "full" sensation in my head and a little shakiness. I'm scared, because I keep reading all these bad things about Abilify, but I feel soooo much more alert & interactive now. If only the restlessness would go away, this is a miracle med for me. How long until these side effects taper off?		F	28	14  days	5/28/2009
3	Bipolar Disorder (rapid cycling)	Weight gain (about 20-30 pounds in a six months...without changing eating habits), extreme tiredness, lethargy, shaking/tremors, increased levels of insulin (blood sugar).	It helped my manic episodes and leveled out my mood. However, I don't feel it was worth the weight gain and increased blood sugar levels, which contributed to reoccurring, prolonged (and quite painful) yeast infections.	F	20	6  months	5/23/2009
1	bi polar	This was the worst medicine ever. I tried it for 6 weeks, starting at 2mg, and by the end of the time taking 15mg. My body would not stop moving. I couldnt read a book or watch TV. I found myself taking too many sleeping pills (and i never take sleeping pills) to counteract the movement so that i could fall asleep. This medicine should be used as a torture technique!!. The the doctor gave me sleep meds, and blood pressure medication to help with the Abilify side effects.(the blood pressure meds were supposed to make me stop moving...) So she had me on three medications! (NOt to mention this medicine is extremely overpriced!) You couldn'tpay me to take this medicine again. I am on Lamictal 25mg (a very low dose) and its a miracle. I bet this medicine will be pulled soon. It was just like a poison! Be very careful trying this medication.		M	39	6  weeks	5/19/2009
2	depression and ptsd	inner restlessness and desire to drink or eat	i took this for about two monts along with wellbutrin and at first had a hard time staying awake during the day.  after that passed i began wanting to drink so badly it was driving me nuts.  i began to drink to control the restlessness i felt because i was climbing the walls in my house just trying to get away from myself.  i quit taking it a week again and with just the wellbutrin i feel much better.	F	29	7  weeks	5/18/2009
5	Depression	Feeling a little "speedy" mentally, waking up early (4am), weight gain (about 10-15lbs) in 2mos.  Sometimes I feel overtired and not able to sleep enough to catch up.	I was depressed and Cymbalta was not helping---I could not motivate myself to do anything, even just taking a shower was hard.  Went back to Effexor XR (150mg) which had helped before with 5mg of Abilify and I could almost immediately feel the difference.  Wish I felt a little more energy physically, but I do feel a lot better.	F	48	2  months	5/16/2009
3	psychosis/spirit possession	weight gain, perhaps constipation, perhaps insomnia	I've been taking Abilify for 3 years and liked it the most of all the anti-psychotics I tried. Resperidol made me gain a lot of weight quickly. And Haldol was abominabal - I ate constanly and got ridid muscles, but that was also from all the anti-psychotics I tried. The key for me was finding the right DOSAGE, which was much lower than my doctor put me on originally. 5mg Abilify was just right, but I've been gaining more and more weight over the years and want to go off it due to this serious problem. It did however, protect me from the spirit invasion or what others call "voices" or "hallucinations". The risk of psychosis is one problem by going off of it, but so is diabetes and obesity, as well as other side effects from staying on it. I have weighed the consequences and made my choice. I will add that I'm perturbed with my doctor for not monitoring my weight while I've been on this drug. I think he doesn't want to see that it causes obesity.	F	46	3  years	5/13/2009Email
5	Bipolar Disorder	None that I know of	It has saved my life.	F	42	2  years	5/12/2009
4	Schizofrenia/Severe Anxiety Mix	Extreme dizziness & Muscle Tremors.	It works well, don't get me wrong. I switched from Invega. I'm on only 10mg and will probably switch to 25mg by next fill up. Totally helps with the anxiety and works well as an antidepressant. I've been able to focus more, but i'm also on Vyvanse for ADHD. I've had no suicidal thoughts what-so-ever. 10mg is a bit low, in my opinion anyway. Also, if you take any anti-psychotics, through my experience, for a month straight, the side effects generally seem to wear a bit off.	M	15	1  weeks	5/8/2009
1	Depresstion	Facial tics - blinking, tongue thrusts to the point where I had sores in my mouth, muscle stiffness, joint pain.  Uncontrollable muscle movements, twitching, jerking. Fatigue.	This medication was the worst thing that I ever took.  I had "parkinson syndrome" from it.  The facial tics & tongue thrusts lasted over a year.  I had to take Vitamin E for the past 18 months to get rid of them.  I still have blinking tics.  My daughter's doctor wanted her to try it(in small doses) but I refused. This was a horrible experience for me.	F	44	6  months	5/8/2009Email
4	bi-polar depression	Week 1: very slight weight gain -- about 2 lbs. that seems to have leveled off; a few days of extreme fatigue. Overall: slightly irritated stomach (I believe this makes me eat more, and is responsible for the weight gain), lighter sleeping, more sleep disturbances. I used to sleep like a log. Now I sleep like a cat. I miss my old sleep.	I was on abilify once before. The doc took me off due to my "speedy" response. But I have ADD, and I really liked the abilify. New doc is a-ok with my response, so long as it works for me. I'm also on Adderall and Welbutrin. Since starting this drug, I actually feel like doing things rather than just thinking about doing them and then thinking that I'll never finish and then getting depressed and hating myself. I'm more social. Self esteem is better too. Disruptive and ruminative thoughts are way down. Overall, I like.	F	33	16  days	5/7/2009
5	Bipolar 2	Initially stiffness and emotionless face, subsided within weeks.	This drug is a God-send to my 9 year old without it he would likely be in the hospital.  Almost totally normal with it.	M		15  months	5/6/2009
1	depression	facial tics where my left side of my face moved with my inability to stop it, my legs felt like they were filled with lead and I didnt want to work out anymore, my feet tingled and my toes hurt this was the creepiest drug I have ever taken	I felt happy but the side effects were so horrible it wasnt worth being happy (and that says a lot) I'm on wellbutrin and pristiq and this medication was a nightmare. My psych really pushed for me to take it and I had to really stand up for myself to say no. Dont let the commercial fool you and keep trying other drugs cuz abilify is poison	F		2  months	5/6/2009
3	anxiety, bi polar, chest pain	i can barely do anything...i just want to sleep until it hurts.  while sleeping i feel as if i am on a trampoline, i just toss and turn and bounce.  today(day 4) i feel jittery.	i was put on abilify because i was having panic attacks and feeling as if i was having heart attacks.  tight chest and trouble breathing, er visits.  doc thinks its in my mind and that im bipolar.  i cant believe that chest pain so severs is mental.  i havent had a bad attack yet but i feel as if i will collapse, i hope this tired dead-battery feeling goes away or i cant take it, i have a 2 month old.	M	36	4  days	5/4/2009Email
4	Bipolar Disorder	weight gain, inner restlessness.	I've been on lamictal, seroquel, and geodon since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder two months ago.  Each of those medicines gave me horrible side effects.  Abilify is the only medicine that has helped.  I am calmer, do not have my angry and irritable outbursts.  I'm also a self-injurer and haven't done anything since a couple days being on this medicine.  The downfall, I've been on this medicine for 2 weeks and I've gained 12lbs.	F	23	2  weeks	5/3/2009
2	Bipolar 2	Insomnia, wide awake every hour or two; impulsivity, shopping, eating, speaking; 15lb weight gain in 1 month; became nearly inarticulate, could not convey my thoughts or feelings very well at all; hypomania	I took Ability for a month as an adjunct Zoloft 100mg, which has stopped working.  In term of relief from the depression, the Ability worked wonderfully.  Because of the side effects, I dropped from my initial dose of 5mg to 2mg, and the depressive symptoms/suicidality returned nearly immediately.  After bumping back up to 4-4.5mg, the side effects returned.  This med may be tolerable for others but the side effects were intolerable for me.	F	36	1  months	5/2/2009
5	Bi Polar Disorder, Psychosis	Weight Gain (15 lbs in 6 months)	My daughter is doing EXTREMELY well on Abilify. Her rapid cycling is nearly zero. Her psychosis is also tremendously better. The change is almost as if she is a different kid. She went from extreme  mania episodes that cycled at times within minutes. To near stable in her moods in just days after beginning this medication. Her doctor wants to change her to Geodon due to the weight gain. Weight was never an issue for her until she started taking Abilify. But I think with the improvement in her mental stability a little weight gain is not that significant. I love this medication. She was on 5mg per day up to 7.5 per day after 2 months. It's effectiveness wore off at about 2 months in. No problems since upped to 7.5mg a day. She has no trouble sleeping. I didnt realize how her mania was affecting her sleep until starting this medicine and she is actually tired when it's time for bed. No complaints from me.	F	7	6  months	4/26/2009Email
2	Bipolar	Severe akathesia!  The restlessness drove me up a wall.  I also experienced word loss, short-term memory loss, stiff muscles and joints, tremors in my left hand (I'm left-handed), raised body temperature, weight gain (15 pounds in 4 months), no sex drive, increased breast size with milk coming out of them, fatigue during the day and sleeplessness at night. I took Abilify before I want to bed.  I have tried almost every dose: 30mg, 20mg, 10mg, 5mg and 2mg.  At 5mg and above I experienced euphoria that made me feel like I could probably jump off of a building for fun and be o.k.  At doses below 5mg I still experienced all of the side effects (except for the euphoria)and became extremely irritable and hostile, but otherwise I had no emotions.	To be fair, my paranoia went away. This was the only medication I was taking.	F	45	4  years	4/23/2009
2	Bipolar Disorder	Brain fog, Stiff muscles, inability to ever sit still or relax,	Abilify caused me to not be able to relax my muscles and I was always uncomfortable.  I had a hard time sleeping at night.  Wasn't what I expected. I had to go off of it becuase my grades in school started to drop.	F	23	2  weeks	4/17/2009
5	Mixed bipolar		I have been on Abilify for 2 years with no side effects. It has stabalized my mood along with Tegretal and Pristiq. While my antidepressant often stops working or has to be adjusted in the dose, the Abilify 10 mg has worked for me. I take all my meds at bedtime and sleep well, have no appetite increase or weight gain(terrible wt. gain on Depakote that I have since  lost), no nausea, dizziness, or vivid dreams. For me it's a life saver and I'm able to continue to work at a high functioning capacity.	F	60	2  years	4/16/2009
4	Suicidal thoughts	My mouth is dry and i've noticed i'm not hungry but my muscles ached terribly for the first two weeks.	I'm glad I didn't listen to the scary potential side effects. On abilify I feel even but I still feel emotions only I dont think about how much I hate myself anymore. I'm surprised at how this has worked so far.	F	35	2  months	4/16/2009
3	depression, over fatigue & stress	at first my husband take zyprexa but his doctor changed it to abilify due to gaining his weight. after a week i notice that my husband became restless and move or walk like a robot, though he can sleep he always tell me that he tired very easy as well his muscles. his craving more than before so his cholesterol became higher. so i decided to stop taking abilify and i noticed that my husband movement became normal.		M	33	13  days	4/16/2009
3	aggression & phycotic eppisodes	Tiredness, sleeplessness, extreme fluid retention. pain in the left side of neck	My son has DownSyndrome and a level of Autism, he has also been diagonised as having Psyschotic eppisodes, He gets very aggressive He has been on Risperdal(disasterous). Zyprexa(worked on the outbursts, but huge weight gain,and the threat of him developing Diabetes) He's been on Abilify now fo thirteen days but I'm getting very concerned about side effects, So I'm now considering stopping the drug, It has helped keep him calm, but at what risk to his health,We are running out of options for him	M	18	13  days	4/15/2009Email
3	bi polar /anxiety	jittery restlesness cant sleep	i am also taking lamectal and added abilify to help with continued depression the depression has subsided but the jitteryness and lack of sleep are annoying and i am not sure i can deal with it makes working hard when i keep feeling these "twitches" inside my body  am going to speak to my DR about changing to another med  i am not impressed with abilify	F	29	7  days	4/14/2009

5	mind racing, bi polar	none	completely made me a different person, I felt normal after 20 years of struggling with depression and paranoia. I also use this with celexa which works for me too	M	37	1  months	4/7/2009
3	Resistant Depression/Anxiety	15 lbs weight gain.  Restlessness.  Chronic insomnia.  Night binging (and subsequent purging to curb weight gain).	Ironically, this drug (5 mg to 2 mg with 150 mg of Wellbutrin XR and 20 mg of Adderral XR) helped my self-confidence in social situations by minimizing my anxiety and shutting off my self-critic -- despite shattering my self-image (as a result of relentless weight gain).  At my best, I didn't care.  I shopped nonstop -- because I was constantly gaining weight (in reality) and my clothes no longer fit me.  In my case, my doctor did not listen to my threshold for weight gain.  In two years, I gained 20 lbs with various antidepressants.  Desperate to gain some resemblance of myself back, I began purging.  In the eight months that I have been (on/off) the Abilify, I have vacillated from hypomanic (on) to hopelessly depressed (off).  In fact, the spiraling phase upon quitting the drug (without compliance) has translated to increased anxiety (and dependence on Xanax) and debilitating depression. I do not recommend this drug to young women whose self-image is inextricably related to their appearance in anyway.	F	33	8  months	4/1/2009
3	Depression	Speedy manic feeling, shakiness, feeling like I couldn't sit still, a little nausea in the beginning, craving for sweets at night, WEIGHT GAIN.	I was already taking Prozac for depression but still having depression symptoms, so the Dr. prescribed Abilify to supplement the Prozac. In the beginning, this medicine really helped to pull me out of the funk that I was in.  I felt energized, productive, and like my overall attitude was very much improved.  After a couple or 3 weeks, however, I noticed that I was gaining weight at an alarming rate.  In the 2 months that I took this drug, (at a low dose of 1mg/day) I gained over 15 lbs!  I also felt strangely like shopping and spending money all of the time, almost like I was having a manic episode. All in all, I felt much less depressed, but stopped taking for fear of becoming REALLY overweight. Note: after I stopped this drug, I felt more depressed than ever and almost suicidal.  If you stop, you should probably taper off gradually!	F	45	2  months	3/29/2009Email
5	pediatric anxiety/possible bipolar	nausea & headache for the first few days. Also, tired during the day for 1st week. otherwise, none.	This medication has worked wonderfully for my daughter. She has been on it 3 weeks and for the first time in her life I heard she had a "wonderful" week at school. The side effects are most definately tolerable and my daughter says this medication changed her life. Parents-don't be afraid to try it. I know everything on this site sounds bad, but it has been a Godsend to my family.	F	8	3  weeks	3/20/2009
3	Post Tramatic Syndrome & OCD	I wake up several times in the night and am not able to go back to sleep usually for an hour or so.  I have never had this problem in the past.  I have also been very restless and am not able to stay focused on one task for two long.  I have to be doing something that is keeping me very busy.  I have also noticed increased anxiety with this medication.		M	36	1  months	3/15/2009
2	adjunct to depression therapy	I am incredibly sleepy. I can not function in this state.		F	23	2  days	3/12/2009
4	psychotic episode	filling a little dizzy the first day	after 2 years from  my first episode I had to change from solian to abilify due to sides effects(waight gain ).So far it helps me	F	40	6  days	3/5/2009
5	manic/psychotic episode	restlessness at first, waking up several times in night	Switched to it from risperidone, 4 months after a manic/psychotic episode. I was depressed on the risperidone but depression lifted on aripiprazole (an antidepressant was also added). Didn't have the demotivation and lethargy I experienced on risperidone.	M	24	9  months	2/24/2009
3	autism  bipolar	painful erection of penis	My 6 year old son never had a problem with erections until taking Abilify.  Then it happened all the time and was very painful.  The doctors would not believe me that this was happening - even though it is rare side effect.  His behaviour settled down on the abilify; but we have not seen an increase in bad behaviour since taking him off the med.	M	6	3  months	2/21/2009
1	Bi-Polar	Could not sit still.  Felt confused.  When I say I couldn't sit still I mean it.  This drug had me jittery, and it was the worst feeling I have ever had in my life.  Sit down to watch TV, standing up thirty seconds later.  To come off the drug was worse then the side effects of the drug while taking it.	Be very careful of this drug, it is very powerful, and it takes a good month to get it out of your system.	M	38	4  months	2/21/2009
1	Depression	I went from being moderately depressed, to feeling suicidalwithin 2 weeks. Acute anxiety and paranoia followed.	This is a very dangerous drug.	F	41	16  days	2/20/2009
4	Depression	Insomnia	I started taking this b/c my regular depression just wasn't doing the job. Now I take 2mg of abilify and 150mg of Effexor XR and I haven't felt this good in months. Absolutely no side effects from the abilify except difficulty staying asleep during the night. That's why I gave it a 4. It did exactly what it was supposed to do! Thank goodness!!!!	F	31	20  days	2/13/2009
4	Bipolar and Schizophrenia	None that I can directly attribute to Abilify	I have been taking Abilify for over 2 years now. As a result, I can no longer remember what it felt like to not be on it or what it actually does for me when I take it. It is just another drug that I pop twice a day. 15mg twice a day for a total of 30mg. I do know that my hallucinations are very minimal from what they used to be. But I still hear voices and see things on occasion that are very disturbing.	M	36	2  years	2/5/2009
1	depression	weight gain	I gained 35lbs in 6 months... it helped with my mood swings but when my psych told me it was why I was gaining weight, I went off it.... i hate it =( Now I'm left almost 40lbs overweight	F	22	6  months	2/5/2009
3	depression	weight gain = 60 lbs in 1 yr, craving sweets, developed pre-diabetic condition, BANKRUPTED ME AS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE	I've suffered with intractable depression for decades and have been on just about every medication ever made.  After years of working with an extremely competent, caring psychiatrist, he placed me on a 2 drug combination of 60mg/daily of Cymbalta and 15 mg/every other day of Abilify and, for the first time in a very long time, I do not experience the terrible lows which with I previously struggled.  Now, if I could just lose the weight I gained.....I'd feel much, much better.  Please do not construe this medication combination as a CURE.  I AM better; BUT, I still struggle with depression...just not as often.	F	50	4  years	2/3/2009
5	Depression	No perceptable side effects. This medicine stabelized me and provided some lift. I am taking it along with anafrinil and cymbalta.		M	46	2  weeks	2/1/2009
