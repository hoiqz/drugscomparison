5	Antihistamine/ Anxiety	I was drowsy when I took it, so I took it at bedtime. Then I found I could tolerate it in the daytime as I continued to take it for sinus allergies, and gave me a somewhat anti anxiety effect.	I like this medication and use it 50mg 3 times a day. I am normally very agitated and shaky person, from some nerve damage in my head. Vistaril is a wonderful for allergies, I don't get sleepy and have little or no anxiety problems now.

1	I had an allergic reaction	I have Lupus and have no immune system and I also have chronic bronchitis.  Hydroxyzine Pamoate affected my breathing.	Maybe it should be contraindicated in someone like me that has chronic bronchitis.	F	63	1  days	7/25/2009
4	Anti-anxiety	Still foggy & depressed, but I absolutely CAN'T have a panic attack.	It was great for panic attacks (and allergies, hah)	F	17	6  weeks	1/7/2007
