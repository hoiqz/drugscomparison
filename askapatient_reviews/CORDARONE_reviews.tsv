1	aterial fib	Induced thyroid toxiciti,myopathy,dry skin on face sudden cardiac arrest,heart attack and much more..and yes im alive and still suffering to tell the story..beware of this drug.		M	40	6  years200mg	9/15/2012Email
5	Ventricular Tachycardia	Typical side effects for me are, decreased Thyroid function leading to higher cholesterol. For this I need to take 100mcg of Orixine to increase thyriod function. I sunburn easily, and must "slip,slop,slap" all the time. Cordorone may possibly causing retina problems in left eye, not too bad though.	Have been taking 150mg (200mg tablet broken in 2. Half one day and a full tablet the following day)for 17 years. Had ICD fitted 5 years ago. Increased to 200mg per day, as ICD was reacting more than I would like. After 2nd cathater ablation 2 years ago, I have enjoyed a clean bill of health. Now taking 150mg/day (just in case). I'm now back into active physical sports. My cardiologist doesn't want to remove the ICD...just in case. I don't have a problem with that.I'm very sorry to hear that some folks have had problems with this medication. It has been good for me.	M	53	17  years150mg 1X D	8/1/2011Email
5	AFIB AFLUTTER, PE	None ascribed to this drug, as others mentioned I have been prescribed additional meds at same time.  Halo during loading at 400 Mg.  Now at 300 Mg, no halos.	The episodes of AFIB and Flutter have been reduced with this drug, stamina returning to normal, which did not occur with CCB or BB alone.  Also on Metaprolol now.  Had CV but that lasted only 3 days, will try another after 5 months on cordarone.  The 3 days without AFib/Flutter were heaven on earth, after 5 years of episodes, this drug has been a second best thus far.	M	53	64  days	8/7/2008
1	Prescribed after stent procedure	This medicine was prescribed for my Dad following placement of a stent in a blood vessel leading to his heart in March 2007. At the same time, the heart doctor put him on metoprolol, plavix, vytorin and regular strength aspirin. Since that time he has not been the same person. He has had no energy, tingling in his hands, frequent urination at night, tiredness, cognitive trouble, eye problems, back pain, dizziness when getting out of bed in the morning, and more. This month his regular family doctor took him off of the vytorin, did an ekg, and faxed it to the heart doctor suggesting strongly that he be taken off of the amiodarone (cordarone). This doctor said that this is a DANGEROUS drug.	I've gone to various sites on the web and they've all mentioned that this drug should only be used in life-threatening situations. It is not to be used lightly and has many, many side effects. I know that medication is probably necessary following stent procedure, but I can't believe the amount that doctors prescribe to their patients. The heart doctor did his own ekg, ordered a stress test and cardiogram. He did not want to take my Dad off the amiodarone, but when my Dad asked how he was supposed to pass a stress test in his weakened condition, the doctor took him off both it and the metoprolol. I'm sure he'll want him to begin taking them again after the tests. Don't know what to do in that case? Its only been a couple of days since he's been off of them, and he already seems to feel better. He didn't have back pain today and the morning dizziness is gone.	M	75	16  months	7/24/2008Email
4	Sustained VT	floaters, blurred vision, blue splotches (too much sun), halo vision, increases INR (coumadin)	This is a miracle drug, I have been on almost all of the antiarrythmic drugs and none worked, ICD kept going off, until after my 2nd Ablation (that did not work) I have been on 300MG daily for the last year and I get all the test to make sure nothing happens but I am happy with the time that this medicine has given me without shocks from my ICD. If you want to talk or  some support give me a shout...	F	35	1  years	7/22/2008Email
4	Atrial Fibrillation	None	Cured AF completely, at the beginning with 200 mg per day (4 months) now with 100 mg.  Seems effective in my case.	M	55	9  months	2/18/2008
1	A-Fib	Death	This drug killed me at the age of 72, one month after I retired and three weeks before my 50th wedding anniversary.  It essentially napalmed my lungs over the course of a month.  Then I languished on a respirator for three weeks as one organ after the other failed due to its extraodinary half-life. My wife finally put me in hospice with a DNR.  I lasted 30 minutes.  Amiodarone is white-hot death.	M	72	30  days	1/30/2008
1	Arrhythmia	My father was perscribed this drug for arrhythmia.  It caused acute interstitial pneumonitis and, after putting him three weeks on a respirator, it killed him.	Be advised, this drug can kill you.  Hold your doctor's feet to the fire if he prescribes this for you.  If this advice saves just one person, then Dad won't have died in vein.	M	44	30  days	1/25/2008
2	A-Fib	Started taken before cardio-version (loading dosage). Now out of A-Fib and taking 200mg daily. Have most of all side effects.After taking this drug I become very sleepy and rest about 12 hours per day.		M	49	5  months	1/14/2008
5	VT	At higher doses I got halo vision and elevated liver enzymes. All doses cause sun sensitivity.	Miracle drug for me but it still makes me nervous. Completely supressed my VT where Sotolol did not!! I'm on an extremely low dose now - 200 mg 3 times a week - and it still works!	M	51	2  years	11/24/2007
2	atrtial fibrillation	lack of coordination, fatigue, ataxia, dizziness, insomnia, abnormal gait	This drug really did a number on me. I could hardly function after a few days on it. Driving, walking, even getting dressed in the morning became major challenges. It was very disorienting, even frightening. Discontinued after about a week.	M	57	7  days	8/31/2007
5	ATRIAL  FIBRILLATION	INITIALLY, SEVERE CONSTIPATION.  RECOMMEND BREAKING THE DAILY DOSAGE INTO 3 SEGMENTS AND TAKING EACH PIECE AT THE MIDPOINT OF EACH MEAL.  THIS SEEMS TO REDUCE THE CONSTIPATION AND INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DRUG. LIVER TESTS SLIGHTLY ELEVATED AND BEING WATCHED BY MY PHYSICIAN.	FOR ME IT IS A MIRACLE DRUG ESPECIALLY SINCE ELECTRICAL CONVERSION WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.  THE ADDITION  OF  50MG TOPROL XL PER DAY ALLOWED THE AMIODARONE DOSAGE TO BE LOWERED TO 100MG PER DAY.  BEEN ON THIS DRUG FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS. AT BREAKFAST I DRINK PRUNE JUICE AND EAT ALL BRAN TO REDUCE CONSTIPATION.	M	67	1825  days	11/1/2006
1	A-FIB	VISION DETERIORATION, INTERFERRED WITH THYROID REPLACEMENT	I WOULD NEVER TAKE THIS MEDICINE UNLESS LAST RESORT.  MANY SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS	F	56	2  months	12/8/2005
4	betapace no longer effective	lightheadedness, fatigue, nausea but am taking several new drugs do can't necessarily blame this one.	IT seems to work where sotalol no longer did.	M	66	33  days	11/24/2005
1	non sustained tachycardia	fever, achy all over, jaundice, sleeplessness, sorethroat.Hate it.  Red face.  No sun, Off of it now.		M	56	 	10/10/2005
4	Atrial Fibrillation	Need to urinate several times at night disrupted sleep	Was effective in eliminating my atrial fibrillation symptoms after my first ablation. Replaced Rythmol.	M	50	8  months	9/20/2005
2	vt's	My skin has turned blue caused by being out in the sun,45 sunblock used but didn't help.my vt's continues.I was on 200mg twice a day for 4 years		M	64	4  years	7/19/2005Email
1	Tachycardia	Elevated liver readings, lack of energy and strength, listlessness, shortness of breath, weakness.	This is a very dangerous drug and should be used as last resort and the side effects need to be carefully monitored or it can cause organ damage and kill you.	M	76	15  years	5/11/2005Email
2	post surgical med CABG	Coughing, constant coughing whenever I tried to speak. I was on 800 mg to control AF after bypass surgery. I still had to be hospitalized again to control the AF. Dotor has kept me on 200mg for the past month to keep the AF in check .... might be doing some good. At least the coughing disappeared after the dosage was lowered.		M	52	4  months	4/23/2005
1				M	60	1  years	10/31/2004
3	post surgical  atrial flutter	low energy, horrible upper body muscle spasms, labored breathing naseau	very strong..only recommend if there are no safer options	F		4  months	1/5/2003

1	for cardio myophia problems	amiodarone induced fibrosis of the lungs and liver problems	whilst the cordarone seemed to assist the problem it was prescribed for the side effects resulted in a 3 weeks spell in hospital and I am still receiving treatment.I still do not know if the drug caused permanent damage to my lungs	M	67	5  months	10/27/2002Email
