5	blood pressure control	It is the only medicine that has controlled my blood pressure with no side effects. Lopressor made my lips and face swell		M	69	15  years240/40 2X D	9/1/2010Email
3	high blood pressure	Uncontrollable cough. It got worse over the months that I used it. Finally had to switch meds.	It's very expensive.	M	47	3  years	1/20/2010
3	hypertension and rapid heart rate	pounding heart; chest pressure; shortness of breath,poor sleep	I have taken Tarka 2 for almost 2 years.  After losing 30 lbs, I started to have side effects. Prior to weight loss, Tarka successfully controlled my blood pressure and heart rate with no problems. I now take a diuretic and have no side effects.	F	58	2  years	5/14/2009
2	hypertension	developed an almost constant hacking dry cough, which is a well known side effect of ACE inhibitors.  I couldn't go anywhere without coughing.  Did lower BP but MD changed it to an ARB.	Tarka is a brand named combination pill, very expensive.  Ask your MD for generic Verapamil, and generic Trandolapril.  Same exact meds only at at least 1/2 the price.	F	50	3  years	12/29/2008
4	BP	Dry Cough	Works for me	M		3  years	8/6/2008
3	Hypertension	Sleeplessness	Started taking 4/240 after Mavik 4mg didn't control pressure. Took it at night so AM pressure wouldn't be high. Worked, but couldn't sleep. Now taking it in the AM, but pressure isn't controlled as well. Dr. considering a change.	F	61	2  years	1/21/2008
4	high blood pressure	dry, hacking cough during the night, loss of sex drive, fatigue	Immediately lowered my blood pressure to a normal level	F	39	1  years	9/24/2007
2	high blood pressure	Loss of sex drive , doesnot control blood bressure for very long,causes a lot of sleepyness, Joint pain dailey, un sure if it contributes to otherproblems such as constipation. feel draged out and tire all time.	Have been taking one tablet dailey 4/240mg seems to cause more problems than it helps. have been on this for aver 3 years so I would think there has been plenty of time to adjust to and & all changes it causes. seems to only work for about 6 hours then any activity cause blood pressure to climb again.

5	High Blood Pressure	At first I was quite tired.I had little energy.  After taking the drug for about 2 weeks, everything was back to normal again.	After being on 4 different medications, this one controls my B/P perfectly.  It was 140/90, but now it is 124/70.  No side effects whatsoever.	F	60	1  years	4/11/2007
2	High Blood Pressure	headaches, nausua, anxiety, pounding heart at times, sluggish at times, constipation, dry coughing (Dr said it was a common side effect)	Dr. started me on 2/180 for blood pressure at 140/80. While on Tarka bp was up and down, but avg of 130/80. Discontiuned it due to nausua feeling everyday, making it hard to eat daily. Headaches in the begining were terrible, but after 4 days reduced to managable headaches. Was taking Tarka, 2 Advil, and Prilosec daily.	M	30	20  days	2/8/2007
1	High blood pressure	Headaches, blurred vision, no stamina, grey/green palor to skin color, blood pressure erratic, high (140/100)then(120/80)within few minutes/ reduced libido(sex drive), blotchy patches of skin upper body, just to list a few!	I have stopped this medication, tapering off, and then using herbal/vitamin supplements, reversed the side effects, which took some time to completly go away, and I feel much better then when on Tarka, and have mostly an acceptable BP in the 120/130 OVER 80/90 range, which is better, most of the time, then when on Tarka.

4	high blood pressure	dry cough at the beginning, still have headaches but not as bad, have had some constipation, currently experencing hot flashes, very tired, can't seem to get in the sun b/c if I get too hot I get dizzy and can feel my heart beat throbbing through my body, I have also gained about 15 pounds since taking this medicine....I was not a small woman when I started taking this med and really didn't need to gain any weight...I would like to be able to find something that can counter the weight gain...	my blood pressure has gone down drastically but really would like to be able to get in the sun	F	29	4  weeks	6/1/2006
5	Hypertension	A little dry cough and a little constipation at the start, but now that I've adjusted to the med, I'm doing well on it.

1	hypertension	systolic number worsened with tarka. tried 2/240mg...didnt work so we tried 4/240mg and bp was even worse. I wouldnt reccommend to anyone.		F	33	20  days	5/2/2005
1	hypertension	Joint pain, reduced sex drive, impotence.  Lotension worked as well, with no side effects.  My Doctor fell victim to the savvy talk of a drug salesman.  Even driving a car became a chore due to joint pain, and doing yard work was impossible		M	42	80  days	4/24/2005
2	Hypertention	Joint pain, reduced sex drive.  This medicine reduced my BP to on average 160/85.  Did nothing for the top number, but reduced the bottom.	I have never experienced joint pain or back pain except very rarely until taking Tarka.	F	53	10  months	4/18/2005
1	mild hypertension	joint pain, impotence	Doctor said I was diabetic (A1c never over 5) and changed to this.  Doesn't control my BP even at double dose (2-240 bid), too strong a diuretic element, and impotence at age 53.  Firing the Doc and going back to Tenormin or Tenoretic - they worked.	M	53	2  years	4/5/2005
2	hypertension	dry coughing started the same day i started it		F	34	 	1/14/2005
1	high blood pressure/migraines	awareness of heart pounding, rapid pulse, almost manic feelings and blood pressure did not drop	I have been on a beta blocker for a long time and I was taken off it and put on this.
