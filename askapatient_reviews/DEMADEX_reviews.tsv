1	Edema/fluid retention	These pills caused paralysis in less than 12 hours after I took the first (and only) one.  Woke up and could not move my hands.  They were locked in fists.  My speech was slurred and my facial muscles were also locked.  I could barely walk.  I had to be transported to the ER via ambulance where I received a potassium IV.  These pills had depleted my potassium level to 2.5.  I had another attack of paralysis in the ER.  Do not take these pills unless your doctor has checked your potassium levels before prescribing.  Mine did not and this was the most terrifying experience of my life.  I will never, ever take these again.		F	29	1  days20 mg	2/13/2013
