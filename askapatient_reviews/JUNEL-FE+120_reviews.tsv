1	Period birth control	I have been on this pill for a year it has caused slurred vision, mood swings/depression I have distant myself from all my friends. I get very annoyed and I have a short temper and I had none of these symptoms before taking this pill. Tremendous weight gain. I do like the light periods which are usually 3 days long. Every morning I feel nauseas as if I'm pregnant. My sex drive is low. My energy has decreased. I think everyone is talking about me or doesn't like me just by one simple look and I take everything personal. Do not take this pill unless your ready to deal with all the side effects that come with this pill.		F	20	1  years20Mg	1/11/2013
2	Period & Birth control	Weight gain (about 6 lbs), no changes in period, DEPRESSION.		F	15	4  months	1/8/2013
1	Birth control	I want start off saying that I gave this pill 3 months bc that's the recommended amount of time for your body to adjust. Three months too long! This pill is awful! The third month was actually the worst. I read the reviews before taking it and after my Dr prescribed it to me. I was scared bc of all the negative reviews, but I understand everyone reacts differently, so I gave it a chance. The only positive thing about this pill was that my period was light and short. 2-3 days and light bleeding, but my period never came on the same day and sometimes started a week early. I had severe moodiness and would get so angry about the littlest things. I would even ask myself why I was getting so upset. I gained 10-15 lbs during the 3 months of being on this pill. I was bloated from the first couple of days being on this pill. I slowly became very depressed and withdrew from people bc every little thing would upset me or annoy me. My face broke out do easily. I read a few people saying they need to take this pill off the market and I thought they were being dramatic, but now I totally agree with them! I've been off the pill for only 3 days now and starting to feel back to my normal self. Thank goodness! I gave energy and not feeling depressed or bloated. I honestly felt pregnant on this pill between the bloating and crazy mood swings. I'll be switching back to Ortho Tri Cyclen next month. Giving my body time to adjust from not taking this pill. I'm writing this to warn others about this		F	28	3  months	1/8/2013

1	Birth control	Feel like I'm pregnant, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, sore boobs, cramps, and bloating. I expected to be somewhat used to this medicine by now because I was on Loestrin and had no funny side effects. This is crazy!!		F	20	7  days1/20 fe	10/28/2012

1	birth control	nipple sensitivity, felt bloated all the time, gained weight	Was on Loestrin 24 Fe for about 5 years.. I really liked it but I stopped getting my period which I thought was unhealthy so my doctor put me on this pill. My nipples are extremely sensitive and tender, I always feel bloated and have gained weight. I just stopped taking the pills two days ago and will see how it goes.	F	20	3  months 1X D	6/3/2012
3	Started having sex	Reallyyyyyy baddddd acne...ughhh...such to my stomach for the first few days....headache for the first few days, very emotional and moody.		F	27	1  months20 mg	6/2/2012Email
2	prevent pregnancy	spotting, nausea, bloating, breast/nipple tingling and tenderness, acne	I began Junel-Fe because Loestrin 24 was giving me erratic periods. That was the only side effect though. Junel-fe, in comparison, gives me way more side effects. I do get my period as expected with it which is the only thing I like about it. The first month took Junel-Fe, I actually thought I pregnant because it felt like it! I think my breasts were even more tender than when I truly was pregnant. They tingled like when I breastfed...weird. Now, that I have been on it 3 months, I notice that I have acne worse than I've ever had it. It is the the kind that is a bunch of bumps grouped togetherIt isn't the big kind of pimples, but it still bothers me. Going to ask doctor to switch again. Not happy with it. i have been on several kinds of bc before and never had breakouts this bad.	F	30	3  months1/20 1X D	5/23/2012Email
2	birth control	I have experienced an increase in appetite.  I would like to know if this happen to anyone? I crave food every two hours.  I was on Loestrin 24 Fe for two years, and I loved it. No side effects or anything.  I switched because loestrin was $24 and Junel is free for me.		F	18	5  days 1X D	3/7/2012Email
2	Menstrual regularity	Enlarged and tender breasts, weight gain, acne, irregular periods, rashes, and wake up with swollen face. I didn't have these problems before. My doctor said to wait 6 months!		F	35	2  months	12/7/2011
4	Period Regulation	I have breast tenderness and at first had some weight gain, although I soon lost it.	I have been taking it for about a year with minimal problems.  I started taking it because I would get extremely sick when I started my period (cramps, dizziness, profuse sweating, weak, throwing up).  Now I am finding that I no longer have a sex drive and am continuously spotting.  I still think that this is a great birth control; however, I'm going to try something a little stronger in hopes that it will smooth out the newly arisen side effects.	F	19	1  years 1X D	5/22/2011Email
1	BC	frequent yeast infections, foul odor, excessive sweating, night sweats, headaches, pain just behind my left eye, lower back pain, tremedendous weight gain, heart palpitations, dull pain on my left side running from my eye socket to the back of my arm, thigh, and down through my calf.	I never connected the symptoms until I read other people's responses.  When I first started the pill, I gained a lot of weight without changing my habits.  I never felt rested even when I went to sleep at 9:30 pm.  Eventually the other symptoms started as well.  I literally could feel my heart palpitating but it only happen for a few seconds and for a few times.  The eye pressure developed as well.  I remember searching google for what may be the cause for the dull pain or eye pressure.  When my left side began to feel weird, that's when I started searching for Junel side effects.  Everything I experienced was a side effect and I just never connected them until finding this web site.	F	34	9  months 1X D	12/30/2010
1	endometriosis	horrible cramps, dizziness	I normally take Microgestin/Loestrin and was given this poison as an alternative.  The cramps I experienced while on Junel were the worst I have ever experienced.  I had to take twice the recommended dosage of oxycodone just so I wasn't screaming in agony.  Do not take this medicine.	F	21	14  days1/20 1X D	11/16/2010
1	b.c.	longest, HEAVIEST periods of my life, 7+ days of constant, incessant flow (I've always had 3-4 day light periods before starting this rx); horrible bloating, increased appetite; I thought these symptoms would subside after a few periods, but have persisted to the point I cannot continue on this drug.		F	30	3  months20 1X D	8/19/2010
5	Heavy Flow	Slight breast tenderness at first. Occasional heavy periods. Gained about 7 lbs at first, but easily lost them.. Occasionally feel bladder infection symptoms.	I love this medicine. I like having a period every month and knowing exactly when it's coming.	F	18	3  years28 Day 1X D	4/12/2010Email
4	Birth Control	Small weight gain.  Occasional sore breasts.  Would often not have periods.	The no periods really freaked me out at first but I grew to enjoy the no or very tiny spot of blood.  This was pretty good but I wish it had helped me with my mood swings and I totally would still be on it.	F	23	6  months	9/13/2009
4	birth control	mild side effects, none that weren't managable.	the first month I was on it, my period was about 11 days.  the second month I was on it, my period was 1 day with no bleeding in between.  I have been pleased with the medication so far.  I have had no weight gain or acne problems.	F	31	2.5  months	8/10/2009
1	Birth control	Headaches, acne, vaginal tenderness, nausea, abdominal pains, mood swings	My gynocologist switched me from one Loestrin to the other, and the pharmacist automatically gave me the generic, Junel.  I have been taking it for 2 months and so far I have noticed that I am breaking out (which the Loestrin cleared up), I have headaches all the time, severe abdominal pain, and even some nausea.  I don't know why I switched from the Loestrin to begin with, this was supposed to give me "more control over my uterus" but so far it has done nothing but made me feel like crap.  I am going back to the Loestrin as soon as I finish this cycle.	F	21	2  months	11/13/2008
4	birth control	slight nausea in the first month of taking it and slightly more bloated just before my period each month	No problematic side effects and I loved that my period was only 1 or 2 days long.  I've stopped taking to to have another child but will likely go back on it afterwards.	F	29	1  years	8/28/2008
4	Birth Control, Regulate Period	The first 3 days I was on Junel, I felt sick to my stomach, but it went away after those first 3 days.  My boobs went from a B to a C cup.  I get random mood swings, but nothing too severe.  My period is lighter now.  I also seem to break out less.	It's a cheaper version of Loestrin.  I like it and plan to stay on it until we TTC.
