4	Hair loss	Itchy scabs, sores on scalp and much dandruff. Also heart doing strange things, fluttering, pounding, and sometimes clenching up in a painful mannor.	Nearly 30 and used it since I was about 20. Its kept hairloss at bay well enough. Stopped using the product for health concerns (it is a drug). Looking into non-drug solutions (baseball cap, scary head tattoo, hair plugs etc.)	M	28	9  years	4/18/2006Email
