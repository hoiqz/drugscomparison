1	sleep	Had a paradoxical reaction and hit tolerance w/d within a month. Suffered HORRIBLE sxs that I NEVER had before. Severe anxiety, depression, derealization, head pain, dizziness, blurred vision, cog impairment etc etc. My ignorant doctor ripped me off in a cold turkey and that was 5.5 year  s ago. I have been in a protracted state ever since.. I have healed approximately 30-40% and still suffering each day. This pill has DESTROYED my life the last 6 years. I have connected with hundreds of other people around the world who have experienced the exact thing as me. Never ever take any BENZODIAZAOINES. Most doctors are totally ignorant of their possible wd sxs and that they can last years for some. Google benzos wd and you will find documentation galore to substantiate this. There are numerous internet support groups which have literally saved my life. Dr. Heather Ashton is the guru of info of this. Please, do not ever take benzos as it has the potential to send you into a hell you have neve		M	45	10  months30mg 1X D	4/8/2013Email

1	Insomnia	Cooking and eating in my sleep.Memory Loss.	I was prescribed by my psychiatrist Temazepam to stop the insomnia. It worked for months, now all of a sudden for the past few weeks or so I began finding bowls and plates in my bed. My family told me last night I cooked and ate, and I cannot remember. My cousin told me today after telling her about this that she have noticed here in the past few weeks that I would forget what she told me an hour later.	F	41	7  months60 1X D	1/3/2012Email
4	chronic insomnia	None	I was prescribed Normisom (one of Temazepam's brand names in Australia) initially for insomnia related to anxiety/depression in 2006.  Although I have not suffered any depressive problems for the past 4 years, I developed chronic insomnia in June 2009, and have relied upon Normisom since then (my insomnia is so bad that I don't even fall asleep without drugs, and can be awake for over 24 hours straight).  I think this is an excellent sleep medication.  I have found it very effective and completely free from any side effects, and it does not interfere with any other medications (over the counter pain killers, vitamins/herbal remedies, Nexium) I have taken during this period.  My only comment is that it isn't as effective as it was initially after taking it constantly for going on 3 years (I did try Imovane as an alternative, but it lost its effectiveness after 3 months, and left a foul taste in my mouth in the mornings).  I don't know how I would manage without Temazapam in its various guises.  A very good, effective product.	M	58	3  years10mg 1X D	3/4/2011
4	Sleeplessness	None, perhaps sleeping an hour longer?	I am taking temazepam to counter sleeplessness associated with depression, on an irregular basis (anywhere between 3x in a week to once a month). It's nice in that there are no side effects for me and it helps to manage my occasional sleep problems. The only complaint I have is that it's been ineffective on some nights where I've felt particularly bad, but I am sure that a higher dosage would have helped with it.

5	waking at 2:00 or 3:00 a.m.	Some grogginess until my cup of coffee, but it's a relaxed grogginess, so not bad.	It gets me back to sleep when I wake in early morning (1-3:00a.m.). I have had to take breaks, usually a day or two, occasionally to keep it effective.  I recently learned that it works by increasing the efficiency of the brain's GABA receptors, so when the effectiveness started to diminish I began taking GABA (750 mg)along with it and it began working perfectly again.  I have not had to increase the doseage beyond the 7.5 mg I started with.  It gets me closer to natural unmedicated sleep than anything else I have tried.  I love it!

1	insomnia	depression got worst	helped for sleep but made depression really bad	M	47	10  days	9/9/2009
3	Sleep Aid	Although it helped me fall asleep, I felt horribly groggy the next day, and found that it was very difficult for me to function physically.	I don't recommend this drug. After discussing my discontent with the pharmacist, he recommended I take Ambien, or it's generic form Zolpidem.	M	57	7  days	7/29/2007
1	sleep problem	vicious headach the next day both times i took it	on the bright side, it did put me to sleep for several hours	M	46	2  days	12/12/2005
4	Trouble staying asleep	Makes you dizzy just before you fall asleep.	I have trouble staying asleep, I wake up after about 4 hours.  With this drug, I get about 7 straight hours of sleep.  I read it is addictive, so I only take it when I absolutely have to, not every night - maybe once every two weeks.	F	41	3  months	8/8/2005
4	sleepless nights	I did feel a bit dizzy. best to go to bed within 20 minutes after taking	I have been under a lot of stress this past year and found this to really help me get about 6 hours sleep. I try not to take them every night, so I probably take them 3times a week.	F	53	2  months	1/28/2005
