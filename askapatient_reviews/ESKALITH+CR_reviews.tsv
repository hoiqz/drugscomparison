3	Depression	Exessive water retention and swelling (after two weeks of use couldn't wear my regular shoes and was wearing pants two sizes larger than normal), moderate constipation	Due to the water retention I don't feel I was able to give this med a fair chance at working. I did see some positive impacts in my mood from the medication, but the swelling and water retention was unbearable.	F	27	3  weeks	1/29/2010

5	Bipolar	Some nausea, hand tremors, excessive thirst. NO WEIGHT GAIN- weight loss. Thyroid function got weird after about 5 years (testing both hyper- and hypo- over time) but that was managed and has leveled out to where I no longer need thyroid meds.	I love this drug! Have been switched around to a multitude of different medications over the past and finally am coming back to Lithium. I hate the others because of the potential for cognitive difficulties and other mental issues (nightmares, etc.); with Lithium the sides are purely physical. I suspect the dulling effect that some people are experiencing might be the lack of mania; don't know. I was very calm on Lithium. Check out how long people take Lithium compared to other drugs- its staying power can't be beat.	F	40	11  years	7/3/2008
5	Bipolar II	First day or two felt slightly drowsy.	I am very, VERY HAPPY with Lithium.  I wish I had taken it years ago but I succumbed to the stigma surrounding its use.  I have been on almost every single AD out there, all of the mood stabilizers (lamictal, topamax, tegretol...), I have been going through HELL since 2000 getting the proper med combo, and FINALLY the Lithium has been the one that works for me.  I have been on it a week.  On the third day I started to feel results.  The results I have noticed are I don't hurt, my body doesn't ache, and I am getting back to a regular sleep schedule, where I actually feel tired around 8 p.m., vs before I would get all energetic as the night wore on, and I never ended up getting enough sleep.  I don't feel scared or paranoid going outside, thinking people are staring at me or making fun of me .. I don't have those feelings or thoughts anymore.  It is WONDERFUL and I seriously recommend that anybody with BPD really consider taking it and letting it take effect.  BTW I am on 900 mg now and	M	34	7  days	5/8/2008Email
5	bipolar	gastroparesis - vomiting undigested food. nausea, bloating,	I also take 5mg olanzapine, 400mg lamotragine, 20mg citalopram.Would like to hear from anyone who has gastroparesis	F	50	4  years	12/20/2007Email
4	Bipolar II	Incredible thirst, woozy/dizzy feeling the first two days of each new dose increase, bad nausea, wet heaves, salivation the first week of taking the drug.  Mild whole body shaky feeling the first two times I increased the dose.  Mild hand tremor.	Not so quick-acting at lamictal at reducing anxiety, restoring sleep, eliminating depression, but I can feel it working, and there are none of the headaches that lamictal causes in combination with antidepressants.

4	Bi-polar I	I have only been taking it for 2+ weeks, however I feel alot better than I have felt on the other anti-manic drugs. So far, so good.	I like it, it is probally the only one I have liked.	F	31	2  weeks	10/5/2007
5	Depression and hypomania	None, but need to drink more water.	Brought me out of severe suicidal depression that Effexor could not alone. Saved my life. Back to normal except for some mood issues for which therapy is the best solution.	F	52	2  years	1/5/2007
2	Bipolar	My side effects are weight gain but the most troubling when you can't find ESKALITH CR anymore. I feel like I am dying. I had a pharmacists tell me the "generic" was ESKALITH CR ... After 2-3 days I realized something was wrong. That is when I found out I was taking generic. THE PHARMACY SHOULD HAVE TO TELL YOU THE GENERIC IS NOT THE SAME AS THE BRAND!!	I feel like there is no one to help me. I am going to stop taking the lithium. I don't know why they - whoever they are - have stopped manufacturing Eskalith CR but I would rather fade away than struggle with this. It is just too hard.	M	58	8  years	11/25/2005Email
1	suspected bipolar	swelling, exhaustion, confusion, apathy	Don't take this medication unless you have a responsible doctor who thoroughly reviews the side effects and will be available if you have questions, especially during the first couple weeks.	F	28	16  days	8/29/2005
5	bipolar		I have taken this drug for 13 yrs and it has made a huge difference in my life. Since taking it I have not had a major depression and only some minor hypomania that was short lived that goodness. Don't be fooled by the new generic drug it is not the same. I took it for 6 wks when the local pharmacies suddenly did not have eskalith. The generic is extended release not controlled and there is a difference. The generic dumps so much lithium in your system at once unlike Eskalith that you are tired and can't think straight. The generic also made me extremely bloated and I got toxic which rarely happens with Eskalith. This a great drug and from my experience drugs like depakoate and tegretol don't work. And antipsychotic meds should not be taken long term and why would you want to. Eskalith prevents the highs and lows and that's what this condition is all about without medication.
