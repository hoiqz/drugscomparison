1	Cholesterol	I have been experienceing extreme lower back pain.I had a kidney infection years ago while in Montreal vacationing - worst pain in my life. This feels alot like a kidney infection. Can hardly get out of bed or tie my shoes withoutmajor lower back pain. Why so many side effects? Who knows what other damage this stuff is doing to people!	Ridiculously expensive!I was paying less than $10 with my United Healthcare plan for Simvastitin, now pay $150 for same 30 day prescription!	M	52	12  days40mg 1X D	2/1/2013Email
1	high Cholesterol---heart attack	Extreme pains in oesophegal area,stomach pains, extreme gas ,diahorrea,nausea,headaches,muscle pains in back and chest	No problems before taking Vytorin,was on Crestor, and one month after Vytorin being taken all these problems began to arise-----never felt worse in my life---in fact doctors are unsure what is wrong --test after test,but i feel Vytorin is the culprit.

2	Taken for cholesterol..	I felt very heavy in my legs. Constantly moving them.  Do you know when you put a chile in your mouth how hot it is. Well my chest felt like that. Like it was in flamed. I only took it once before bed. But I was lying there feeling like I had to move alot because I felt so heavy and constantly drinking water. I dont know what to think of this medication its only been a night, but I am afraid to continue this medication.		F	57	1  days10-20mg	5/10/2012

2	High Chloristal	Nerve pain around teeth and face.	Bad nerve pain in the face going up to the temple, and around the teeth.  I've had three bouts with this, coming off the meds and it goes away.  going back on and it comes back.  Started with pravachol being doubled.  Swithced to Vytorin and it was OK for about a year then came back.  Cut dose in half and that worked for about a year.	M	76	3  years10-20 1X D	2/3/2012
3	Cholestorol	muscle pain, confusion, trouble breathing. Chest and rib pain (muscular). insomnia.	I used this for many years without issue. it lowered my chol count. Triggered a severe reaction after taking generic antibiotic. Took several months for the doctor to suspect it was vytorin. I have been off it for 1.5 weeks now and muscle pain is going away. breathing is getting better. I still cannot sleep yet but I have been getting more (about 4 hours last night).

5	Lower cholestral	I'm not aware of any side effects.  It is expensive, however.	It has kept my cholestral down consistantly way below the  amount they want you to be concerned about	F	84	10  years70 mg 1X D	5/11/2011
5	High Chol., by pass 20 years ago	none	working well	M	70	6  years 1X D	2/16/2011
1	high cholesterol and LDL	Muscle pain in legs, very tight feeling in calves, some momery loss, and gain some weight.	I took quite low dose Vytorin for about two months. Vytorin did reduce my cholesterol from 198 to 145, and reduced my LDL from 120 to 77 in two months. But the medicine has had very bad side effects.  After 3-4 weeks I quitted to take it, my weight was back to normal, most of my muscle pain reduced.	M	71	60  days10 MG 1X D	2/11/2011
5	high cholesterol	Minor muscle problems.	This did very good with lowering my cholesterol. It did not lower my triglycerides. I noticed minor muscle cramps but it may not have been from the Vytorin. I was taken off of it when it had gotten bad press in the news and put on Crestor (Crestor didn't help and only caused major problems). So I recently requested to be put back on Vytorin.

1	Atrial fibrillation A FIB	Severe Mental confusion, memory loss, forgetting words, days, driving functions, aggression, verbal abuse, severe back and muscle pain. recently diagnosed with Mild Dementia due to my reactions (and actions) to this drug	went to 1 tab every other day, now 0 tabs for the past week, diagnose for  Mild Dementia reversed, all of my symptoms listed above seem to be disappearing a little more each day, I had no mind of my own and decided that this med is a death sentence for some people! Now knowing that some of the side-effects can cause permanent damage, research VYTORIN (and all Statins) on the Web, there are tens of thousands out there for whom this drug does much more harm than good. New Vytorin Tests  indicate increased risk of Cancer. All Statins  will be the next major drug scandal.	M	79	2  years40/10 1X D	12/26/2010
3	High Cholesterol / Triglycerides	Muscle Pain	About one year ago I began to have feeling of pain in muscles of both feet on standing. Visit to Podiatrist gave me diagnosis of arthritis. Suffered with pain. About eight months later, began having severe pain in my back. MD told me to stop Vytorin. I did and "lo and behold after two weeks NO pain in feet. Back pain is slowly resolving. If pain in back does not resolve within the next three months, I will be suspect of the Diovan I am also taking.	F	66	3  years10-20 1X D	11/9/2010

1	high cholesterol and LDL	myalgia (muscle pain) in legs, very heavy and tight feeling in calves and thighs, initially thought it was in knee joints but turned out to be muscle pains	I thought it was arthritis and so did my cardiologist.  Finally saw a specialist who said muscle pains are common with statins, especially at higher doses. He suggested stopping for several months, not weeks.  I found medical journal articles that said incidence of myalgia is more like 5-15%, not the 1-2% found in the literature that comes with the drugs.  My CK level was elevated but in normal range, so my cardiologist did not believe it was the statin.  I also found journal articles that showed that the CK test can be NORMAL with mild to severe myalgia caused by statins.  (I fired my cardiologist!!)After I stopped Vytorin, the pains disappeared after about 3 months.	M	64	6  months80/10 1X D	2/16/2010

4	to lower high cholestrol #	none obvious	Doc switched my Rx from Zocor.  Vytorin brought cholesterol down to good #	F	70	3  years	1/23/2010
1	high HDL cholesterol	anxiety attacks	This drug failed to lower my HDL cholesterol more than 9 points over the 6 months I took it. The bouts of sudden, unusual anxiety attacks were too serious of a side effect to continue the medication.	M	26	6  months	12/21/2009
1	High LDL	Elevated Liver Enzymes, Inflamation of neck arteries, Drug induced psoriasis, Mental confusion, muscle pain.	Not at all happy with Vytorin Tests which indicated increased risk of Cancer.	M	65	4  years	12/6/2009
4	hyperlipidemia	So far so good.  Been on it for a year when my cholesterol dropped within the first three months.  Lipitor and Zetia did very little for me.  Just goes to show that some drugs work on some people and other drugs on other people.		M	68	6  months	11/29/2009
1	high cholesterol	Large amounts of hair loss, some actual bald spots	I could not imagine what was wrong with my hair and I mentioned it to my hairdresser.  He asked if I was on any new medication, well Vytorin was the only meds I was on.  Once I stopped the hair started growing back.	F	64	90  days	8/26/2009

5	high cholesterol	none	I have been taking this medication for over 3 yrs now. I have not had any side efects, and it has worked wonders at lowering my cholesterol down from 270 to 140. I will continue to take this drug.	F	45	3  years	7/28/2009
1		muscle & knee joint pain < 10 days after starting - very bad rep out of statin choices.  I can't take any after 4 tries - any exercise creates problems and since I'm young this isn't aceptable to be scared to do treadmill for 6-8wks because bad drug breaks something	worst and fastest troubles of 4x statin I tried.  Ezetemble was not the problem as I took zetia for 2 years.	M	44	10  days	7/6/2009
1	high cholesterol	Extreme leg pain ,knee pain, pain in my neck . The leg pain got so bad I couldng get out of bed for three days.  With all my complaining about pain, my doc thinks iam crazy.I stopped takeing it 9 days ago. My pain is already alot better.Sunday I am going to start taking it again and see what happens. If the Pain returns Iam going straight to docs , and telling him to switch me to something differant.	Did dramatically lower my cholesterol	F	43	3  years	6/10/2009
2	High Cholesterol	Irregular and/or slow heartbeat	Irregular and/or slow heartbeat appeared several months after starting Vytorin. Dr. diagnosed atrial fibrillation. Treatment was ineffective. Decided to live with it. After 4 years switched to Lipitor due to bad Vytorin press. Irregular/slow heartbeat disappeared two months after stopping Vytorin.	M	66	4  years	5/13/2009
1	high cholesterol	side effects - muscle and head pain. Doc says from arthritis, which I never had before. Other doctor agrees with me but said not to quote her, "it's a theory." Quit it & can only hope side effects will go away & have not caused permanent damage.	POISON	F	59	8  months	4/18/2009
2	high cholesterol	muscle pain, memory loss, forgetting words, real zombification	I've been off the stuff for more than a year, but even though the physical stuff has gone away, the cognitive stuff is still here.  I want my mind back!	F	52	16  months	2/22/2009
2	to lower LDL & boost HDL	Nausea in middle of night followed by a day of low grade fever (99.5 - 100.5), muscle aches, low energy: flu like symptoms. Could have been a 12 hour viral bug but I rarely ever get sick and have a reknown cast iron stomach!		F	55	7  days	2/12/2009
1	high Cholesterol	Muscle pain and cramps; and muscle deterioration.  That caused my knee to fail: tore ligaments inside of knee.  It did reduce cholesterol from 330 to 180	The cure is worse than the initial problem.	M	65	14  months	12/7/2008
5	High LDL cholesterol	no side effects	combined with exercise and better diet, I lowered my total cholesterol from over 300 to 126, with an LDL/HDL ratio of 2.4.  I have a total of eight stents, but no blockages since taking this drug.	M	67	3  years	9/21/2008
1	cholesterol	muscle pain, tiredness	The body makes cholesterol, it wouldn't if it were poison!Cholesterol doesn't cause heart disease any more than firemen cause house fires!	M	59	3  months	8/3/2008
5	High Cholesterol	None	Vytorin dramatically improved my cholesterol levels.  I switched to another brand when the bad press came out on Vytorin because my doctor was on maternity leave.  My level went sky high on a different med.  She put me back on Vytorin & I am doing extremely well.	F	40	1  years	5/28/2008
3	High LDL	I have recently experienced a fluttering in my chest and sometimes a stronger pounding, especially when in a recling position. My legs also feel heavy and I have experience many foot cramps.	Although this medicine has drastically lowered my LDL from 250 to 82, I am quite concerned about the recent side effects. I have found no mention of these in the literature that accompanies the prescription. I am stopping today and will monitor how I feel.	F	66	5  months	4/22/2008Email
1	dr. said was safest/no side effects	horrible muscle cramps in legs, itches, ulcerative proctitis, myalgia, cellular damage in lower leg muscle	disclosures said muscle pain or muscle ache; so dr. and pharm. didn't recognize cramping as symptomatic	M	62	6  months	4/12/2008Email
4	High tri/col.	Been on vytorin and trycor 145. Wasn,t sure which one was giving me the muscle pain in my back,legs, and making me so tired.So I just stopped the Trycor 145 3 days ago and I'll see if pain goes away...I stopped trycor 3 days ago and already feel better. Must say the combo of Trycor,vytorin,niacin with fish oil lowered all my levels very, very well...but think I'llgo without the Trycor for now..		M	59	2  years	4/3/2008
1	high overall cholersterol	started out as itching, progressed to excruciating burning pain, neuropathy, over a period of 3-4 years	This stuff is a death sentence for some people - one neither the patient nor doctor sees coming because it sneaks up on you.  There are thousands of sufferers and the doctors don't recognize it.  This will be the next major drug scandal.	F	60	4  years	4/1/2008
2	lower cholesterol	muscle and joint pain	does lower numbers, but no benefit for heart problems, drug companies knew this 2 years ago! read news release http://ktla.trb.com/news/ktla-vytorin,0,42072.storyIn Canada this is called ezetrol	M	50	1  days	3/31/2008
1	High Cholesterol	Worst side effect was burning sensation in neck arteries and elevated liver enzymes.	Vytorin, which came out in 2004, combines Zocor with Schering-Plough Corp.'s Zetia, which went on sale in 2002 and attacks cholesterol in a different way.The study tested whether Vytorin was better than Zocor alone at limiting plaque buildup in the arteries of 720 people with super high cholesterol because of a gene disorder.The results show the drug had "no result  zilch. In no subgroup, in no segment, was there any added benefit" for reducing plaque, said Dr. John Kastelein, the Dutch scientist who led the study.That happened even though Vytorin dramatically lowered LDL, fats in the blood called triglycerides and a measure of artery inflammation  CRP.	M	63	1.5  years	3/30/2008
2	High Cholesterol	Pain in lower back on both sides by kidneys. Pain just under my left shoulderblade. Feeling of stomach bloating, waking up soon after sleeping with pain in my chest that felt like a heart attack. Acid reflux. One episode of my vision being wavy on the periphery. 2 upper respitory infections in the last year	I thought I had cancer. I had no idea what was wrong with me. My doctor ordered 2 CT scans which were both negative. I thought my mind was making up all these symptoms. Then I looked closely at the side-effects, did some searches, and found others had the same side effects as me! Realized that my cardiologist had prescribed Verapamil with high-dose Vytorin, which it specifically says one should not do! Amazing! and he's a doctor. I have stopped taking Vytorin about 5 days and the pain in my lower back is beginning to subside.	M	38	2  years	3/23/2008
2	high triglicerides and cholesterol	extemely dry mouth, to the point of having a constant feeling of sickness	Dr. switched me from crestor 20 mg which I had been taking for approx. 4 years due to an increase in triglicerides	F	46	4  weeks	3/21/2008
4	High Cholesterol and Triglycerides	None that I could notice	Worked very well lowering my total cholesterol in half, from about 285 to about 140.  Did not do a very good job lowering my triglycerides, nor did it improve my cholesterol "ratio" in a significant manner. I am taking the lowest dosis available for both drugs in the product.	M	64	14  months	1/31/2008
4	high cholesterol	joint pain, back pain, insomnia, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, and headaches at times.  Not all side effects all the time but some more than others and some more often.	It's helped my cholesterol levels greatly and without it my cholesterol levels were 250+, now around 180.	M	44	1  years	1/27/2008
4	High cholesterol	None	Added Vytorin 10/20 to my Omacor 4 caps a day regimen. LDL went down significantly.	M	37	 	1/18/2008Email
1	Very high cholesterol	Atrial fibrillation w/ER visit; muscle/joint pain	Statin drugs seem to work well for some, but there are some who ABSOLUTELY should NEVER take any of this class of drug. Some of the side-effects can become permanent damage.  Do the web research, there are tens of thousands out there for whom this drug is much more harm than good.	M	50	4  months	1/18/2008
3	High Cholestorol	Muscle pain and ache feels like circulation has been cut off from my lower legs	It has helped lower my over all counts	F	43	5  years	1/17/2008
2	high cholesterol	burning feet, started off I thought I was just standing too much but over time the burning got worse		M	39	90  days	1/14/2008
5	high cholesterol	Occasional joint pain but not sure it is attributable to Vytorin	I have taken Vytorin for 3 years.  My Cholesterol reduction has been substantial. Total 250 start; 103 as of 11/07.  LDL 179 start; 53 now.  TRIG 167 start; 87 now. HDL 38 start; 34 now.	M	63	3  years	12/5/2007
