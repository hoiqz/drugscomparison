4	type 2 diabetes	Hypo'd a little too easily, but once understood could control - always keep some sugar handy if you take this medication, no need to be alarmed just be sensible.	Nothing else has worked so well to reduce my bs to manageable levels. Was hypo-ing too often so requested Dr. to reduce dose - put me on amaryl instead, and it is next to useless for me. Amaryl is gentler so if you can manage with that then better, but if not glucovance is worth a try but make sure you titrate it carefully (start with lowest does and work up to find right level - may change over extended use, so look then to lower)	M	42	18  months250 2X D	12/26/2010Email
1	Type II Diabetes	Terrible low blood sugar episodes.  Shakes, tense, jabbering.  Had to be on constant alert for these, have sugar tablets or similar handy, checked blood sugar obsessively to avoid this. No way to live.I gained weight on this drug, probably from the added insulin packing it on, and also because blood sugar swings make you hungry.	Maybe there's patients this drug is good for, but I sure wasn't one of them, and don't think most Type II's are.  This drug kicks your pancreas to spit out more insulin, so if you still make your own insulin, it can bring you to a low quickly.I am not a doctor, but have a hard time understanding how you are not wearing out your pancreas sooner by forcing it to make more insulin.I don't understand why Type II diabetics who are often admonished to lose weight can be put on a drug like this that promotes weight gain.  Yes, the insulin your body makes is not working properly to lower blood sugar... but that faulty insulin PLUS all the insulin you have in your system from this drug will still work great to pack more pounds on you.I believe most of us Type II's are better served with low carbing, some exercise, and glucophage and Byetta or anything else that slows the rush of food into our systems.

3	Type II Diabes	Sugar Levels too low at times.	Although this medication has significantly lowered my sugar levels, I have also experienced sugar numbers in the 40's.  I always make sure to eat with my medication.  I just am stumped over this.	F	42	2  years	2/21/2008

3	Diabetes type II	periods of the day where my blood sugar dropped too low	My doctor switched me from glucophage to glucovance to lower my blood sugar better, but I'd have these times in the day where I was shakey. I got switched back to a higher dose of just glucophage,  and the shakies are gone.	F	43	90  days	12/15/2004
