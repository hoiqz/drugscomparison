2	Cold Sores	The first couple of times i used this, it worked great. I get an occasional cold sore but they are bad and I get a residual neuralgia in my face. The last two times I have used it, it has had no effect on duration and I got another cold sore within 3 weeks (never had have that happen before.  Usually it's maybe 2-3 per year max). I am on day 1 again and hoping it works.  Ugh.		F	48	1  days1G 2X D	6/29/2013Email

1	Genital herpes	I was ok for the first few years and had continual outbreaks however in the last six months developed severe fatigue.. Can't stop sleeping, migraines, rashes and depression The generic brands are not the same! Symptoms were worse on the original brand I'm going to stop taking this tomorrow		F	33	6  years500mg	4/18/2013Email
1	hsv type 2 on genitals	Since starting taking valtex ive had liver pain, kidney pain, headaches, dizzyness, elevated liver enzymes and currently waiting on kidney tests to come back. This stuff is a night mare. It works well at first with little to no side effects but now it seems I have all the side effects and then some. Dont even get me started on the massive hair loss from this stuff.		M	26	5  years1 gram dai	4/12/2013
1	Hsv-1 (I think)	I've been taking it since Sunday morning, I took 2 doses Sunday, Monday, one on Tuesday and by Tues evening had red spots all over, itching everywhere. In addition to the burning with urination and ongoing pain to my genital region. This entire thing started on Friday/Saturday -1 week after having unprotected oral/vaginal sex with my boyfriend for the first time. He's had cold sores in his lifetime but none recently. I've never had a single problem ever. I went to the walk-in, they took swabs of some of the lesions and a urine sample. It's now Wednesday morning and I still don't know for sure what I have. I was also put on Doxycycline as an antibiotic which caused me to vomit. So now I can't take anything to try and rid myself of this horrible pain. And I'm getting no answers. And my doctor's office wasn't able to get me an appointment until tomorrow. I am miserable and angry and upset. What's worse is he also has spots around the base of the shaft and is on the Valtrex too. Hoping he doesn't have any allergic reactions. Ready to throw in the towel on my life. I don't know anything, I can't take anything for what we think this is, I'm in pain.... Seriously. Any ideas or help. I'm about to go and pick up Lysine and garlic supplements		F	36	5  days1 G, 2xD	4/10/2013Email
5	herpes	Nausea headache dry mouth weird dreams, the list goes on. But the side effects are less severe because I drink at least 80 ounces of water throughout the day		F	37	10  years500mg	4/3/2013
4	Genital Herpes	Depression, which I never get, feeling lethargic. I think it is making me sensitive or irritated during sex.	The side effects seemed to lessen after while, but after reading peoples experiences I realize that I am more lethargic than while not taking it.  I didn't have alot of breakouts to begin with, and they have subsided completely, but I think I am going quit taking it.  I have been feeling sensitive and not enjoying sex as much and I think it is because of the Valtrex.  I also do not have as much energy, and I work out and try to eat right.  Sometimes I feel like I could sit all day.	F	48	2  months500 1X D	3/7/2013
5	Cold sores	After taking medication for years periodically for cold sores. I all of a sudden had pronounced anxiety with bizarre thoughts.. Racing heart beat and angst.. I will never take it again way scary		F	51	5  years500mg	2/4/2013

5	Shingles	No side effects.	I've been getting shingles since I was 5 or so. Once I got a little older about 12 my doctor started prescribing Valtrex to me. I started talking it only when I got shingles. I have never had a problem with it. It makes my shingles go through the process quicker and less painfully. Very pleased!	F	18	7  days1 GM 3X D	11/2/2012
4	shingles-1st diagnosis	bloating, mild headache, tired, slightly irritable & "down" but that is really due to getting the shingles which is forever now. I still work fulltime & don't need this	Pain diminished by 2nd day & eruptions less "angry" looking	F	70	3  days1 Gram 3X D	10/28/2012
5	shingles	none	Had shingles only 2 weeks. It helped my body fight it off so I didn't have them long. Although I have gained 25 lbs since I had shingles and wondering if the didease or drug had anything to do with that. But I didn't really see any side effects.	F	36	1  weeks 1X D	10/23/2012Email
2	Herpes	Bloating, abdominal pain, pain in side of my head, yeast infection, confusion		F	49	3  days500	9/12/2012
4	HSV-1 (cold sores)	Works well at decreasing the symptomatic days of cold sore infection, as long as I get the pills started the first day (second day at the latest but results are spotty). If I take the pills later in the breakout phase, they have little effect.		F	29	1  days2g x 2	9/2/2012
1	Shingles	(Valacyclovir)  Worst side effects I've ever had on any drug.  Extreme fatique, slept 20 hours/day, stomach pains, sweating, nightmares, dizzy and disoriented.  Stopped taking after 3 days and felt great, then side effects began immediately after starting again 24 hours later.		M	57	4  days1000mg 3/d	9/2/2012
1	Herpes 1/2	Tingly sharp pain in legs/thighs, abdominal pain, gas, I've gained 4-5 pounds in 2 weeks, and insomnia.	I had posted on 4/12/12 and I'm updating about Valacyclovir. After my episode with taking it on April 2012 I stopped due to the side effects. I was on other meds as well at the time. Now at the beginning of August I thought I would give it a try again even though when I took it before it didn't stop the OB. Now I've stopped taking it again because it just doesn't work for me. It seems like I have more OB and symptoms on Valacyclovir than off of it. My stomach has been in severe pain, it has caused a change in my period and these pains in my legs and thighs are just unbearable. I haven't been able to get much sleep either since I've started taking this medicine again and I'm not taking anything else right now, so I know that Valacyclovir is the cause. There has to be something else besides this drug	F	32	19  days1000 2X D	8/30/2012Email
3	Shingles	Body aches, FATIGUE, extreme sweating leading to dehydration (reduced urine output/ leg cramps)	I'd never had shingles and was surprised at how painful it is. I thought it was poison ivy and went to Dr. for prednisone but Dx was shingles. Who knew? After seven days, the rash dried up but still hurt. I can't be certain the side effects were from Valtrex or just from my body fighting the zoster virus.	M	49	7  days1000 3X D	8/27/2012
1	Shingles	Extreme fatigue,muscle weakness,decreased urination . I believe I was misdiagnosed (never had a rash or  other symptoms of shingles)!and should never have taken this drug due to unknown to me mild renal insufficiency. Later diagnosed with a kidney infection and was then told an earlier urinalysis revealed mild renal insufficiency. I have had decreased urination since taking this drug in spite of drinking 80 to 100 ounces  of  water daily as  I have done for a very long time.	If a drug has FDA approval, look out  These guys will do anything for a buck. Their credibility is in question with me.	F	71	10  days1000 mg 2X D	8/18/2012
5	Hsv2	No side effects, it makes the symptoms go away though. I was having constant outbreaks for 3 months		F	36	2  weeks500 mg	8/6/2012
3	Genital Herpes	Fatigue, Diarrhea, Could not concentrate, Brain Fog, Reflux.	I think this medication would be useful in taking at night or during an outbreak. I do not find this useful at any other time. I can't deal with such loss of concentration and fatigue when I have stuff to do during the day. I am a busy mom and can't afford lounging around not being able to focus. I am going to stop these and take Lysine.	F	18	1  days500 mg. 1X D	8/5/2012
2	suprressive therapy	Cleared up my outbreak....but caused severe depression, listlessness, wierd dreams, insomnia, and reflux. I'm stopping it immediately.		F	36	6  weeks1000mg	8/4/2012
1	Shingles	Very itchy rash began on 3rd day on Valacyclovir--generic for Valtrex.  Treatment began on 7/6/12.  Rash located from my shoulders, all around my trunk, to tops of my thighs.  At first, I didn't realize the rash was from the Valtrex, so I took the full 5-day course.  Dermatologist prescribed Pramasone, a topical ointment, for itching, but it didn't help.  Itching stopped after about a week, and rash is fading, but it's been 4 weeks since the rash erupted, and my skin is still blotchy.		F	71	5  days1GM 3X D	8/4/2012Email
5	Just diagnosed with hsv2	None so farI got hsv2 from my husband I knew he had it but we used condoms. One day we had a fight and make up sex was hot and heavy we didn't use the condoms properly we put it on half way through the sex. I'm not sure if I ever had an outbreak I got bump now that's been there over two weeks it don't hurt and it hasn't changed I just been watching it. Any way I left my husband 2 1/2 months ago got a check up cuz I'm in a new relationship and they told me I'm positive for hsv2 been taking it since that day no problems yet . I also take lysine vitamins a b c d and e daily and a stool softer that's natural senna cuz I heard you can get GI issues so far so good.		F	34	3  months500mg	7/24/2012
1	Shingles	Itching, abdominal pain and stiff neck.	I called my Dr.  when the itching  and the abdominal pain started and of course he told me to start with the trusted Benadryl.  He thought if I could make it through the first few days I'd get to feeling better.  Day three I wake up with a headache and stiff neck.  Being the rational, level headed mother of five that I am, I automatically assume I'm dieing of menigitis and my Dr. misdiagnosed me.  Before dialing 911, I update my will, then read the side effects packet insert given to me by the pharmacist.  Instead of 911 I called the Pharmacy which suggested I stop the medicine.  I will not be taking it again.  The side effects appear to be worse then the actual disease.	F	48	5  days500 mg 3X D	7/16/2012Email
5	Genital Herpes	No negative side effects.  On the positive, I don't get colds or the flu as frequently as I used to, and I recover quicker.	It's a great drug. I was diagnosed 25 years ago. I used to get outbreaks just about every month and used cream / pills when the OB would occur. Started suppressive therapy about 10 years ago and have had only 2 OBs since.  My partner for the past 7 years has never shown any symptoms.	M	54	10  years1000mg 1X D	7/8/2012
5	Genital HSV-1	None on daily regimen, but a little nausea with double dosing	My first OB lasted about 3 weeks and I was on 1 gram valtrex twice daily. I continued 500mg daily when it cleared up and have not had anymore OBs. There was one point where I was moving and traveling and such and i forgot to take it for a few days in a row and I could feel an OB about to happen (tingling, soreness in legs and buttocks), I immediately doubled the dose for about 3 days and it went away (no blisters). I take the medicine right before bed along with my BC, Vit D and melatonin so it doesn't really change much in that sense. I would so take this drug over having any OBs. No side effects at all other than when i double dose and get a little nauseated. And actually, I've noticed that my nails get longer and harder while taking it daily. I haven't found any studies to say that it's a true benefit, but I've noticed it.	F	25	9  months500mg 1X D	7/6/2012Email
2	Varicella from vaccine	Extreme agitation, irritability, stomach pain, confusion, extreme fatigue, food cravings, shakiness, headaches, nausea.	Some symptoms may be from the illness itself or a bladder infection I have as well. The shakiness and agitation would start very randomly. My blood pressure was normal but my pulse was 100. There's no way for me to tell if the medicine was working because I got the Chicken Pox from the vaccine, so it was not behaving in the same way as it would if I got it from someone else. I am going to stop taking the medicine, as I cannot handle the side effects.	F	31	8  days1gm 2X D	5/19/2012Email
5	Genital Herpes	I have been on Valtrex for over 10 years. Sometimes I get good results taking it every other day and sometimes I have to take it every day to keep the virus in remission. I have had no side effects from taking this drug. It's a miracle drug for me		F	36	10  years1000mg	4/19/2012
1	Thought I had genital herpes	I started taking valtrex in October because I had blisters on vulva area. I had 3 culture swabs that were negative but tested positive for HSV 1. So the doctors put me on valtrex, well I never had it. I have a skin dermatitis, they finally did a biopsy. I hated being on the medicine. Felt depressed, agitated, bloated. The worst though has been since I stopped the medicine. I have been off the medicine for two weeks and I've had horrible anxiety. I am so glad I am off and hope to feel better soon.		F	34	6  months1000	4/14/2012Email
1	Canker Sores	I am currently on my period and took a Valtrex in order to eliminate the canker sores in my mouth. I woke up in the middle of the night with a horrible stomach and and awful backaches and cramps. I felt nauseous, and tried to go back to sleep. I woke up, still felt terrible, and vomited. I will not be taking the pill again.		F	17	1  days2000 1X D	4/13/2012
1	Persistant Viral Infection	I felt horrible the entire time I was on this medication. I was on a generic version of the drug "Ranbaxy valacyclovir" 500mg. Seems to be the only generic stores stock around here.	Felt sick when I was on the drug. I have been off the drug for several months now and I still feel quite ill. Caused muscle pains, GI problems that got worse and worse (felt like I was trying to digest a rock), messed up my sleep very badly! Surprised no one else seems to be mentioning Insomnia from this drug as a common side effect. But the terrible stomach pain is the most pronouned side effect. FYI: There is an antiviral drug called Famvir, also generic, which you may want to inquire about if you can't take valtrex, it is also supposed to work for similar conditions. Sadly, Famvir made me sick also! Any new antivirals coming on the market that don't have such horrible side effects? When the  "cure" is worse than the disease.......what to do? Also, even though they are both generic both valtrex and famvir are very very expensive! Hundreds or thousands a month!	F	31	3  months500 3X D	4/12/2012
1	GH 1/2	Tingling feeling throughout my body, pain in arms and legs.	I'm confused about this medication. I am new to taking this and just found out about a month ago that I had gh 2 . I've been taking this for about 30 days and have missed probably 3-4 pills. I've noticed since taking this medicine this weird tingling feeling throughout my body, it doesn't hurt but it's really weird and it makes me feel like I'm going to have an outbreak but I don't. My arms are starting to ache and I really just don't feel like myself. I'm really scared because once again I am new to this and I'm not sure if I should be feeling this way. If anyone else is experiencing this, please contact me.	F	32	30  days500 1X D	4/10/2012Email

4	Genital herpes	So far so good i feel a minor headache and back pain but my doctor said it's normal and that my body will get used to the medicine and the pain should go away, I'm more calm emotionally knowing I'm taking medications		F	33	4  weeks500 MG	4/4/2012
3	Cold sores/fever blisters	After years of getting cold sores/fever blisters occasionally, maybe 2 a yr. I started to get them every few weeks for months, from stress I am told, so I started off taking 2g & 2g 12 hrs later, it seemed to speed healing but I got another one immediately following healing. I tried another round of 2g & 2g and same thing. They decided to put me on 500mg once a day every day for preventative, the only side effect I've noticed is dizziness but so far that's it. Hope it works well for me with no short or long term side effects as cold sores are miserable! Good luck everyone		F	26	2  weeks500mg	4/1/2012
2	Herpes breakout	After 1 day on the drug my diastolic (lower number?) blood pressure went from 76 to 100!   I also came down with diarrhea.		M	53	2.5  days500 mg 2X D	3/26/2012Email
3	suspected hsv 2	Fatigue, mild muscle/joint pain, grogginess, vivid dreams, very mild abdominal discomfort, mild headaches and slight sensitivity to light and loud noises		F	27	6  days500mg 2x d	3/13/2012
3		Stomach pain and bloating. Taking the generic by Ranbaxy. But I also had these side effects with the brand name.	How is Ranbaxy generic valtrex compared to the other generics out there? As effective? Less? Is it working for others who have been on it long term? Is there anything that helps with the constant stomach bloating and sick feeling? Seems like most people get this side effect.	F	32	4  months 1X D	3/9/2012
1	Genital herpes	Nausea, depression, listlessness, lack of motivation. Reduced to tears on several occasions. It took me 31 days to realise that it was Valtrex that was causing this - at 65 I thought this was just old age doing its thing.  Have had this condition for 25 years and spent the first 10 years taking Aciclovir - don't recall having any side effects.  I had booked time with a therapist because of the depression - hopefully this will disappear now that I've stopped taking the medication.		F	65	31  days500 mg 1X D	3/8/2012Email
3	genital herpes	flu like symptoms, bad depression, severe fatigue, really bad dreams and just plain old not myself. I feel sick everyday since I've started valtrex. The upside is it took away my outbreak within a week. This was my very first outbreak and my husband passed it to me and never knew he had it. It was very painful but after the first dose of valtrex it made it feel a little better but as far as the side effects I will never take it again!! I am a mother of 4 and cannot feel incapable of doing anything except lay on the couch cause I'm so I'll sick.		F	25	10  days1X D	3/7/2012
1	?	Extreme headache, joint, & muscle pain. Exhausted beyond anything I've experienced before & I have chronic fatigue syndrome. SEVERE DEPRESSION. Bad stomach pain. Loud noises a killer. Just laid here w/o TV or radio for days. Sweats. Be sure to tell your doctor if you suffer from depression or are bi-polar!	Beware: This medicine or its generic may cause you severe pain and illness. New doctor never warned me of side effects. Thought it was a "you'll feel worse b4 you feel better" thing until I was so sick,and was in so much pain that I almost called ambulance. I found this b4 I did. Thanks to all who have reviewed this medicine. I will never see this doctor again, as generic costs over $1000 per month and this guy gave me a script for 5 months worth, again never telling me that this could worsen my chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia or bi-polar symptoms! He prescribed me 3-6  more daily dosage than most other people who have complained about same side-effects here.	M	63	13  days1000 3X D	3/4/2012Email
5	Been suffering for years	Grogginess if I take before bed, nauseous (extremely mild and not long lasting) . I have been suffering from frequent bad outbreaks for years. Couldn't shave, exercise, have sex, even sit for to long wearing jeans without having the symptoms. It completely took over my life and I became very depressed. I finally decided to try this medicine and my only regret is not getting it sooner :(		F	27	1  years500 mg	2/20/2012
5	shingles	None of the side effects have been ongoing, but I have experienced periodic fatigue, muscle aches and GI upset.	Very painful first shingles outbreak on my face/ear, with pain radiating to my jaw and teeth. Started noticing diminishing pain and drying of blisters within two days of starting generic Valtrex.	M	53	4  days1GM 3X D	2/19/2012Email
3	Occasional Cold Sores	Since the first day I've been very cranky and have no patience. Loud noises make me angry. I feel very bloated and have gained 7 pounds. The fourth day, within 20 minutes of taking a dosage, I was on the bathroom floor with extreme abdominal pains and nausea. It was so bad I could barely breathe. I've had headaches for a few days and feel blah. It sucks, I'm going to stop taking it.		F	22	1  days500 MG	2/16/2012

4	HSV-1 Genital	Nausea, headaches, tiredness, fatigue, muscle aches, depression.	Valtrex did cure my genital HSV-1 outbreaks but has not come without a price. Thought I had a mild case of the flu, or a cold for the last few weeks, but then read the side effects for Valtrex and realized that was the problem. I decided to look into it today when I was feeling fine all morning and realized I forgot to take my Valtrex at 1:00 PM and within 30 minutes felt so nauseous I had to lay down. Valtrex also has not made me feel like myself. Over the last few weeks I have felt very depressed and wake up feeling overall sad. This is rare for me as I generally do not have depressed feelings. The medication has also made me lose interest in daily activities such as social get togethers with friends.	M	20	30  days500 2X D	2/6/2012
5	Herpes S2		Every night I have wild crazy dreams, never nightmares...I love it, its great, I cant wait to go to sleep to find out whats gonna happen this time....I was just diagnosed 2 months ago, and have never had a second outbreak (not yet anyways) Not sure if its the Valtrex, or just the way my immune system works.Since I have no negative side effects, Im going to continue taking it. I have felt tingling down the back of my leg..I took 2 pills that day and nothing seemed to come of it	F	31	 500 1X D	1/20/2012EmailHistory

1	Supress shedding of genital herpes	I contracted genital herpes 15 yrs ago.  I have never had an outbreak since.  I began taking it a month ago because I wanted to suppress shedding so that I would not infect my partner.  I don't know if it will or will not help with that, but I do know that it has given me symptoms that mimic both a yeast infection and also an outbreak.  The last time I had a yeast infection was probably about five years ago, so I don't get them regularly.  As previously stated, I have never had an outbreak since the first one 15years ago.I think for someone like me, it is not worth the hassle.  I feel like I am having an outbreak now and know that before Valtrex, this was not a concern.Needless to say, I am discontinuing valtrex and my partner and I will just use condoms and take any other necessary precautions.

4	HSV 1 Coldsores in mouth	Heat rash, headaches, heartburn, tiredness	Have taken for coldsores in mouth for over 10 years.  After first episode I had a long break before next outbreak...maybe close to a year.  Then I began getting a cold sore on one spot of lip every other month it seemed.  Then it jumped to inside my mouth where most of my primary infection had occurred.  Recurrence was often so went on 1 500 a day of Valtrex for about 10 years.  Would still have occasional episodes but less severe.  Eventually I stopped it because of pregnancy.  The first outbreak was very bad after stopped.  Then became less sever but still frequent..about once every two months on average.  I didn't take anything for 3 years for episodes but after having my son coldsores were occurring very frequently, once every 3 weeks or more.  I began taking for each episode2 grams twice for one day then 1 500 for a few days.  Works well to shorten but since I don't know I'm getting one until it really is forming it does not usually prevent.  Thinking of going on once daily again but unsure.  Want to protect my kids most of all but I seem to be getting them a little less now, can go 5 to 8 weeks between.  Menstruation seems to be my trigger.  Anything hormonal.  I recon I am also predisposed genetically to recurrences.Using the generic Valacyclovir now.  Can't tell exactly if it works as well.  I think it does but unsure.

5	HSV-2	Never had any.	Valtrex changed my life. I used to have monthly OB, which ended completely after starting taking the drug. I found out that extreme stress (death in the family, one week not sleeping well) could cause an OB even while taking the drug, but the symptoms are minimal (tiredness, constipation) and last for a day or two, without visible blisters.

1	shingles	Extreme stomach pain	Never had a reaction to anything like this! The pain was so bad I could barely breathe. Only took one day of a 20 day prescription. Emergency room Dr. Wanted to inject antihistamine for breathing problem, but trouble breathing was from the pain. -- decided to tough it out rather than risk even worse side effects.  Recommend you start with a low dosage to see if you get any side effects.  Anyone have an immediate antidote?   Did help the blisters even with just this one day dose, but the "cure" made the disease seem minor.	F	54	1  days1g 2X D	10/12/2011Email
4	Genital Herpes	Really really weird dreams, heavy brain fog, i don't really feel like myself, bad stomach pains and mild constipation	I was recently diagnosed with herpes and started on my 5 day regime of this medication and it cleared up the outbreak. today is day 6 and i woke up from the most messed up dream I have ever had.

4	Genital Herpes	None	Valtrex has been great. I was having an outbreak each month before starting Valtrex but have had none since. I personally did alot of research on Herpes once I found out I was positive and made my own preventative cocktail.

1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email
1	Depress or  Bipolar	All side effects what listed on Abilify's instraction. was hospitalas, digestiv sistem  not functionable for  3 dayABILIFY : best killer	only 5 MG of Abilify can kill you in 4 Hs	F	52	1  times5 1X D	2/2/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.	F	52	8  years20 MG 1X D	1/13/2012Email
2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
