5	Muscle Spasms/Lower Back Pain	Desire to sleep was strong at first but i take it at night, so that dosen't bother me. With the coupon provided by the manufacturer on their website, the cost is about $10 a month. When I have extreme pain, I add a Vicodin or Tramadol. It has also just recently went generic ! I also use this drug for PMS/Menstrual Cramps and it works great.I would encourage new users to to start this drug over the weekend, so you can see how your body will react. I have no problems, driving or going to work after taking this drug, but everyone is different.		F	28	180  days30 mg 1X D	7/18/2011

5	Muscle Spasms/Scapular Bursitis	Expected drowsiness & Dry Mouth.	Worked well for me. I had the expected drowsiness initially the first few days of taking the medicine but that has since diminished. Doesn't really make me that drowsy now. This did help with the chronic muscle spams that I had, but just seem to take the edge off. Might require slightly higher dose than 10 mg, but will let the Doctor decide that when I return. Only real side effect was dry mouth, or feeling thirsty.	M	29	1  months10 mg 3X D	1/3/2011
5	back spasm	A bit of dry mouth, but not enough to stop taking the medicine.	My doctor told me to take it between 6 and 7 PM so that I wouldn't be drowsy the next day.  He also said it didn't matter if I took it with or without food.  It worked really well and I wasn't tired the next morning like some of the other muscle relaxers have made me in the past.

1	muscle relaxer/pain	I took this pill roughly 10-10:30 Tuesday night.  It's now 11:48 and I still don't feel right.  I've probably been awake about 6 hours today max.  I just keep sleeping and I feel so lethargic and not right.		F	40	1  days15 1X D	9/1/2010
2	neck-nerve/muscle pain	extreme dizziness and fatigue	I took just one pill at about 8:30 at night and the next day at 7am, i could barely get out bed for work. I almost fell asleep driving and the fatigue and dizziness have lasted all day so far and its 1pm in the afternoon. I hope it wears off soon but im worried the feeling will last longer due to other patients experience. The Amrix drug fact page i dont believe is honest about what percentage of patients experience somnolence and dizziness. I will never take this again	F	29	1  days15mg 1X D	8/27/2010
1	Back spasm	Extreme drowsiness, faintness, brain fog, zoning/focus trouble,excessive sleep and moodiness.	Took it one time for my spasm last Saturday, and it worked great on the spasm but left me dysfunctional for two days afterward.  Still not feeling myself, and here it is Tuesday.  Will stick with pain meds, heat, and PT.	F	49	1  days15 mg 1X D	6/22/2010
3	Pain in the shoulder joint	Extreme drowsiness and disorientation.	I took the pill in the evening not long before going to bed.  I had a very hard time getting up in the morning and was disoriented and groggy at school (I'm a teacher).  I felt like a Zombie all day. I fell asleep while proctoring an exam, then later after school while doing prep work on computer.  At home, I fell asleep at the dinner table.  After dinner, I went to bed and slept for 9 1/2 hours, extremely rare for me to sleep more than 6 hours. The pain went away though and I was glad I didn't need to take another pill.

1	Help Endure Physical Therapy	Day one took dose @ 6pm - blurry vision and disoriented for about an hour. Slept great that night and felt ok the next day. Day 2 took 2nd dose @ 6pm - slept great that night by 10 am the next day Horrible anxiety attack with redness of face and chest - felt like I was sitting in front of a fire; thought I was going to die - very anxious, nervous, tense, increased heart rate, disoriented, confused... horrible, horrible feeling!	I would not recommend this medication to anyone without constant medical supervision!!! Dangerous!!!!	F	42	2  days50 1X D	4/27/2010Email
4	Neck Spasms Chronic	Increased AM drowsiness.   At first getting up in the AM was challenging.  I stopped taking the drug after 10days.  My dr convinced me to give it another try.  I have been on it again for 3 weeks and feeling better than I have in years.   I am still very tierd in the AM but work full time at a professional position.   Since I am not in pain I can focus better on work and less on pain.		F	39	21  days	11/7/2009
4	neck & back pain	headache when i first wake up but gone within 2-3 hours	this medication does not make me drowsy at all, no hangover feeling the next day. i was afraid i would have trouble getting up the next day, but although it helps me sleep, i have no trouble getting up. it helps me a lot more than short term muscle relaxers! i'm by no means pain free, but it does take the edge off	F	35	1  months	9/10/2009
4	Deep muscle spasms	The most notable side effect is drowsiness; since it's a 24-hour extended release medication, it comes with 24-hour extended release drowsiness!	I take Amrix 15mg capsules, 1-2 as needed for deep muscle spasms.  It's great for releasing muscles that are locked tight and not responding to shorter acting muscle relaxants, but it's not suitable for long-term daily use because of the drowsiness.	F	36	6  months	9/3/2009
1	Low back pain (herniate disc L4-L5)	I took Amrix 30 mgs at 5pm and the next day I could not function.  Very sleepy and "drugged up" feeling.  Felt like I could not concentrate.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  I will never take this medication again.		F	49	1  days	8/24/2009
2	Strained Muscle	Extreme drowisness and unable to focus	I can't believe they prescribe medication like this. This has to be the worst thing I have ever taken. Please use caution with this medication. The warnings are not lying. I took it at 7:00 at night, and apparently 18 hours of sleep was not good enough. It took a good 2 days to get out of my system. Never again.	M	33	5  days	6/10/2009
3	chronic nerve pain in mid back	taking 15mg at night and the first 4 days experienced only dry mouth and extreme thirst---side effects I could live with. After 4 days, I struggled to stay awake even after 8 hours of sleep and an afternoon nap (something I never did before). I could not take this drug daily anymore. Works well on loosening up muscles I thought were permanently frozen.	works great if you don't mind sleeping your life away!	F	53	7  days	5/14/2009
