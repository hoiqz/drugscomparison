5	Ulcerative Colitis	No side effects.  Asacol HD has worked great for me!  I was diagnosed with UC in 2001 and took Asacol 400 mg for 10 1/2 years.  Then I experienced a major flare and was put on Asacol HD.  It only took a couple of weeks to notice major improvement and a couple of months to be in full remission.  I am extremely happy with this medication and highly recommend it.		F	37	10  months1600 mg x3	11/18/2012
2	UC	Bloating, abdominal pain, sudden bowel movements, lathergic, difficulty staying asleep, made colitis worse.	It worked for the first 8 weeks. After that things regressed. I thought I was having another flare up. Did my research and found the drug to have too many side effects. There is lactose in this as well, which I cannot tolerate (most who have an IBD can't!) and I feel contributed to my digestive problems. I've been off of Asacol HD for only a few days now and haven't had any bloating and sudden urges. I'm still bleeding but will seek other treatments for this.	F	31	5  months800mg 3X D	11/21/2010Email
5	ulcerative colitis	Hair loss	This medicine works. I also take 4g salofalk daily for 3 months. I had to change my diet to 5 or 6 small meals daily, all healthy and eat only soluable fibre (no skins of fruit of veg)but my diarrehea is gone and UC is under control. I am reducing Asacol over past month and now down to 2 x 400 mg and 4g salofalk every other day and my hair loss has reduced also, I think if I can reduce further it will be ok. I am hopeful it will grow back. Other than hair loss, I have tolerated this drug well.	F	47	3  months800 mg x 2 3X D	10/16/2010
1	colitis	fatigue, nausea, headache, severe rash	It did nothing for my diahrea. Maybe made it worse. I was run down and felt bad. Magnesium levels dropped from diahrea and was getting bloodwork every month. Stopped taking it and am starting to feel better after about 3 weeks. Rash went away after a few days.
