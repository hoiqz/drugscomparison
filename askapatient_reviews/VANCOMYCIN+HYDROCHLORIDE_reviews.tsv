2	MRSA	After 2 weeks of HIGH dosage one day started itching from head to toe, was told to take benadryl. Extreme headache, hives, rash, dizziness, nausea, fever, chills, uncontrollable shaking, low blood pressure (at times), and worst of all was the extreme pain in my arms neck and shoulders, which I am still feeling a week later, I can hardly move my left arm which is also numb, but the dr said I will regain use within 3 weeks.	It cleared the MRSA but I had terrible reaction to it! I recommend the drug because it will eat MRSA for breakfast lunch and dinner but PLEASE PLEASE don't be afraid to let the nurse know IMMEDIATELY if you start to feel any of the above symptoms especially the itching. Redman syndrom is not too big of a deal I guess but in my case it was pretty extreme.	M	28	2  weeks1700 2X D	6/29/2012

2	Suspected CDiff	MAJOR hairloss.  Lost about 80% 2 months following treatment.  I was hospitalized & given the drug in November.  My hair began falling out in January and continued through March.	I was given the drug via IV for 5 days.  The dr. suspected CDiff, which I later found out I did NOT have.	F	31	5  days 1X D	3/30/2011
4	MSRA or whatever its called xD	Felt very weird, instant ichiness, that's about it.	This worked very well for me, I had a horride staph infection that i let get out of hand and thank goodness they had this big bad boy antibiotic to kick its tail around.  My wounds healed up nicely and im now on bactrim to finish up.	M	20	7  days	7/4/2009
2	MRSA	It seems to have handled the MRSA, but caused a rash over most of my body.  Feet, hands, and groin especially.  2 weeks since coming off of the Vancomycin and still peeling in areas, feet and hands are still sensitive.	I only give this a "2" because the MRSA seems to have been cured.  A "1" would probably be more appropriate, but since the MRSA is as dangerous as it is, I will leave the rating a "2".  The skin reaction has definitely extended my recovery.	M	38	7  days	4/12/2009
1	high white blood cell count	My mother developed a whole body rash with severe huge blistering from vancomycin. Her blood pressure dropped significantly and never made it out of the ICU.  A terrible experience.   It happened months ago and still cannot get those images out of my mind. And this was a person who never took much medication.		F	53	3  days	4/7/2009

5	C. Diff	None that I noticed.	Vancocin was the only thing that stood between me and being bedridden or worse.  Every time I tried to get off it, the c. diff. came roaring back.  After doing extensive research I opted for a fecal transplant.  Within two hours of the first enema, I felt like I was returning to normal.  Sure enough.  The monster c. difff has not returned.  The fecal transplant protocol says to take the Vancocin right up until the day before the first infusion.  I live in Houston, Texas, home of one of the largest medical centers in the world.  I could not find a gastroenterologist who would even coach me.  They all said the fecal transplant was the right thing to do but they would have no part in it.  I have read that 39,000 people in the US die every year from c. diff.  Needlessly in my view.  Thank goodness for Vancocin or I would have been one of them.	F	68	2.5  years250 mg 4X D	6/2/2012Email
5	C-Diff	none	Vancocin is the only drug that kept C-Diff in check but my intestinal bacteria was wiped out so asa I went off it, the C-Diff came back. However, I was grateful for this drug. I felt normal while on it but it is VERY expensive. Thank goodness for health insurance.	F	55	2  yearsvarious 3X D	9/7/2011Email
5	C-diff	No significant side effects. Occasional slight pain/pressure in left ear, as others have mentioned, but no big deal.	Vancomycin is a terrific drug for C-difficile. I developed a C-diff infection after way too much clindamycin to treat bacterial pneumonia. The diarrhea from the C-diff was relentless, up to 30 hits a day, often with no warning. Because the first lab messed up the test, I didn't get a positive culture for C-diff for two weeks. By the end of that time I was seriously malnourished and so dehydrated my blood pressure dropped 20 points in both numbers, despite my drinking gallons of Gatorade. My doctors (primary and GI) were pushing Flagyl, but I have a terror of nausea. Reports on this site gave me the courage to "just say no" to Flagyl. I insisted on Vanco and said I would pay for it. My primary doctor, who has practiced for more than 20 years, told me he'd never dosed Vanco orally, and that when given by IV it is "poison," but he agreed to try the capsules. Vanco stopped the diarrhea in two days, like turning off a light switch, with no nausea, no anything. The gastroenterologist who set the dose says it is "aggressive treatment." At his urging, I also took Florastor and will continue to take it indefinitely (easier and cheaper to buy it online). There have been studies that show Florastor decreases the risk of C-diff recurrence. Vanco is ludicrously expensive. My Medicare Rx co-pay was $1,750 for a two-week supply, though other insurance might do better. I'm not rich, but to me it was worth every penny. C-diff takes your life away.

4	C Diff after Keflex and Augmentin	None, but saw doctor today and after the initial dose of 20 capsules, he wants me to take Flagyl.  He put me on Flagyl first and I asked for the Vancocin.  I only took one Flagyl, then went on Vancocin.	The Vancocin stopped the diarrhea within a day or slowed it down considerable.  C Diff is the worst thing I've ever gone through.  For me, the expense was worth the cost.	F	72	4  days250 mg 4X D	10/5/2010Email
5	C-Difficile	None :)	My doctor switched me to Vancomycin after I couldn't tolerate Flagyl. I felt a world of difference the very day after starting my Vancomycin. I felt worse on Flagly than I did when I was just battling the C-Diff I had acquired from taking Clindamycin.	F	35	7  days250mg 4X D	10/2/2010
5		None. GREAT DRUG. IT killed the CDIFF and have been without CDIFF for months. Don't waste your time with Flagyl or let your doctor give you Flagyl since it does not work against CDIFF and has bad side effects.	Make sure you take Florastor as well as a probiotic like VSL when fighting CDIFF. Most doctors are clueless about CDIFF and how to treat it. As you kill the bacteria, you need to replace it with the good stuff. Vanco rocks. Flagyl is WORSE than CDIFF.	M	52	3  weeks 2X D	9/26/2010
4	C.Diff	No obvious side effects. My ears were doing funny things.	This is my second round of Vanco (14 days each) but now I am taking it WITH Flagyl...I know, very sad. I acquired c.diff when my idiot of a gynocologist gave me clindamycin for some "unknown" infection. So DON'T TAKE CLINDA UNLESS YOU'RE DYING! I would take the "unknown" infection over c.diff any day. Vancomycin works great, my symptoms disappear when I'm on it but I've had 2 recurrences so far. The ONLY symptom that comes when I'm taking it is my left ear hurts when I swallow my ears generally feel a little different. I've read that back in the day vanco could cause deafness but that that was no longer an issue. Maybe I'm getting an antibiotic ear infection? I don't know.... my thoughts are with anyone who has C.diff, it has made these past months a living hell.	F	24	14  days500 MG 4X D	8/2/2010

5	cdiff	I had NO side effects. This was an AMAZING drug. SO SO SO much better than FLAGYL!	I took FLAGYL first to try to fight off the cdiff, but I honestly believe the flagyl was worse than the actual CDIFF. I was on flagyl for a dreadful 10 days, and it was torture. The side effects of that drug are completely horrific. HOWEVER, after being put on Vancomycin, I am very ecstatic to say, that I had no side effects.	F	24	3  weeks	8/2/2009
5	c diff	None that I can notice I'm happy to say	I switched to vancocin after feeling poisoned to death by the flagyl. take florastor while treating c diff. You need good bugs in your gut ready and waiting to pounce on the c diff spores once they re-emerge, if you dont you get high relapse rate	F	42	7  days	7/1/2009
4	c difficile	tongue coated white and a lot of gas	It worked for the infection, but I had many relapses.  The first after 17 days, then 25, 30 and so on.	F	54	6  months	1/21/2009
4	C-Diff	I haven't noticed any.  As soon as I switched from Flagyl to Vanco I felt a world of improvement!	I hope this gets rid of my C-Diff and it never comes back!!!!	F	29	10  days	11/25/2008
4	c. diff	Nothing really noticeable.	I couldn't tolerate Flagyll and I thank goodness for Vanco. Problem, I had a relapse of c. diff within 5 days of being off a 20 day oral Vanco course (and that's after being in hospital for 2 weeks on IV Flagyll and Vanco). So, I hope this 2nd 20 day course does the trick. Good luck to anyone who has suffered through C. Difficile.	F	51	 	9/18/2008

3	C. Diff	I am a healthcare provider and contracted C. Diff by taking Keflex post-op and working around C. Diff in an ICU unit.  I was started on Flagyl and had an anaphylactic reaction after 5 days of being on it which is rare. I've been on Vancocin for 3 weeks for C. Diff and have been hospitalized twice for dehydration and C. Diff complications.  We're awaiting the sensitivities from my latest culture but looks like I have Vanc resistant C. Diff.  I get bad stomach cramps 30 minutes after taking the vanc and also some heartburn.  Otherwise, it's been well tolerated.  I take some pain medicine and heartburn medicine that makes me feel better.		F	30	21  days	3/16/2007
5	c.diff	none at all	Amazing, after three days (which is normal, it takes about 3-5days to kick in) I saw relief of my symptoms and was almost normal again.  By the end of the treatment I felt completely better.  Great medication.	F	29	10  days	1/7/2007Email
5	clostridium difficile		I had to take it twice for recurring c-diff, and it worked the second time.  No side effects for me, as other protocols have.  Only take if absolutely needed because this is currently the best hope I've heard of knocking out c-diff.  If over-prescribed or misused, this will become problematic like all of the other antibiotics potentially.	F	39	10  days	6/27/2006
