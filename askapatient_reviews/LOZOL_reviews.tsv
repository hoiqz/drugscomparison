5	Hypertension  approx. 130/100	None.  Great diuretic.	I have taken Lozol (indapamide) 1.25mg since 1994. At one time it had reduced my BP to 120/72.  Perfect!  Now my BP has creeped back up.  I've tried other meds (Lisinopril, Diovan) in addition to the Lozol, but have had trouble with side effects.  Now I'm working on diet, vitamins, minerals (Mg & potassium), and sleep to bring down borderline BP.	F	43	14  years	10/20/2008Email
1	High Blood Pressure	Nausea, dizziness, tinnitus, insomnia, agitation, anxiety, thirst, flu-like symptoms, dehydration, confusion, depression, flushing, rash, swelling, night-sweats.	I have taken this drug on and off for the last two years as a supplement to ACE treatment for high blood pressure and it really is a nasty add-on.  Everytime my doctor convinces me to try it again I wonder why I have agreed.  My view is only consider this drug as a last resort - it's not a good diuretic, it's not a good antihypertensive - it's just cheap and nasty.	M	30	2  years	8/22/2008
1	High blood pressure	dehydration, personality change, anxiety, reduced kidney function	This drug caused me to be so dehyrated that my eyes and mouth were always dry no matter how much I drank liquids. I noticed that I would become easily upset and angry. My blood tests showed that it lowered my kidney function. I was also taking Toprol and Cozaar. The combination of drugs seem to have caused permanent kidney damage.	F	64	2  years	1/9/2008
