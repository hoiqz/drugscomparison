2	Breast Cancer stage 11a	palmer-planter erythrodysesthesia producing sever skin peeling on fingers. Tearing in eyes, extreme outside. IBS type symptoms, consipation, bloating, taste change, mucus changes in all mucus areas.	Was warned about numbness which I haven't had yet but not about the palmer-planter peeling symptoms which produce very sore fingers prior to peeling which make it impossible to care for oneself for a couple of days. Starting second 3 week cycle with steroid cream for hands. If this doesn't stop sever symptoms in hands will have to stop treatment and move to taxol.	F	47	23  days	10/7/2009
1	stage II breast cancer	During treatments, body aches, chemo brain, neuropathy, chemically induced menopause were the worst ones. Many minor ones: loss of taste, all day tearing and runny nose, hair loss. Permanent side effects: neuropathy, infertility, chemo brain	Two years ago I began a regimen of six treatments, three weeks apart. The significant decrease of quality of life from these long term side effects and the inability to function are dehabilitating.	F	50	 	9/13/2009

I have had 13 weekly IV treatments of Taxotere with 5 weeks to go (there are 2 weeks off after every 6 weeks of treatment).  Since beginning treatment in Nov. 2006 there has been noticeable improvement in the breast and underarm area where the cancer quickly returned after a lumpectomy in March 2006.
