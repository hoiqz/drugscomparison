5		None....	With Cenestin, I have no hot flashes, my memory works, I am more "even tempered"..... I was 30 post Ovarian Cancer survior...life is MISERABLE in menapause with young children.  I will take the risk to have a GOOD quality verse a long poor quality of life.	F	45	13  years.625 1X D	1/31/2013Email
5	hot flashes	Makes me feel wonderful and I look much younger than my age.		F	57	5  years.45 1X D	7/12/2012Email
5	Total Hysterectomy with ovaries out	None while taking...love it.	I had a complete hyst in 1993 and had tried many other estrogen products while I was a clinical RN in a women's health clinic...kind of the office guinea pig.  They were not controlling the menopausal side effects, such as hot flashes, insomnia, anxiety spells, etc.  A dear friend, another RN, suggested Cenestin, so I tried it and was amazed...after one month, no menopausal symptoms and I was able to smile, enjoy life with more energy as well as a happier temprament, which my hubby was grateful for.  I have tried to wean down to a smaller dose, but the hot flashes and grumpiness return full force, so I am still on 1.25 mg.  At 55 years of age, I will continue to use for another few years under my doctor's close care...unfortunately the cost has skyrocketed since I started to take them years ago and it may not be an option for others due to lack of funds or insurance!

5	oopherectomy	None	I have been on HRT for 21 years. I am a small boned person but have not had bone loss. I attribute this to Cenestin. I tried not taking Cenestin but the hot flashes drove me mad.  The headaches that I had had before taking HRT came back. I persevered for one month. That was enough. I will not give up Cenestin.	F	72	7  years4.5 1X D	9/13/2011
5	menopasue	none	I feel young again, calm, happy, a lot more energy. I recommended to everyone who suffers from menopause.	F	49	5  years0.625 1X D	7/13/2011
5	menopause symptoms	None except for calmness, less wrinkles, smooth skin with no blemishes and no excess hair. Best product ever.	I recently stopped taking cenestin on my own when questions arose regarding breast cancer and hormone replacement therapy. Then I had to have a biopsy which was negative Thank God. I stopped using the cenestin with disastrous results, hot flashes, more facial hair & blemishes that I never had, and I'm sure if my husband was asked my temperment has not been the best. Well, I restated cenestin with an almost immediate change in my skin, calmness, and no hot flashes. I will continue to take cenestin and recommend this product to others after checking with their physician.	F	65	17  days 1X D	12/13/2010

5		hot flashes, night sweats due to ovary removed.	I take cenestin with prometrium. I've had no side effects. People tell me I look 25 years younger than I am.	F	52	2  years	1/30/2010
1	hsyterectomy at 43	started cenestin after the hysterectomy in 2001. Kept asking the Dr. if it was safe. I had read that you should only take it short term. Still had night sweats and weight gain from it. However, in 2008 went in for a CAT scan for another issue and a tumor was discovered on pelvic wall. Was stage 4 cancer, needed two major operations and approx. 18 mos of chemo. I had no ovaries but still developed ovarian cancer with also endometrial cancer cells. I truly believe it was caused by the cenestin feeding these cells over all those years. I had the surgeon stumped cause they couldn't even diagnose the cancer properly because there were so many different cancer cells within the biopsy piece. Had to send it out to three different labs for research. Has been a long road trying to recover. Wish I would have trusted my instincts and just lived with hot flashes rather than take a drug like this one.		F	52	7  years	1/18/2010
5	severe menopausal symptoms	none	Drug got rid of hot flashes, vaginal dryness, aches and pains, fatigue and depression. I was able to lose almost 40 lbs. Libido is much more active (perhaps too much). It is as though the drug knocked 25 years off my age.	F	57	2  years	3/9/2009
4	Hysterectomy	none	Second night after surgery I had a night sweat. My Dr. had me on 0.9 censetin the day I left the hospital. I do not have no night sweats at all. I am just scared a little because I was given a high dose, my Dr. says it is a normal a dose. Is it really?	F	47	2  months	2/4/2009
3	menopause side effects/hot flashes	breast tenderness, skin break-outs, and bloating   The worst side effects came about a day or two AFTER discontinuing Cenestin:  an over-all sensation of not feeling very well, jittery.  After about five days of non-use, the hot flashes returned but the other side effects (feeling unwell and jittery) went away.  I am now happily dealing with moderate (tolerable) hot flashes which is where I was prior to taking the drug.  In conclusion, I wish I had never taken it.  I feel now that the side effects, and possible risks of taking Cenestin, did not make using the drug appropriate for me or worth it.	My Dr. never told me that I should only be taking Cenestin short-term, as it was originally intended.	F	57	2  years	10/24/2008Email
4	Hysterectomy	some heart flutter	I have found that 1/2 of the .625 tablet relieves hot flashes and night sweats for me. I have tried to stop taking the drug, but the symptoms return.	F	52	3  years	2/28/2008
5	hysterectomy	None	Have taken lowest dose (.3) for several years. Tried to stop once , just cutting down to every other day, and just didn't feel right. hair started getting thinner. Decided the benefits outweighed any risks. I get checkups every year, eat healthy, etc. Recommend the drug to anyone.	F	63	4  years	2/13/2008
5	hot flashes, memory loss, depressed	vaginal discharge	I had been on Premarin for a couple of years after a complete hysterectomy and didn't like how I felt: blah, moody and depressed. After losing 25 lbs my hot flashes and interrupted sleep (fatigue, depression, memory loss) started up again. Cenestin did the trick. I feel much better. An added bonus was that it got rid of vulvovaginal thinning and dryness, although the vaginal discharge is quite heavy.	F	55	3  months	10/19/2007
1	menopause	Within 2 days I had a yeast infection vaginally, orally, a urinary tract infection, and a yeast type infection in my eyes as well as diarrea. Great, no extreme PMS, but my body is far worse off!		F	50	12  days	10/3/2007
5	early menopause & hot flashes	Have not had any side effects from taking this medication.	I have a family history of cancer and heart diseases,plus I am a diabetic, so I did have concerns about this medication. I have been taking it for 3 years now at a high dose rate and have not encountered any problems nor have I had any drug interactions with it and other medication.	F	51	3  years	8/25/2007
2	hot flashes	Migrane headaches, tingling fingers, wavy vision, bleeding	The other commentors raved about cenestin. I'm glad it worked for them, but the side effects were too great for me and I had to go off the medication.	F	54	2  months	7/31/2007
5	Premature menopause	I have experienced NO side effects unless you say being calm, centered, healthy and energized side effects.	I take Cenestin along with Prometrium and have taken it for about 10 years. I read about it before FDA approval because the company that makes it is practically in my back yard. I was diagnosed with premature menopause at 32 years old. I am now 43 and my doctor had at first prescribed Premarin (with which I bled about 20 days out of each month. I was searching for something new when I read about Cenestin development. I kept asking my doctor for it and as soon as it was FDA approved I got my prescription (even though I had to educate my doctor on what it was first). I have been on it ever since and have recommended it to many. I don't know why this isn't THE leading menopause symptom remedy. Doctors should be more educated.	F	43	10  years	2/16/2007Email
5	Hot flashes, night sweats	This drug is wonderful - my doctor says it's plant-based. I take a VERY low dose - the lowest infact.  I used to take a higher dose but as time went on, I found I didn't need it.  I take Cenestin with Prometrium.  Occasionally I have breast soreness but without this drug, my life is a living hell.
