1	Major Depression	Dizziness, Extremely Low Blood Pressure/Fainting, Severe Constipation w/ Anal Fissure, Anxiety Attacks, Abnormal (for me) Thougts/Writing, Weight Gain, Night Terrors so frequent and traumatic that I became sleep phobic.  Feeling psychotic.	My tme on this drug was the worst six months of my life. Over time the psychiatrist was prescribing so many other drugs to combat the side effects; Florinef to keep my blood pressure up and stop the fainting, Sleeping pills and anti anxiety pills so I could sleep, vitamins for my electrolytes that were tanking and finally an anti psychotic!  I became more sick on this drug than without it.  After passing out and not coming to this time I was rushed to the hospital.  I saw a psychiatrist there who told me that my dose was too high and I was having a toxic reaction, not becoming psychotic.  He took me off the drug and while I still had to deal with the depression, all the side effects vanished and I didn't need all the other drugs. I was 19 years old and on 75mg per day.

3	Major Depression	Weight Gain, Constipation, Sexual Side Effects, Insomnia	I have been taking Nardil for almost three years - it made me gain about 30 pounds and I have trouble sleeping (I wake up 2 - 5 times per night).  However, it is the only drug (out of about 30 of the SSRI's, SNRI's, tricyclics, atypical antipsychotics, etc.) that has worked satisfactorily for me.	M	26	3  years30 Mg 3X D	2/27/2013Email
5	Atypical Depression/Social Anxiety	Anorgasmia, constipation, insomnia, dizziness, weight gain.  All of these except the weight gain went away after 2 - 8 weeks/	For crying out loud if you have tried and SSRI, SNRI, and Wellbutrin read as much as you can about aytypical depression.  If you truly beleive that you have it then you owe it to yourself to try Nardil.  Side effects except the weight gain and some mild constipation have all resolved.  This drug has helped me get my life back and given me the energy and mood stability to get into therapy which is making an additional world of a difference.  Depression is 90% gone and social phobia 65% gone with Nardil Alone.  I can get out of bed and naturally start thinking what I want to accomplish today.  My motivation to do things is back.  Nardil vs. the 8 other antidpressants I've taken is no comparison.  This drug is awesome.  Working my ass of with an expert therapist I'm getting both of these to near 95% gone.  MAOI diet is outdated.  Read the articles from the researches in Toronto who researched the tyramine levels these "restricted" foods using modern day food hygine production.  Never had any issues and I eat whatever I want except any smelly aged cheeses, soy sauce, tap beer.  I make sure to stay away from the contraindicated medicines that you can't take with it though.  Don't be an idiot and you'll be fine.  I had to bounce around psychiatrists and had to be assertive with each one to make my case for Nardil.  I finally found one that would work with me and we eventually tried it.  Thank God I did.  If you have trouble getting someone to write it keep trying and boun	M	33	7  months90 3X D	2/6/2013Email

At start I feel lazy now i'm full of energy, I can drive almost anywhere, I stay alone at home with no fears. WOW, I loose 8 years trying to find the good antidepressant. I eat what I want, any cheese, meat... My heart beat is 80 instead of 120 beats per minute. My pressure is very good. Only panick attack per month instead of 5 every day. Thanks god i feel alive!!!

1	Severe depression/social anxiety	Other than wanting to violently kill myself, none	I was so disappointed. I was so pumped to try Nardil but it gave me strong suicidal urges and I had to stop after just 8 days. :( Big downer.	M	19	8  days15 2X D	1/14/2013Email
4	Anxiety / Depression	Insomnia for about 2 weeks, which went away.	I began taking this when all other anti-depressants failed, and I could no longer tolerate the mental fog and apathy that Lexapro caused.  It has helped a lot with taking the place of Lexapro for panic attacks and general anxiety, and has given me some energy back so I can work normally again.  It hasn't been what I had wanted in an anti-depressant.  I still feel emotionless and dull most of the time, with brief instances of feeling.  I am planning to go up to 30 mg BID soon to see if this helps.	M	32	9  months45 1X D	12/4/2012Email
3	Treatment-Resistant Depression	Severe swelling of legs & feet; chills; insomnia; blood pressure in the 70/40 range; frequently close to fainting	I recently ended up in the ER as I fainted upon getting out of bed in the morning and did not come to for over 20 minutes by which time my husband had called an ambulance.  It was determined by consults with both psychiatrists and internists that this episode was caused directly by the Nardil and it was imperative I begin weaning off of it as it was far too dangerous for me to be on with the way I responded physically.   My heart rate was in the 40's and blood pressure when going from lying down to stand was in the 70's/40's.  A month previous to this I had lowered my daily dose to 45 mg and the swelling became minimal but the other issues remained.  And my mood and ability to function also decreased very noticeably.  So I am beginning to slowly taper off with no idea what I will try next as i have been on just about every other drug in every conceivable combination and dosage.

5	social phobia/depression	the insomina made me give up, which i regret to this day , thast why im going back on it again, unable to orgasm, light headed first few weeks, staggering when walking sometimes	was the most amazing med ive tried, i have tried a lot this med at the low dose of 45mg per day brought me back to the young woman i once was, maybe even better, besides the side effects i was happy every day, i was confident, i looked forward to everything, i could do all my house work & felt good doing it, went off it and in a space of a month to this day im miserable.

4	Major depression	Weight gain, nausea, horrible taste in my mouth due to change in coating in 2003, dry mouth. Four hypertensive crises in 30 years due to eating spoiled chicken and/or ketchup.	The doctor who prescribed Nardil saved my life. I had been having panic attacks, deep episodes of depression, and heavy depersonalization. I have been on as little as 60 mg, but mostly maintained on 90 mg. I  would be lying if I said that it made me feel 100% better; it's more like 65-70%. The panic attacks are completely gone. I do suffer insomnia, however, and even moving the Nardil to earlier in the day has not helped. Yes, it took about 4-6 weeks to kick in. The way my doc described it was that my "depressed palor" had disappeared, but the greatest relief was that I no longer had severe panic attacks -- and those had been the worst of it. You have to be very committed to taking this drug because of all the food and drug interactions. There is a steep learning curve, but once you experience feeling human again, having to remember a lot becomes easier. If you're just starting on Nardil, please give it time. I promise it will work for you. If you need to, put up a wall calendar and mark off days. By around 4 weeks, it will start to kick in because the blood level of the drug will be growing. Remember, it IS worth the wait, and YOU are worth the time it takes -- even if you have to take a leave from your job or your life. I'm a cheerleader, but I hate Pfizer for changing the coating because it's cheaper to make that way.	F	55	30  years45 mg 2X D	7/9/2012Email

5	Depression	Slight weight gain (easily counteracted with exercise); mild fatigue (again, exercise); constipation in first couple months (eat fiber).	Saved my life. When Prozac stopped working, Nardil proved to be a miracle drug! Not only did it allow me to have a normal, outgoing personality, but allowed me to date, build relationships, and live a normal life. This drug is the reason I can live like anyone else.. I can live without the fog of depression. Each day feels like a positive, new day. And yet, it doesn't dull the emotions. I still feel great music, still have strong emotions, etc... it just takes away the awful, awful depression. So sad doctors know little about this drug. If only more people knew about Nardil.. if only.	M	27	2  years60 1X D	4/21/2012Email
5	Depression, anxiety agoraphobia	Nausea on starting low blood pressure	I was originally on nardil in the 1980's they changed my life completely. Now just gone back on them only been on 3half wks still feel nauseaus but hopefully that will cease soon!	F	49	 30mg 2X D	4/8/2012Email
1	Severe Post Traumatic Stress/Depres	As I increased dose fainting and seizures started becoming a problem. Ended up in the Emergency Room after having 2 bad episodes in the space of 3 hours. I naturally have quite low blood pressure 120/50 but my blood pressure was dropping to under 90. In the emergency room, through consultation with my GP and Psychiatrist it was agreed to drop dosage down to 30 mg twice per day. A week after being in the ER I had an unstoppable seizure, went from arms, legs and head flailing about uncontrollably to being stiff as a board, neck back. An ambulance was called, they were unable to stop the seizure so called for a second ambulance. They put a breathing tube down my throat in case everything seized up. By the time I arrived at the hospital I was unable to breath and the seizure contunued. I was placed in an induced coma in the Intensive Care Unit for 2 days and then was placed in the Critical Care Medical Ward for a further 2 weeks. I had one more seizure while undergoing rehabilitative Physi	Prior to all the horrendously bad stuff happening, when I was taking my full dose of 90mg per day I was feeling the best I had ever felt, certainly not 100% but soooo much better. When the dosage was dropped to 60mg per day, I noticed a considerable downturn in my mood and behaviours - Binging on food, feeling miserable again, terrified to leave the house, buying random things uncontrollably.Would I recommend Nardil? Yes I would, the things that happened to me was not the norm and before it happened I was feeling better.I had taken so many different other types of anti-depressants before this but nothing helped me.

5	Anxiety and severe depression	It's been so many years taking Nardil I believe there were no side effects.	Nardil was the drug of choice by doctors during WW1. Soldiersriddled with fear couldn't return to the battle field..  The drug gave instant relief of fear. Nardil should be taken with a benzo. to stablize chemical imbalance.

5	Depression	extreme constipation	Nardil may have saved my life. I was extremely depressed and suicidal. After 4 weeks on the drug and the addition of abilify, I have zero thoughts of self harm and can engage better with others. I have taken ssris and snris for years with very little results.

When my doctor put me on Nardil the day before I had been sitting in the batroom with a 357 in my mouth. Seeing the doc was my last chance. The drug gave me a complete recovery.It took two weeks. From that day on I married, had a family and built a very lucrative business. With all the potential side effects it is worth it as I was 24 hours from eating a 357 magnum.I am now doing public speaking and wowing the crowds. If they only knew my secret.

5	Depression, Social anxiety disorder	None	Stopped taking pristiq and started Nardil 7 days later. I didn't sleep the first night, but wasn't even tired the next day. I feel amazing and have to constantly ask the people closest to me if I seem manic because I feel so good but feel extra talkative. For the first time in my life (without benzo's) I have absolutely no social anxiety. Life just seems amazing now. I was taking Nardil last year at the same time as a strong painkiller and always looked off my face, and had postural hypotension to the point where I kept waking up in cake, on the floor etc. This time around, minus said painkiller, I am experiencing no side effects whatsoever. Unless the joy for life I have really is mania or true euphoria, in which case I welcome it. I am going to tell my doctor to stop prescribing other ad's as this is the only he should really ever use. I've tried everything and this is the only drug where I have seen a noticeable difference. It felt like waking up from a nightmare. The relief is amazing and I truly believe this medication is a godsend. I'm not even sure it has had time to even kick in but if it gets any better they will have to start calling it ecstacy.

1	Depression	loss of affect, sleeping constantly, sensation of electrical shock, tardive dyskenesia.	I stopped taking it when my arm began swinging out without volition, and the symptoms stopped.	F	60	60  days 1X D	6/27/2011
5	Treatment Resistant Depression	Mid afternoon sleepiness, weight gain, insomnia, orthostatic hypotension	This drug saved my life not once, but twice - and I mean literally.  Without this drug, I may have ended up an ECT victim or ending my own life.  In 10 years, the MAOI drugs (Parnate, and Nardil) are the only things that have touched my depression.  I went off Nardil before due to the weight gain - if this happens to you, I strongly advise you don't do what I did and stop taking it.  I am just fortunate it has worked for me again.  I tried every SSRI on the market, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Remeron, Lithium, Lamictal - nothing has worked as well as this drug which has relieved most of my severe, treatment-resistant depression and anxiety.  It makes me feel normal, feel like engaging in meaningful activity, and returning to work eventually.  If you've tried modern antidepressants and they haven't helped, or haven't helped enough, you owe it to yourself to give Nardil or Parnate a try.  (I had to stop Parnate because it ended up making me hypomanic - but Parnate had similar efficacy without the weight gain, not QUITE as good for anxiety.)	M	29	2  weeks30 2X D	6/15/2011Email
5	Major Depression, Suicidal Ideation	postural hypotension, insomnia, extreme fatigue, daytime narcolepsy, constipation, weight gain, temporary impotence, difficulty concentrating, and much more!	Thanks to this rating site and many other online message boards, I decided to try nardil after failing a couple reuptake inhibitors. I had just transferred to a university and the drug trials were profoundly ruining my life for a year. There is no other way to explain the experience other than mental torture. Nardil saved me. The only reason I had almost every side effect to extreme degrees was because I increased to 90mg/day after only 1 week at a lower dose. Had I known the intensity of side effects it would bring on at that rate, I would have been more patient in reaching my appropriate dose. Most of the side effects subsided after 6-8 weeks.	M	23	6  months30 mg 3X D	6/7/2011
4	Anxiety, Depression, OCD	Weight gain, trouble sleeping, sweating, snoring, alternating diarrhea and constipation, flatulence.	Since childhood I have taken over 20 medications for my condition, and Nardil is the best treatment. The positive changes it produces often seem lacking or insignificant, but in truth the changes are profound and mean the difference between being hospitalized and having some quality of life.

5	Depression and Anxiety	Insomnia,some difficulty sexually peaking.	After trying 10-15 anti-depressants in 12 years, Nardil is The Only Medicine that not only eliminated my depression (crossing my fingers!) but doesn't make me feel like an anxious situation will completely take over my mind and body.I HAD INSOMNIA IN THE BEGINNING- SO FAR THIS HAS WORKED FOR WONDERFULLY: I'll wake up @ 1 a.m., TAKE 45 MG. OF PHENELZINE, AND GO RIGHT BACK TO SLEEP!  THEN I TAKE THE REMAINING 15 MG. BEFORE 12 A.M.  I DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS SLEEPING ANYMORE!	F	41	80  days60 MG 1X D	3/19/2011Email
4	Treatment resistant depression	Delayed ejaculation, mild erection problems, sleep disturbance, strange ringing in ear when standing (not the normal type), constipation, narcolepsy type sleepiness in the day at times, memory issues, weight gain (about 20% of my weight), some carb cravings.	I tried about a dozen different drugs which had little to no effect. Nardil was the first thing that worked. I'm not 100% on Nardil, but very significantly better - I can function something close to normal most of the time. The side effects are worse at the beginning as you'd expect, but they do see to increase in intensity time to time in waves - I'll have a few weeks of bad side effects then a few months of mild. Overall, you'd have to pry it out of my cold dead hands. After years of ineffective drugs, despite the side effects sucking, I can function.	M	40	2  years60mg 1X D	2/6/2011Email
4	Depression, anxiety	Difficulty achieving erection, inorgasmia, occasional down periods, daytime fatigue and sleepiness.	Only antidepressant out of thirteen over a 15 year period that has actually provided sustained results.  While there are still the occasional down days, I no longer have major depressive episodes.  I do often have ADD-like symptoms, but never hypomania, and since I concurrently take 200mg daily of Provigil, the cause has not been attributed to one or the other drugs, or is perhaps a combination of the two.  I would like to comment on the diet restrictions:  Being the personality type that has to push the boundaries in order to know the playing field, as it were, upon initially taking Nardil I consumed foods from the restricted list, slowly at first until there were no restricted that I don't consume freely.  In four years I have had one hypertensive event where I asked my wife to drive me to the ER when my BP meter indicated a BP of 180 over 250.  Upon arrival, my BP was normal.  I had been told that in an MAOI related crisis, my BP would not have returned to normal this quickly or without intervention.  Was it the Nardil? No one knows, although an hour before checking my BP at home I had consumed nearly 8oz of Societe Roquefort cheese and nearly the same quantity of dry spicy Italian salami, so it is probable.  My psch doctor and everything I've read had prepared me for specific symptoms that included being nauseous or vomiting, severe headache, etc.  The only symptom that signaled concern was an odd feeling that I hadn't experienced before which made me think to check my BP	M	62	4  years45mg 1X D	1/2/2011

5	social anxiety	insomnia,lack of libido,headaches,tremor-all gone now and probably went after i was slowly increased to 45mg a day	an excellent drug for social anxiety-when you first take it you are invincible,have verbal diohrea,can talk to strangers about anything(nardil nonsense!)nothing phases you.this eurphoric stage last a few weeks and then you mellow out to a normal stage where the drug just does its job and side effects are then minimal-i have had no issues with any food-i drink alcohol,eat pepperoni,mature cheese in moderation,dont be put off by these very outdated food restrictions	M	45	2  years15mg 3X D	10/13/2010Email
5	Bipolar 2 & Social Anxiety	Insomnia, constipation, low blood pressure, lower libido, in past 5 years, due to Nardil causing high adrenaline levels, blood pressure would spike high after evening dose; that is under control now.	To date, Nardil is the only anti-depressant I can take.  I have tried many others and am treatment resistant.  Nardil has been a life saver for me in spite of some of the side effects.

5	Treatment Resistant Depression, GAD	Excessive sweating, carb cravings	After two years of trying every anti-depressant known to man, my P-Doc mentioned MAOI's as a last resort.  He said they were not prescribed often because of the dietary restrictions, but I was desperate for relief. Nardil has been a wonder drug and a savior-My anhedonia has been replaced by motivation and enjoyment and I don't need Klonopin to battle anxiety.  The dietary restrictions are so minimal I can't believe that anyone with depression would not make the trade-off.  Full relief in exchange for no aged cheese, pepperoni and soy sauce is a no-brainer in my book.  I can't recommend this medicine enough.	M	55	1.5  months60mg 1X D	8/13/2010Email
2	Atypical Depression	Repeated fainting/falling upon standing that didn't seem to go away with time resulting in many bruises & bumps to the head. Tiredness during day. Complete lack of headaches (good). Wanting to sleep all the time. Super low blood pressure even after activity. General coordination problems at 60mg which I was only at briefly-even trouble staying in lane while driving.	I think it was helping with my depression, but the low blood pressure/fainting/falling was too dangerous & unnerving to remain on a therapeutic dose. I am on 22.5 mg now just to get by till my next dr's appt. Parnate is next. No food interactions, but I stayed away from restricted foods. Still feel it is worth trying for anyone that hasn't responded to other meds.	F	35	90  days15mg 3X D	6/14/2010Email
5	Migraines and depression	Insomnia, euphoria, weight loss, possibly tardive dyskinesia	I've taken 4 courses of Nardil over 15 years. It quit working after 1 year except this time. Works extremely well for both migraines (the only prophylactic treatment that has) and depression. Staying hydrated increases effectiveness markedly - at least 1/2 gallons of fluids a day, 3/4 is better. Keep Nardil "foods, meds, and supplements to avoid" list readily available for family, friends, doctors and ERs. [***You may contact me for very complete MS Excel worksheet***] You literally can't be too careful. While being prepped for a procedure the OR clinician decided to use lidocaine w/ epi (epinepherine) as opposed to the lidocaine I had approved, on the spur of the moment!

5	In the 1980's for Major Depression	My side effects were mostly all GOOD with Nardil when I took it back in the mid-eighties for a major depression. No other meds at the time helped me..of course now in 2010 they have a lot of other meds..but none that I have taken have helped like Nardil did. I did have ONE High BP episode when I ate a very small piece of Kilbasa (my mistake). Headache for hours b/c of a spike in BP..but it went away. I also lost weight due to the strict dietary requirements, so that was a plus.	I wish I could take it again now (2010) for depression, but b/c of some health problems that I didn't have years ago, the doctor won't give it to me. That drug saved my life. I told the doctor at the time who prescribed it that I would walk out in the AM and hear the birds singing..things were SO CLEAR. Amazing..and powerful drug. Within 3 mths of starting Nardil, I had a job, lost weight (I needed to lose a lot) and had more energy than I had in years. I thank God for my doctor at the time for trying this drug on me.

Crave carbohydrates. Now I wonder if hair loss is from taking Nardil for so many years, but I have no options. Treatment-resistant depression.	Treatment-resistant depression. Docs always seeking adjunct med to add to Nardil. Have tried Lamictal, Trileptal, Topamax. Either the side effects were horrible, or they didn't help. Now my doc is thinking of Abilify, which scares me to death. Side effects can be really bad. Nardil helps my depression only about 75%, and no one has found the drug to enhance that.In 2003, Pfizer changed the manufacturing facility and the coating was changed. The pill looks different and the coating has a horrible taste, which never really leaves the mouth. Many people have complained to Pfizer that the drug is less effective than it was pre-2003; don't know the sites, but if you Google Nardil 2003 changes, you'll find message boards. I also have trouble finding a new psych who knows how Nardil works and really about drugs that don't interact. I have to take Yohimbine HCL 5.4mg twice daily to maintain normal blood pressure. Otherwise, it's VERY low, like 75/50.	M	52	28  years	8/17/2009Email
5	Depression and anxiety	None. I strictly adhered to food list given by doctor.	Only anti-depressant that worked, even better than shock treatments providing I took them regularly. It was my wonder drug.	M	78	3  years	8/11/2009Email
5	Migraines	Weight gain, carb cravings.  Mood swings if I miss more then 1 dose.	Hospital trip expected if I stray off diet.  Hard diet because no leftovers over 2 days old + no cheese = my not eating enough protein.  I eat a lot of eggs - luckily, I like them and have a good source.  This is the only medication that helps me maintain "low pain" headaches instead of 2-3 Migraines a week.  It was given to me after 3 years of failed "migraine regimin" drugs.	F	41	4  years	7/29/2009
5	Anxiety	Occassionally some stimulation, anorgasmia	Best psychotropic for me so far	M	52	16  years	7/26/2009
5	muscular/neurological problems	Sleepiness, hot spells, nightmares (but no REM sleep).	I had several very bad reactions to food.  Blood pressure sky-rocketed, severe headache, nausea, pain in left arm, heart palpitations.I've been to the emergency trip several times.  Once after a reaction I was hospitalized because my blood work showed signs of a heart attack.Apparently I've had many more problems with interactions with food and drink than others.I recommend following the food restrictions carefully, except for those on avocados, soy products, and bananas.	F	47	23  years	7/22/2009
4	Dysthymia + Major Depression	On dosage c.40mg: short term memory loss (not listed as side effect in literature), slowed digestion, increased appetite - especially for carbohydrates,	After trying a series of SSRI's, tricyclics, SSNRI's etc I tried Nardil and it has worked well. Dietary restrictions are not a concern for me and occasional alcohol, cheese etc are fine. I split dosage into 3 times/ day. Can be a hassle to travel with as you are meant to keep them refrigerated.	M	36	4  years	7/4/2009
5	Depression	Weight gain, occassional dry mounth, insomnia, occassional Postural hypotension	I was suffering from a debilitating depression. The pain was constant and unbearable.  I felt worthless and hopeless. None of the  new class of drugs worked.  I had taken Nardil in 1987 to lift me out of similar depression and it worked so my doctor and I thought we should try it again.  This time it started working after about three weeks.   The drug hasn't solved all my problems, but I couldn't expect it to.  Right now I feel the absence of depression.  I feel much, much better.	M	43	5  weeks	7/3/2009
3	Social Phobia	Jaw clenching (in the beginning), anorgasmia (did go away), huge increase in appetite	I took this for an extreme case of social phobia and was on 75 mg/day. It was never even mentioned by doctors, but I found info on it online. I brought this up to my dr and he agreed to give me the prescription. Supposed to be the "gold standard" for social phobia. However, it did not help me at all. I was on it for 8 months so I did give it an honest try. It caused anorgasmia, but this did go away by about the 4th month. My appetite was insatiable, I just wanted to eat all the time and was insatiable. On the plus side, I had daily chronic headaches, and Nardil completely obliterated them. Now that I"m off of it, the headaches have returned. I've been on other meds in the past to prevent headaches, but Nardil worked better than any of them, by far! Too bad it didn't help the social phobia.	F	39	8  months	6/13/2009
5	depression anxiety	sleeplessness weight gain less sex drive	Had a problem having to take any meds ! Had a problem knowing I suuffered from depression but realised if you need to take meds to get your life back then so be it! Chemists sometimes gave a 'funny' look to me with comments like,"be very careful with this drug; it can be dangerous". Food and wine avoidance is a pain - I cheat lots! and have found no problems. Read somewhere list of foods to avoid has been reduced but can't seem to find it. Only drug I found worked for me.	F	53	15  years	3/14/2009
4	depression and social anxiety	weight gain, sleepiness during day, insomnia at night, wild variations in bp,	It has helped and I've tried everything in the book over the last 15 years. 45mg dose seems to make me irritable any really lowered bp. It's my experience that most foods on list do not cause problems. I cant seem to sleep longer than 4-5 hours at night and that is with ambien cr and a muscle relaxer. chronic headaches.	M	43	8  weeks	2/16/2009
3	Social Anxiety, dysthymia	severe weight gain due to craving of sweets, extreme narcolepsy like sleepiness in afternoons, sexual inorgasmia, urinary hesitancy	Definitely helped anxiety and depression but not completely but has helped more than SSRIs. I am going to taper off due to weight gain/sleepiness but it was a hard decision. Going to try Parnate instead. Hopefully it won't cause same SEs. Tried Provigil for sleepiness - did not work at all.	F	35	8  weeks	12/28/2008
5	depression	anorgasmia, orthostatic hypotension, insomnia, hypersomnia, myclonic jerks, constipation, farting, excessive sweating, slow metabolism	worked great after 1 month. side effects almost all gone by 3rd month, except minor constipation and softer-than-before stool and excessive sweating. eating more salt relieves the embarassing sweating. complete success in recovery... combined with modafinil. without modafinil I will usually feel too "tired"/groggy and it blunts my functioning. with it, my appetite is decreased, attention increased.	M	20	4  months	8/3/2008
5	atypical depression	postural hypotension, anorgasmia and weight gain. Diurnal somnolence at the beginning but improves over time. Insomnia is not as worse, because I'd say is much rather a lessening in the total amount of sleeping time, wich is not always a bad thing.	Side effects apart, the medication is exactly what I needed. I suffered from mild social phobia but severe apathy, anergia, lack of concentration and anhedonia (lack of motivation and unable to enjoy anything). The treatment brought me back to my previous personality, and I have been feeling exactly what I expected for 2 years. The main issue that makes me think about a change is the weight gain. I am wondering to pass to tranylcipromine, but I am not sure about it. Any suggestions?	M	31	2  years	5/4/2008Email
5	social anxiety	dry mouth, ejaculatory difficulty at mid to high doseages.	The only medication among about a dozen that I tried that was at all helpful with depression, social and generalized anxiety.  Gave me my life back. The dietary restrictions are based on 1940-50's pharmacology and have been updated considerably to the point where only a handful of items need to be avoided. I took this medication for 20 years and only twice had a reaction - once to anchovies and the other to a decongestant. MAOIs (including Nardil) are NOT contradictive with Wellburtin, Lamactil, Dexostat (dexadrine) and many of the medications widely believed to be so. I speak from years of experience. All of the foods I ate and medications I took with Nardil (and later, Parnate and Marplan) were under the direction of doctors and based on my own review of studies. There is absolutely no science-based reason not to eat most of the items on the outdated "do not eat" lists. The Univ. of Toronto (Sunnyside) was a pioneer in researched into MAOIs in the 90's. Their conclusion was	M	55	20  years	4/18/2008Email

1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS.

His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy).

I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011

Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
