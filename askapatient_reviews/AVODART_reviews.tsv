5	bph	no sex drive-constipated-		M	76	3  years 1X D	2/14/2013
3	enlarged/inflamed prostate	Leg muscle aches/cramps, joint stiffness, tenderness in feet	This is the second time in 2 years that I have taken this drug....with a 6 month break in between.  Symptoms began 20 - 30 days after starting the drug. The drug helps w/shrinking the prostate, but the side effects are miserable.	M	60	2  months20mg 1X D	2/12/2013Email
4	frequent urination/enlarged prostat		Now taking Avodart every other day, alternating with Saw Palmetto extract.I believe my prostate has shrunk somewhat more. I will discontinue both Avodart and Flomax (which I also only take every other day now) when I run out. It will be interesting to see if my BPH issues continue to be better (having to urinate less often) and if the sexual side effects completely subside (a little more difficult to get an erection and decreased ejaculate).

3	enlarged prostate	delayed and reduced seman ejection after ejaculation. erection only partial.		M	72	6  months.5 mg 1X D	8/2/2011Email
2	prostate cancer	Tumour quickly became smaller to three quarter size and hardened and became well-defined, libido decreased to near zero, sexual frequency reduced to once a month at best, feelings of severe depression, despair, mental degradation, lethargy, increased anxiety, can't wait to get off the stuff.  Feelings of despair and mental degradation increase with continued usage especially after 25 days.	Too many negative side effects for me and hate the stuff.  Wish the tumour would just vanish on its own and they would develop a pill without the side effects or a pill to destroy the tumour.	M	70	42  days0.5 mg 1X D	6/20/2011Email
3	Hair Loss	I have taken avodart for two months for hair loss.  It causes something strange to happen when i take the pill at night before be.  i have to go pee like 20 times.  Its weird because i know people take it to stop frequent urination. Maybe because i didnt have that to start with its doing opposite??? i dunno,  gonna keep trying hoping this feeling will go away.  cause i really dont want to loose my hair.  or better yet I really want to keep what i have		M	25	2  months,5 1X D	10/18/2010

4	back pain when urinating		Iâ€™ve been taking for 5 years and will probably continue for rest of life. I began because of some severe pain in my lower side back when urinating. Had to be catheterized several times in emergency room. At first thought was kidney stones. But never found stones, and doctors could only suggest had something to do with prostate. Meanwhile I also began to show the usual prostate symptoms: urgency, frequency, reduced flow. For those I started to take Flomax. The severe pains stopped after several months, but the other symptoms remained troublesome until recently. The good news is that I've just stopped taking the Flomax after five years and I'm doing fine. I attribute my improvement to the Avodart, which, I surmise, reduced the size of my prostate sufficiently to make taking the Flomax unnecessary to control the symptoms. So there is hope ... though patience is required: 5 years in my case. I guess Avodart was the real agent of long-term change for the better.	M	59	5  years	8/11/2009
2	moderate BHP	painful sensitivity to breast nipples, breast enlargement,discontinued use upon M.D. advice (after 6 months use.)	I also take 10 mg of Terazosin, for urine flow, am still on this drug.Avodart seems to alleviate the prostate pain I am suffering from, but the side effects are too strong.	M	66	6  months	10/28/2008
4	BPH	Does cause ED if taken 6 hours before sex.  Planning ahead means postponing dose	Flomax had changed my life for the worse. I was not feeling well and could not figure why -- I now believe blood pressure issues. On Avodart I have reversed symptoms and have nearly no side effects.	M	65	4  months	8/2/2008

4	hair loss	none that I'm aware of	This product only works if you continue to take it.  I noticed that once I discontinue use for two weeks, I noted some level of hair loss.	M	56	3  years	2/26/2008
2	Enlarged Prostate	Anxiety, rash and pain in groin area, lowering of libido,  and slowly decreasing overall wellness	Shortly after starting Avodart, I felt a terrible anxiety in my leg area and lower body.  Had never experienced anything like this in my entire life.  I wrongly blamed it on eye drops taken for Glucoma. The anxiety slowley went away after starting a rigorus vitiamin regiment but was soon replaced with an agressive rash and pain in the groin area.  My Dr. treated the rash with antibiotics and then later with a prescribed cream.  After both treatments the rash returned with a vengence. The light came on and I realized my problems were atributed to the Avodart.  After only 2 days off the pills, rash is almost gone, my libito is back, and I feel like my old energetic self.  I honestly had no idea how far I had drifted from my previous spark for life.  Will visit with my MD in a few days and discuss options.  Perhaps since the recovery is so rapid, a pill every other day might work, or even an occassional sabatical from the drug now and then.  Or maybe no Avadart at all ?  I must admit, it	M	64	18  months	2/11/2008
4	Prostate enlargement	Loss of Libido - I will soo ask Dr. to change my prescription to Proscar.	Seems to work well for the prostate condition.	M	61	2  months	1/31/2008Email
4		Hair Loss	works well as long as I keep taking it---but noticeable thinning when I stopped taking it for a month or so... also seems to cause blurry long-distance vision---trouble focusing on long distance objects--which is different than the age-related vision changes that I have experienced for reading, etc...

5	Enlarged Prostate		I have been taking Avodart concurrently with Flomax. It's about a year and my Prostate has shrunk. I've reduced my Flomax dose from two to one a day.  I'm now going to eliminate Flomax as I'm urinating with strong flow.	M	73	330  days	5/31/2007
