				F M	 	 	    
1	copd/emphysema	difficult swallowing, hoarseness, but the worse was the nighttime muscle cramps which were very severe enough to be afraid to go to sleep. Weaned myself of of it.		F	71	1  months	7/10/2009
3	asthma treatment	lots of mouth irritation and gum irritation even though rinsing well after use.  Also notice weight gain and my face swells and I have to stop taking it for a few days.  It does improve coughing and symptoms quite well but I hate the side effects.		F	60	3  months	2/16/2009
4		no side effects yet	I am now taking 4 puffs 2x daily with Singulair each day to get me off the albuterol. Seems excessive but i'm taking the albuterol less.	M	41	1  months	2/4/2008
2	asthma	I've been on Azmacort for about a month and it is not working.  I'm still coughing and wheezing.  I'm switching back to Pulmicort.  The only thing I've had that might be a side effect is I had sore gums for a week after being on Azmacort for a couple of weeks.  That has gone away.  Otherwise, I don't know why my gums would have been sore.  So, no other side effects, it just isn't working for me.		F	38	1  months	1/1/2008Email
5	Asthma	No side effects.	Have not been hospitalized for stat attack for over 10 years after being put on azmacort.  Prior to being on Azmacort, was frequently on oral steroids.  Able to lead full life:  walks, play golf, do yard work.  Rarely need to use albuterol inhaler. For me, it has been a cure, although I know better as asthma is a dangerous disease if not managed.

5	Asthma	None.	The combination of Azmacort and singulair has worked wonders for me.  More than one Dr. has tried to sell me on advair, but my current drugs are working great for me...so why change?	F	46	20  years	8/8/2005
