5	Avulsed Brachial Plexus C-5 - T-1	extreme sleepiness, sore gums, burnt gums, jaw pain	I have severe nerve pain, and this is the only drug that knocks it out when I desperately need it. Make sure you move it around while it's in buccally to stop it from burning your gums. I coat my gums with probiotics after it dissolves. Watch out with this potent drug...only 1/hr.

5	sarcoidosis, chronic pericarditis,	My gums get a little sore	This is an amazing drug. I have been in such severe pain and this is the only thing that has been able to REALLY REALLY work and FAST, especially for when my heart is involved. Too bad my damn insurance co. BCBS after two years of me taking fentora, they have decided that since I don't have cancer, I can't have it anymore, unless I want to pay out of pocket $5500 a month. Which I don't have. I am appealling as we speak, but it doesn't look good. Does anyone have any suggestions, to help me fight them, I really need to have this approved. I have every other narcotic you can name, they don't come close to the releif the fentora offers! (oxycontin, dilaudid, fentanyl patch, MS contin, methadone, neurontin, etc) please contact me if you can help me!! Thanks Tee	F	42	28  months	7/20/2009Email
5	Degenerative Disc Disease	Dry mouth, not that bad. Better then Oxycontin and many of the other meds I've taken. I recommend	I also take Duragesic, Nerontin, Cymbalta.	M	35	365  days	4/8/2008Email
5	pain, failed spinal surgeries	sore bleeding gums, mild headache, occasional dizziness with nausea and vomiting( only if taken without food)	Fentora is a Godsend! I have chronic intractable pain with a spinal cord injury and Fentora is the only med that makes the pain tolerable. I only use Fentora now for my pain, I take 800mcg qid. I was able to stop taking oxycontin,methadone,and dilaudid. This med really helps! I used Actiq 1600mcg prior to Fentora and this form of Fentanyl is much stronger. Plus, it is sugar free, so even though my gums get sore, my teeth are safe. On Actiq I had 6 cavities in the first year. I just went to the dentist and I have zero with Fentora.

4	pain	sleepiness	Fentora works extremely fast and is effective since it is absorbed throught the gums and cheek.  When my pain is at its worst I can not keep a pill down. Fentora is a life saver.	F	25	4  months	11/30/2007
5	complex regional pain syndrome	some dry mouth, bitter taste both short lived	acts very quickly. relief in 5-10 minutes. Lasts about an hour. More effective than Actiq. Lower dose works better.	F	52	1  years	11/14/2007
