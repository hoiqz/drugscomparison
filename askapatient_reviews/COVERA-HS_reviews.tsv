1	high blood pressure	swelling ankles,headaches,dizzyness, mood swings,hair loss, heavy eye lids a night,shortness of breath at times, vision blurred, itching, lightheadedness.	This is one drug that should be tossed in the trash can forever!it makes a 40 or 50 year old person feel like a 80 or older person ! you have no energy at all, bp goes down but does not hold even with sr types - fades out in the wee hours, and you end up wakeing up with ultra high b.p readings! and some chest pains! I think Doctors should take a step and read the side effects and make sure the paitent can tollerate the medicationsthey hand out so free and easy! its a half assed process with doctors today!

4	High Blood Pressure	Fatigue, dry mouth	It brought my HBP uder control almost immediately (from 180/130 to 120/80), but I am always tired and have dry mouth & eyes.	M	39	5  years	7/28/2008
1	High Blood Pressure	Hair loss!  I was on it for 9 years and losing my hair.  I didn't realize that it was the Verapamil causing the hair loss.  I pray my hair will grow back now that I am not taking it any longer.  It worked for my high high blood pressure, but not worth it to be going bald.		F	55	9  years	3/14/2007
4	HBP	Very mild. Constipation	Cannot get it anymore. What gives. I really liked it.  Neither the mail away nor the local drug stores said they could get it.	F	66	2  years	4/28/2006
5	Tachycardia	Mild constipation	My tachycardia first started at age 11 and I had 4-8 episodes per year until starting Verapamil about ten years ago.
