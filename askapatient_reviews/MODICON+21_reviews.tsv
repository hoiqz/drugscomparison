2	Birth Control	When I firswt started taking this pill, the first week, nothing seemed different. Then I started feeling very bloated, I gained about 5lbs. and had no appetite and felt nauseous.I usually go to the gym (for the past two years) daily, but couldnt go, and if I tried, I felt severly tired and dizzy.I have depression, and this seemed to multiply it, to where I couldnt get out of bed in the morning and felt disconnected.I have acne, and it seemed to help that (the only positive effect).This is the third pill I have tried, and the low dose pills seem to make me blled during the regular pills and not on the sugar. I also noticed I couldnt wear my contact when taking this pill, my eyes simply rejected them when I tried to put them in.		M	24	20  days	3/23/2008Email
