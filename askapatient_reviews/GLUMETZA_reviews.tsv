3	PCOS and TTC	Very loose stools, loss of appetite, nausea, weight loss, loss of libido	Taking total 1500mg a day. When I initially started with one a day to work my way up, I was very overwhelmed with the constant diarreah and terrible nausea. Went on business trip for 2 weeks and decided to skip meds as it would make work more difficult. Came back and decided i needed to get to get back on as we are TTC and I have been having irregular periods for the past year. I have been working my way up slowly as the side effects are too much for me to handle. I am up to 2x a day working up to 3xday. I stuck out the nausea and disgust for food (which I LOVE) and now have reduced my appetite drastically.  No carb and or sweet cravings which is FANTASTIC! I noticed my weight is going down. Only have lost about 3-4 pounds in the past couple weeks but I am extatic about it as I have been trying to lose weight so badly since the start of the year and barely lost 2 pounds with a low carb 1200 cal diet and exersize. Worst part is that my libido took a nose dive :-( Poor DH. I have not been working out as i should be but am thinking to get back to the gym and hopefully lose more weight as it can reverse the symptoms of PCOS. But all this diarreah, and nausea will be all worth it if i get my periods back and we can conceive to term. Here's to hoping and wishing you all luck	F	29	3  weeks500MG 3X D	7/5/2012Email
