5	Sinusitus	None.  Seems to have dimished heart palpitations from taking Plavix.	Would reccomend in an instant.  Sinus infections went away in about three (3) days and didn't suffer from any loss of taste.	M	46	7  days50mg 1X D	2/1/2012Email
4	I'm taking fluticasone for allergy.	I'm getting few if any side effects- maybe a little slow & sleepy,but that could be from allergies, which are definitely not as bad since I started the Rx.		M	58	2  weeks50 mcg 2X D	3/22/2011
4		I have not had any side effects whatsoever.  I have seasonal allergies but this year has been the worst.  The nasal spray appears to be helping but then again it could be that whatever I am allergic to has somewhat cleared up. Too soon to tell.	The brand I am using is the generic brand manufactured by Apotex.	F	59	6  days50 mcg 1X D	10/30/2010Email
5	sinusitus, Chronic Nasal Polyps	none.	Seems to work great for me.  keeps polyps down to reappearing in 5 years instead of 1.  No more sinus infections.	M	42	5  years 2X D	10/21/2010
1	Sinusitis / Allergy / Stuffed Nose	Feeling of losing your breath especially during sleep (bad since nose stuffed) / Anxiety / Feeling of something bad is going to happen / panic attack / unable to sleep.	Didn't put two and two together until I read this wed site concerning both this generic and the brand name Flonase.  Thought I was dying / wife says I was over reacting but now I see I am not the only one experiencing these adverse reactions.	M	44	3  days50 mcg 1X 1X D	9/14/2010
1	Allergies	My daughter's usual Veramyst was changed to this. Although this is considered a generic to Veramyst, we found side effects that were different than she'd experienced. She experienced trouble falling asleep, but when she did sleep, it was fitful and her dreams were vivid. She'd wake up in a panic and felt beathless (so she'd think she was having asthma & take the rescue inhaler). We noticed that she was taking the rescue way too many times during the week, so we watched her and began to notice that it seemed to be a panic attack instead. We also noticed daytime mood swings, anxiety, out-of-it feeling, angry, argumentive behaviour, and mild depression.(Yes, I know she's a teen, but this was obviously related to what she'd been taking).	Called the allergist who "never heard of this reaction". What did I think he was gonna say? He did say to take her off for a few days and see if she feels better, that she might be sensitive to an ingredient that's in it. We did take her off and she's had 3 nights of good, nightmare-free sleep. I read somewhere (maybe on this site) that these drugs are from the steroid family and can cause the reactions noted. She was experiencing what so many others here have reported.	F	13	2  months50 mcg 1X D	5/30/2010
