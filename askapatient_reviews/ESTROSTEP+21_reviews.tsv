4	Moderate acne	The worst side effect was that I bled for 3 weeks straight during the first month taking it. I was off birth control pills for about 4 years because my acne got better. It wasn't excessive bleeding (good bleeding for about 1 week, then spotting for 2 weeks). For the second month, my period returned to normal.	Great with acne, I don't have breakouts any more.

2	Birth Control and help Acne	Spotting, Unusually emotional, Breast pain, Either very hungry or not hungry at all	Mostly I hated this bc because my period became completely unstable. I normally get it like clockwork every 27 days and this threw it off completely, I wasn't spotting I was getting a period 3 times a month just shorter. It also made my boobs hurt REALLY badly, sad I was hoping it would work out.	F	21	2.5  months20 1X D	2/1/2012Email
5	Prevent pregnancy, control PMS	Altered period cycle -- almost all of my PMS symptoms (cramps, zits) occur the week BEFORE my period now. Period length was not shortened as much as other oral contraceptives have shortened it.	This was the ONLY pill that did not make me fat. Yaz and Ortho Tri Cyclen both made me go from 118 lbs to 140 lbs over the course of months. This BC allowed me to shed the weight immediately back down to 121 lbs. Helped control mood swings tremendously. Helped acne (except while on period). Helped cramps. Only downside -- period was not shortened or lightened as much as other BCs have and this pill is expensive (co-pay tends to run high, $25 for me, even for generic).	F	18	1  years 1X D	12/12/2011
1	Endometriosis	Wanted to put a gun to my head and blow my brians out. Cried over everything and nothing.  Became evil towards family and friends.	My GYN had switched me because I had been on the same pill since my endometriosis surgery two years prior and she wanted to make sure my system was maintaining. I finally realized, after having such a horrendous argument with my mother that I blacked out I was so angry, that it had to be this pill.  It was like being possessed! I have never had such erratic mood swings and crying jags.  It was a horrible, horrible month, especially the week before my period.  Went directly back on previous pill and have been too frightened to try anything else.	F	43	30  daysFE 1X D	9/25/2011
4	Lower estrogen birth control	first week i experienced numbness/tingling in arms and legs but this stopped the second week. start of third week i have been experiencing constant breast tenderness, very vivid dreams the entire month.	I switched to this bc because i was on ortho-tricyclen for several years and i had a lowered libido and frequently yeast infections. Although i have not had my period yet on this new bc i can say that i am happy with the switch. my breasts are sore and the vivid dreams are a bit annoying but i like some of the other effects. i have improved mood, less constipation, slightly higher libido and no yeast infection. it is amazing how switching pills can change problems that you never knew were associated with the pill. i would recommend this pill to women who are curious if higher estrogen might be behind some of their problems. I will update more after my period next week to give a full review of this product. So far though, i am happy with it.	F	24	3  weeks20,25,30 1X D	2/22/2011Email
3	Prevent Pregnancy	Negatives: Weight gain of 5-7 lbs so far. Breast size increase and constant tenderness. Slightly more tired. Major decrease in sex drive. Positives: Wonderful during period: No cramps, small headaches only 1 or 2 days, didn't make me nausated like most birth controls. (Was on generic Tilia Fe the first month and I would NOT suggest that to anyone. Constant headaches/migraines the WHOLE month I was on it. And an increase in anxiety; slight depression; more moody.	I was on the Nuvaring for 6 months and it was WONDERFUL! No side effects at all except extra discharge and shorter lighter periods. I had a slight discomfort during intercourse and knew mutliple people who had gotten pregnant while on nuvaring so I switched to Estrostep. I am going to continue it and I think my body will adjust for the most part, and working out will take care of the weight gain.	F	23	2  months 1X D	2/4/2011
1	prevent pregnancy	Crippling anxiety! This BC messed up so much, and I've tried several brands of hormonal BC. The anxiety and panic attacks stopped me from going about my life and eventually gave me IBS that I still have 5 years later. The month after I stopped taking the pills my anxiety levels went back to normal (but my stomach never did)	Wish I had never tried it!!	F	26	3  months 1X D	1/31/2011
3	regulate period	im 5ft3 and when i started taking it i weighed 120 and i am now 131..my boobs hurt so very bad to the point im going to call my dr to complain in the morning. im still in my 34d bra but i could probably use the next size up but i refuse to buy a new bra:) its not my entire boob that hurts just the outer part almost like they are growing full speed ahead:)my face is broke out really bad but my chest and back that use to be bad is as clear as a bell now:)go figure. im tired and forgetful all the time now. seem confused alot and my husband says im more moody. a real bitch according to him:)but guess what..it regulated my period, comes like clockwork now but is it really worth all the other side effects??? I THINK NOT!!!!!	WEIGHT GAIN, MOODY, FORGETFUL, TIRED ALL THE TIME	F	30	2  months 1X D	1/30/2011Email
5	Birth Control	Extreme hunger the week before a period.	I have used Estrostep off and on for the last 6.5 years.  I have had nothing but good results with it.  It decreased the severity of my cramps (I use to vomit due to the pain), I knew exactly what day I would get my period, my skin was clear, and I didn't get pregnant while on it.  I did switch to Mercett for 1 year to see if the B/C pills were causing my migraines (Turns out they weren't). The Mercett didn't even compare to Estrostep.  I will be using it for as long as I can.	F	25	6.5  years 1X D	9/27/2010
2	For Pregnancy Prevention	weight gain, depression, moodiness, skipped period (or withdrawal bleeding i guess it's technically called), severe headaches, lethargy, upset stomach, stomach pain, sore breasts, very very stingy sore nipples (sucked real bad)	i was on lutera (generic for allesse) for two years and never had any bad side effects, until it stopped controlling my bleeding so i switched to the estrostep.  after the first month on estrostep fe's generic (tilia), i had bleeding for a day or two, after the second month, i had no period at all.  i've taken a dozen preg tests, all negative.  the headaches occur all through the month but the worst seem to fall in the third week of pills, they are so bad i can't do anything other than lie down and cry. i've been depressed and lack interest in most things around me.  my sleeping habits have gotten messed up too, i find it hard to get to sleep but once i do, i find it even more difficult to get up.  the sore boobs and nippies didnt' start until i began this third month pack of bc, that was two weeks ago, the nippie burn has subsided and my breast aren't as sore as they were last week.  i have had some mild cramping sensations as well.  oh, and a yeast infection that just won't quit.  i really don't like this pill but i'm hoping these side effects will clear up after a while.	F	30	2.5  months 1X D	7/12/2010
5	Prevent pregnancy, acne	Weight gain, some hair loss	This is by far the best birth control I've been on. I started on Ortho-Evra and HATED it. Went to Estrostep and loved it. Then I got Tilia (Estrostep's generic) to save money and went right back to Estrostep. Tilia made me super depressed and have frequent suicidial thoughts. No thanks! Estrostep keeps my libido good, my acne under control, and my periods light and regular. I would recommend Estrostep to anyone.	F	33	3  years 1X D	6/29/2010Email
1	Birth control	No sex driveWeight Gain, 20 lbs in the last 2 years.  I worked my ass off the first 3 years in order to maintain my weight.Cry over anything (I hated moody women and promised I would never be moody).  I am in bad shape today.  I cry, get angry, don't want to leave the house, I do not like the person I have become, even though I am very successful at my job and my relationship is wonderful, but I fight with my emotions everyday.		F	27	5  years	12/30/2009
3	birth control	weight gain; missed a period, spotting and deceased sex drive	I was very worried when i missed my period and 2 weeks later i started spotting.  My doctor said i was getting use to it. I've gained 15lbs in 3 mos but thats a good thing for me.. I like being thicker.	M	24	3  months	12/18/2009
4	birth control and acne	much shorter, lighter periods, mild cramping	I am very happy with this pill, I have been on Yasmin and Yaz before switching to this to try and help with my acne. My acne hasn't improved or worsened, but my periods are super light and short with mild to severe cramps on the first day or two.	F	21	2  years	11/6/2009
4	birth control and regulate period	weight gain. i have gained about 15 lbs in the two years i've taken it. also had an increase in facial hair. and moodiness is heightened for me during pms time - which i never had an issue with before.	the upside: it caused my periods to be like clockwork when they were never even close to regular, before estrostep. also, have had much less intense cramping (used to be so bad i'd pass out), and my periods are much lighter.	F	29	3  years	9/8/2009
4	As a "vaccination" to ovarian cance	Increased breast size, 20 lbs weight gain, decreased sex drive	I was advised by my OBGYN to take E due to family risk of ovarian cancer. She told me that 10 years on E would drastically reduce my cancer risk. I like the drug with the exception of the weight gain.	F	48	9  days	7/21/2009
5	Prevent Pregnancy	Zero sex drive	I have been on this birth control for 8 years and overall, I would recommend it to anyone.  Not going to lie, the first 4 - 6 months were rough: I was nauseous all the time, I lost a 10 pounds (went from 120 to 110), and had spotting.  Once my body got used to it, the drug was a miracle - very light periods at the same hour each month.  Major downside - I have absolutely no sex drive and I really believe it is because of the birth control.	F	25	8  years	7/6/2009
2	Birth Control	very slight weight gain, cramps during period, extremely low sex drive during the "white pills" but felt like i was in heat during "placebo-pills"-week (i never actually took the placebos though.) Pain during sex (deep pain, near cervix probably), slight bleeding after sex. Need more sleep than usual.	I was on Orthotricyclin Lo before, but it was getting too expensive for me, so my doc at school recommended estrostep. I'm hoping that my body will get used to it by the 3rd month. if not, i'm definitely switchin pills again. i'm getting way too many negative side effects from this pill...orthotricyclin NEVER gave me weird/bad side effects.	F	21	1.5  months	5/16/2009
5	Birth control	The first month, I had horrible diarrhea and stomach cramps when I went on the placebo week, but I'm now thinking it was unrelated to the pills, and just a coincidence. I stopped taking the placebo iron pills just in case, and the problem never returned.	My boobs got huge! Again, could just be a coincidence, but I went from a 34B to a 34D in 2 months. Not complaining though! Also, my sex life is greatly improved - I'm in the mood more often, and orgasm more easily. Hooray!	F	19	3  months	5/7/2009
3	control symptoms of endometriosis	increase in facial hair, weight gain, increase in blood pressure, change in vision, thinning scalp hair, lots of yeast infections that were hard to get rid of	I take this BC pill continously for endometriosis. I loved that I did not have extreme mood swings around my period time anymore. I did not have anymore horrible cramps at all. It helped some with my acne, but I still have quite a bit of acne.	F	34	3.5  years	4/6/2009
5	mainly help with severe pms	all positive effects - had the least weight gain. Only one concern - does taking it for a long period of time have negative effects. I am afraid to go off of it because my psychological well being is really important.	I needed a pill to regulate my periods and help ease the severe emotional drama that came 2 weeks before my period. My emotional upheaval would effect my children and my husband. I wound up feeling guilty all of the time. Estrostep took away all of the emotional problems.	F	44	15  years	1/9/2009
5	Birth Control	At first mood-swings, now increased confidence and high levels of self-assurance, weight gain (20 lbs in 10 years), positive personality changes (I feel very "motherly" towards just about anyone), emotional at times, migrane once a month.	Well, I've been on this for 10 years and it definitely prevents pregnancy.  It also has caused me some positive side-effects (increased confidence and kindness towards others) and negative side-effects (major weight gain and a migrane once a month).	F	29	10  years	12/29/2008
4	prevent pregnancy	Increased discharge, frequent spotting, a few missed periods.	No change in my moderate acne, unfortunately. Slight weight gain that could have been many other factors in my life. No real breast increase. I always spot about a week after my period for 2-3 days. Gyno says it's normal and doesn't bother me too much. But lately my periods have been coming later and later during the inactive pill week and sometimes haven't come at all, which is very worrisome. No mood changes, very high sex drive, can't complain too much.	F	22	4  years	12/19/2008
2	Birth contol	Nausea, bladder infections, mood swings	The pill worked fabulously the first month - I lost about 10 pounds, had no nausea or headaches.  But after that, it's gone downhill.  The second month I started getting recurrent bladder infections and the last two months, once I start the last set of active pills, I can count on being nausated in the morning, if not during the whole day.  What started out great kind of backfired...	F	22	4  weeks	11/17/2008
4	Birth Control	Major weight gain in the first 3 months, I went from 120 to 145.  I have since been on this pill for 2 years and 3 months with no problems, and I've managed to take and keep most of the weight off.  My emotions were crazy for the first 6 months, but everything regulated itself and I feel more like me again.	I'd reccomend this brand.	F	21	2  years	9/11/2008
3	Endometriosis	Moodiness, cramping in legs while sleeping, increase in anger/easily upset.	This pill wasn't horrible, but it did mess with my emotions. I have always been sensitive and can get upset easily, but I feel like Estrostep made it even worse. I also got angry much easier too. The strangest thing was my legs cramping up at night. It would happen at random times while lying in bed and would really hurt. I noticed it in my upper thighs mostly, but often the entire leg. I have since switched to LoEstrin24 and am feeling much better. Getting more headaches on this one, not sure if that is why though.	F	21	1  years	7/29/2008
4	Birth Control	mild moodiness, dry skin/ eyes, heavy breakthrough bleeding	Estrostep Fe is hands-down the best birth control I've ever been on.  This first time I was on BC, I tried Ovcon.  Then I switched to Balziva (THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE).  On the advice from a friend, I tried Estrostep.  I do not have the extream moodiness that I had on the other 2 pills, or any weight gain.  I weigh the same today as I did when I started taking it. I do have breakthrough bleeding, but I have experinced this will other pills.  My regular periods are so light, I feel like I can handle the breakthrough bleeding.  Over all, its a great pill!	F	25	4  months	7/4/2008
3	birth control, ovarian cyst	depression, lethargy, weight gain	This is the only bc pill I've ever taken, and I've taken it mostly regularly for almost a decade now.  The first 7 years I was on it, I would have given it a 5.  My periods were lighter, regular, hardly any cramping.  However, in past two years, went off it for stretches and noticed that I had way more energy, lost about 5 pounds each time, etc.  Have finally just asked my doctor about switching to something else, though am worried that any other pill will be just as bad w/side effects...	F	28	 	7/3/2008
5	birth control/endometriosis	Possible weight gain (5 lbs)	I've been on Estrostep FE for 8 years.  It's the only BCP that I've ever tried.  I love it!!  I used to have awful cramps and very heavy periods.  My period are practically non-existent and I don't have any cramping at all.  My skin looks great, too.  The only complaint that I have is a possible 5 lb weight gain, which is all in my stomach.	F	31	8  years	4/10/2008
3	birth control	large appetite all the time	i loved how light my periods were and how i always knew when they were going to be, HOWEVER, while on estrostep i've gained around 15 pounds and always have the appetite of a 300 pound man!!! It's really great to know that i'm not the only one who has had this problem with it...	F	21	2.5  years	2/28/2008
2	birth control	hair loss, mood swings		F	33	8  months	2/28/2008
5	pregnancy preventtion, acne		I LOVED this pill. I never had any PMS and periods were light and very predictable. Unfortunatly, it is expensive and w/out insurance anymore Doc suggested I try another one. Tried OrthoTriLo and have a lot of symptoms. Trying Loestrin 24. We'll see how that goes. I may end up switching back to Estrostep.	F	24	8  years	2/27/2008
3	I have cyst	I get migranes and the medicine makes it worse.	I don't really get my period when being on the medicine. Barely any pain and any side effedcts. Great pill exceot for the migranes and weight gain!!	F	20	3  years	1/24/2008
3	Prevent Pregnancy	I've been on Estrostep for about 2 years and I've gained a ton of weight. I've missed my period a bunch of times - once for 2.5 months when I was sixteen, that was scary... currently in my second missed month, already taken 2 tests and both negative but still nervous. Not fun. I'm moody and incredibly lethargic (probably due to my intense weight gain...)I could sleep for days on end without a thought. This is my only b/c I've ever tried but I think I want to switch.		F	18	2  years	1/22/2008
1	birth control	Extreme depression, moodiness, crying often, Very hungry, anxiety, tired all the time, can't sleep, caused acne (when I didn't have any to begin with), have hot flashes where my skin gets red then goes away.	I have never had such bad side effects.  Since this is the completion of my first month, I will try a second month to see if there are any changes, but will be seriously changing to a different medicine if things don't improve.	F	30	28  days	1/8/2008
5	acne	I was taking these pills last year and they were working well for me. I had mild acne as soon as I turned 21 so I decided to take the Estrostep. My acne started clearing up for me and I was also gaining weight. Yeah, I know most people won't think that's an advantage, but for me it was. I was 5'3'' and weighted about 115. As soon as I started taking these pills I went up to 135 and looked great with a clean and clear face.	I have one problem. I'm pretty possitive these are the pills I was taking last year, but I want to make sure. For those of you who took these pills last year, did they come in a pink/purple box and said With Acne Contraceptive on the top of the box? I stopped taking these pills about the beginning of this year and can't seem to find them, of course til now on the internet.Thanks	F	22	6  months	12/23/2007
5	birthcontrol/ lessen period length	i have never had any bad side effects.	Wonderful, a little expensive compared to other birth control pills, however it is well worth the money for me.  I have been on estrostep for 3 years and love it!  Never would change... before this i was on ovcon 35 and i was getting extremely sick.  Estrostep is the way to go	F	19	3  years	12/14/2007
5	acne,eliminate cramps,birthcontrol	It was wonderful, I have tried the depo, estrostep, and also ortho.This birth control made my periods seem obsolete, i only bled for one or two days, no cramps, no acne (which i battle), and NO MOOD SWINGS!! I even lost about 15lbs while on this birth control. The only reason why i switched was due to a loss in insurance, so the health department gave me ortho and depo.my hair fell out with the ortho pills, and i gained about 5 lbs.NEVER get the depo.its poisen. I have gained 2olbs. which is alot for my small frame.estrostep is heaven compared to that shot..id rather bleed for two days out of the month than turn into a fat and manly woman (hair growth increased w/ depo too!) Oh and imagine how that affects the sex drive! (blah)I cannot wait to get back on estrostep birth control!!!!!!	i took this BC when i was 16 until i was 18..ortho for about two moths...depo for about 4 months now.	F	20	2  years	12/13/2007
4	Birth Control/Heavy Flow	Minimal side effects	I have been really happy with Estrostep, however I have never been on any other form of birth control, so I have nothing to compare it to.  Before I was on it, I had really heavy flow, after the first month of taking it, my monthly flow has been really light.  I never experienced any of the weight gain or massive breakouts that others have experience, in fact I experience the opposite.  I've always had a problem with acne, and this pill have completely cleared my face, with an exception to one or two pimples during the week i'm on my period.	F	28	1.5  years	10/26/2007
1	Prevent Pregnancy	Extreme moodiness, highly emotional, inability to cope with stressful situations, cramping, low sex drive	This was the first birth control I tried.  It was prescribed by my GYN and I didn't question the prescription.  The extreme moodiness has caused problems at work and at home.  Before starting on the pill, I never had PMS type symptoms and now it is like clockwork.  The one advantage has been timing as my periods were never regular before.  I would very cautious if I were prescribed this pill.	F	24	3  years	10/21/2007
4	Birth Control	The only complaint was longer periods (five days instead of four) but for the most part, it was fine. I lost weight easier and had little to no cramps. Migraines were slightly harder to kill but it was mad accurate as to when my period was about to start.		F	21	2  years	9/25/2007
5	To prevent pregnancy	sore breast about (3 days)	Estrostep is great i've been taking it now for 8yrs. I've tried lots of birth control over the years that have made me sick to my stomach but this is great. I take it every night about 10pm. The only side affect i've experienced is sore breast for a couple of days. I would rather have sore breast for 2-3 days than feeling nausea. My period is more comfortable and my skin is great. It actually has also made me want to have sex more. So overall its a great pill.	F	25	8  years	9/24/2007
1	Regulate perioods	Horrible side effects! Bled for a whole month, didn't get my period for 7 months after that, gained 15 lbs, vomiting, horrible depression/mood swings, NO sex drive whatsoever. Bad acne flair ups. It's been 6 years and I'm horrified to try another pill because my 1st experience was so bad.		M	20	8  months	9/17/2007
3	Regulate mood swings and cycle	Very effective for mood swings and cycle regulation, but have noticed increased migraines, vaginal dryness and extremely low sex drive.		F	45	5  years	9/11/2007
5	birth control	None	I have tried two different 'traditional' estrogen focused BCP and they gave me horrible side effects.  I was severely depressed, irrational, lost my entire sex drive, and gained a bit of weight on the other pills.  My doctor suggested Estrostep as an alternative, since it does focus more on progesterin more than estrogen.  I've been on it for going on three years now, and it's amazing.  My periods are to the minute, almost, and my PMS symptoms are almost gone.  My libido is back up to a normal level and I don't *feel* as if I am taking a medication, which should be the goal of any medication/treatment. I know a lot of you are bashing this pill, but all of our bodies are different.  What works for most women (Ortho Tri) was the absolute pits for me.  Remember to each their own!	F	22	3  years	9/2/2007
3	control cramps and bleeding	break-through bleeding (for almost 2 weeks each month), very low sex-drive the week or so before my period, and mood swings.	I have experienced very bad break-through bleeding since the first month on this pill; sometimes it is even heavier than my period.  Also, I never used to PMS that badly when I wasn't on the pill, and now my mood swings the week or so before my period are horrible.  I actually threw out my Estrostep tonight because I couldn't deal with how it was making me feel.  My doctor just prescribed Femcon FE to me to fix these problems and I can't wait to start it.  However, the Estrostep did make my period a lot more managable...2 days instead of 5, and much better cramps.	M	19	7  months	6/21/2007
3	birth control	weight gain	Helped acne	F	20	3  months	6/21/2007
3	birth control	Anxiety, depression, mood swings, migraines and breast tenderness	I have been taking Estrostep for about 5 months now. At first I felt great and didn't really feel many symptoms except for my boobs being really sore. But about up till a month ago I have been experiencing a lot of anxiety. I'm not sure if it's directly related to this pill but I don't know what else it could be. After reading other women's comments about anxiety related to this pill it makes me feel so much better that I'm not alone.	F	26	5  months	6/17/2007
4	As a birth control method	The only side effects I may have experienced was mild weight gain, if any, maybe a couple pounds. Some irritability, depression.	Estrostep has been pretty good for me. I used to have horrible long, painful menstrual cycles. When I began the pill after a few months my periods have shortened to about 4 days. They are light and almost cramp free. I am also on a schedule. I know the exact day my period is coming. Most of the time it has done a great job in managing my acne except in times that I am under a great deal of stress. I could have possibly gained a few pounds but it could have also been from my diet. I do notice irritability at times and also times of depression that could be an effect of the pill. I would still recomend estrostep it has been reliable and very helpful.	F	18	2  years	6/11/2007Email
5	birth control	I really have not had any side effects.	I have been on it for 2 1/2 years now and I have had absolutely no problems. I have had very minimal cramps, 3-4 day light periods which are very regular, no spotting, slight breast enlargement and weight gain which may or may not be connected. I love it. All of the horrible stories I had heard from friends on the pill never happened. It's great.	F	23	2.5  years	6/9/2007
4	birth control, to regulate periods	Small amount of weight gain, occasional bleeding between periods	It really helped regulate my periods. Before I started on it I never knew when my period was going to come. And my periods were also really heavy and really long with awful cramping, also I had problems with throwing up right around the time my period would start. Now that I am on Estrostep I still get some cramping but it is very manageable with a few Tylenol. No more puking either. I have gained about 5 pounds but I don't know if this is a result of the pill itself or the fact that I'm no longer throwing up 3 days out of every month. Occasionally I'll have spotting between periods but it's only about twice a year and doesn't last long so it's not too annoying. My doctor said Estrostep would help to clear up acne that I had on my back and shoulders but it really didn't. But overall Estrostep has been good for me at least and my periods are a lot more manageable now, and I'm also not pregnant!	F	22	3  years	5/22/2007
2	prevent ovarian cysts	I have had the same horrible weight gain as many other people! I've never had a problem with my weight and now after being on this pill for a little over a month - I have gained 8 pounds. I don't even eat that much and I can never lose any weight! In addition, I feel tired all of the time and very moody. I am going off of this pill at the end of this cycle. 		F	46	2  months	5/14/2007
4	regulate, birth control	Cleared up stress acne, some breast enlargement (didn't give me back what I had before nursing 2 children), cry easier, shortened period from 7-14 days to 3-5 days & regulated to every 28 days.		F	30	2  years	4/20/2007
5	birth control.	*** (meant to put years for the last one) I used to have terrible acne, and I'm allergic to the benzoclyn found in many acne products, so creams were almost out of the question.  I was also pretty irregular.  I'd go almost 5 months without a period.  But within 3 months of taking Estrostep, my acne had been greatly healed and my periods were starting to regulate.  My cramps also became lighter and much easier to handle.  I did, however, get nauseus on a daily basis, so I had to switch to taking the pill at night.  Other than that, I haven't had any problems.

4	birth control	longer periods	I got on Estrostep after an unplanned pregnancy. It was smooth sailing for about 4 months then I started having longer periods. Bleeding for 7 days instead of the usual 4 or 5. Then it progressed to the point that I was bleeding 3 WEEKS out of every month! I pretty much had clear skin before I started Estrostep, but after I started taking it- I did not even get the monthly premenstral breakouts. My sex drive was fine - when I could have sex- the one week a month I wasn't on my cycle.	F	28	4  months	4/2/2007
1	acne /pregancy prevention	I totaly despise this product !!!!!!!!!! I just had a baby 3 months ago I had started to lose the baby weight immediatly I felt great all smooth sailing . Started taking this about two months now, I stopped losing weight immediatly and have gained 7 lbs already all on the abdomen area. I also started to take this as a acne prevention thanks to estrostep you can now play connect the dots on my face due to the acne breakout I also experienced really bad leg cramps and arm cramps as if poor circulation. I really would not recommend anyone to use this product worse thing that I have ever tried. Thanks to this I feel and look horrible.		F	29	2  months	3/29/2007
5	To help clear acne.	None. Well, actually MAYBE. For a while, I seemed to be having more discharge than before I started taking the pill, but my gynecologist said I'm perfectly fine. And that problem has pretty much gone away; I feel just fine, physically. Emotionally... I don't know if it's due to taking Estrostep or just being a teenager, but I have had some pretty bad ups and downs.	A lot of women here are totally bashing Estrostep Fe... I'm sorry to hear so many people had bad experiences. In my case, I haven't really experienced any negative side effects that I can definitely attribute to Estrostep. Some women are also saying their breasts got bigger after taking Estrostep. I WISH. The original reason I started taking Estrostep was to help my acne... but it doesn't seem to have helped. On the other hand, I don't think taking Estrostep has made it worse. I happened to become sexually active AFTER I started the pill, so I guess I was glad I was already on it. Well... at least I have no libido problems... I want my boyfriend just as much as he wants me lol All in all, I'm happy with Estrostep Fe.	F	18	1  years	3/24/2007
1	so I won't get pregnant	severe cramping, extreme fatigue, excessive hunger, loss of sex drive, weight gain, mild psychosis..lol	I hate it!!!!!! I'm switching today!!!!!!!! this is the worst pill ever. I was put on it after the birth of my son and I was already experiencing mild post-partom depression and it just made it worse. Plus I can't seem to lose any weight whatsoever and I'm a maniac all the time. I have zero energy to even play with my son when I get home. I HATE IT!!!!!	F	22	1  years	3/21/2007
1	Birth control	Estrostep FE made me a crazy person... irritable, rude, and on an angry rampage.  I didn't even recognize myself for the few months I was on Estrostep.	People should note that the progestin in Estrostep is high in androgens (male hormones).  This can cause some people to grow excess hair and have bad acne.  It is probably also related to the bad mood swings people experience on Estrostep.  I ended up switching to Ortho Tri-Cyclen and have been doing great on that for years.  I have no idea why my former doctor EVER prescribed Estrostep to me.  Women should all know about the hormones in their pills!!!  This is a good website about the hormone contents in various birth control pills and their effects: http://www.wdxcyber.com/ncontr13.htm	F	27	3  months	3/21/2007

				F M	 	 	    
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010

I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010

3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped. Abilify worked immediately and I haven't been depressed since.	F	24	3  weeks5mg 1X D	5/9/2010Email

Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal.

1	Bipolar spectrum disorder	Restlessness, anxiety, drowsiness, face rash	I went on Abilify at the start of an up period, so I don't know how effective it would have been in treating depressive spells. However, it did counteract some of the effectiveness of my lithium, and I was falling asleep during the day more frequently than usual. Had to go off it because of a rash on my chin/cheeks/ears.

4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue. Negative - I find myself much more emotional - memories, key phrases, smells, songs, pictures, etc.can bring me to tears.	M	50	9  months50 MG 1X D	4/11/2010
2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now.

After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!

2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010
4	ocd, agitation, schizotypal	drowsiness at high dosage, jittery at low. however, sometimes i feel my legs very heavy, other times i've a little akathisia. try to manage the right dosage for you, it's the only way.	it get slow my mind, my obsessions get down almost to not have. i take it in combo with Wellbutrin and Gabapentin, and i feel calmer and relaxed than before. it was horrible only thinking about past.

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010
1	depression, of all excuses	This is to the PARENTS out there who believe that if their child looks passive on the drug it is a godsend:  Beating someone over the head with a baseball bat can also make them sit still.  Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.  No more for me. Abilify- Forgetaboutit!!!!!!!	F	57	3  days	1/30/2010Email

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.

5	anxiety and depression	increased hunger and increased energy	This is a wonder drug for me. I thought I was going do die due to severe depression and anxiety. I am taking cymalta but after about a year, it didn't work. My MD RX'd 5mg of abilify along with my cymbalta every day. In my opinion, it saved my life. I feel like I have a reason to live and starting to enjoy the things I used to, just after one week of starting the med.	F	42	7  days	1/13/2010
4	Bipolar and anxiety	restlessness increased appetite inability to concentrate. Not sure if there are periods of anxiety or nervousness. No Mania	Works for mania. My pdoc says there is activation at low doses. My son started on 10 mg and takes 15 mgs. He also takes 900 mg of lithium and 10 mgs of Lexapro.	M	10	6  months	12/29/2009Email
3	Depression	Weight gain and constant appetite, anxiety, inability to concentrate	Worked well for the depression, but the constant appetite and associated weight gain, along with anxiety at higher doses, was not worth it overall	F	39	2.5  months	12/22/2009

1	anxiety and mood swings	increased heart rate that made my daughter pass out only after the 2nd day.	after first night of taking my daughter missed school the next day feeling nauseated and stomach cramps. That night she experienced indigestion/heartburn. She vomited. Sleepy but couldn't sleep. Feeling scared for no reason. Next day she passed out after being awake for 15 min. I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug. I got home and looked up the side effects and all of these were listed.  I can only say that we are glad we found out so quickly about this drug.	F	12	2  days	12/19/2009
2	OCD, racing thoughts.	drowsiness, leg pains, akathisia...	it is a great drug to calm down mind... seems to be on a "holy peace"... but side effects are too strong, just for me.	M	23	14  days	12/18/2009
3	bipolar	stopped after 14 months due to heart pulpitations, memory loss, trouble sleeping, slur speach due to excess syliva, after 12 months these things started. At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying. I am very uncomfortable giving a child this age any drug that is diagnosised by trial and error.	M	8	14  months	12/17/2009
2	unipolar depression	nasal stuffiness, dyslexia, word finding problems, increased appetitite, change (worsening) of vision, weight gain and wanting to graze constantly, watering eyes, feel like gravity is heavier (I have to sit down to brush my teeth), very restless around people, visual hallucinations (things disappear then reappear right where I saw them last), trouble focusisng while driving  --- weird.	I am taking 50 mg of lamictal concurrently with 7.5 mg abilify.  Affect is flatter, less mood swings, but more non-reactive than anything.  I'm not sure this is where I want to be. I have been able to get projects done that I had difficulty starting.  Some days I have energy, some days I don't.  I a fasting blood draw yesterday and haven't heard the results yet.  Continuing to take abilify is a quandary -- do I feel worse or better if I factor in all the weird side effects?  I will probably cut down on the dose since I really will be suicidal if I gain any more weight.	F	51	30  days	12/17/2009
3	Bipolar	Some weight gain, some restlessness	My 14 yr old son has been on 2.5 mg of Abilify for 3 months now.  He has gained 8lbs. so we are going to be watching this closely.  It has helped him be able to concentrate, and definitely better in school, and social groups.  Smoothed out the ups and downs.  Previously was on trileptal and zoloft.	M	14	90  days	12/14/2009Email
