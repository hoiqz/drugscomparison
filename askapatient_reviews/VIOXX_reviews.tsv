5	Chronic Neck/Back Pain & Migraines	None	I was prescribed this medication just before it was pulled off the market a number of years ago.  It was heaven sent.  I had not had that kind of relief before or since.  I was only on it for 15 days but it was the best 15 days of my life.  As soon as the announcement came out my husband flushed the balance of my prescription.  I have been on many other prescriptions since and nothing has compared.	F	44	15  days 1X D	4/28/2010
1	back pain	nerve irritation/pain throughout left arm	Doctor put me on this a few years ago, 3 months before it was pulled from the market. Afer taking it for 2 weeks I developed shooting pains in my left arm that got so bad I would cry myself to sleep. It ceased after I went off the medication. A week later I tried vioxx again and the pain came right back, so I stopped taking it permanently. On top of that it wasn't effective in numbing my back pain.	F	23	4  weeks	1/14/2008
1	back pain	heart attack  hardening of the arteries and nerve damage in my feet	everybody that works for the fda that oked this drug should be put in jail	M	56	2  years	6/28/2007Email
1	Severe Cramping	High Blood Pressure, Sinusintis, irregular Heartbeat	This drug eased the discomfort but if I had known the side effects I would of turned it down. I'm still taking meds for HBP, no history of side effects  prior to taking Vioxx.  I had a Nurse Practitioner state that once I stopped taking Vioxx the HBP would go away, that's a statement I read on Merck's report. beware, all the cards are not in on VIOXX.  Next time you get a prescription for a drug, read the side effects I recently had a Doctor prescribe celebrex to me, 2 reasons I didn't take them, I read about the side effects and the commercials they were showing, in which I'm considered a hight risk for a heart attack if I have HBP.  What the dickens was he thinking or is he like some others, pushing drugs to patients for a discount or whatever discounts they get.	F	45	16  months	6/12/2007
1	Off label use for carpal tunnel pai	I experienced vertigo, diarrhea, abdominal pain, respiratory problems and memory loss. I still have memory loss and have gaps in my thinking process where I can't even think of common words I am trying to say, even to this day.	I had quit taking Vioxx long before the recall because it was the only new med introduced into my regimen at the time the symptoms started. I was told that if I continued to take it, I would be let go from my job because of inability to perform simple tasks.	F	40	6  months	4/5/2007
5	Rheumatoid Arthritis	None	Too bad it had to be pulled. Hoepfully newer, safer Cox-2 inhibitors (available in Europe) will be approved in the US soon.	F	38	5  years	2/23/2007
1	back problems amongest others	I ended up in the hospital after 24 hours of taking the first dose. I was having problems breathing plus it looked like I had the measls (sp) from head to bottom of feet. I was covered in bright red dots. they itched but not very much. I spent 5 days in hospital hooked to IVs and oxygen.		F	37	1  days	9/4/2006
1		On September 30, 2004, Merck & Co. issued a worldwide recall of the blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx from the market because of data from a clinical trial that found an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes among patients.		M	29	 	6/30/2006
1	Joint Pain	Suffered a heartattack, was life flighted.	I believe vioxx is a poison and people shoud treat it as such.	M	47	4  months	6/17/2006
5	back pain	None	I am very dissapointed that this drug is no longer on the market. With this drug I was able to be virtually pain free and no more stiffness. Now I am in chronic pain. I am allergic to Celebrex and Bextra. There is only so much Ibuprofen you can take without getting an ulcer.	F	45	3  years	4/25/2006
1	TMJ pain	Broke out in hives with blisters and had a rash from head to toe. Even had blisters in my throat and couldn't breathe.	Had to be hospitalized and put on massive amounts of Benadryl and anti-inflammatories to bring down swelling. Made the chicken pox I had when I was a child look like a day at the park compared to the hell I went through with Vioxx.	F	29	4  days	10/21/2005
1	Inflammatory cartilage pain	Rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, found out later it actually did more damage to my cartilage instead of helping to heal it.	I was given about every NSAID out there, and none worked. They certainly made me feel worse. I did my own research and switched to herbal anti-inflammatories, and after a few months of them, my pain lessened greatly and I started to feel "normal" again. NSAIDs are awful!	F	38	5  months	9/17/2005
4	Severe shoulder pain	None	Helped with pain in a shoulder muscle, something my chiro couldn't fix.  I'm sorry this was pulled off the market soon afterward, as it helped me, along with several older family members who have joint problems.	M	46	3  weeks	8/28/2005
1	osteoarthritis	Vioxx raised my BP to dangerous levels.  Am dizzy all the time & have dull headache that can flare to migraine quickly, actually just waiting for stroke to occur.  Very scary, unfortuntely,because 'nothing has happened yet' I can't get an attorney to take case.	I did not have any of the 'symptoms' prior to taking the drug on a consistent basis.  When I was taking it occasionally none of these conditions appeared.	F	54	12  months	1/21/2005
5	menstrual cramps	none	loved it   it was the only thing that helped.	F	39	3  years	12/23/2004

1	arthritis	Acute Vertigo, permanant deafness in left ear. Subtle things, like could hear my own heart beat, sparks from behind my eyes at night, like maybe lighning outside only it wasn't storming..real weird things.	I believe this is a very dangerous drug.  I just found this site after all these years...It has been almost 4 years since My Vertigo attack from Vioxx.  I believe it caused me to have a stroke, or TIA.  I woke up from sleeping so sick I couldn't even walk to bathroom I had to crawl to toilet.  I had never been this ill in my entire life.  While I was Vomiting and having diarreah,couldn't open my eyes because of dizzyness, after about an hour of this my husband heard me and called EMT's and called my Dr. because I could not leave the bathroom.  I felt my left ear gurgling, that is the only word that I can use that fits.  The EMT'S had to take me to hospital and I spent the day in ER with them, Dr's, trying to find something to give me to stop my Vomiting and Diarreah.  They finally gave something to calm my Vertigo.  I went home that night and fell asleep for a few hours.  My sister in-law called me and my husband gave me the phone and I put it to my left ear and I could not hear...To this day I am still deaf in my left ear.  I had no previous Strokes, no family history of Strokes, no high blood pressure..basically healthy except for a little arthritis in my knees and back..So yes I would say it is poison...

5	R/A	None		F	73	 	10/12/2004
4	osteoarthritis cervical spine	Initially,  weakness, dizziness, nausea, mental confusion, depression, which all seemed to lessen within a week. However, If I EVER mistakenly increased my dosage I suffered the same side effects which were great enough to send me to bed for about 24 hours.	After trying every other NSAID for the debilitating, maddening pain in my neck, Vioxx and physical therapy did the trick. The only other treatment that had been as effective were the cortisone injections directly into the neck. And now Vioxx is off the Canadian market and I'm hoping like heck that there is SOMEthing out there that will give me the help that it did.	F	57	6  years	10/10/2004
5	lyme arthritis, menstrual pain	None	It works well, better than bextra for me.  I had been on it for nearly a year.	F	33	 	10/3/2004
4	Back and side pain.		One time for some reason my entire torso felt tight and painful for several days.  Coughing or sneezing brought about painful spasms.  My doctor had me take tylenol for a few days, but the pain wouldn't go away.  So he gave me some vioxx, and once the medicine did take effect the pain was gone.  It took a couple days for the medicine to take full effect though.	M	29	2  weeks	9/30/2004
2	arthritis pain	raise in heart rate & in light of the findings, I opted to try new supplement - SierraSil. In less than a week, I was almost pain free. after 3 weeks I find that my inflamation is measurably reduced. I highly advise trying SierraSil along with Glucosamine.		F	51	7  days	9/30/2004
3	Elbow Swelling	Major headaches and Dehydration.  I never get headaches.		F	24	2  days	9/14/2004
2	OA	None	I don't see that it is doing anything.	M	29	2  months	9/12/2004
5	Disc Degeneration	None	I had back pain so severe that I was totally consumed by the pain. I had to leave my manual labor job and take a desk position. I had many days that I couldn't even set at a desk for a whole day. Since being placed on Vioxx the pain is normally under control and I lead an almost normal life. I still have days that I have pain but with a little rest it passes.	M	45	4  years	8/29/2004
1	Knee Tear/Hamstring Strain	Initially, I was tired.  My stomach was also upset.  I started having vertigo while swimming laps.  After 10-12 days at 50mg, I spent 24 hours vomitting (may have been a stomach bug).  A few nights after stomach trouble, I woke up with vertigo, diarreah, heart palpitations.  I went to the ER and had an irregular heart beat.  I stopped the vioxx.  I still wake up with vertigo and rapid heart beat a few times a month 6 months after the initial episode.  I can't say for sure that the vioxx caused my problems, but I never experienced these symptoms prior to taking vioxx.	I have been a runner my entire life, I have always been physically fit.  I have always had normal blood pressure, pulse, etc...  I wouldn't recommend vioxx.	F	34	2  weeks	8/10/2004Email
1	Post-op knee pain & arthritis	Both lower extremities swelled like Moon Boots IN ONLY 3 DAYS!  My Dr. said to get off it immediately.	Two weeks of antibiotic therapy, heavy-duty diuretics, and elevated legs produced very slow reduction of the swelling.  The aftermath has been chronic venous stasis and recurrent cellulitis (infection of the deep layers of the skin, causing swelling and blistering), which can be life-threatening.  I am now under the care of a vascular specialist, sometimes have to have both legs wrapped in Unna Boots to be able to put on the compression hose I now have to wear, and I can no longer wear any of my pre-VIOXX shoes.  I can neither sit at my desk without elevating my legs, drive my car, nor be on my feet for any length of time without feeling my skin fighting with the compression hose. All this for three days of pain relief!  NB:  SWELLING WAS NOT AMONG THE SIDE EFFECTS IN THE PACKAGE INSERT I RECEIVED!	F	63	3  days	8/7/2004Email

3	Arthritis/Bone Spur Pain in Neck	After 2-1/2 years I began to get reflux that burned my esoughogus and occasional indigestion of tomato laced foods and Coke. This slowly progressed over 6 months until I had strong stomach pain and the onset of IBS for 2 months. The stomach GASTRITIS ruled my life and caused severe nausea. After tests and weeks of elimination dieting we discovered it was indeed the Vioxx. I had an endoscopy today that revealed I did not have an ulcer as previously thought. Nothing was visibly wrong with my stomach lining despite 60 days of hell.	This drug changed my life much for the better after years of headaches and neck pain that was crippling. I have been functioning normally the last few years. I am hoping to still go back on Vioxx at a lower dose in  a couple months. But only after this period away from it. I will no doubt continue to pace it and take periods off. The staomach pain has been so bad that I do not have a problem going back to aspercream and hot showers for a while.

3	psoriatic arthritis		it helped somewhat with my swelling, but not enough for me to say it was excellent. it also helped ease my migraines slightly. it did  not have any significant side effects though, so it's ok to take.	F	28	3  years	5/2/2004Email
2	joint inflammations	none	I take it to relieve morning inflammation of my shoulder. I also take MS Contin, but have tried vioxx to help ease stiffness and soreness in the morning. It hasn't had any noticeable effect.	F	26	2  weeks	4/28/2004

2	artheritis	loss of taste & smell	within 2 days - lost ALL sense of smell & taste so went off it. It did seem to help the pain but couldn't stand not tasting anything.  a couple weeks later tried it again & same result - no sense of taste or smell - went off after 2 days & it took 4 days to get to be able to taste food again. so i won't use this again.

4	OA	This medicine definitely helped my thumb pain, but it caused heartburn, water retention, and weight gain.  I also notice a rapid heartbeat after taking it & a loss of taste.  Therefore, I am going to try something else.  Perhaps Celebrex.		F	53	6  months	3/17/2003

4	RA	SOme blurry vision in right eye, but this may be related to other systemic problems	I was in severe pain and withing a few days I was able to live a semi normal life.

The side effects increase proportionately 1-2 days after increase.I have a history of gastro problems with NSAIDs and at 50mg, if kept too long on that amount, I get bearable gastro discomfort/gastritis. In the past I was put on various strong stomach meds when this happened but now I only take Nexium if needed for a few weeks, while reducing Vioxx back to 25mg. I have been on it for 3 years now. Longer than any other NSAID with minimal side effects	F	48	3  years	8/28/2002

3	Bipolar 2	I was hypomanic after the death of my father in November. Began taking Depakote in early December for anger/rage/mood problems.  Psych suggested Abilify might help Depakote work better.  While my mood is better and my anger issues are nearly non-existent now, I'm finding I'm still a bit hypomanic and the Abilify creates extreme restlessness in me.  While my house has never looked better and I'm getting lots of project done, I find I can't sit still for longer than 10 minutes and by the end of the day my feet ache for being on them so long running around in the house and doing all my projects.	Together with Depakote.  Doc now prescribing propranolol for agitation/restlessness/irritability - would rather prescribe additional med for side effect than change primary meds...and I agree with his decision.  Doc now bumping me up to 10mg 1xday and propranolol 10mg 1xday.	F	36	7  weeks5mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email
1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
