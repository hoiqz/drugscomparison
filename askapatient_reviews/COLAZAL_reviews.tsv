				F M	 	 	    
3	Crohn's/indeterminate colitis	Some fatigue, some darkening of urine that's alleviated by drinking TONS of water.	For the past 3 weeks, I've taken two 750-mg tabs 3 times a day, in addition to Prednisone, which I am weaning off slowly. I can't tell what the Colazal is doing, if anything, but I am grateful that there are no side effects. I had bad reactions to both Asacol and to Mesalamine suppositories. I'm very sensitive to medication in general, so it is AMAZING not to be experiencing anything bad with this drug.	F	27	3  weeks	5/13/2009
4	UC (ulcerative colitis)	No directly attributable side effects, although joint pain did increase (but such pain is also a documented general side effect of the underlying condition, so no way to truly attribute it to the drug.)	Since it has gone generic, I have not been 100% sure of some of their quality controls.  2x experienced minor flare-ups with change amongst drug manufacturer that took several weeks to resolve.  (Pharmaceutical equivalency in generics does often vary)	M	46	4  years	2/2/2009
5	chron's disease/colitis	No side effects that I've noticed.	My family dr. has treated me for years for another condition, but since the birth of my last child 2 1/2 yrs. ago, the pain and bleeding had gotten much worse, but I didn't say much, as I was dealing with another medical problem that took center stage.  However, this got to the point that I couldn't even take a walk on the beach with my children on vacation, so I had a colonoscopy a month ago which diagnosed me with Chron's.  It answered SOOO many questions, and the Colazal is helping perfectly!!  I just wish I had taken care of things sooner.  I feel great, and now I'm living a much more normal life.	F	38	4  weeks	7/5/2008
2	UC	red eyes all the time, MAJOR joint pains, fatigue	Dosage (750 mg) 3 pills 3x's a day.  The side effects were too severe that I switched to asacol and feel VERY SATISFIED with the meds.  With Asacol, my problems immediately went away.  As with Colazal, the problems were minor but still persists.	F	26	3  months	6/19/2008
4	Ulcertaive Colitis	None that I have noted.	My doctor switched me to this after having two flare-ups (one in November '06 and one in May '07) while on Asacol. He also added Imuran along with it and I haven't had a flare-up in 7 months. The combination of the two has really helped me function normally again. Although I am concerned about the possible side-effects of Imuran.	F	24	7  months	12/1/2007
1	Ulcerative Colitis	Diarrhea that continued after my colonoscopy, made my condition so much worse	Recieved a colonoscopy and was put on Asacol first, then Colazal. i didnt know it at the time, but this medication actually made my conditon much worse, ended up in the hospital for two weeks, bascially almost died. please be careful, if you notice your condition worsen after takin this medication or anything containig measalmine, dicontinue immediately regardless of what your docotor says.	M	27	30  days	9/12/2007
1	Ulcerative Colitis	No noticable side effect.	I was put on Colazal after Pentasa and Asacol did not work. After being on it for 2 months and no improvement, my doctor put me back on Prednisone and Pentasa. Currently on them. Dont know what will happen next.	M	33	2  months	3/28/2007
5	Crohn's Disease/Ulcerative Colitis	No side effects.	I was placed on Asacol when I was first diagnosed, but switched to Colazal due to severe side effects from the Asacol.  I have been taking 2 pills 3 times a day and have been in remission for 6 months.	F	26	6  months	2/12/2007
5	ulcerative colitis	I have not noticed any obvious side-effects. I've had a slightly sensitive/itchy scalp, but I suspect that this is due to the onset of winter weather, rather than the medicine.	I've had only one remission of U.C. in 7 years and tried a number of medicines with no relief.  After a few weeks on Colazal, my symptoms have gone into complete remission.	M	34	30  days	11/15/2006
4	ulcertive colitis	I was given colazal samples by a gastroenterologist while on waiting list for a county hospital GI appointment.  I was extremely fatiqued when I started off taking two 750 mg capsules three times a day so I reduced dosage to taking only twice a day, and most of the side effect went away.  It took about 30 days for the medication to work and stop the pus and the bleeding from my colon, but only couple of weeks to reduce the frequency of bowl movements from 10 plus times per day to twice per day.  But keep in mind, I am taking the reduced dosage.	However, the county hospital switched me to asacol because they didn't carry colazol.  Holy cow!  despite my taking the reduced dosage of two 400mg asacol twice a day, I have difficulty focusing and felt dizzy throughout the day.  Also noticed a long streak of red color back on the stool.  so here I am on the net searching for some information on the side effects.  As I read different people's opinion and experiences on their ulcertive colitis meds, I notice that many people do fairly well on asacol, and a few didn't, while others didn't do as well with colazol, but I did.  So I am realizing that treatment for ulcertive colitis seems quite individualized depending on your own body make up.  You initially may need to go on trial and error to find out what works for you as far as both controlling the UC symptoms and not experiencing  debilitating side effects.  Talk to your doctor and advocate for yourself till you find a med that does both the above and you are feeling more your normal	F	40	50  days	11/11/2006
1	UC	After about 1 week of taking Colazal I experienced MAJOR join pain in my toes, fingers, sholders and neck. Went off this med immediateley. Currently taking Asacol that makes me itch.		F	48	7  days	8/15/2006
2	UC	I had only taken it for about a week when I ended up with a bad rash.  Not sure if the rash was due to the medication, the heat or what.  It started working, but was only for a week.  I'm not sure if it would have made a difference taking them on a fill stomach every time.	The dosage of 3 pills 3 times daily is sorta hard.	F	46	7  days	7/20/2006
3	U.C.	Several years ago I had side effects of upset stomach and diarrhea that stopped when I switched to Asacol.  But the Asacol was not effective so switched back to Colazal with no side effects this time around.	The pills are large and one has to take numerous pills per day to have effect, which is difficult and inconvenient.	F	59	2  years	6/14/2006
4	UC	Proscribed after first diagnosis, I also a long time before any real effect (6 or so months).  Judged against the potential for liver damage that other meds give rise to, I opted to stay with colazal.  it has since been present for a remission of nearly two years and a reduction of inflamation of over 30 cm to under 2 cms at most recent scoping.	Regretably, not under lower tier copayments in any of 3 insurance plans I have had.	M	42	27  months	11/28/2005
2	Ulcerative colitis	No side effects.	On the plus side, this medication had no side effects.  The bad part was that it didn't do anything!  The time I wasted waiting for effects from Colazal would have been better spent getting results from another medication.  After I ended up in the hospital with my UC flare, I switched to a different doctor who immediately changed my medications.  Try Colazal for a little while, but if you have no results after a few weeks, it's fair to ask for a change.	F	21	3  months	4/25/2005
