5	burning nerve pain, fibromyalgia	sometimes a small rash in application site after removal, sometimes a little itchy while wearing it	This was added to manage breakthru pain.  I agree with the other reviewer - it does seem to wear down before the change date.  Butrans has made the exhausting pain manageable, but it is still not completely gone.  I use this in addition to Cymbalta: 60mg/at bedtime, Tramadol: 50mg/ 3x daily, Meloxicam: 7.5mg/ 2x daily, Tizanidine: 4mg/ 2x daily.  My joints still burn, my feet are still numb.  I HATE taking pills but I can mentally function.  Radiating paid down both legs keeps me from walking, but I am extremely lucky - I've kept my job, I can work at home.  I have something to be thankful for!  Good luck to everyone suffering from the same or similar.	F	40	5  months10 mg/hr 1X W	3/7/2013Email
5	Chronic pain	Works as well or better than 100mcg Duragesic without the side affects. The only drawback is that it does not last 7 days and checks out quickly on the 4-5th day.  It also starts to work immediately unlike the duragesic which takes at least 8 hrs to get in your system.	I feel so much better on this medicine and can complete daily tasks without the sedation and side affects from regular opiate medication.	F	52	2  months20mcg 1X W	11/27/2012Email
