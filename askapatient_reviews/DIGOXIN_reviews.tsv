1	PERICARDITIS and ATRIAL FLUTTER	1) SEVERE PAIN IN BREASTS! as a male it was bizarre to have a double MAMMOGRAPHY, plus double ULTRASOUND to try to find the cause. Within 24hours of stopping DIGOXIN the pain subsided!ALSO: experienced uneven heart rate and felt like I was rocking in a boat when standing and thought I would pass out!  I finally stayed in bed and curled in a fetal position since I felt so bad and COULD DO NOTHING ... PLUS I URINATED OVER AND OVER up to 15 times per day. Sometimes I would return from the bathroom and as I sat down, I WOULD HAVE TO GO AGAIN!!!	For me, it was a horrible experience, because I was already so sick from Pericarditis ... and this drug made me feel even worse!  I was so happy to get off of this medication .. because the side effects WENT AWAY when I stopped taking it!	M	71	 ? 1X D	10/29/2010Email
5	Atrial fibrillation	No side effects at all.	I am taking this drug along with Metoprolol and they keep my heart rate down to a normal 70 or 80.  My blood pressure is quite good, too.  I feel that I could conceivably remain on these two medications for the rest of my life, except for my concern about taking dangerous medications in general.	M	61	4  months	2/21/2009Email
