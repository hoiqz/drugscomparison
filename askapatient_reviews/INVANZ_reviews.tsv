5	acute diverticulitis	minor thrush but could be from the Augmentin the idiot in the ER started me on.	First diver flare was one year ago, put on cipro/flagyl, almost killed me, developed lactose intolerance immediately, lost 8 pounds in one week, had to stop meds after 3 days, horrible thrush took two weeks to cure.  This is NOTHING like those drugs.  NO side effects, stool is loose but could be post diver flare, have not lost weight.  If you have diverticulitis, REFUSE cipro/flagyl and ask for this drug IV every day (a bit of an inconvenience) but far superior.	M	64	4  daysIV 1X D	6/10/2011Email
