5	Migraines	none	I am so thankful for this drug.  I was having severe migraines 2-3 times a month and having to go to the ER at least once a month for treatment.  Now I can give myself an injection and it is gone in 20 minutes.  I don't have to ask someone take me to the ER and then take care of my children while I sleep off the medication given in the ER.

5	Migraines	None at all	I have had migraines since I was 9 I am now 24 B4 getting these injections I had tried EVERYTHING all triptans such as imitrex just to list one people are familiar with I did bio-feedback therepy I also did physical therapy for my neck and shoulders, I tried anti-seizure meds such as topamax and I did the diet taking out all things I mean its been years of trying it all some many scans and a lot of hospital visits which are hard b.c they think your seeking pain meds when all I wanted was relief I also have tried against my better judgment but I hate pain management I don't want to mange my pain I want it gone and to know whats causing it to begin with so I have tried stadol once and it made me so so sick most pain meds do I am not a large person at all my migraines typically last three days and I have a sever migraine weekly sometimes twice weekly which means six days a week the diet did help I have A LOT of triggers..chocolate, onions, tomatoes, avocados, MSG...the list is endless lol anything good makes me sick :( but I went to a new doctor along with my regular Neurologist and I tried the five day hospital stay for the DHE treatment AGAIN...and I was still sick afterward I still was taking my midrin if needed but was told to try my hardest not too...I was still sick and my doc. put me on the injections DHE 45 when I have a migraine I cant get shake and would normally go to the hospital for...and IT WORKS....THE HEADACHE GOES COMPLETELY AWAY NOTHING has ever worked I am so	F	24	4  months	9/17/2009
5	Severe Migraines	None that I remember.	Injection every 8 hrs in hosp f/3 days. On 3rd day severe migraines started again & they gave me Toradol to help w/the pain.  The migraines continued f/2 more days. I fought thru the pain & tears. Under my Doctor's advisement I did'nt take percocet(narcotic)for pain and took toradol instead. It was well worth the 3 days of pain because now my migraines are manageble. I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis(MS)5 years ago. There's no cure for MS,but my migraines are under control & I'm thrilled!	F	47	3  days	5/28/2009Email
5	Severe migraines	Nothing material, a little nausea once.	This is a far better option than pills. The rebound effect is eliminated and the results are consistently better than other drugs I've used over the past 20 years.	M	54	1  years	3/30/2008
5	Migraine for 3 weeks	No side effects	Injections every 8 hours in hospital for 3 days....Headache gone....no side effect...Took 2 years ago..this is first headache in 2 years	F	59	3  days	8/26/2007
1	4 month long migrain	Went into a Brady code, Heart rate dropped to 30 beats a minute, cold and pale, coldness in fingers/hands and feet, severe mood change (anger/ anxiety)	I would not recommend this drug to anyone.  The contraindications for the drugs are long.  I thought I was going to die, and now my migrain is worse than ever, and am back on dilaudid (strong pain medicine), again.  If I was given all the information prior to use, I would not have had the injection at all.	F	35	1  days	7/24/2007
4	Chronic Migraines	nausea	I take Ondansetron for the nausea about 1/2 hour before the DHE.  The shots are annoying but I get longer relief than from the nasal spray. (at least 48 hours)  I'm not convinced this is the answer but at least I am off the triptans and analgesics that have a higher incidence of rebound.	F	41	1  months	7/17/2007
4	migraine	diarrhea and joint stiffness	I've been using DHE for 17 years.  It works very well for me.  I currently have 2 to 3 migraines a month, down from 5 or 6 when they started 27 years ago.  Prior to using DHE I would have to go to the ER for injections that put me to sleep for a full day.  I highly recommend DHE45 but I do wonder how long it is safe to contrict/dilate blood vessels with this or any other  vasoconstricting drug.	F	59	17  years	3/11/2007Email
1	migraines	tightness in chest, headache was worsened with each injection, pain in legs, my body/immune system was weakened after treatment and my head still hurts.  I have been on bed rest for a while.	I do not believe doctors have done enough research.  I would not recommend this treatment to anyone else.	F	34	4  days	9/30/2006
2	migraines	nausea, possibly tremors	I had 4 doses, and before the DHE was given, they gave reglan. the 4th time, i experienced very bad side effects from the reglan: dystonic reactions, and tremors (not sure if it was caused by reglan or DHE).I stopped getting more doses because of the side effects, and it barely helped the migraine i've had for months.

2	SUDDEN HEADACHES	I GAVE THIS MEDECATION A 2 DUE TO IT CAUSED ME TO HAVE A STROKE AND  I AM NOW PARTIALLY PARALYZED ON THE LEFT SIDE. I believe some physicians need to learn more about DHE before administering. I had tightness in the chest numbness on the left side. These side affects were immediately following being given DHE intravenously.		F	37	1  days	1/18/2006Email
2	SUDDEN HEADACHES	tightness in the chest/left side weakness as the doctors would say. Its called paralysis!

3		Weird Taste, Chest Pain/ tightness, unrelenting nausea	today, not a pleasnat expirience, caution for folks with heart other circulatory illnesses.	F	44	2  months	12/7/2005Email
4	migraine headache	mild Nausea, diarhea, tastes bad benefits far outweighed the side effects.	Suffered Chronic migraine 3 years, tried dozens of preventatives and abortive medications.  Went to Cleveland Clinic Headache Center and they took me off Imitrex(Had been using 15-20 days/month)  Replaced with DHE injection.  Improvement was so dramatic I went from 15-20 days of pain/month to 4-5.  I understand DHE has been around for years, but none of my Headache Dr's tried it until Cleveland.	M	36	4  months	11/19/2005
4	headaches	Chest tightening, drowsiness, and vomiting	it is the only thing that works	F	21	4  years	11/14/2005

5	Migraine / Cluster Headaches	No known side effects	This is the only drug that worked to stop the cycle of cluster headaches - longest headache lasted 5 months before using this medication - now they last 2 weeks tops after using this medicaiton.	M	43	10  years	2/9/2005Email
