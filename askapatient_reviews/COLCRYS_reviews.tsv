1	Behcet's	I did not have any gastrointestinal problems at all like others experience.  I did, however, have a lot of hair loss.  This drug was prescribed to me off label to help with Behcet's mouth ulcers but it did not help.	I have taken both Colchicine and Colcrys.  Same effects and response.

5	gout	diarrhea	I was taking colcrys only when I had a gout attack. Those attacks started coming every 5 to 10 days. I talked with my Dr. and told him why not take colcrys as a maintenance drug. I started taking colcrys 1 every day. The attacks stoped. I am now taking colcrys every other day and have not had gout since January 2012. I gave the drug 5 stars because it does what it is supposed to do for me. One more thing for gout suffers. I know this will not be true for all of you but I was taking meds for high blood preasure a number of those meds put some people at a far higher risk for gout. I believe this happened to me.

5	suspected gout	The first day i felt a little nauseas but after that it's been fine.	I started taking colcrys 10 days ago after a month long series of unexplainable severe joint pains in my ankle, knee and then elbow. I plan to stay on it.  I have not had a gout flare in 10 days. i haven't felt really good like this in about 3 months. I've tried to avoid red meat, beer, shellfish but still drink red wine. i think i began having gout flares years ago when I tried to lose weight on the atkins diet and was eating a lot of red meat. I'm 6'0" and 240 lbs. keeping my fingers crossed that I have no more pain.	M	47	10  days.6 mg 2X D	12/16/2011
1	Gout	Swollen lips, milk-white slime on tongue and in mouth, raspy voice.	Colchicine was removed from distribution in September of 2010, even though it had been used for gout, in a variety of forms, since 500 AD.  Now, Colcrys is the only replacement.  Obviously, I am allergic to Colcrys which worries me greatly as I used Colchicine to thwart off gout attacks.  Without Colchicine I anticipate unnecessary pain and suffering.

5	PERICARDITIS   COLCHICINE ONLY!	NONE that I was aware of.  Please know that I was taking COLCHICINE by Westwari ... and I could not find that listing in RATE THIS MEDICINE.	I TOOK COLCHICINE NOT COLCRYS .. by Westwari .. not able to locate plain old Colchicine!Normally, colchicine was prescribed for Gout.  I had INFLAMMATION OF THE PERICARDIAL SAC ... and Pericarditis!I was originally on DIGOXIN... but there were so many side effects from that, they had to take me off of it and substituted COLCHICINE!It seemed to take care of the problem along with LOTS OF IBUPROFEN/400mg/tab, 2 tabs 3x's per day!! for two months. Very scary when you take that along with Aspirin also.  I was waiting for a bleed to occur!	M	71	6  weeks0.6mg 1X D	10/29/2010Email
5	gout flares	Oh my God, this drug was FABULOUS...I have had gout before and have been on colchicine - which usually worked, but the diarehha was AWFUL,,,also had some nausea.I don't know what was worse, sitting on the toilet all day or suffering from unbearable pain from gout.	I have been on allopurinal now for a few months, but still continue to get gout, once my doctor added this drug to help kill the gout flar, I was like a new man!!!   By far, this drug gave me the fasted relief from pain, AND NO DIAHRREA!!!!  Love it!	M	59	1  days.6mg 2X D	7/28/2010
