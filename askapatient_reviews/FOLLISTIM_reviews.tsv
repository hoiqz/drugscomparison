				F M	 	 	    
3	increase more eggs	Severe mood swings - went from crying to wanting to punch someone in a matter of minutes.	The needle did not hurt one bit - I was shocked how painless it was, considering I hate needles & get my blood drawn all the time which always hurts.  This was a breeze.  Mood swings were a killer though, I've never experienced anything like that before.	F	37	7  days75 mg 1X D	3/7/2011
5	increase follicle #, TTC	Bloating, slight tenderness at injection sites	Worked better than Clomid (more follicles matured - 3, and no thinning of the uterine lining).  Used prior to IUI.	F	39	5  days150 IU 1X D	7/5/2010
3	undefined infertility	Hot flashes and period like cramping...definitely no bloating and headaches with Clomid	Definitely recommend this medication.  Extremely easy to administer.	F	38	4  days75 units 1X D	5/1/2010
4	IVF stimulation	Bloating and soreness at injection site(lower abdomen)	This drug was used in my ivf protocol in conjunction with low dose hcg.  Of all the IVF meds, this is by far the easiest to use/inject.  The needles are so fine you barley feel them.  A real pleasure compared to any and all other ivf drugs I have used!  Sick and sad, but true!  My ovaries did not respond well at first to this drug.  However I strongly feel this had more to do with the fact that I had been over suppressed with lupron.  My doc had to increase my dose from. 300 to 450 after a couple days of stimming.  I would reccommend this drug for it's ease of use and also for the fact that it is portable (does not have to be refrigerated once a vial is punctured).	F	30	2  weeks300-450 1X D	2/9/2010
5	infertility	Hot flashes, irritability.	A great drug!  We have a healthy baby boy.	F	35	14  days	10/4/2008
5	Anovulation infertility	Mild Crabbiness,hot flashes, headache	I tolerated this medication way better than Clomid. I was way happier using this instead of clomid. The shots with the AQ pen are a breeze. Do not panic about the shots....very easy.	F	40	7  days	9/3/2007
5	Infertility/PCOS	I did have mild OHSS with this medication, but I got pregnant in just one month of taking straight Follistim/IUI.  Not only that, but I am pregnant with twins.  After 2 1/2 years of trying to conceive, this medicine was finally what worked.		F	29	1  months	5/28/2007
5	infertility	none	A great drug with very little side effects.	F	39	8  months	9/25/2006
