4	PCOS	I have been on this medication for 2 years (going on my third) and I've had very few side effects. My periods and cramps are so much lighter then they've ever been. When I was initially on the 1/20 I noticed a decrease in sex drive, but then switched over the the 1.5/30 and noticed improvements. Occasionally I will get cramps a few days before I am due.

1	Hormone supplement	I'm 50 years old and was trying this as recommended by my GYN as a hormone supplement. After the first week I started having cramps. Then, my mood increasingly went south after that. By the third week I was a basket case with thoughts of suicide, hating my family, not wanting to interact with anyone. I finally threw the pills away and started my period yesterday. Since then, the cramps have been debilitating. I have never had symptoms like this before. Horrible, horrible pill.

5	Debilitating PMDD	None	I truly believe these other reviews are inaccurate, and that the symptoms reported should not necessarily be attributed to the Microgestin.HISTORY: Diagnosed at 18 with panic disorder (incl. frequent panic attacks) and depression. After 8-10 years of behavioral therapy AND varied medication regimens, my panic disorder was cured and my depression is under control. I began taking Microgestin about 6 or 7 years into my therapy, and it did NOT cause a relapse or worsen my panic disorder/depression in any way. My mental health progess continued as normally as it would have without Microgestin. ALSO: Microgestin near-immediately eased my severe PMDD of more than 10 yrs. Previously, I suffered debilitating cramps, hot/cold flashes, moderate to severe bloating, nausea and occasional vomiting, and drastic mood swings. After 2 months on Microgestin, the severity decreased by about half; after six months the PMDD was essentially gone.I believe Microgestin *helped* my recovery from depression and panic disorder, and wish that more people who use it successfully would take time to write positive reviews. It is a low-dose option, and great for PMDD sufferers. Those with horror stories are likelier to post, but I think it's unfair to scare others with biased accounts, and especially irresponsible to blame a medication for symptoms that are likely attributable to something unrelated. Don't self-diagnose! Talk to a doctor.	F	33	6  years 1X D	9/30/2011Email
3	Anemia / Birth Control	Nausea, panic attacks, paranoia (as in, anticipation or impending danger, or feeling like you forgot something important), decreased appetite, weight gain (5 lbs), Heavy lethargy, lack of impulse control, poor anger management, irritability, depression the second week, acne the second week, vanishing sex drive, extreme sugar cravings week two. No period yet, it was due yesterday.	I recommend Xanax or lots of tea when taking this pill. A gym membership is helpful to keep you calm, focused and to keep your weight under control. Your significant other will be fed up with you if he is unaware of the side effects.	F	30	15  days1 tablet 1X D	5/14/2011Email
3	Contraceptive && Irregular Periods	EXTREME NAUSEA! Weight gain of about 4 pounds. Boyfriend said I've turned into a B-word. So definitely moodiness and depression.	I took this pill when I was 17 and didn't even manage to get through 2 packs because my family and friends made me get off the pill because it seemed to make me so mean and depressed. I've been back on it now for 2 weeks, and I now remember what the SEVERE NAUSEA was like ): I can barely eat sometimes because of it. I really don't want to get pregnant and I really want to have sex. But I think its making me into a mean hormonal mess and pushing me and my boyfriend apart. I might just have to quit this pill.

1	Prevent pregnancy	Significant weight gain, increased appetite, loss of sex drive, depression	I've been taking these pills for about 2 years and recently my prescription ran out.  It wasn't until then that I realized how awful these pills have been to me.  The minute I stopped taking them my appetite decreased.  My depression also seems different now.  The past two years of my life have been hell due to depression, anxiety, and excessive weight gain.  Now I know why.  Bye bye.  I'd rather get pregnant than take these pills again.
