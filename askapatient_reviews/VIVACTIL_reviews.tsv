1	Major Depression with anhedonia	I had tachycardia and almost died trying to exercise with a pulse of over 200bpm!	It did nothing for my anhedonia or depression	M	20	2  months5 MG 5X D	11/8/2012
5	depression, anxiety	none -- I had sexual side effects (low desire, no orgasm) but they went away.	I've tried every antidepressent, and every SSRI causes sexual dysfunction that never gets better no matter how long I stay on the drug. Vivactil caused anorgasmia in the beginning, but after several weeks, it wore off! Never had that happen. It helps but does not fix my depression.	F	52	3  months 2X D	11/26/2011
4	depression, anxiety	insomnia, anorgasmia, constipation, dry mouth	Vivactil works far better for me than anything else I've tried -- Prozac, Wellbutrin, Paxil, a slew of supposedly cleaner and better drugs. It both calms me down and energizes me -- hard to describe. I'm more focused on others, less on myself. It has me on the thin side because it does take away the appetite a bit, but no complaints there. The worst of it is the sexual side effect -- low libido, no orgasm, little feeling. I don't know if I'll be able to tolerate this in the long run, but for now it's helping me navigate this awful time of perimenopause/PMDD. The constipation is not terrible, the insomnia's getting better and the dry mouth can be managed with lots of fluids and gum.	F	52	2  weeks15 mg 1X D	7/20/2011Email
1	Migraines	-Difficult urinating-Difficult Ejaculating-Woke up 2-3 times a night to urinate	I am winding down taking Vivactil.  Since lowering my dosaged my headaches have decreased.  This was presribed to prevent migraines but I think it triggering daily headaches.	M	35	8  months10MG 3X D	3/18/2010
5	Depression	No negative side effects thus far, However an increased libido and sensitivity is apparent..A side effect I don't mind one bit..No dry mouth as of yet, And it hasn't effected my sleep or anything.	Been on this medication for about a week now to treat depression, And can safely say it's already had a positive effect. And look forward to the coming week's of use..Surely worth a try for anyone who suffers from depression..	M	27	7  days	10/12/2009
4	2009	PROTRIPTYLINE  dry mouth.	thanks groovyboho.com	F	44	1  years	9/21/2009
5	Depression	None!  Unless you consider sexual activation to be a side effect - libido, arousal and sensation are all increased.  Although protriptyline is supposed to be somewhat anticholinergic, I have no significant problem with dry mouth, less than with desipramine.	Id give this more than a 5 rating if I could.  As one of the earlier posters said, it is a mystery why protriptyline is not prescribed more. Partly this must be because it is in the older TCA class (although I am very supportive of new drug development, expiration of patent protection means that an older drug will not be promoted, no matter how effective it is).      I am a neuroscience professor and have tried many different options, including Wellbutrin, Celexa, Effexor, Pristiq, Cymbalta, and Desipramine.  Although effexor worked well for depression, the sexual side effects were worse than I was willing to put up with.  Protriptyline has made me feel actually cheerful for the first time since I came down with depression about a year and a half ago.  According to my wife, I am better than for the last 30 years...    I find a fairly low dose works best for me (for this medication and the others), less than the usual recommended amount. I dont know if this would be true for other people.  I gradually increase the dose of any new med until it starts working less well and then go back down to the amount that worked best.

5	depression	None at all (amazing for me)	I have treatment resistant depression and am very sensitive to side effects.  This is the only antideppressant that has EVER worked for me.  It is amazing, and I'm perplexed as to why doctors don't prescribe it more.  Lifts your energy, too.  No weight gain.  I had absolutely no side effects. Downside:  it wears off quickly, have to take at least two a day. Also, the generic did not work for me.	F	35	3  months	10/12/2006
5	Migraines/Depression & panic	Dry mouth, constipation, both very manageable; not bad at all.	I was put on this drug for Migraines. I was previously taking Remeron for the migraines, which worked wonderfully, but had the unpleasant side effect of 35 lb weight gain and fatigue.Thankfully my Dr. had me try this Vivactil on a daily basis, which has helped me immensely without the weight gain problem. Actually the Vivactil has curbed my appetite somewhat. This drug has also helped me with panic/depression. I highly recommend trying this drug for migraines. The side effects are minimal & tolerable. Vivactil has given me much relief from migraines and the depression that go along with migraine headaches.	F	48	3  years	9/26/2006
