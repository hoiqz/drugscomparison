2	Osteoperosis	High blood pressure. Mild depression. Mood swings. Choking in my sleep. Body tremors.	Prescribing 50,000units/week vitamin D due to blood work results.	M	41	10  months20 mcg 1X D	6/6/2012Email
2	severe osteoperosis (-4.3 T score)	seizures have returned. Now on blood pressure meds due to continuous high BP. Uncertain if my recurrance of hallucinations and "OCD" are from the Forteo or the permanent damage left over from the actonel.	Going to talk to my doctor about a possible lower dose.	M	41	11  months20 mcg 1X D	6/5/2012Email
3	Osteoporosis	Pain in elbows and knees.  Bloating when injection site was abdomen.  Have since switched to hip injection and abdomen bloating went away.		F	59	8  months 1X D	2/2/2011
2	osteoporosis	Insomnia, anxiety, depression, severe back pain, upper GI inflammation	I experienced debilitating side effects from Forteo and it was totally ineffective in treating my osteoporosis. The only thing I have to show for a year of use is longer and more luxuriant hair. I am no longer taking it.	F	58	1  years 1X D	12/20/2010Email
4	osteoporosis	None, so far.	Doing great! All tests show improvement. Will do anothter bone density exam in May.  Fingers crossed!	F	54	7  months20mcg 1X D	11/19/2010
5	osteoporosis and nonunion femur	None that I am aware of.  My physical therapy has been more successful with Forteo than before -- finally after 20 months since suffering a nontraumatic subtrochronteric femur break, the union has occurred.  I can walk without a cane. I had been on Fosamax for 11 years when the break occurred and was still on it for 6 months after the break.  I stopped Fosamax and then started Forteo	Accidentally missing a day is rare now that I take it first thing in the morning.	F	67	1  years 1X D	6/1/2010Email
1	osteoperosis	I had NO improvement, I actually had bone LOSS taking this drug for 15 months. My bone density test was worse. So now, I am back on Forteo and Micalcitrin (sp?) Nose Spray. What a terrible disappointment and expense, financially and physically.I also worry about the cancer risk.	I had no problems with daily injections, and no side effects while taking the drug. I do take cortisone for asthma, don't know if this effected the results, but it is specifically listed as "good" for cortisone patients. I wish it could have helped me. Especially with the Fosamax and like drugs femur fracture reports.	F	64	15  monthsinjection 1X D	3/27/2010
5	Forteo	Only side effect I noticed was occasional "growing pains" in my leg bones, and temporary, small red rash at the injection site.	Significant improved my DEXA scores, going from -3.2 to -1.9 in the spine.  Will likely shift to a Strontium-based drug to maintain gains in bone density.	M	51	2  years 1X D	3/6/2010Email
5	osteoporosis	none		F	65	20  months	1/16/2010Email
3	osteoporosis	10lb abdominal weight gain, loss of appetite, acid reflux	Don't know if this is helping yet, but I'm experiencing considerable weight gain in spite of decreased appetite. My rings are loose, but I've added a couple of inches in the bust and waist. It took a lot of work to get my weight down over the past couple of years and I'm not at all pleased to put it back on so effortlessly. Also I have nearly constant indigestion, no matter what or how little I eat. It's clearly putting a strain on my body, but nothing else has worked at all.	F	57	4  months	11/9/2009
1	osteo bad in spine	light headed, I taste the medicine upon injection, bouts of nausea, pains in my knees and pain started in my kidney. I can smell the medicine also. I'm going to a urologist to re: kidney and I have blood in urine and no infection. My doctor suggested trying it every other day. this is my second try	I don't know that I can stay on the drug	F	61	5  days	10/17/2009Email
2	Two fractures in 1 year	Light headed,dizzy, forgetful, extreme joint pain esp knees extreme fatique, headaches	I was good for 4 days, on the 5th morning I woke up thought I was tired from weekend, but, the joint pain, headaches and extreme fatique continued or two weeks. I wish I could of taken I am off from work yet 3 1/2 months and 6 months the 1st break of my foot. Good Luck if you try and try not to be negative it might be ok for you. Everyone reacts different.

3	to heal bone fracture	Light headed feeling most of day.  1-2 major dizzy spells daily.		F	57	1  years	10/4/2009
3	Severe osteoporosis	Bone pain, especially in legs.  Flu like symptoms.	I know I have to stick with this, but it's been very hard. Started 3 mos. ago and have had to stop several times.  I have severe pains and cramping in legs, especially shins. I feel tired, achy and like I've got the flu. I don't know what to do. I don't want to start breaking bones as my bone density scores are very bad, but at the same time I don't want to feel this bad all the time.  Any suggestions or comments are appreciated!

5	Low t-score and 6 frax's	I didn't have *any* side effects... I've finished the 2 years.	My scores are now in the in the -1's which is fantastic since originally I was in the high -3's.	F	54	2  years	11/7/2008
3	Osteoporis	I did not have any side effects from the drug that I noticed. I took the drug for one year, however, at 53 I have a blood clot in the brain,"stroke".  Have not taken the drug since. My dr. said this drug cannot be taken more than 2 years. I wonder if anyone else has had side effects from this drug.		F	54	9  months	10/14/2008Email
3	I kept breaking my bones	Druing the two (2) years of taking it really didn't bother me.	After the two years I now bleed real easy.  In the sun I burn real easy.  I am no longer able to tolerate the sun/heat.  I am now having spells where I almost faint.  I have ringing in my ears several times a month along with the fainting spell.  The doctor says all the above isn't from the Forteo but I NEVER had any of those problems prior.  Makes one wonder.	F	56	2  years	7/20/2008Email
5	loss of bone - fracture	One month today, so far no side effects except a little bruising where I give the injection and it doesn't hurt at all	Looking forward to a good bone scan.  Will keep you posted.	F	49	1  months	5/27/2008Email
