3	Endometriosis	Major hot flashes, weight gain (40 pounds), extreme mood swings, trouble sleeping	Though i had a very hard time with the drug, and the side effects, especially going through a simulated menopause at 16, i have to say it has helped to decrease my daily pain and helped me be able to re-enroll in school. I will never take this drug again though if i can help it.	F	16	5  months? 1X M	6/27/2012Email
4	Endometriosis and Ovarian Cysts	MOOD SWINGS, Some abdominal pain once in awhile, Hot flashes, Tiredness, Hunger cravings, Night sweats	The mood swings are the worst. I do not reccomend trying to be in a relationship if he isn't ready for to deal with this cause I have been up and down with my emotions such as crying for no reason and getting irritated at the smallest of things. I sleep with my window open every night (and it's snowing outside) because i'll wake up dying of heat. All I want to do is lay in bed and eat food. I have struggled with being tired throughout the years but this is much worse. I go to work and put my head on my desk and fight to stay awake some days. I've gained about 10 lbs since I started the injection. And that is without changing my diet. Besides all the cons I would not stop taking it. I went from curled up in bed in so much pain to being able to work out for 45 minutes and walk up stairs without crying. So far the injection has been wonderful to help with the pain. I used to have cysts that would burst often and since I started the injection I have had none and have not felt any pain from them. If you can put up with the cons than you will feel much better. A few days ago I received my second injection. My doctor is having me do one more at the end of this month and than in 3 months i'll have one more and will be done.	F	25	1  months 1X M	3/7/2012
5	Fibroids	Mood swings , migraines , hot flashes were severe the first 2 months but have tappered of since.my 3 softball size fibroids  that put strain on my heart and lungs forming a pluresy mass . Drs gave me 7 yrs to live & a full hysterectomy was my only option. After 5 mths of 3.75 treatments my fibroids are gone except for one that has shrunk from 10 in to 6cm. I've never be happier with my results and the Luperon Depot is worth enduring any side affect .Hopefully I will still have a chance at getting pregnant...best of luck to you all		F	42	7  months3.75	2/4/2012Email
4	endometriosis,bleeding,cysts	Hot flashes, pain in pelvis worse for first 3 months, headaches, extream cold, mood swings, weight lose, incresed labido	I was on lupron for six months and was taken off for 3. I was off for only 1 month when I started getting my ovarian cysts back. They had to go in and do emergency surgery to remove a 10cm by10cm cyst from my right ovary when they went in they also found extreme endometriosis. My doctor told me that I had to go back on lupron for another 6 moths then on to birth control. Before I was on it I had extreme pain and bleeding, after 3 months all my symptoms were gone. I had some side affects that were opposite of what most women experience. I was happy to go back on it again but also worried because i am coming up to the year mark here in a while and once that happens I have to come off it. I am not looking forward to that. I dont wanna go back to the pain and the bleeding.	F	21	7  months 1X M	1/3/2012Email
4	Endometriosis, cyst, bleeding, pain	Hot flashes, moody, sobbing, bone loss	I have been on Lupron twice for once for a year (2005) then another time for 6 months (2003). I start again today or tommorow whenever the shot comes in the mail. Lupron was a life saver for me, I went from bleeding for months and extreme pain to almost no pain at all. This time the main reason is for a cyst on both ovaries. I am trying to avoid another surgery due to me still trying to conceive.	F	31	1  years 1X M	8/24/2011Email
1	Endometriosis	Pain, and crazy mood swings.	I had the 1 month injection given to me 2 days ago due to supposed endometriosis, aka pain that wad only getting worse, periods getting heavier and more painful, and experiencing painful intercourse for nearly a year. I just had my 2nd child 3 months ago, was on the pill, which only made my mood and periods worse. Finally an ob recommended I try this instead of "different positions and more lube and throw some Mrotin in the mix for the pain." first of all, due to a stomach condition I can't even take motrin and right now I am in so much pain, and I have been alternating between pure rage and complete hopelessness...not to mention yesterday I had the first migraine I've had in years, and fluid retention...and yet they won't do another surgery. I've already had one ovary removed due to a lot of good sized cysts, and have 2 beautiful children(and 2 miscarriages), and am soDone with dealing with this...I am feeling very lied to by the ob and would never wish this hell on anyone except maybe a serial killer or something. Please tell me it gets better or at least some advise on what to do...	F	23	3  days3.5 1X M	8/24/2011Email
3	Endometriosis	I've taken the time to read over everyone else's experiences with this drug. You must understand going on this drug is by choice and for many different reasons. Many people have different side effects but here were mine; Headaches, Weight gain(35 pounds to date), Tiredness, Night sweats, Hot Flashes, Cold sweats, The worst leg pain I've ever experienced, loss of vision to an extent,feeling weak, overall feeling like crap. <<< I'm sure some will read these and wonder why I put myself through this, Though the side effects suck pain wise I feel much better.	I first got sick when I was 15. I've had 4 surgeries to date since then. Doctor One:First one at the age of 15 to remove polyps of the uturis and a D/C. No endo found at that point. Then tried many oral birth controls ended up at the first depo P. shot. Doctor Two: Second operation at the age of 17: I remember this quite well due to it was the week of xmas, Found adhesions and cysts. No endo found at this time. Once again this second doctor said they had done what they could and put me back on b/c(birth-control) During these three years I had to drop out of public school and go to an online school, I had my period at least 3 weeks out of a month. Pain was not tolerable. Finally at age 18 I went to see a specialist for endo in Hershey Pa. Doctor 3: First thing she said is I know you have endo we need to go to the operating table as soon as possible. By July 2010 I was on the table being cut open again. For the third time with the third doctor I had a D/C, lap scope, and four new incisions. When I was brought to I knew something wasn't right. Doctors all around me and my mom crying. They had finally found endo after my battle with doctors and pain for 4 years. What was suppose to be an hour operation turned into a 5 hour operation! The endo had moved onto my lungs, appendix, bowels, bladder, ovaries, uturis, ect. At my two week check up I was told how bad my endo was, I was then told I needed to go on the lupron depot right away if I wanted any chance at one having kids and two	F	19	7  months 1X O	3/22/2011
5	Continuous bleeding and pain	Hot flashes, painful injection site	I started the lupron injections four months ago after suffering continuous heavy bleeding and pain for about 18 months.  I was scared to try this therapy, but my doctor made me feel more comfortable about it after talking with her.  I have had hot flashes and night sweats, but the bleeding has stopped and the pain is more manageable.  My doctor said it's this therapy or a hysterectomy.  (This was my 4th opinion).  Since I have been unsuccessful in staying pregnant and do not have any children, she recommended this therapy to give me a chance at having a child before a hysterectomy.  So far, I do feel much better.  Sure, there are are days where I feel horrible, but it's so much better than it feeling bad everyday.  My doctor gave me a low dose of Lexapro to help with the hot flashes and night sweats and it has made a huge difference. I would recommend this to someone who may be in my situation.

5	Stage 3 Endo/12.6 cm mass, rt ovary	Hot flashes, night sweats, constant fatigue, loss of period, vaginal dryness, decreased libido, memory and concentration issues, heart palpitations, depression, mood swings, muscle and joint pain, bloating, weight gain > 60 lbs (1st round), mild acne, nightmares	I took 7 rounds of monthly Lupron in 2002 for Stage 4 ENDO after lap with adhesions all over my organs, including a mass on my diaphragm. I experienced severe side-effects, but the results were astounding I was able to get pregnant in 2007 and had a healthy,beautiful child. I had no pain or complications until getting pregnant in 2010 with my daughter. I developed a 12.6 cm endometrioma on my rt ovary and had to be monitored very closely during my pregnancy. I lost my daughter in my 3rd trimester to a cord accident and am now on my 2nd 6-month round of Lupron to attempt to avoid surgery and get pregnant again before I lose my reproductive organs for good. 2nd time, milder symptoms, but new and worsening memory and concentration issues are worrisome. I am also having muscle and joint pain and heart palpitations that I did not have last time that I attributed to age until reading this site. Lupron has been a miracle drug for me,aside from the side-effects, and I hope this 2nd round passes quickly and does its job. This drug is not for the faint of heart, but in my case, it has been my saving grace.	F	29	6  months3.75 MG 1X M	3/16/2011
3	Endometriosis	Constant backache, occasional pelvic pain and intense pressure, chills(not really chills, but always extreamly cold), hot flashes at least once an hour, weird cravings(especially at night), weird dreams, increased libido(which is the oppisite of most people on the drug),depression/INTENSE mood swings, and bad headaches	I had always had painful periods, but around age 17 i started getting cramps and backaches through my entire period. After a foot surgery in october 2010( dont know if its related) i started bleeding, even though im on the pill, and i bled for 4 months. I had a laprascopy in December 2010 and was diagnosed with moderate endometriosis. But after my surgery i could barly move for weeks, i was in so much pain, i had a pelvic infection and started intense antibiotics. After finishing them i was still bleeding, not sleeping, and in a ton of pain. I usually took something to knock me out so i wouldnt have to deal with the pain. Then i got the Lupron shot. at first it worked, the bleeding and cramping stopped the first month. But this is my second month and i feel out of control. The hotflashes, cravings, dreams,headaches, and backaches are killing me. I have to finish my dosage though, so im hoping to not have to do this again. Its hell :(	F	18	6  months 1X D	3/12/2011
5	Endometriosis	Bleeding, temperature changes	I have had only great results from the 3 month Lupron shot I received. I did get a lengthy 2 week period of bleeding, and then the extra pain about 3 weeks after the shot was administered, but since then feel better than ever. My mood has actually improved. I used to be hot all the time, and now am more on the cold side and feel regulated. I am taking add-back therapy so that may be a helper. I am due for my second 3 monh shot at the end of the month, and am hoping that the results stay the same!	F	3	  1X D	3/10/2011Email
4	endometriosis	constipation, 5 lb weight gain the 1st week which disappeared after the 2nd week.	I feel good on Lupron so far.  I have more energy and no lasting side effects but I'm only on my 1st month.  I was worried to go on it after hearing all the horror stories but also realize that many women only come on the site to vent.  I wanted others to know that it can help some people feel better and is not only a nightmare drug.	F	40	1  days3.75 1X M	2/15/2011Email
1	Pain, endo?	Had an emergency hysterectomy after the birth of my son 19 years ago, have had trouble ever since, it's taken them this long to do anything!!! passing out with the pain, only one ovary, adhesions, leg pain, bowel problems	I was great at first, even though the mood swings were awful and I was very very tired (I have narcolepsy and it seemed to make my symptoms there better too) but started getting chest pain within about 8 months and my blood pressure shot up!!..and stayed there! Massive weight gain, my hair has thinned a great deal ( I have very very long hair so it has made a big impact) The hot flushes started to get unbearable, I honestly felt that I would literally drop dead of heat exhaustion, dramatic but true! Suicidal!!!Lost all my confidence, have become a recluse..cannot lose weight no matter what I do, I'm so tired. Developed a fistula so now a colostomy is on the cards, the doctors can't tell me if it's connected or not.  I just feel like a lab rat frankly so I'm not having the shot anymore, Totally fed up and have no life now. The oestrogen add back was the worst point. I was literally barking at the moon and I don't feel that I was monitored enough by the doctors.My life has ground to an abrupt halt completely and all the tiredness, hair loss, depression, it's all been for nothing. I wish I'd never been put on it. I will never go back on this drug, ever! I'm better of with nothing but my own oestrogen, at least the symptoms were only monthly rather than all the time! I don't believe that the doctors know enough to prescribe this drug to women. I studied medicine myself when I was younger and my treatment over the years has just been absolute rubbish!

1	Adenomyosis	I've suffered with adenomyosis, probably for 35 years.  After years of being on various low-dose types of the Pill and Depo Provera, nothing was very effective.  With Lupron Depot, I had hot flashes, cold chills, and sweating all day.  I since decided to have a hysterectomy. I developed pain in my neck, arm/leg joints, and hips five months after my first (and last) injection. The joint pain has been getting progressively worse.	I did not have joint pain prior to taking this drug.  The 11.25 dosage is to be taken every three months.  Four months after the injection, I had a hysterectomy (with my ovaries remaining).  I'm not in menapause and am still ovulating.  Prior to surgery, I was in excellent health, with no family history of arthitis.  I am very strong and was very mobile prior to surgery.  I'm taking it easy, as it has only been five weeks since my surgery, but I walk and move around and eat and sleep well.  But I'm surprised that the neck and joint pain started after the surgery (five months after the Lupron Depot injection).  The hot flashes and sweats have been greatly reduced since I started taking sage leaf extract a couple of times a day.  But I'm concerned that the drug has affected my immune system, and I hope it hasn't triggered an auto-immune response in my body.	F	47	3  months11.25 1X O	12/17/2010Email
3	Endometriosis	Hot flashes and some restlessness at night	I just had my third shot of Lupron. So far I am having hot flashes a few days a week. I had surgery a couple months ago and had lots of endo removed. I am on Lupron in preparation for a second surgery on my bladder. Lupron will hopefully shrink the endo that is on my bladder. It is growing in a tricky area near the ureters and will be a risky surgery that could lead to more problems (bladder problems). Really hoping the Lupron shrinks what's there. Has anyone ever have endo on their bladder?	F	30	3  months 1X M	10/29/2010Email
1	Endometreosis	Hot Flashes, mood swings, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, migranes, vision changes, decreased sex drive, nausea, vomiting, light-headedness,	I have only been on this medication for just over 2 months, first month went fine no problems besides the hot flashes... if those were the only side effects i could deal with it. Directly following the second shot however, the side effects got extreamly worse. I foolishly didnt do any research before accepting this shot, I recomend that anyone being told that they should go on this, DO RESEARCH! Endometreosis is a very common diagnosis among women, almost 60% of women. I dont believe this drug has helped me at all. I believe it has made things worse. I have missed several day's of work because i couldnt function at all. The abdominal pain, nausea, hot flashes, dizzy spells, fainting, back aches, trouble sleeping...It felt like i had the flu for a month straight. ITS REDICULAS! i think all health care providers should definatly have an in depth conversation about the side effects with their patients they plan on giving this shot to. If the patient dosent mind having all these side effects on top of the endo-pain... go right ahead.. but personally I will never take this shot again! It hasnt helped, just made everything worse!

3	endometrosis	hot flashes, cold chills,  migraines, nausea, difficulty urinating, constipation, painful female organs, anxiety, overwhelmed, fatigue, acne, weight gain (40 lbs), memory loss, throbbing in my right temple that makes me tired--(and probably more side effects I can't remember right now)	I gave this medicine a 3 because even though I had a blue million side effects, I had severe endo and my organs were stuck together.  The doctor couldn't remove it because he didn't want to damage my other organs.  So I did lupron once a month for 6 months. The first 5 months, I was great on the shot with only acne and hot flashes as side effects. The 6th month however brought with it the rest of the side effects.  However, the doc scheduled my surgery in October of 2005 after my last shot in August and was able to clean me out from the endo. In November I went on the shot for another 6 months due to the pelvic pain I was in while on the last month of the first 6 shots and wow, did it ever get worse.  I thought it was the endo causing the pain but little did I know it was the shot. During this time side effects were worse than ever and 5 years later, I am still suffering from them.

3	Exreamly bad Endo.	Exream hot flashes, memory loss, swollen hands and feet, weight gain ( over 40 pounds ),extream headakes, crying for no reason, got attached to people, really bad back pain, sleeping all the time,uncontrolable shaking, some bleeding, hurt to walk up and down steps, feeling like bugs are crawling in your skin.	I am 15 years old and i have had endo. since i was 13. All the doctors i went to told me i was crazy that i was to young to have endo. i went thru 3 different doctors, and by then i was out of school and couldnt move it hurt me so bad. I had lapo. done and they found out that i had so much of it on my blader and overies that they couldnt burn it off so i got put on Lupron. I wont say it is my favorite thing, but it is helping me alot. After i got the 1st shot it was hard to deal with. I just had my 2nd shot done 2 weeks ago i am still having alot of pain. The doctors just want the endo. to get off of my blader then if i still hurt they want to do a hysterectomy.	F	15	6  months12.5 2X M	9/19/2010Email
3	Fibroids, heavy bleeding and pain	Hot flushes, weight gain, joint pain especially knees, fatigue, weepy and highly emotional	Stopped injections 3 month ago and periods have still not returned.  Prostap stopped the severe pain and heavy bleeding completly but added a whole lot of new problems to my lifestyle.  Joint pain especially bad and not good for my husband and two young children to see.  Still highly emotional and tired and have a lot of excessive weight to shift so not sure would recommend really!!

1	PROSTATE CANCER	In 2007 I had a radical prostatectomy. In 2009 my PSA went up. Dr recommended Lupron depot. Did not inform me of possible side effects. Now I have no muscle strength, very poor endurance, hot flashes, very poor sleep, memory loss, very poor concentration, irritability, bouts of extreme depression, vision changes, and PAIN in legs.	When I went back to Dr he said my PSA was lower and would not need another injection. Stated I would never take another injection. This medicine has destroyed my life. I have been a paraplegic for 23 years. My life has gone from being independent to depending on others. I cannot make transfer into my car so now will have to buy van with lift. The pain in my legs seems to be bone pain mainly is in my left femur which has had no  feeling for 20+ years. Due to the muscle weakness I have fallen and fractured two bones in calf. Dislocated a finger and suffered a torn rotator cuff and head trauma. THIS MEDICINE SHOULD NEVER BE GIVEN TO A PARAPLEGIC WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION OF POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS! I was given the shot Sept 1, 2009  and went to my 40th class reunion on Nov 21, 2009 and barely remember any of it.	M	59	1  times? 1X O	7/16/2010Email
1	Ovarian Fibroid and Heavy Bleeding	Severe weight gain, horrific hot flashes, mood swings which effected my everyday life, severe depression, joint pain and frequent, long lasting headaches.	I was happy with this medication on my first go around, I used it for a little over a year and it did what it was suppose to do, decreased pain, stopped my bleeding.  After losing insurance coverage I had to go off this medication for about 2 years during which the pain and bleeding returned worse than before.  I was able to get back on the shot for about 1 1/2 years during which the side effects were awful.  I continued the shot because of the fear of the pain in my pelvic region returning and the uncontrollable bleeding.  I have been off the shot since Feb and all my old symptoms are returning.  This time I do believe I will seek a surgical treatment versus Lupron Depot!	F	30	1.5  years 1X M	6/6/2010Email

My pain was not bad at all and this treatment was not worth it. My endimetrosis was discovered when i had a cyst removed. He said it was a light case but went ahead and put me on a 4 month shot.

2	Uterine Fibroids & Heavy Bleeding	High blood pressure. Joint pain (Knee & finger) Could hardly walk on occassions! Migraines. Depression/weepy. Palpitations. Memory loss/Forgetful	Initially agreed to to have 3 x monthly PROSTAP injections, prior to my hysterectomy.  Ended up having 5 as they couldn't fit me in for the op.

2	Uterine fibroids	Briefly?  Leg pain, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, sweats, flu-like symptoms, debilitation, fatigue	I have known I've had fibroids for some 15 years now, but they (one 15cm one, plus other smaller ones) have become so problematic that my uterus was the size of a six-month pregnancy, and was pressing on my leg veins (I've had a clot), and central veins (feeling dizzy if I lay on my back for too long).  I am of course a prime candidate for hysterectomy, but do not want to have one for various reasons, so was keen to try Prostap (UK name).  Was given the treatment (1-month depot injection) by the nurse who said that most women are fine, without being told of the possible adverse side effects.  It was only after reading the leaflet later, that I became concerned.  Felt OK in the first 2 weeks of treatment, and it was like a miracle in terms of the notable uterine shrinkage.  My stomach became flat again, and my legs stopped swelling up.  Great!  However, I then developed the excrutiating leg pain (bone pain), that kept me awak at night.  Next was the vertigo attacks.  Usually on rising in the morning, but so bad that I had to take time off work. Next was the worse nausea and vomiting I have experienced in my life, to the point I had to go to A&E with dehydration from it.  Then came the flu-like symptoms and the hot flushes, plus the affects on sleep.  As a business woman and fitness enthusiast, the treatment has totally pollaxed me.  I am due for my third shot next week.  The week I had the N&V, I swore I would not have any further treatment, but no have the dilema of f	F	48	2  months 1X M	3/5/2010
4	Prostate cancer	I was prescribed this, which they call Prostap in the UK, as a preliminary treatment before having radiotherapy.  After a few days I started to experience obsessions with certain things, and this developed into a mania over about 3 weeks.  Then I had what felt like an emotional crisis, with insomnia, anxiety, extreme swings of mood (elation, weeping) and over-reaction to any emotional event.  I felt I was deeply in love with one of my best friends!  (Never told her)  Also physical symptoms like palpitations and sweaty episodes, but these were insignificant in comparison to the mind-bending effects.After 3 months the effects are wearing off, thank god, And I am much calmer. Now I just have the effects of the radiation to suffer.	It had the desired effect on my prostate cancer, but I hope I never have to have this drug on a long-term basis.

On February 12th I had a lupron depot shot(3month).I was told the only way to keep endo from coming back for 5 years is taking the lupron.  The third week was hell.............I started to have panic/anxiety attachs. I scaring my family. Then came the hot flashes, ever 15 to 30 minutes!!!horrible. I still have not started my period and I am coming up on 6 months. I WILL TELL YOU FROM MY EXPERIENCE THIS DRUG IS EVIL AND SHOULD NOT BE USED!

1	To Shrink Fibroid	EXTREME HOT FLASHES, Mood Swings, Chills, Restless Sleeps, Crying, depression, and Hungry all the time.	I was an outgoing, friendly, bubbly person. I would walk into a room and brighten it. I barely want to leave the house because of the HOT FLASHES! I carry a fan everywhere I go and its so embarrassing when the flashes just come out of no where. If I am emotional, which is all the time because of the shot, the FLASHES ARE WORST!! I am going through a horrible crying spell that I have no control over. I feel so sad and depressed and I have no reason to feel that way. IT SHOULD BE CALLED THE SHOT FROM HELL!!! I wish that I had listened to a friend of mine that had to go through the same thing, when she told me, "whatever you do, don't take the Lupron Shot". I am now suffering more than I was before. I had to have a Hysterectomy and my Dr. was great. I just wish I hadn't ever agreed to shrink the fibroid before surgery.I am now applying estrogen patches to level the side effects. The hot flashes are every hour instead of every 15 min. I would never recommend taking this medication to anyone, not even my worst enemy! God Bless the women and their marriages that have no option, but to take the "SHOT FROM HELL"!	F	36	2  months	7/3/2009Email
5	premenopausal breast cancer	After 2 yrs in combination with tamoxifen: thin eyebrows, cramping in calves, no periods (great!), but finally some severe cramping in calves and pain/swelling in am in knuckles and soles of feet.  But I would do this combo again - not bad at all.  Effects may be just menopausal.	Used Lupron with Tamoxifen for 2 years for hormonal treatment of breast cancer.  I believe Tamoxifen does stimulate the endometrium because I got my period back after chemo, 1 month after starting tamoxifen.  Therefore I used Lupron for ovarian suppression to hopefully keep my estrogen down and prevent reoccurance of my breast cancer.  I think it was a good decision - no cancer return so far, and quality of life was OK.	F	47	21  months	4/17/2009
3	endometriosis	Freaky dreams, edgyness, acne, weight gain, headaches	Laproscopy for endo 4-2008. 9 months later, started lupron. I am always wary about medicines, so I do a lot of research and consideration before starting something new.  This one had me a little nervous especially b/c of the bone loss, but after discussing all my ?'s with the dr. I decided to try it. She suggested the 1 month shot to give it a try. I said that if all went well, I would continue to have them given one month at a time b/c I like to have the option of getting a medicine out of my body asap if needed.  Anyway, the very first night after getting the shot, I had a very disturbing dream!  These types of disturbing dreams continued for 2 solid weeks, all night, every night!  After 2 weeks they began to get less disturbing, but I was still dreaming all night--feeling like I had a restless sleep.  My husband said I was very edgy that whole first month and the first couple days after the shot I felt kind of crazed like a wild energy and ambition. So, I decided to not pursue any m	F	37	1  months	3/13/2009

4	Endometriosis	I took Lupron for 4 years off and on. I am 29 years old and was very concerned about infertility after having 2 lap's to remove adhesions and still experiencing pain. I happened to have a very good experience with Lupron but I do urge one to do tons of homework on this med and it's side effects prior to taking it. After 3 months on Lupron, I had lost 10lbs, was not experiencing as much pain, felt much less moody and unpredictable, and did not have a period through the whole course of my treatement. However, I also experienced hot flashes that were out of this world, occasional fatigue, as well as osteopenia (or bone loss) in my hips and knees (Osteopenia has since improved with regular weight bearing exercise and calcium supplements) I stopped taking Lupron about 3 months ago and luckily all my symptoms went with it. My cycle is beginning to return but is in no way "a regular monthly cycle."	I am very sorry to hear about the awful effects this med has had on so many women. I have not read many positive ratings on this med and do feel very fortunate after reading all of yours. I, like most of you, did not do my homework and jumped on the Lupron wagon with my eyes wide shut. My 2 concerns were; 1. no more pain and unbearable periods but most importantly 2. Fertility protection. From what I have read these have been the concerns of most women contemplating Lupron therapy. We all must weigh out the risks and benefits of starting any new medication and it is always best to get more than one opinion especially if you do not fully trust your physician. Also, there are many holistic therapies that have been effective in treating the pain associated with endo, fibroids, as well as other repoductive disorders. My recommendation to anyone considering Lupron therapy would be to seek out alternative therapies before putting this drug (or any drug) into your body.	F	29	4  years	11/10/2008

After 2 pelviscopy surgeries for my endometriosis, and finding out that i have another disease called endomytosis, the doctor recommended this procedure for 6 months... i wish i did a little more research on it BEFORE i decided to go through hell for 6 months. I would have to say the only major problems were my hot flashes and memory loss. I noticed that after my 2nd shot i lost alot of weight almost too much if there is such a thing. But by the 4th shot and no really change in my work out pattern i notice the weight came back on but only in my mid section, i know this might not make sense but my pain started to come back again as well. I did notice the depression was a on going battle, up and down...etc. Listen people ask me all the time would i recommend it...and the answer would be ....i don't know, it is such a complicating shot, some people have the results THEY hoped for and others don't.

1	Endometriosis	Insane hot flashes, mood swings (aka crying for no reason every day)	I took Lupron as a last resort after, even after surgery did not provide relief, for severe endometriosis pain. I took it for 6mo. six years ago without the progesterone supplements. Although my back pain subsided during the 6 mo. my other side effects were just as bad and the pain returned as soon as I stopped the Lupron. One important thing to note is that the use of Lupron has been tied to the development of other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. My cousin and I used Lupron for endo ~6 years ago and now we have both been diagnosed with RA. We are only in our early 20's and have debilitating joint pain and she has had more health complications. I would not recomend Lupron to anyone. Natural hormone replacement has been the most effective for my endo., and 2 laporoscopies.	F	24	6  months	6/17/2008

3	Pre surgery for ablation	Extreme hot flashes and night sweets and headaches.  Recently severe chills, don't know if it related.	The cold chills started about 2 weeks ago (just after my 2nd shot) and last about 30mins to an hr, until a hot flash takes over.  I am painfully cold and can't get warm no matter what I do.  The headaches tend to be mostly at night as well.  I also had some leg pain the fist 2 weeks but it went away so I don't know if it was related either.  I have one more treatment of Lupron and then I will be very glad to be done with it.  The hot flashes and night sweets are causing a major lack of sleep and is wearing me down to the point where it is getting hard to cope.  At night there are more like an attack.  I also have type 1 diabetes and have a hard time telling a diabetic low from a hot flash which can cause, some serious problems.  I only have to have the third shot as my surgery date has been moved.  I don't think I can stand to have a 4th one if they move my date again.

3	ENDOMETRIOSIS	Hot flashes, acne, mood swings... possible weight loss inhibitor.	I just had my 3rd injection.  So far I've had several hot flashes-- not too bad though... yet?  I've been receiving accupunture to help  with the mood swings, i think i have them in check.  Just in the past  2 weeks I have been experiencing forehead and chin breakouts.  Acne was something that I've never really had a problem with... not even in my  teen years.  And, as always, weight gain is a concern.   I've been working out pretty consistently, but the scale isn't moving- up or down.I should also mention that I had a multiple myomectomy and a left ovarian cystectomy in 12/07.  My Doc removed 21 + fibroids, while discovering that I also had severe endometriosis--hence the treatment.  My doctor has prescribed a half tab of Norethindrone to help with some of the side effects.  Anyone else on this same cocktail?

I was diagnosed with endometriosis at that time.  My ovaries were left because the dr. felt I was too young to remove them.  One year later, most of my pain and symptoms had returned.  The dr. thinks this is due to my ovaries feeding more endometriosis in my pelvic wall.  I have had 4 injections of lupron and my symptoms have only gotten worse, and now I have the side effects to deal with.  Please do a lot of research and prayer before deciding to take this treatment.

ALT, AST and cholestrol were very high initially and have returned to top of normal; sugar higher and B.P. a problem too; also i'm always hungry. i've always had an aggressive daily exercise routine so i've confined weight gain to around 5# and believe exercise is key to L. management. it is certainly a little tougher to scull or cycle, but my yellow wristband is an inspiration. exercise also helps fight bone thinning - i learnt i had borderline osteoporosis readings in my spine from the baseline bone density scan. is anyone on a prescribed course other than 4-6 months and 28 months initially? i am concerned about becoming hormone refractory. i've been on effexor for 7 years for depression (strong genetic history) so can't tell whether it's helping with the sweats/mindset.

Yes the pain is gone but the side effects are horrible, The mood swings are causing so many problems in my life, the hot flashes are embarassing, the cold sweats in the middle of the night I can't bare.. Any woman reading this should take Lupron as a last resort because the side effects seriously change your life and most people will not understand or care that it's the medicine making you act the way you do.

A year after discontinuing I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis and every dr. thinks this medication triggered this disease.  My RA is VERY sensitive to changes in estrogen levels--there is a belief RA has an estrogen link as it is more common in women.  I now have 2 other auto immune diseases and have seen more than 20 dr's over 6 years at Duke, UTSW, Baylor and Northwestern.  They all agree that this med did something to my system.

Unless you are being prescribed this injection as a last resort or for something like a condition causing severe pain or a life threatening illness - i.e. something very serious - don't take this.  I read the discussions and ignored other women's warnings before I was injected - I regret my decision.  Someone mentioned feelings of insanity which I thought was ridiculous and which I dismissed but now I believe it.  I realize how important it is to consider that side effects are not always physical.  That is the case with this medication, the most serious side effect is the mental side effect.  4 months after I was injected I thought I would have a nervous break down. Everyone mentions the hot flashes.  But these aren't 'normal' hot flashes.  They are preceeded by negative feelings of dread/angst/agitation which admittably seem to be triggered by stressful situations.  But even the littlest amou	F	37	6  months	1/21/2008Email

I have had 4 op's in the last year and a half...don't think my body can cope with much more. They will remove my left ovary and fallopian tube next time. Even though my last injection was about 6 weeks ago, I',m still waiting for my periods to return...no sign as of yet.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email
1	depression/anxiety	severe muscle weakness, tremors that have yet to stop 2 months in, not sleeping, pacing		M	44	5  days5mg 1X D	9/19/2011
1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!	M	37	21  days10 1X D	2/24/2011Email
5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
