4		loss of sex drive	In the beginning, I bled for almost 2 weeks during the first 2 months. It was better during the 3rd month and now I barely even have a period, which is awesome! You have to be patient and give it 3 months. I think it's worth it. It has helped with my menstrual migraines as well. However, the worst side effect is I have no sex drive and my husband has noticed. I'm considering trying another pill but I'm afraid since this one seems so easy. It's the lowest dose of estrogen on the market which is safer for older women. It's also expensive though since there is no generic yet. I pay almost $90/month.	F	41	6  months 1X D	1/1/2013
1	birth control	So I start this pill. Bleed the entire time,gain weight,become suicidal,and end up pregnant. Take the pill every day as I was suppose to. On a lighter note after having my child I got implanon and its been WONDERFUL		F	28	2  months	12/1/2012
5	birth control	I was switched to this from regular loestrin 24 due to smoking and lower hormones. I love this pill! Never had side effects. Periods last a day. Amazing.		F	29	4  years	10/8/2012
1	Regulate menstrual Cycle	Anger, anger, did I mention anger - hungry all the time and just miserable and I am usually a "happy go lucky" girl.  Was told by the doctor to take the first day of bleeding - well i did that and have had spotting every since.  This pill is not for me - just gonna learn to deal with heavy periods and a 21 day cycle.		F	39	3  weeks 1X D	9/24/2012
3	birth control & prevent migraines	spotting if i took a pill even an hour late. this stopped after a few months.  just realized that my anxiety & paranoia started around same time as I started the pills.  around week 3 of the cycle i start to get really anxious and paranoid.  I suspect my fiance is cheating even though there's absolutely no reason, get really short tempered at work. I do not have a temper at all, but I start to get really aggrevated in week 3 and am really crabby.  I've also lost my sex drive, which in 40 years has never happened to me.	in my late 30s I started getting severe menstrual migaraines the week of my period.  i would have to call in sick every month.  These pills stopped the monthly migraines, but I have to take the pills continually and skip the "fake" pills at the end.  On other pills i wanted to eat all the time, but my appetite is ok on this pill. I get the urge to eat a lot the last week in the cycle, but I would get like that when I'm not on pills too.  I hate the anxiety/paranoia/cranky side effects, but I feel like I have to stay on this pill since it's preventing my crippling migraines.	F	40	10  months 1X D	8/15/2012Email
1	Borderline anemia - regulate period	Racing thoughts at night, waking up in the middle of the night, hot flashes, disoriented, dizziness, anxiety, painful breasts, heavy bleeding, dry mouth.	I started this medication the first day of my period with the fist dose at 8pm. That night I tossed and turned and could not stop my thoughts. I normally do not have a problem sleeping.  I also had hot flashes (never have hot flashes!) and a very very dry mouth. The next day I felt groggy and disoriented but it eventually wore off. I decided to take the pill the following night - same thing - woke up in the middle of the night with hot flashes. The next day at work I would not come out of my office because of the anxiety, my breasts were very painful and I was bleeding quite heavily - more than normal. My heart was fluttering and I felt as if I couldn't walk correctly and my mouth was dry.  I had so much water weight that by the end of the day I could not button my pants and I am not blowing this out of proportion.  By around 2pm I felt well enough to actually work. I NEVER feel like this so I can only assume it's the medication. For me it's not worth it to see if it would get better.  I would not be able to work and I don't even want to imagine feeling like that for days. If this pill makes you feel this way - do your self a favor and quit right away.  Synthetic progesterone is known to cause emotional and mental liability - you are not going crazy - it is the pill. After one day of stopping the pill all the symptoms practically vanished. I was really hoping this would have worked for me but the side effects were deal breakers.	F		2  days 1X D	8/14/2012
1	prevent pregnancy	Extreme paranoia and anxiety. Shakiness, loss of appetite. I felt crazy convincing myself I was pregnant even though it made no logical sense.		F	26	1  weeks	8/3/2012
