Pain	stacynolan81, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	7/17/2012 3:13:58 AM	I am agymnast, and a soccer pleyer. I have been very, very athletic my whole life. Recently I had been having severe neck pain, and I have a very painful buldging disk. I don't by any means take this medication on a daily or regular basis, but when the pain is to a point that it is just unbearable, and that's is even putting it very lightly. I must say in combination with my chiropractor, and a variation of hot and cold tretments to my neck; when I do need to use this medication, it definately does what it is suppose to do, and brings much needed relief! Thankyou Sincerely, Jen!

Darvocet however is a combination of propoxyphene and acetaminophen but has been pulled from the market due to cardiac issues.  WebMD, get your information straight!(Student Pharmacist)

Pain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	2/18/2009 1:34:39 PM	It doesn't seem that this medication has worked very well for my arthritis and neuropathy pain.  Still it is more effective than ibuprofen, naproxen or tylenol, all of which I've purchased at some point to deal with these pains.  All in all, I would say it is somewhat effective for milder pain, but does not go beyond that.

I took it without food, because my doctor and pharmicist stated that it couldbe taken either way, and it caused vomiting and a severe headache. I had to go to the emergency room and was treated for dehydration (due to severe vomiting) and a migraine (triggered by the medication).As long as I take it with food, I have no side effects and it works fine.
