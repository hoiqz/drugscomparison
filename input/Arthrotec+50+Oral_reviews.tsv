She had to wait a week to see a Dr. and was in much pain so she took her husband's Arthrotec that he used occasionally for gout flare-ups.  When she saw the Dr. she told them that this medication was helping with her severe pains.  So the Dr. went ahead and prescribed it to her and made her an appt. to see a specialist for bone pain. After a month or so, a specialist found that all the pain was due to a deficiency in vitamin K and she didn't have the arthritis.  Tests also revealed that her kidneys were failing and thought to be the result of taking Arthrotec for an extended period of time.  He took her off this medication immediately.  He believed that her kidneys may bounce back 3 to 6 months after being off of it.  A couple months into it and she started having nausea and other sick symptoms.  Went back to specialist at 3 months, nothing had changed.  He said wait at least 3 more months to see if any changes happened.  Here just shy of the total 6 months another primary Dr. tested her again because of her sickness symptoms and found that her kidneys are working at only 9%.  She has to start dialysis immediately, three times a week.  It is not known if she had any kidney disease before she started the Arthrotec, or if this medication was the cause of it.  Either way, she shouldn't have been taking it to begin with.

Other	seagate5, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	55-64	1/7/2012 3:35:42 PM	Physician prescribed arthrotec +/- ten days ago, addressing continued lower back pain, at five (5) months post surgical L1 - L5 Laminectomy (disc and nerve impingement). It is difficult to state whether the medication has been effective for the symptoms described. After what can only be described as less than a pleasant recovery, what still remains is 'nerve pain,' centered at the rear of upper right leg, identified to be scar tissue. In any event, it renders me imobile and interferes with sleeping patterns. Despite aggressive rehab, I have not been able to extinguish problem. Aside from the items described above, I have observed a retention of water in my ankle and feet, which does concern me. I currently take Valturna (BP meds) 1x/day, effectively controlling mild upward blood pressure levels.  Is it alarmist or reluctant to resume dosages prescribed, due to the swelling. I am pleased to obseerve that other users of ARTHROTEC have found benefits that satisfy the intent for which it was prescribed.  While the literature does mention hand/feet swelling in a precautionary statement under the SIDE EFFECT CATEGORY, it is not very high on the list. I am curious whether other users have experienced similar symptoms. Good luck to all

I call it my miracle drug. After being in constantly daily pain, stiffness difficulty standing for more than 20 mins etc, this drug instantly took the pain away.  I always take it with food and have zero side effects.  It has allowed me to return to almost totally normal activities like golf!,   Tried naproxen first which didn't help at all but this totally works for me.

It takes a few hours to kick in though, but that's okay.  I have to take it with food, there is some crapping in stomach, but bearable.  The only thing odd is I seem to start menstruating when I take the pill.  Weird.  I am having my doctor look into this to see if normal or if it is just me.

I started with one pill per day.  It took the edge off but I was still feeling discomfort.  My dosage was increased to 2 pills per day.  I have recently started to see a Pain Mgt. physician.  My dosage has been increased to 3 a day.  While it does not relieve all the pain, I am able to do limited activities.  I have Barretts esophagus due to reflux and Arthrotec has not caused any problems if I eat before I take the medication.

I recently (7 weeks ago) had total knee replacement on my right knee.  My left knee was causing me a great deal of pain (I assume compensating for the recovery of the right knee) and was getting to be intolerable.  I have only been taking it for a little over a week and the pain is greatly diminished.  I have taken may arthritis-type medications, even Vioxx and never had the relief I have from this.

I have used it off and on again for the last 5 years.  I am satisfied with the results.

It was only mildly effective with side effects including stomach pain and anxiety.  I had to stop taking it. 600mg of ibuprophen was more effective and carried no side effects.

Since I started taking this 3 yrs ago, I have been able to do more and stand the cold months.  It takes away 90% of my pain.  I can tell a big difference when I forget to take it.  Only problem is now is I have a sore stomach from this and other meds I have to take and have been told to come off it.  Personally, I'd rather have the sore stomach than the pain I have without it.
