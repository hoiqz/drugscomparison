I recently stopped the medication to see if the rash will clear up. I had reduced the dose to 100 mg after three weeks because it made me feel &quot;dingy&quot; and I couldn't think straight.

Other	Notlit, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	8/13/2010 2:29:11 PM	I had my first seizure after a car accident in 1975.  I was on anything and everything for seizures.  When we moved to Colorado in 1997 from Maryland and found a rural doctor who was quite knowledgeable of seizures he changed my meds to Tegretol and took me off of 4 other meds.  I have been seizure free for 12 years using Tegretol (brand only).  Currently using a maintenance level of 400 mg per day.  Tegretol has left me with no side effects.  Stress level is very low here in the mountains - which helped my blood pressure, anxiety, etc.

There must be an ongoing commitment of allowing the patient to understand the difference of this tegritol compared to previous tegritol without xr affixed to it.

My neurologist was a moron who would not even consider any other drug and kept me on this for yrs.  When I finally got a new neurologist we changed meds and tried several different varieties until we got it sorted as best we could.  I don't remember any side-effects but I was very traumatised when I began taking it.  As for the effectiveness - forget it.  What a complete waste of time

It was of no benefit to me at all. Even though the seizures wasn't so frequent, i still had very bad side effects which included depression, hypothyroidism, agression, irritability and hullucinations. I thought i was going mad. When i came off the drug and went on to another, i very much improved. The side effects have gone. My new drug is leaving me seizure free. I have NOT benefited from this drug. If anyone needs to go on this drug, please ask how likely are the side effects going to be in you.

Manic-Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	9/17/2009 6:10:05 PM	I've been taking it for about 2 yrs and I often have numbness in my fingers that I never had before. My docter was trying to slowly take me off the 800 mg I take, but even though I'm on 2 other mood stabilizers, the mood swings were horrible. I really want to reduce the 6 meds I take but this has proved pretty difficult to get off. I also wish it caused the drowsiness other people claim to have, because I have severe insomnia. I'm just even more thirsty, but I guess it helps keep me a little more stable.

I feel great emotionally and mentally. I did feel dizzy and sleepy when first put on rx and every time it was adjusted. Trying to decide if I should switch to Keppra and try and have another baby.

Facial Nerve Pain	buenogato, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	65-74	7/25/2009 12:31:15 PM	I was diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia 21 yrs ago. I have been on all doses &amp; types of Tregretol. I have had a microvascular decomprssion and gamma knife and other smaller proceedures. Everything worked for awhile, but the trigeminal nerves are very nervy &amp; keep coming back worse. Tegretol is now causing severe sodium loss and low blood pressure problems. Doc has lowered dose to 100mg 2x day, but wants me off all meds. Sure easy for him to say he has never felt like he was being electrocuted in the face. I have taken a plethora of other drugs for this but nothing seems to really kill all of the pain. I am now worried about the sodium &amp; blood pressure issues (I keep fainting, last time in the hosp for 5 days because of injuries). Anyone have a miracle cure??
Epileptic Seizure	 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female		7/25/2009 7:48:25 AM	I had nausea and a headache when I first began taking it, but none of the other medications either didn't stopp the seizures or I had severe size effects.

Since my brain surgery for complex partial leading to grand mal seizures, I am fully under control.  A reason some, including myself, may have seizures while on it is becoming dehydrated and causing electrolytes to become unbalanced.  Just make sure you stay hydrated and drink something like gatorade to fix that and you'll be fine.

In the beginning it was hard to say the least. Not going to lie....  Those side effect were AWFUL.  I had every last side effect, you name it I had it.. except it has never made me tired. The dry mouth was by FAR THE WORST.  If you can get through those side effects which don't last forever. Mine pretty much disapeared within a month or so...the worst ones disapearing first I must add.  I would highly recomend it for the treatment of someone trying to cope with bipolar at the end of a short rope.  I have tried ALL the bipolar meds out there in every combo you can dream up except lithium and depakote...so I've circled the block a few times and this is deff worth a try.

I had a break in use due to a switch in Ins. companies (I was off this drug for about 3 months) and I have been back on it for about 2.5 months now and I am having severe headaches, as well as the typical loss of interest in sex and lack of orgasm intensity.  I am not sure this med is working this time around? I often have dbl vision or blurred vision or I have to &quot;re-focus&quot; whenever I am trying to read things. I may have to switch meds?

After taking Tegretol (general) for about 2 years, I still have blank stare sometimes, so Doc. switched me to Tegretol XR(extended release). I am taking 200mg X3 per day. It is more effective in controlling the blank starring and gradually the zombie, lost of words and out of reality feeling were all gone by now (it's been more than 2 year now on extended release). It's well tolerable without nauseous feeling or dizziness for me. Thank God for this!

Diagnosed with multiple sclerosis since Nov. 2002, 30 lesions presently in my brain.  Trigeminal Neuralgia attack last June 2007, holding onto the front and back of my head and being rushed to the hospital with 200 over 156 blood pressure when I got there. There is no way to describe the pain, except to say a gun would have been the only relief.  In olden days called the suicide syndrome, I personally know why having experienced trigeminal neuralgia first hand.  Since taking tegretol no more attacks, thank you Lord.  I was taking every night copaxone shot, for multiple sclerosis then found out its the weakest of meds!!!  Now, I am on Tysabri once a month infusion, and no relapses since I have been on it for multiple sclerosis.

Needless to say, no more seizures either- knock on wood. I have went through pregnancy and birth while taking this drug and my son is perfect, no birth defects; although we planned the pregnancy, talked to all my doctors before hand, and started prenatal vitamins way before I even got pregnant. I have been very happy taking this medication, the ones I was on before hand didn't stop my seizures.

Tegretol did a great job of taking away the pain, but it made me stupid. I couldn't remember anything that I read, even if I read something seconds ago.  Within 4 months, I had to bump up my dossage from 200 mg twice a day to 600 mg twice a day.  I couldn't afford to be stupid and choose to have Microvascular Decompression surgery.  It's worked and I'm drug free.

Epileptic Seizure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	45-54	11/22/2008 12:42:16 PM	I have not felt myself since I was put on this a couple of months ago. I hate it. I was diagnosed with an abnormal EEG and Tegretol XL was prescribed to prevent seizures after a bowl dropped on my head in CA from a seagull (?) we think on the 3rd floor balcony. My EEG was abnormal so dr. put me on this drug. I cannot take it anymore. It makes me sick (vomiting) and really weird. I am done with it. I would rather wait till the brain injury has healed and take the chance of a seizure until then. Yes, I am scared of it, but it outweighs the side effects. I have to &quot;live&quot; my life. This drug definitely altered my brain; not in a positive way at all. That was more scary than a possible seizure. Just research this drug first, please! JMHO:)
Epileptic Seizure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/23/2008 8:06:45 PM	I've been on Tegretol XR for almost 10 years.  Has worked great.  Have had to bump up my dosage twice to combat breakthrough seizures.  Makes me feel dizzy (and stupid) for a couple weeks until my body gets used to it again.  Definitely had issues with sun exposure; just use sunscreen!  Has been nice to be seizure free.

Because, I needed so much of that medicine to get my levels right, I was totally worthless.  Beyond tired - absolutely exhausted.  It was as if I were drugged.  A year ago, my Dr. switched me to this drug (700 mils a day, taken twice a day - morning and night).  At the beginning, the medicine altered my moods and I was extremly happy.  Also, no more exhaustion.  HOWEVER, the adverse affect I experienced was a sore throat.  I had an ultrasound of my throat and lymphnodes taken and all was normal.  I'm still on this med and the sore throat has calmed down to almost extinction.  I've researched other meds and find this one (w/the exception of the sore throat) to be fitting for me because it doesn't make me sleepy, confused, etc. - I do not experience any other adverse reactions as I've read in other reviews on this matter.

I am trying to determine if the cause may have been the Tegretol XR or Lipitor or a little of both.
Epileptic Seizure	help, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	9/5/2008 7:43:13 AM	I have had epilepsy for over 20yrs. In the begining this drug was very effective I belive. But as time went by we have misscaried five babies. Found out that I have autoimune disorder. ANA, and Antipospholipits. My head is in a fog alot of the time now. I now have middle nerve left and right arm damage along with a second nerve in the left arm. Nero dr doesn't knw why. tingling the whole right side of my head both palms of my hands and pads of both my feet, radiating up both legs. Ended up in the ER latly and they thought It was all im head (crazy woman)I presented with forced speach and numbness and tingling on the whole right side. My Ochsner doctors now think I am a psych case because I am telling them my signs and sysmpoms. I am going to have to get a second opinion. Nobody wants to look at my meds as the poss. problem. After what I read today doing simple reseach I think the doctors have completly missed the boat.

Epileptic Seizure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	3	4	1	Female	45-54	8/26/2008 6:56:17 PM	Be forwarned- this prescription medication has been associated with cases of drug-induced Lupis, a serious autoimmune disorder.  I was prescribed Tegretol to treat a diagnosis of complex partial seizure. Dosage was increased multiple times to control break-through seizures.  Now also have an autoimmune disorder.  Do research before taking any drug, prescription or otherwise!

It hasn't been working for me at all. It caused my to have severe headaches, dizzy spells, lack of sleep, lack of concentraction, an increase in being confused and feeling like I'm slow, altered my hear, made me feel fusterated all of the time. I'm a college student and all this side effects made it hard for me to go my classes and to study my materials.

I think I'm more tired than I used to be.  I haven't had any seizures since I began regularly taking this medicine and I've been on it for around 9 years now.  (My seizures have been controlled and cause no problems in my life, but I may just have a calmer disorder to begin with.)

I had previously tried Dilantin, but had some adverse reactions.  I have no such problems with the Tegretol, and find it to be easy to take on a regular basis.  I have been using it now for 8 years and have had no seizures.

Manic-Depression		1	1	1			11/8/2007 5:34:18 PM	I started taking tegretol and the next day started to have double vision. I tried to wait it out, but it just got worse. I stopped and restarted the medicine to see if it would do better a second time around and it just put me to sleep. It ruined my birthday.
