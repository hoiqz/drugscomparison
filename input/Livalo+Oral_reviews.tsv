Reported this to my doctor and he cut my doseage to 2g from 4g.my next blood test showed quite an improvement.  my trigliserides went down tofrom 500 to 250. But I told him that I didnt want to take Livalo anymore  because I just wanted to get my trigliserides down and thenquit them as I was having too many strangethings happening to me.  but I was determined to try to get my Tri down.  But I still had to get down some more.  so heput me on 1g per day. I still get the painful leg and toe cramping,the cramping lasted too long, then leaving my muscles sore the next day. and now I have what looks like tiny red spots on top of my feet and toes. Looks like Petechia. and also beenhaving dreams at night that are so vivid and seem so real. this was scary. Also couldnot focus on anything, and my attention span was getting less and less. My hair is falling out and I wearing wigs now.  I am due for another test soon, and I am going to stop taking the Livalo no matter what.  I havent felt good for 10 months.  Even though Livalo was very effective in lowering my TRI.  It is not worth it to me.  I rather diet for the restof my life than to continue taking these pills.

Not sure if Livalo is the answer as I am having some muscle pain and severe fatigue. I felt much better when they took me off the beta blockers but now feel tired all the time. This morning my shoulders were aching and lower back was sore   this is new so will wait and see. I doubt there is a statin out there that is 100% free of side effects but sure would like one with minimal effects. Otherwise will have to resort to whatever else is available.

I had no bad effects except my hair was thinning. I fought with the insurance company for the next 20 days until it was approved even though I have a $25 manufacturer coupon. Taking for 2 weeks now and have bad back pain, severe headaches, toe cramps, loss of hearing, cough and loss of smell. My head feels like it is under water. I take 2mg but i will cut the pill in half and take every other day to see if that helps. I've taken every other statin known but have very severe side effects from all. My next blood work is next week.

Tried at least 5 and could not tolerate. Then was given Livalo. It started to bring my numbers down at 1mg. So Dr. increased to 2mg. Started to have problems again. My body is slow to adjust to most medication, so we went back to 1mg. for about 6 mos. Then gradually increased to 2mg every other day. I have recently started 2mg. every day. So far so good. Never thought I would get to this point. Will check numbers to see if it's helped in about 4 weeks.

It always takes about 3 months and then the symptoms start.  Joint pain, especially shuolder, elbow and wrist.  Can't sleep at night because it hurts to sleep on my shoulders.  I am also having headaches that my doctors have not been able to get rid of or explain and I am thinking it is the Livalo.  I am stopping it today so we will see if all my aches and pains go away?

Well it did lower my cholestral to 150 but it gave me such a bad case of ED that Cialis and Viagra would not work.  Then it stared with muscle pain when walking or exercising.  I quit it.  If you are a male, run from this drug!

At first a light headache for a few days.  It went away.  About 4 weeks ago started having a few foot and toe cramps a couple times a week.  Not sure if it is the livalo or not.  Will not stop taking it unless it gets a lot worse as this med. has had fewer side effects than any I have taken.  This is about my 5th or 6th.  My hair started getting thicker after I got off lipitor, it was the worse one I had taken.  I am on 2 mg. day of livalo but was on 40 mg. of lipitor.

High Cholesterol	mbrogers, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	65-74	5/6/2012 3:01:22 PM	This was the 4th cholesterol medication I've tried, and it successfully lowered my cholesterol count; but I started to have slightly elevated liver enzymes, so my doctor had me take a heart CT and found I had a calcium score of ZERO!  Apparently, this means I don't really need to lower my cholesterol;  it's not clogging my arteries.   When I stopped taking the Livalo, suddenly all my sleeping problems (trouble going to sleep; waking often in the night, unable to return to sleep) stopped and I could sleep straight through the night!   It seems Livalo was interfering with my sleep.

Felt like I was in a fog all the time and had feeling of just being ill. Stopped medication and all feelings were gone within a day or so. Previously tried all statin drugs and had muscle aches, pain, and weekness. Only drug that worked well was Baycol but they took that off the market!

I also started getting weird dreams and waking up every morning around 5:00 AM and not being able to go back to sleep. I found eating a banana every morning ended the foot cramps(low potassium levels gave me the cramp).  Being this is Sunday and the end of the 3rd week of the drug I will be calling my Doctor tomorrow.
High Cholesterol	none, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/25/2012 1:12:30 AM	I would just like to say that it would be much more helpful if people would not report about this drug until you have been on it for awhile, you went off it, and/or your blood tests are done! Also, since this drug is once per day, with or without food, how can it get less than 5-stars for Ease of Use? Don't mean to complain but it would be more helpful to report information after you have CONCLUDED if it is good or bad for you!

Could not see with naked eye send to urologist did cytoscope okay but MRI showed kidney cyst.  Told to continue on Livalo.  Lower back pain worsened finally after drug card expired checked with md. told to go off.  Pain stopped , body feels normal, but cholesterol100 points too high this was 6th statin tired of being guinea pig.  All gave terrible side effects. Can't afford all these extra bills of more specialist plus pay for meds that seem to give me more problems worried about losing insurance thru part time job.  Told doctor last two meds, she had me try last time got terrible skin reaction that itched for 6 weeks several times thru the year  several thousand dollars later for dermatologist and more meds for skin reaction.  Now urologist and gynecologist also prolapsed uterus and bladder....maybe related maybe not....not happy

It is intensified when i sleep on my right side and arm. It usually comes on at night and is intense enough to wake me up. I generally keep two advils by my bedside which generally alleviates the pain within 30 minutes.In response to this, i have cut down my dosage to 2 mg every other day. However, it doesnt seem to have an effect on the pain. Plus, i still experience weakness in my right arm. Funny because it never affects my left arm.I really dont want to quit taking this medication. As i posted a few months ago, the Livalo lowered my cholesterol greatly. Despite the problems, it has been the most tolerable for me.

High Cholesterol	Kristie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/9/2012 9:28:52 PM	I took it for one month. In about a couple weeks I started noticed sensations of coldness on my feet, as if the air conditioning were blowing directly on my feet. I also began to have trouble climbing stairs. Then I begin to feel sore sitting in a chair. I began to sleep in mornings. Finally one night, the coldness had traveled up my legs to me knees even though I had sweat pants on and it was warm inside, but legs were freezing! I quit the Livalo that night. the next day I woke up feeling bad, but decided to go to the gym and walk on the treadmill for 20 minutes. I came home, ate breakfast, and then suddenly got achey all over like I had run and marathon. I took some ibuprofen and went to bed. I called my dr. but she said to call her back in a couple days if I didn't get better. Since then, I have been having symptoms of low back pain, , intermittent aching down the back of my legs, and trouble sitting for more than 20 minutes. One doctor said it was herniated disks, so I spent several months in physical therapy. But when I wasn't getting better I saw a neurosurgeon who looked at my MRI films which showed my disks were not touching my nerves. I am now at square one, and will be seeing a rheumatologist to rule out other diseases. I am 47 and was very active, going to the gym 5x a week. It has been nearly a year, and I am still having a little soreness in my back and legs, but it seems to be improving with time. I think this drug is very scary. People need to be aware at the sign of first symptoms to quit right away!

This is the third one that's given me peripheral neuropathy. Only the the numbness has taken longer to diminish with this one. I think the new guidelines for sub 200 total are a fraud anyway. Its the HDL/ triglyceride # I'm going to focus on. Stop eating so much sugar and simple (white) carbs people, lift weights to build back muscle tone and those numbers will get in order.

No cramping, etc. but no bowel control.  3rd day did not take but feel flish and extremely weak.  Going to Dr in 2 days to talk with her.  Hurt like a truck ran over me on all Statins, don't know what I will do.  Started taking fish oil and niacin again hoping this will help.  Only have had one other experience with no bowel control and that was due to medication so do think this is a problem for me.  Stopped taking, still weak.  Someone said &quot;flu&quot; but no temp, no cramping, just weak and no bowel control along with lower back pain.  Has anyone else experienced this??  Had to answer effectiveness to post but don't know how it would work as I am not taking again.

After going on vacation in the 7th month I experienced very bad shoulder pain, and neck pain extending in the right side of my neck, which would come and go.  I have now stopped taking it and monitoring the situation to see if my neck pain will go away.  This may be my last try with Statins. I had previously tried Crestor and it was not very good because it gave me a lot of acne.

After trouble taking Zocar and Crestor I am finding similar effects with Livalo such as leg cramps, arm pain, chest discomfort (flu like aches). The fact that my insurance does not cover Livalo also really causes a strain on the budget $5 per tablet. I'm thinking Statins are not for me........

I had just started Livalo and now nearly 3 months later want to give a honest update since i have had my blood work completed.Originally i complained of muscle pain at week 4. My doctor suggested dropping the dose down to 2 mg(from 4mg). It made the difference. No more muscle pain. The fatigue has subsided also. I blame a lot of the fatigue on the high dose of a beta blocker i was taking for hypertension. We switched to a new one which probably has played a large role in my new energy.As far as results, all i can say is the Livalo has been absolutely amazing. My Total cholesterol dropped from 260 to 156 and this is only with a slight diet change. I have basically replaced large breakfasts with a bowl of cereal or a Slimfast. There have been dramatic drops in my LDL also. However, my HDL only went up about 5 points so it was not as dramatic a shift.All in all, i am estatic over the numbers. For me, its the only statin i can tolerate and has given me remarkable changes.

Also, I've been told I have a post nasal drip and I've read others have experienced sinus drainage which is most likely the same thing I am experiencing.  I have tried many meds to stop the draining and the cough to no avail.  I will now stop the Livalo and check the results.  It's actually too bad the coughing and drainage is so bad because the medication has done it's job well.
High Cholesterol	Lisa M, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	1/4/2012 5:21:28 PM	I began taking 2mg daily along with 200mg of CoQ10 at night in addition to Welchol 3.75g in the morning for high cholestrol about 6 months ago. Since both of these medications are absorbed in the stomach I was hoping for fewer side effects. Everything was fine for the first 3 months then after getting blood work done my doctor wanted to increase Livalo to 4mg since my LDL 134 was still high. Less than a week later I started experiencing severe  pain/cramps/numbness in my feet where I had problems walking and sleeping, I also noticed sharp pains in my back, neck and pelvis, all of which were symptoms that I was trying to avoid after years trying every other statin drug on the market with no luck.I was not advised to take vitiman D prior to beginning this medication like many have posted so I cant say if that may have helped, but in the mean time I'm cutting my 4mg in half and will try taking it every other day instead,unless my doctor advises me to stop.

Day or two after taking started with a migraine that would not go away.  Stopped taking med and migraine gradually went away.  Thought it might be a fluke that the migraine was going to start anyway so waited a week or two and took Livalo again and the headache came on much sooner and was much worse as well.  Not to mention the aches in my body were starting already.

The first was pravastatin which was horrible. Within one week i could barely get out of bed. I was so weak and my arms and shoulders ached nonstop. My doctor quit it and put me on Welchol. For the cost and trouble of taking it(6 large tabs a day which caused severe constipation) it did not lower my cholesterol a great deal(only about 20 points)I am now trying Livalo at the recommendation of a new doctor. I take 4 mg daily. For the first 3 weeks i was ecstatic. No side effects at all. On week 4 however i am starting to notice some troubling problems. The most severe is fatigue. So bad i struggle to stay awake through the day. I have weakness in my arms but not as severe as the pravastatin. I have also noticed more hair loss than normal.At this point i can't tell you if i will continue the medicine. My total cholesterol was 260 so i will go in for a lipid profile soon to see if its lower. For the cost of the drug, i am hoping to see remarkable results. I can say, despite the problems, it has been the easiest one for me to tolerate so far.

So I stopped taking this drug and right away things are much better and I can flex my foot with no pain. This drug is not for me.

I have never had anything like this before taking Livalo.  The pharmacy says the drug (pill) is light sensative and should be stored out of any light.  Does that mean that is why I am experiencing this side effect?  Has anyone else had this problem??

I also take Co-Q-10 and 5,000 units of Vit. D daily.  I have experienced knee pain, sinus drainage and cough, headaches daily, even migraines, and waking up during the night.  I can't say if the med has helped my triglyceride or cholesteral as yet because I haven't been on the drug for 6 weeks.  The side effects are less severe than taking Crestor and other statin drugs. I question if statin drugs are the answer?

I have fibromyalgia, so I was sure if the increase in joint/muscle pain was caused by the my condition or from the Livalo. Now I am pretty sure it is the Livalo because I am experiencing so much joint/muscle and weakness that I am finding it hard to swim or ride my stationary bike. I have been doing these things for almost 2 years. I have been feeling generally sick for the last 4 days with ongoing headaches that only subside while on pain medication. Then I suffer from stomach pain and nausea. This is not worth it!

Dr put me on 2mg and have been on it for 6 months now with no side effects and the blood works show a marked improvement.  My insurance company won't pay for this drug but I got a RX card from the Livalo company and it costs $25.00 for a month supply. For now I am very satisfied with this drug.

Not metabolized like the other statins; have no side effects at all except that it's working! If you have had problems with other statins this may work for you as it does for me!

This is the only statin I've taken that does not raise my blood sugar. I have no side effects at all. I had to stop taking every other statin due to side effects. Also every other statin caused me to have ED in addition to higher blood sugar levels. Wow, Livalo is the best!

So I had my blood checked and my cholesterol levels (bad stuff) was extremely high, so my Dr put me on Lipitor. It caused me to cramp in my legs and my joints killed me, so much that even my Fentanyl patch for my daily pain didn't touch it!I went back to see my Dr about this so he put me on Livalo 2mg daily and almost within days, no more leg &amp; back cramps or pain and after 4 months, my chest &amp; breathing is really great, no more palpitations or shortness of breath. I go back in two weeks to see how it's working on lowering the LDL levels and will post the results, but I'm sure it's doing something good with hardly any unbearable side effects, unlike Lipitor!

Weakness in general even though I am on hormone therapy. I was taken off for 30 days and then put on 1 mg where after 30 days, I am feeling tired and my joints in my feet and hands hurt. My skin also feels flushed. Am determined to stay on for nex 90 days and see how my liver handles it. The drug has lowered my cholesterol to normal level however I don't know if the pain and discomfort is worth it.

I have tried several other cholesterol meds but nothing worked and I had extreme joint pain while on the other meds.  After one month, my cholesterol dropped from 260 to 140.  My tri dropped from 390 to 240.  My dr also had me take 5000 units of Vitamin D one week prior to starting the Livalo and continuing for two weeks after I started the Livalo.  He said this would keep the joint pain away.  Something worked....no pain whatsoever.  This drug is great.  I highly recommend it.

Now my doctor prescribed Androgel for low testosterone levels. Then I read cholestrol drugs cause major testosterone problems. Honestly I would rather die of a heart attack then have to keep taking this medicine!

Before starting it, my Tri was 390 and my cholesterol was 260.  After six weeks my Tri is 190 and my cholesterol is 140.  I have had absolutely no side effects from this drug. My doctor did put me on 5000 units of vitamin six weeks before I started it but stopped it today at my six week checkup.  He said the vitamin D is supposed to help alleviate the pain often associated with the pain side affect of cholesterol lowering drugs.  So happy with my new readings.

It seemed to affect my emotional state and my legs. Stopped taking it and the dr told me to take 1mg 3 times/wk of Livalo only. It really affected my emotions. I cried a lot and was not very nice to my husband. He knew every time I took it. I stopped 4 days ago and have noticed a difference already. Has any one else had this problem? What to do now?? Crestor was the very worst.

I took it for 9 days and each evening I experienced electrical movements in my body, mostly in my chest, arms and back.  Then the pain began and it was excruciating in my arms, shoulders back and neck.  I noticed my urine smelling like sulphur.  I am still in a lot of pain and don't know what to expect.  I question if my doctor studied my other medications prior to giving me samples to take.  I have not been able to function normally due to so much pain in my muscles and chilling.  I took the pill for only 9 days, 2mg, at dinner time.  I stopped taking Livalo and yet the pain continues even though it has been weeks since I stopped taking Livalo. Has it left me with permant muscle damage?

Tired of feeling sick and the rash is quite embarassing.
High Cholesterol	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	45-54	2/11/2011 1:17:57 AM	I am a returning reviewer. I was on Livola for 7 weeks with seemingly no side effects. I stopped taking it a while ago.  It just happened that for most of the seven weeks I was on Livalo, I had stopped going to the gym. When I restarted, I was horrified by the condition I was in. I could hardly run. Never felt like this my entire life. I have had longer lapses in my exercise regimen and never experienced such outcome. Let me be clear. Livalo works! It lowered my LDL substantially. However, the loss of muscle coordination I experienced was enough to make me stop. If you are on Livalo, it may be a good idea to keep an active life style and pay attention to changes in muscle condition/coordination during moderate activity. I don't have any other risk factors than high LDL. Perhaps it's an easy decision for me to stop. If you have multiple risk factors, consult your physician before stopping your medication. As for me, I will take a less evasive route to keeping healthy.

I had a headache for the first few days but it quit.  My Dr. put me on the 2mg pills, they have less side effects.  So far so good, but I haven't had my blood work done yet.  I did find out if you don't have insurance, you can get a card from livalo so you only have to pay $25.00 per month.  That works for me! Plus no really bad side effect like I had with crestor, lipitor, welchol, and prevastantin.  This may be a keeper!

After the third I was having muscle aches, my urinary tract felt uncomfortable when I urinated.  I get a metallic taste in my mouth that I have heard no one else mention.  I also thought I was coming down with a cold, but I read nasopharyngitis is a symptom also.  I stayed off it 3 days and took one more.  The aches came back and the cold symptoms got worse and the urinary discomfort came back.  I don't think I will be able to tolerate this statin anymore than the others.  I have taken it for 3 days, off for 3 days and took a 4th pill on day 7.  I skipped tonight.

Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	Painful Pat, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	8/19/2010 5:29:00 PM	After 3 days on this medicine I developed extreme pain in my body, (elevating at bedtime, when I lay down, the pain is throbbing severely) I then started getting headaches, and extreme sore throat.  Lately, the severe pain has been in my kidneys and lower back.  I take Hyaluronic Acid that helps the pain tremendously.  If I miss a dose, the pain is unbearable.  I will call my doctor to report the pain and side effects.  Not what I want to take for long term. After 2 days off the medicine, I don't hurt so bad. I have tried every other day and every 2 days, but the pain and headache is still a problem.

My blood pressure is in the normal range for the first time in 4 years! It &quot;may&quot; be responsible for my waking after 3 hours of sleep and then having trouble getting back to sleep. Not sure about this yet!!
