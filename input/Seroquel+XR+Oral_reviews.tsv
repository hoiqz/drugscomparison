Bipolar Depression	Julie B, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	5/31/2012 12:01:54 AM	I have been on this medication for about 3 months. I started at 50 mg. daily &amp; I am now at 300 mg. I think it's starting to help with my depression, although it could be because my dr. also increased my Prozac from 20 mg. daily, up to 40 mg. I am extremely unhappy with the side effects I have experienced while taking Seroquel XR. I frequently feel very tired for most of the day, &amp; I have gained 20 lbs! I was already overweight, so this is not good at all.

I also take Wellbutrin. I took it at night and it has consistently made me so dizzy about half an hour after taking it that I have to sit or lay down to avoid passing out. This was fine, because I take it at bedtime and it knocks me out. It has also made me want to eat EVERYTHING in sight, which is making me gain weight.I read that other people's dreams have improved, but I have vivid NIGHTMARES more than 9 times out of 10. Lately I have been feeling more and more anxious, so my psychiatrist agreed that I should try switching to Zoloft. Hoping to have improved anxiety and dreams, normal appetite, and no dizziness. Also I have night sweats that I hope will subside.
Bipolar Depression	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	65-74	5/26/2012 10:26:39 AM	I take effexor 150 mg.  But I am experiencing excessive sweating of the head and increased heart beats.  I already had the rhythum problem with my heart but now one of the medications has side effects that are increasing some of my underlying symptoms.  Cannot stand the sweating issues.
Bipolar Depression	RLC, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	4	Male	55-64	5/20/2012 4:20:05 PM	I like Seroquel. I am at a low dosage and also taking Trazadone. After two + yrs. only negative side effects are can't lose weight although I eat like a bird and exercise. Dreams are wonderfully lucid, generally not scary but incredible in visuals and all the characters. I look forward to going to sleep, its like stepping into a fantasy world. Smooths out my day. Not so angry anymore. Caution w/ alcohol. I have had the droppsies. Loss of muscle control in hands. This can become permanant. No libido +(ED) but I think its the Prozac mainly doing that. Would like to hear reports from other males. I'm a youngster just entered the sixth decade of life. I wish you all the best and good luck with your journey!

Mental Disorder with Loss of Normal Personality &amp;amp; Reality	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	4/16/2012 11:43:55 PM	At the very beginning of taking this on day one through bout a week I felt scared and I couldnt breathe, I was dizzy and couldnt hardly walk without feeling like I was going to fall.  I felt out of body and I can best describe it as what I would think having the lethal injection feels like.  I had rapid heart rate.  After taking it for a while it helped me with constant mind racing and with insomnia.  But the biggest downfall with this medication is severe weight gain and appetite increase.  I fall asleep fast but still get up in the middle of the night to eat.  I spilled a bowl of cereal in my lap in the middle of the night a few days ago. I gained 5 pounds in less than a month.  I have takin this medicine for 3 months and as of yesterday the only side effects were eating wayyyy to much and a lil spacey at times.  Well because of my eating habits I asked my doc. for a different medicine that didnt have weight gain.  She gave me GEODON.  Tonights my first night and I'm scared because the reviews are horrid.  I prayed to my lord Jesus, and all will be well.  Seroquel Is a great medicine though.

Bipolar Depression	NatBrat, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	13-18	3/30/2012 6:14:16 PM	Seroquel XR I just started it and I'm in school and might have a new job part time at night and it is making me want to sleep more than anyone should. I have missed a week of school because of it, I called my doctor and he told me I haven't been on it long enough and if it;s not better in 3 or 4 days to call them back. To me this is a problem because I am missing school which effects my grades which may lead to me being repeater again. I need some peoples advice and experince on how it effected ya'll in the beginning and I started at 50 Mg and now I'm working my way up to 150, but on top of this I also take an anti seizure med that also makes me some what tired. Please I'm on 18 and still in high school. I need some help.
Schizophrenia	Jenyx, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	3/19/2012 9:06:12 AM	Was originally on 50mg of normal Seroquel but was switched to the slow release due to sleeping so much. Still sleepy but this has improved. Currently been a month on these and have been noticing for the past few days, on and off, that my heart is hurting, having chest pain and heart palpitations with dizziness. I was suffering with this before taking it (except dizziness), but now I'm constantly worrying about my heart, and I had no idea this could actually be the cause for this. I also told my doctor about my heart problems but apparently health doesn't matter to these people as long as you're on something. Will be contacting my doctor soon to try something else.
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	Be of good cheer!, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	3/15/2012 10:28:56 AM	Seroquel XR has helped partially alleviate some of my various side effects due to the taking of certain medications which can be often as bad or worse than the disorder being treated. These are the one's for which I've had some relief by taking Seroquel XR 200mg 2 to 3 hours before bedtime: anxiety, insomnia, &amp; psychosis. I firmly believe getting enough sleep each night on a regular basis is one of the best strategies for avoiding mental health crises along with proper diet and exercise routines. Doing things for others can often be therapeutic in his/her own health situations! I've had biploar 1 disorder since ~ 14 and I'm now 54 - by the grace of God, His mercy, and Providence am I still alive as likewise all other humans. Have a good day!

I no longer get so depressed that I want to hurt myself or others, and I am enjoying life more than I have in 30 years.  I feel perfectly &quot;normal&quot; on this medication and credit it for saving my life.

Problem is I sleep for many hours and feel like a zombie when I am awake. I wake up with dried blood around my mouth every morning. I still have mood swings and anxiety (with racing heart beat) and a bit of depression but the benifits outweigh the alternative to not taking this medication. I take 400 Mg once a day every evening. I also take an anxiety med and benedryl med everyday. Just wish I could function better physically when taking this medication.

I am aware that I am taking a very low dose, but as my doctor says,&quot;go slow, go low&quot; and it helps me get a full nights rest and hieghtens my awareness and functionality greatly. As weight gain is not an issue for me, it actually allows me to keep weight on. It also has the effect of calming my stomach, which was a problem and side effect of my hiv medicine.

Before taking this medication I was losing my battle ridiculously. I had problems dealing with everyday life the way &quot;normal&quot; (and I use that word loosely) people take for granted. I was suffering within myself and no one understood me. Many people don't know what it's like hearing voices, seeing things that aren't there and having mood swings beyond my control. With this medication I go my life back. I was able to get my bachelors degree and work in the medical field. I have to say that this medication along with my Celexa has definately changed my life for the better! I have had no side effects. I have tried many different medications given by my doctor throughout my jouney with this illness. This medication is the best by far and I really think that it has changed my life for the better.

Bipolar Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	12/1/2011 10:12:28 AM	This drug has changed my life.  I have been taking Seroquel XR for 7 months now and I am feeling better than I have in years.  I have had no side effects from this drug.  I am able to get a good nights sleep without my mind reeling about what I did and didn't get accomplished in my work day and worrying about the next work day.  I have not had the urge to 'light' into people like I did prior to the medication and believe I am genuinally a better person.  Thankfully, I have insurance that covers the medication entirely and feel for those that this medication is helping but are unable to afford the expense of it.  I just can't say enough positive things about it.

As for its effectivness I find that it helps me sleep and I believe that alone has made a difference in my moods. I am still have issues with my outburts and mood swings that I am addressing with my doctors and other professionals. I do believe Seroquel is helping but am still unsure as to what degree.

I've had some weight gain, starting a diet/exercise regimen hopefully that will combat it.  A few side effects but nothing that even comes close to the Bipolar depression, so I'm dealing.  Taking with 300mg Lamictal as well.

I take one tab at night with Restoril 30mg and Lamictal because Serequol also acts as an excellent sleep aid for insomnia which I also have. Serequol leaves me calm at night and puts me to sleep naturally. It has eliminated my endless nights of laying awake at night fighting to go to sleep. It really has help me to improve my mental health and improving my outlook on life. Very effective.

My husband and I have not noticed any difference, other than that I am having too many side effects.  I am currently being slowly tapered off of it by my doctor.  It has been agreed--by my husband, doctor, and I--that I will not be put on another bipolar medication; I will be put on an antidepressant since depression is the biggest factor in my Bipolar II.  And, it will be a minimum of two months before a decision is made to put me back on any medication for depression.

My suicidal thoughts have virtually disappeared, however I am horribly lethargic and sleepy. I have become anti-social and overly tranquil feeling. I used to have drive in life and for life and now I feel like a zombie and I'm unable to be enthused by anything. Word to the wise: DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL WITH THIS MED! It will make you really weird and then very sick.

Started off with 50mg for two days, then 150mg for two days and today it's 150mg. Nothing really affected me with this medication until tonight. I am feeling heavy and sluggish but very calm. I see that some of you have been up to 800mg...that's a lot of medication I say...I am so hoping this medicine along with my Celexa will help me. I am so tired of being irritated and angry with everything. My husband and kids do not understand what I am struggling with, nor do they try.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	6/26/2011 3:33:17 PM	This medicine really helps out my horrible mood swings. And recently I was taken from 300 mg to 400 mg. I do see the 400 mg helping me a lot more than the 300 mg. I feel a lot calmer and not so agitated BUT in a matter of two weeks I have noticed how I can't stop eating, I am constantly hungry, I am beginning to gain weight and I can't barely fit into my pants anymore. I decided as much as I want to feel better, I cannot afford to gain weight like this so I am going to contact my doctor immediately and figure out what to do. It's a shame cuz I like the way this medicine makes me feel but I am already overweight and do not want to become terribly obese. I feel like no medicine is ever going to help at this rate cuz either it makes me gain weight or it just doesn't work.

My rage and rapid thoughts do not consume me anymore! Befor Seroquel I was abusive to my husband, couldn't control my eratic thoughts, was verbably abusive. And once I was in a rage, it was very hard for me to come out of it! Now my thought process has slowed down ( I don't have 15 thoughts at one time) I no longer get abusive! It now takes me alot longer to anger, and if I do get upset it doesn't last for long. I know that if I was not on this medication I would have lost my husband and pushed my children farthur away from me.The weight gain has been a plus for me since befor I could never get my weight over a 100 lbs and now I am finally a healthy 120 lbs. This medication has givin me a healthy and happy life. I never want to go back to the way I was!!

Before taking this medication I was suicidal and every emotion was a freakin tsunami. Now they are just normal waves.

She had not broken any bones but does need some rehab as she was unable to use her walker due to her injury. She is 91 yrs. old and has very mild dementia. She always knows who her family is, is an avid reader of the newspaper and can discuss topics with you, she just asks the same questions quite often. She's had some trouble sleeping at night and after Ambien had failed to work her doctor prescribed Seroquel XR. We immediately noticed a change in her. She was very groggy and would hardly stay awake. When she was awake she was responsive to conversation but also very &quot;zoned out.&quot; My mother had requested this medication to be discontinued after consulting with my uncle who is a physician. He is strongly against the use of this medication in elderly patients with dementia. One side effect listed is death in patients with dementia! She has now been admitted to a rehab facility for 2 days and we have been very concerned as she will hardly wake when speaking to her and has absolutely no appetite. I was sitting with her this evening and noticed she had been sweating. This is very rare as she is extremely cold natured. We have found in fact the Seroquel XR had NOT been discontinued and we are EXTREMELY FURIOUS! Although my grandmother is up in age and had an incident I STRONGLY believe this medication is the culprit in her recent behavior. I would urge anyone to challenge the use of this medication for a loved one with dementia.

Dr had me titrate up to 300MG 6 weeks ago on this.  I thought it was working but, I now find myself ANGRY with a hard time falling asleep and a hard time waking.  I am irritable ALL the time and if not irritable than crying. Plus, am on weightwatchers watching myself gain weight even while keeping with the diet.  Going to have to talk with DR to see about change.  My apt cannot get here fast enough!!!!

Bipolar Depression	pt barnum, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	4/21/2011 10:35:30 AM	I started taking this medication last may.  It slowed me down quite a bit but I had more motivation to do things that I have not had in years of battling severe depression.  I went off of it last October because I had gained 15 pounds and couldn't deal with that.  I think I was on a dose that was too high for me.  Taking 300mg a day.  I loved that it helped me get to sleep and stay asleep.  Side effect other than weight gain was restless legs at night.  That was a tough one to deal with.  Overall, I think this was a good medication but too much for me.  Am doing much much better now off of it but many things in my life have gotten better....

I was taking Welbutrin and it work. I was put on 50 mg and the next day I felt completly differant (good). I've been on it for less than a week. I hope it lasts and I hope I don't gain 25 lbs. So far it's been a life saver for me!

I'm back to being the motivated, rested, and productive person I lost.  I was hesitant to take the medication at first because of the 'sleeping pill' aspect of it, however I had no idea how much sleep I was NOT getting prior to this pill.  Now I jump out of bed in the morning ready to start the day instead of dread the events that are to come.

I took it for many months and because of the sedative effects there are months of my life that I cannot even remember. I discontinued the med. I now started taking Seroquel XR in January and I have gained 30 pounds. I also experience a good amount of constipation. However, this medication helps me sleep through the night and put a damper on the voices in my head. However, because of this I am a little emotionally stunted. I take 150mg at 6pm, fall asleep between 9-10 and by 7:30-8am I'm ready to get up.

But could not afford it without Astra-Zeneca's paying for it. After you pay 3% of your annual income on Rx's they will give it to you for free. It cost me $1379 for a 30-day supply during donut hole. I've been taking 5x 200 mg per day. It has worked well.If you qualify for extra-help on Medicaire it is around $50 mo.
Other	psyquestor, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	35-44	3/14/2011 10:37:07 AM	My physician prescribed this medication to help me sleep and to assist in the treatment of depression. I was reluctant to try it, but it did seem to help me sleep better, although I had horrible vivid dreams. After being on this medication for nine days, I stopped taking it due to an increase in migraine headaches. In the four months prior, I had 2 migraines. In the nine days on seroquel, I had four migraines. I am good at avoiding triggers, but was unable to stave off migraines while taking this medication. I was on a very low dose (50mg once daily at night). I would not recommend this medication for those without insurance coverage or who experience migraine headaches.

I spoke to him some time ago and stated I felt there was potential for weight gain and he assured me it was not so.  I have since been informed that weight gain is highly likely.  My next visit to him is somewhat in the future, so I will contact my medical doctor to see if he can prescribe something for the insomnia. Afterwhich I will stop taking the seroquel.  I have had knee replacement surgery on both knees and was doing much better before the weight gain.  I will begin a water zumbia class the twenty sixth of March.  I am very uncomfortable with the added garth as well do not appreciate not fitting into my clothes and having to buy more.

Bipolar Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	12/29/2010 8:27:02 PM	Well.. I started taking seroquel at the tender age of 13 after a series of medication trials and failures. It has at the very least kept me from going off the deep end.. I do know that when I haven't been able to afford the $478 (and rising all the time) for a 30 day supply of 150mg daily I feel the effects of not having it- i get depressed, cannot focus at all, angry at everything, fidgety, restless- cannot sleep at night at all. When I'm on it I mostly feel foggy, my memory has declined significantly since taking it (no other reason sticks out as to why). It has contributed to many small failures in my professional life, but I know I wouldn't be alive to hold a job without SOME meds. I take in conjunction with Wellbutrin- it has been a good combo for me, but no cure all. I've had weight gain, tremors, constant constipation.. I cannot keep focused enough to finish sentences in many cases and it's extremely embarrassing to look like a fool like that. I would recommend this medication to those who haven't and need to try something because it's been better than nothing and it has generally contributed to a better quality of life for me. Now if only I could rid myself of the life sentence that is bipolar disorder. I really worry about the long term effects (diabetes is probably not fun).

The shakes and side effects from the Lithium was a million times what I now experience with the Serequel XR.  When the doctor first prescribed it as a replacement, I resisted at first because of the extreme drowsiness and sleepy hangover that the regular Serequel had caused me when I was once prescibed it.  However, the XR has a whole different efffect on me.  It has been so much more manageable than the Lithium with next to no side effects.  I take it 1-2 hours before I need to go to bed and wake with a clear head.  It has helped the mania like never before - I used to have days that I would not leave the house so not to interact with people, that is rare now.  I really like this drug, and it has been a life saver for me.  It may have been difficult to adjust to at the beginning, I honestly don't remember - but if so, work with your dr. to find the right dose - once that happens, it is so worth the work.

This drug caused intense, scary visual and auditory hallucinations, nightmares, significant weight gain, increase in mammary size, and anti-social tendencies. Before you freak out about my credibility, prior to becoming bipolar, I was a practicing psychologist, family therapist, a university professor, (Psych) and socially well-adjusted. I am also taking, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Lorazepan, and Temazapan. In the last two weeks, I quit smoking, and quit Seroquel. The hallucinations have stopped, the voices have stopped and I feel more at ease. The medical model of mental health is really a no-win situation. One brief example that reminded me of the frustration of long-term self-medication; I had a bone spur on my elbow and waited 2 months before seeing my family doctor, I didn't want to take any additional medication. Well, I had it bass-ackwards. After 3 DAYS! on Diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory, my elbow stopped hurting. After 3 YEARS on the aforementioned meds, I still get depressed. All the literature states that these meds will restore the &quot;deficiency&quot; of neurotransmitters and encourages you to keep on taking them. Well, where's the cure? Look at the  list to the left, there's 25 meds for depression. How did the neurotransmitters become depleted, that's my question. I am beginning to realize that being depressed is depressing. Maybe we should allow ourselves to feel anxiety in manageable doses and work through it, instead of sedating our more painful emotions. That's what I'm going to try. Wish me luck. Peace. MK-ULTRA

I do have anxiety and some panic.  It works great for me. I am a 49yr old female and it has even helped my hot flashes  Though It takes about 2 hours to kick in for sleep.  I sleep so deeply and I can even sleep 8-12 hrs.  I do have twitching in my legs.  It also feels like bubbling in my legs.  No pain though.  I have gained 25lbs and not been able to take it off.  I am able to have an orgasm though it takes longer to achieve. I am on 100mg and I started cutting pills in half to try and stop.  Not a great idea, I am now back to not sleeping and I am contimplating starting the 100mg back.  I also have a headache, and my hot flashes are back.  So, I guess I will have to be overweight and at least be a good sleeper.  I also think I took sertraline with this, and the two were a good combo also. It seemed to keep me from being hungry.

It has caused my panic to flair up more and can't seem to stay awake. My moods are up and down so much  of the time. My skin feels like it has bugs crawling on it. While on it, I'm scared to leave my house and,I have lost all interest in everything. It has affected my eye's and now I'm borderline diabetic. I hate the overall feeling when I'm on it. 
Bipolar Depression	Poncho, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/31/2010 3:48:04 AM	Taken 1 year to work up to 400mg. Adjusted quarterly. I am more self aware of my behavior and feel much more stable. I have to be careful when I get up from a sit down or laying down position because I get really dizzy and weak. My legs buckle from under me.It has made me more confident in my interaction with others. On occasion I feel my speech is slurred and just have to compose myself and actively speak clearly. It has also helped with intrusive thoughts (uncomfortable thoughts I could not get out of my head). I enjoy the peace of mind seroquel has brought me. I feel empowered emotionally and intellectually.  On occassion I have slept for a 24 hour period because of difficulty getting up or &quot;waking&quot; up. But overall, the benefits have outweighed the negative substantially.

Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	5/4/2010 2:05:01 PM	It took 4 weeks to work up to 400mg a day.  The sleepiness was dreadful but did improve significantly after the second to third week.  I had the feeling like I was coming unglued, jittery if I took it too early in the evening. It made for restless sleep but did improve with time.  I still experience a dry mouth (especially first thing in the morning), constipation and stuffy nose.  The weight gain is starting... 7 lbs so far.  I should be able to manage it by keeping tabs on my diet.  The increase in prolactin has given me larger breasts.  Occasional feeling of numbness on top of my hands and forearms.  I'm more relaxed, patient, less quick to anger, feeling fairly stable.

I take it at 9 and go to sleep around 11 every night. The key is not eating at night. If you eat it slows down the extended release and leaves it in your system too long and you can't wake up and feel groggy.

Lowered immunity increases supseptability to allergies, apnea, illness, DECREASES energy sustanability, restfull sleep required for healing, oxygen in blood stream required for; thinking(rationally), healing, being productive, exorcise or any activity. Emotional function goes from muted at best (can be non-existent/ &quot;flat-faced&quot;, un-opinionated with delayed/slowed introspection to extrapolation, disinterested, un-involved, goal-less, uncommunacative with self and others, mechanical),  to balancing dotted with episodes of physical and/or emotional anxiety, panic attacks when pushed by self or others, even in safe senarios,can become agrophobic at times, or suddenly severly depressed and crying, uncontrollably sobbing while attempting to rationalize random unfounded reaction, thinking, problem solving becomes more clear, cognitive exercises and games help, almost as though reprograming an old computer, patience for there will be frustration, doubt and hope, fear and delight over progress. Breathing, anti-anxiety, and life skill training techniques, diet, exercise (esp. cardio), monitored nutrition, sun daily, improving sleep habits are all good tools. I wish you the best! 
Other	passyaova, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/1/2010 6:38:13 AM	my girl was put on a combination of three meds that were not ment to be mixed, two were o.d. for her body weight, the third made her loose weight and not digest anything eaten, after taking herself off the medications cold turkey, she began to hallucinate, became dellusional, thinking she could fly, and agreed to sign into the state mental health hospital, where instead of helping her detox they manipulated her into taking 50 mg. of Seroquel XR with promises to release her if she complied (3 months later). She was then promised freedom if she took a higher dose, and the medicine that had previously caused her organs to begin shutting down, all while she was not able to make logical, rational, healthy decissions for herself. Topamax was elliminated finally after projectile deficating undigested food and developing severe bleeding hemroids again in three daily doses. It has taken her two years to regain some appetite, after weaning herself off of 200 mg. in 6 months, her sleep patterns have been nearly reversed, memory loss, speech/language problems, bodyaches, fatigue, lack of interest, no prefrences, have been replaced over this time with random bouts of crying, wailing (she says feel like un-founded depression; without the circumstances/thoughts), or irrational paranoia and panic attacks, which have grown further apart. sucidal ideation, irregular functioning, and a fear of never being her &quot;normal&quot; self again. She used to be an intern in Architecture, an A+ Arcithecture College student with dreams, now she doesn't know if she'll ever be fit again to work, declared disabled by the Gov. agency that made her this way. All I believe a severe lack of judgement, and misdiagnosis of her origional symptoms of panic attacks due to being over stressed. The FDA doen't charge 80,000,000$ per new pill aproval for not, about 50%+ of the other inpatients with her in the hospital were on the same stuff for any number of symptoms. she said it was that seasons flavor for the &quot;lucky&quot;

That is how the head of the ward at the Rockyview hospital works. He gets someone else to do the diagnosis then over doses on meds. I also had severe PTSD over a home burning down and then 6 months later losing my job and the house I had purchased and everything I owned. This was not considered important and not addressed. So, the value of this med to me is based on major misdiagnosis. I had no remission of depression and no help with sleeping. I not only had no help with depression it got worse. I could not move my neck anymore. I was told this did not matter. I could no longer reason well and, as a Systems Analyst, it was critical that I be able to think. This did not matter either. I was taken off Seroquel cold turkey and thought I was going to die though this had happened with Effexor too.I believe we are all guinea pigs. I trust my GP more to know what is going on but I have to have a psychiatrist to get my paperwork done for early retirement and nothing to show for a life of hard work.

Been up to 300mg but sleep too much.  Kept on reducing until sleep was regular.  Go to bed same time every night.  Dark cool room. Sleep 6-7 uninterupted hours.  If taking just for sleep, take least amount possible for benefit.  Dose 2 hours before bed time.  Relax.  Must become habit to go to bed at the same time every night.  No morning hangover if dose is small enough.  Do not confuse passing out from too much medication with slowly falling asleep at proper dosage.  Dry mouth only side effect, no weight gain.

I tried to kill myself by swallowing my moms adivan. I went almost a year drinking and doing drugs. When I got pregnant with my daughter. I gave up everything. Now that I'm not doing anything all I do is think. So all I was doing was remembering the day my mom died. I was the only one home with her when she died. I started to blame myself because I didnt stay awake for 15 more minutes. That way I could have done something. That way I could tell myself I tried something. When I got put on these meds (effexor xr, seroquel and xanax) my mind doesnt wonder. I don't dwell on things anymore. I've learned how to except my moms death as not my fault. I also learned how to change my thinking when I start to think about things that I might have done wrong but didn't know if I really did. I'm sorry I wrote so much. I just thought you would like to hear the whole story. That way you could understand why I have the problems I do.Thank You,Miss. Wendy Frank

It has helped my depression and bipolar episods, but I have gained alot of weight and I think I am addicted since I take it at night and I can't get to sleep without it--I almost panic when I run out. It makes me sleep very sound and it is hard to get up the next day. Other than the weight and the sleeping--my moods have greatly improved, the only reason I am staying on it.

Bipolar Depression	littlelee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	12/2/2009 7:08:30 PM	I was on regular Seroquel for about 2 yrs, that didnt help. So yrs later Im now on Seroquel XR. I have been on it for about a year now and within this year I have gained 76lbs., which makes me more depressed. My daughter tells me to say that Im pregnant, which Im not but thats how big I got, I was 130-135, so you can see how this is affecting me. Oh and the shakes, I have to use two hands to be able to have a cup of coffee, when I eat my hand shakes so bad that half my food falls off the fork. If I bend over my legs shake so bad I am afraid of falling, so I have to sit down. So the shakes are so bad that its like having Parkinsons Disease. I have discussed this with my Dr, and he upped the dose to 400 mg. As one of the other reviews said, may as well crawl in a hole and wait for some miracle to come along.

I am thinking about going off this medication (gradually, and in consultation with my psychiatrist) at some point, and am concerned about the withdrawal that I have read about in some other reviews on here and on various other websites.  I am not sure that I would have gone on this medication if I knew that it could cause withdrawal after going off it.  I am concerned for my ability to work and function in general if I experience withdrawal after going off Seroquel.

I have experienced weight gain of 9 lbs. and have not been able to keep it off.  I gained some weight on a previous medication and had wanted to lose that weight as well, but have not been able to get back down to my original weight, pre-bipolar meds.  I believe this weight gain may have aggravated an old knee injury from a few years ago.  This drug often makes it hard to stay alert during the daytime.  I'm experiencing some thinning hair around my hairline above my forehead, and wondering if it is from this drug.  Am also concerned about possibility of developing Type II Diabetes because of this drug.

The weight gain on Seroquel is unbearable for me even though the medication is effective for treating my manic episodes and insomnia.  I'd almost prefer the mania to the weight gain though. Also, possible hypoglycemia, tardive dyskenisia, and potassium disruption in the heart cause me to question whether I should take Seroquel.

This has helped me to sleep like you wouldn't believe. No more midnight cleaning episodes! I have diabetes and my sugars are slightly up but I can live with that if it means my bipolar is under control. I am trying harder to watch what I eat and exercise more, I have gained a few kilos but nothing scary. And again, I can handle gaining a few if my moods are ok. I still have slight ups and downs but nothing that I can't handle with a bit of downtime and some me time. I am now on seroquel xr 400mg to see how I go...am a little anxious that I won't be able to sleep but will have to wait and see how I go. I am hopeful that it will help to really even me out and I can get on with living life. :)

I was severly depressed for most of 12 years before my doctor gave Seroquil a try.  Within a month I was feeling much better and was able to get off the numerous other meds I was taking - including a very heavy sleeping pill that didn't work a lot of the time.  I take a total of 600 mg before supper along with Lamictol and Rivotril.  My only problem with Seroquil is the weight I have gained because of it.  But all in all it has been a savoir for me after being in such a dark place for so many years.

My doctor recently added Seroquel XL (300 mg) to my reqular Seroquel dose.  Although Seroquel has been the best anti-depressant for me so far, I find myself stuttering.  Has anyone else experienced this as a side-effect?

It has been hard on me due to leg pains. It keeps me up and in pain until I just cant take it anymore. However, I do sleep better on it then without it. I still have pain in my legs for about 3 hours after I take it but it is not as bad as it was when I first started it. As for treating my condition, I have been on so many different meds that I feel this one have worked better then the rest. It has helped my mood swings. I don't have as many manic attacks however they are still there at times.

I tend to get manic and unable to sleep.  The lower dose is the best.  It's important to stay on it even though the first few days are a bit rough meaning &quot;grogginess.&quot;

At first I had severe dry mouth and kept drinking lots of water, however chewing gum and having hard candy around helps more. I did &quot;break through&quot; the lower dose of Seroquel and had a manic episode. My doctor increased the medication and we closely monitor this dose.

Bipolar Depression	beccaflight9, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/4/2008 1:44:18 PM	I use seroquel at night (300) mg and it helps me to sleep and to feel less anxiety in the morning hours.  It is a possibly dangerous drug to take and I had to have cataract surgery which, I believe, caused the condition.  Also weight gain is definately an issue. But, weighing in the odds, I think I would choose Serouel time release as a good treatment for bipolar symptoms in general.
