Skin Ulcer	relieved!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/27/2012 12:16:50 PM	I was prescribed this medication by my dermatologist about two years ago for a condition called pyoderma gengrenosum. My wounds had been open for two years and steroids weren't working. When I started to use this medication it burned a little at first but after one week of use, my ulcers were completely closed.

The doctors told my mother that I would need a skin graph but gave her Silvadene to put on my arm 3 times a day.  Not only did I not have to undergo a skin graph, the wounds healed completely and the scar left behid is flat and smooth.  You would not know that I had a 3rd degree burn!
An Infection in a Burn Wound	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/25/2011 5:27:48 PM	While lighting my &quot;smoker&quot; the top door was caught by a gust of wind, causing it to quickly close. My hand and extended lighter were in the bottom, so the &quot;backdraft&quot; burned 90% of my hand, plus hairline and eyelashes. This was a Saturday and I had guests coming over so I covered hand with Aloe Vera Burn Gel and went about my day. On Monday, my hand looked pretty bad so I went to the Dr. She gave me the SSD cream to help heal and prevent infection, but it was thought I would have severe scarring. Well, the cream cooled and calmed my burn. It healed very quickly (much quicker than expected) and I have no visible scars. I am now getting through a bout of 3weeks severe chicken pox. The pox themselves are &quot;healing&quot; but it and the calamine lotion and caused severe drying and rashing of my skin. It is itchy and painful. Though I am on antiobiotics and other meds, I am going to try to apply SSD to a small area to see if I have a reaction or get releif... I have faith in this stuff, hope it works.

It required a wound care specialist as the opening revealed an &quot;open tunnel of pus&quot; about 6 inches long and as round as a pencil in diameter located about 1/2 inch under the skin along side my healing surgical incision.  First attempt by the specialist to help the reopened wound and tunnel heal was to have me pack it with sterile strip gauze saturated with silvadene every morning, cover it with a sterile impenetrable dressing and change the outer dressing every night as well.  When I returned a week later, the wound was no better (but no worse.)  I informed the medical doctor that at the night dressing change I would find the saturated gauze had &quot;crept&quot; up and out of the wound and was curled up under the dressing.  It was not painful, but weird.  His conclusion was that I was &quot;allergic&quot; to the silvadene.  I had no Bad outcome, but certainly no Good outcome either.  After 3 months, the wound healed with help from the specialist's other treatment.  BTW, the skin where the silvadene gauze curled is now a very gray color (even 9 years later.)

Even though I had to make sure and wash off the cream before radiation treatments it started working immediately.  
Other	California Dreamer, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5		25-34	11/3/2010 11:21:42 AM	As a busy mother of two small children, I often multitasked during my day.  It lead to an accident in the kitchen, a huge pot of boiling water spilled on my thigh, burning it badly.  The pain was so intense my body shook constantly with pain and shock. Silvedene brought INSTANT relief.  When the effects wore off and the pain returned, it was the only thing that gave me relief on the 14 x 9 inch burn.  Side benefit was that there was absolutely NO scarring at all.  
Minor Skin Infection caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/12/2010 3:40:16 PM	I had a bacterial infection on my arm and was prescribed this. It feels different than any other topical ointment i've used when on, but it is working. 
Other	ve, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/22/2010 4:10:08 PM	I believe Silvadene saved my daughter's life. At age 18 months she had heart surgery, which went badly.  During the surgery the forceps were left on the skin too long, and all the skin in the center of her chest died.  Because part of the pericardium was used to repair her heart, and the cartilege in her sternum fell apart, there was virtually nothing protecting her heart from infection through the 1&quot; x 2&quot; gaping wound in her chest.  She was not expected to live. After 2 weeks, though, her condition was stabilized and she was sent home, with a prescription of Silvadene for her wound (and many other medications.)  We changed her dressing daily and kept using the cream.  It took nearly 6 months for the wound to close, but there was never any infection in or through the wound. She will soon be 14 years old.
Skin Ulcer	clint, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/30/2009 12:08:40 AM	Pardon my expression it burns like hell, but don't put on at nite because you won't be able too sleep. But it does work, my second treatment with this gel only burned for 4hrs. and now my ankle feel's alot better. The reason I was put on this medication was I have two problem's, 1 is I have a spider bite on my left ankle and just below it a diabetes skin ulcer.

Had an outdated container of Silvadene in the refrigerator, knowing that silver can purify many things I gave it a try and low and behold it worked.
