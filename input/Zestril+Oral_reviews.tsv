Kidney Disease from Diabetes	mtungate, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	11/23/2010 2:47:43 PM	I took this medicine because I had protein in my urine. I am a type 1 diabetic. It caused pancytopenia in me, meaning that all my blood cell levels were low and they thought I needed a bone marrow transplant. After nearly a year off the meds my blood levels returned to normal. I am not telling anyone not to take this medicine, but if you do please make your doctor run a CBC test a couple times a year to make sure your blood levels are normal. I was told that my reaction to this medicine was 1:1,000,000, but I don't want anyone else to be the one in a million too!

They put me on hydrochlorot and that didn't work so they added zestril. I take 20 mg. The drug has worked wonders in lowering my blood pressure 124/79 or there abouts. The only draw back is the dry hacking caugh. It is worse when I go to bed. In fact I have to get up and sleep on the cough because it keeps the wife awake. I called the doctor today to see it she could put me on a non ACE Inhibitor blood pressure drug as that is the reason for the caugh.

I teach elementary school(many stressors)and this drug has been a Godsend.  The only down side is the dry hacking cough.  Sometimes it occurs at night.  Remember to take this medication at the same time everyday. I take it at 6:00AM works wonders for the rest of the day.

Switched to Lisinopril because it was cheaper by far. (My Zestril had gone up, and Insurance cut back).  I will be going back to Zestril immediately.  I feel lousy on Lisinopril.  Have been on it 2 weeks, am light headed, spacey, not focused, have unusual knee pain, feel sleepy.  I actually got a speeding ticket!  Haven't had one for 40 yrs.!  Just wasn't focused on my driving....that's dangerous.  I'm going back to Zestril...pronto! So far, my blood pressure is not as low on Lisinopril as it was on Zestril. Zestril does a better job for me.

This drug can cause swelling, usually lips but can be severe enough to stop the breathing.  The swelling caused 2 ER visits for my spouse before a nurse recognized the reaction was to the drug.  This happened after 10+ years on the drug and the episodes were almost a year apart so not easy to diagnose as a reaction to the drug.  There is lots of literature on this if you search.

So I have recently recommended it to a friend that was having trouble with her medication.  But I am glad that I read these reviews so I can warn her if she starts having any of the side effects I read about here.  
High Blood Pressure	VikingOwen, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	35-44	5/14/2008 6:35:46 AM	My headache I get from this stuff is constant and pretty severe. It is difficult for me to concentrate on anything. The dry cough is also annoying. It has lowered my blodd pressure, but not significantly only about 10 points. I don't care how well it works, it is debilitating and keeping me from living my life. ZESTRIL SUCKS.

From end stage total heart failure caused by malignant hypertension BP 240/160 to perfect control and good health 11 years later.  The cough goes away in a month.  Stick w. it, it mixes well w. all other drugs and you can still drink heavily once a week w/out problems.  If you get postural hypotension and dizzy spells taking this w. other drugs quit the other drugs first.

However it has caused a persistant dry cough that is making me crazy and seriously disrupting my sleep.  My doctor changed me to another medication 2 days ago and I just found out it is going to take 4-6 weeks to get rid of the cough! So watch out for that.  My doctor didn't mention it as a side effect so I had no idea what was causing it.
