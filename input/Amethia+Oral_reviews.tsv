Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	9/11/2012 11:51:37 PM	I have been on bc pills for over 20 years with no issues. I have taken jolessa(generic) for several years and would have some break thru spotting that wasn't a big deal but changed pharmacies this year and was given Amethia.  The first few weeks were ok but the 4th week i started full blown bleeding!  It was very heavy and clotty.  6 days later i am still bleeding that heavy with terrible cramps!  I have never bled like this nor had severe cramps before.  I was very worried there was something wrong even though i was just checked all out a month ago.  Thank you ladies for sharing your experience so i can relax and get my pharmacy to give me the real seasonique or the jolessa again!  I would not recommnd this bc.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	AL10, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/5/2012 11:31:11 AM	I took Seasonique for a couple years before a generic came out.  The first generic I was first given Camrese.  The first packed worked great and for $10 I couldn't beat it.  Seasonique was $55 so I was thrilled with the much cheaper alternative.  Then 2nd pack of Camrese was terrible.  I had a period almost every single day for 3 months.  Terrible cramping and much heavier flow than when I was on Seasonique.  I was going to switch back to the name brand but though I would try it one more time.  The 3rd generic pack the pharmacy gave me was Amethia.  Thought it was worth a try.  Amethia, for me, has been wonderful.  My periods which normally lasts about 2 solid weeks was only a couple days and no break through bleeding or periods at the wrong time.  I've had almost no cramping with Amethia which for me is a miracle.

Amethia has been a nightmare.  I spotted and cramped for 3 weeks. My hair is falling out like crazy. When I wash my hair both my hands are full of hair that has come out.  I have gained weight too. I am going back on Seasonique now that they have it again.

It works for the 1st month then suddenly ur cycle is completely off. I have been bleeding for ova a month w severe pain. I'm goin switch to another generic &amp; hopefully that will work.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	9/1/2012 9:39:46 AM	This has been a nightmare. If I miss ONE pill I get my period for 2 weeks. I was on Camrese before and loved it, my pharmacy switched me to this and I'm calling the doctor first thing to switch back. This 2 week period has happened twice in the 4 months I've taken it. Horrible. Do not waste your time with this useless generic.

I would not suggest the generic to anyone even taking price into factor- BRAND NAME ONLY This cycle I have switched back to brand with no problems!
Other	Nichola, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	8/22/2012 1:53:23 PM	I have used birth control my entire adult life without any problems (Don't know what brand as in UK where we lived then we just call it &quot;the pill&quot;) . After kids my husband had a vasectomy and so never went back on pill but I suffered mood swings and a short cycle so chose to go back on pill and given Amethia because supposedly have periods every 3 months YAY ! No such luck I have been constantly lightly bleeding with little respite. I gave it time for my body to adjust but into 4th month now and after reading these reviews I'm going to Doc tomorrow and changing. Oh not had mood swings to be fair !!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	8/5/2012 4:42:34 AM	I hate Amethia!!! The first month taking this pill was fine. Since starting the second pack, my mood has been all over the place. I have also been bleeding heavily for the past 2 weeks with severe cramps. The cramps are so severe that I cannot walk when it happens. I constantly wake up in the middle of the night with excruciating pain in my lower abdomen. I am going to stop taking this drug immediately mainly because of the severe cramps. 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	13-18	8/2/2012 9:37:46 PM	Started taking this about two weeks ago... Haven't stopped crying since. My boyfriend told me he was going on vacation for a weekend, no big deal right? I cried for THREE DAYS straight every time I looked at him. I'm NEVER like this and I am definitely going to have to find something else. 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	13-18	8/2/2012 1:38:20 PM	Do not take this! After becoming sick while on amethia I gained 6 lbs, I'm not saying it was from the pill but afterwards I was unable to lose any weight at all. Also after missing 1 pill, I graciously received my period for 3 straight weeks. It also made me very emotional, literally I'd be in tears over anything. It was also supposed to &quot;reduce my migraines&quot; which went from around once or twice a month to me getting 5 in a month.. Not to mention this is the generic version of seasonique, and it's still disgustingly expensive. This pill is not worth it.

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	7/15/2012 1:31:09 AM	I use amethia for my periods and it helps me alot. I love the fact that i dont have to have my period every month as well. I still get slight cramping during the month but it only last for a 1 hour.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	6/23/2012 11:42:45 PM	I was on Seasonique for over a year, with no problems at all. Then my pharmacy decided to stop carrying it, resulting to me getting on Amethia. I was not even on it for a MONTH before I stopped taking it and scheduled an emergancy appointment with my doctor. Upon getting on this medicine, I got a period that lasted for 2 weeks! The pain that came with it was so terrible, I thought I was having a miscarriage. I had blood clots like crazy, and they lasted so long I became weak from blood loss. I called my doctor to ask what would help my period stop, they recommended I take 2 pills a day till it stopped...which never happened. I took twice the dosage just to make it stop, and it didn't. On top of all that nonsense, my emotions are WAY off. I'm normally an emotional person, but I keep it minimal. On this pill I would feel the need to punch anyone who upset me, cry for no reason, and became unbareable. Luckily my boyfriend handled it well during the time I was on the pills. I question if this pill will even prevent pregnancy. And the fact I'm not the only one with side effects, I know it's not just my body reacting weird. It's this pill. NEVER RECOMMENDED THIS TO ANYONE. I will gladly pay the extra money for the name brand stuff. Don't even waste time with this generic.

I have no kids. I've been on this for one month and 5 days ago started my period and for 5 days it has been the worst period I have ever had in my life. I have the worst cramps, clots the size of golf balls. I almost passed out the other night because Im bleeding so bad. Called my doctor this morning to tell her my concerns. She is ordering me to have blood work and possibly a sonogram? After reading this blog I think I need to tell her to change to the other pills that everyone is talking about.  This has been a nightmare. I rather have my period every month than deal with severe clots and cramps.  So glad I found this site it makes me feel that I'm not crazy and alone.

I'm currently on my 3rd month with amethia and am having very heavy bleeding like I have never had before. A little spotting in the last 2 months. My husband and I are gonna wait a little while and start trying for a baby. I will def have to request something else later on.... Do not like it at all... 
Painful Periods	TroubleInTexas, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	6/3/2012 10:14:57 AM	Amethia has only been on the market for less than 1 year, so the reviews are few and far between.  I was taking Trivora (and I loved that pill), but my doc swithced be because I have horrible cramps every month.  I've been on this pill for 4 weeks (well only 4 pills into the 4th week and the cramps are insane and I'm bleeding like I'm on my period. I haven't had the mood changes, but I'm having blurred vision, dry eyes, my eyes actually hurt, vaginal dryness, sex drive is gone, I'm super gassy, my feet are swollen, and I sweat all the time, I get hot and sweaty just walking to my car.  I'm stoppig this pill today.  I'm calling my doctor tomorrow moring to get off of this crap. I thought since Trivora and Amethia have the same hormones I would be fine, but I'm not. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	6/1/2012 11:32:44 AM	Absolutely horrible experience with Amethia.  Had no problems with Seasonique but had terrible side effects with Amethia. Would definitely never take it again. Switching to Camrese which is an &quot;authorized generic&quot; so it should be manufactured to be exactly the same as Seasonique.  If this was not available I would gladly pay the extra for Seasonique to no longer have the side effects.
Endometriosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	5/29/2012 12:32:14 PM	I was having terrible periods, and extreme mood swings on every other drug I tried. My husband has commented on how much easier I am to deal with. I did spot for a week before my period,and then I bleed for 9 days on my period. that was frustrating, but I'd rather deal with that then everymonth having terrible periods and mood swings. Over all it has been the best thing for me, my sex drive has increased. 
Other	Worried consumer, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	5/27/2012 2:26:57 PM	I'm taking this for multiple reasons. Started with seasonique for the first three months loved it. Then was switched to amethia, first pack was ok, then the spotting happened and from reading all the other comments on here glad I'm not alone. Also headaches I've had could be due to this. Loved the price but not worth the worry of when bleeding (which was more like clots for me) will end. So going back to seasonique, maybe the other generic which is exactly the same. Hated Amethia!!!!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	BullFrog87, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/8/2012 7:14:11 PM	Hate it! Worst generic birth control pill ever created! Not even close to the brand name. My period is now going on TWO WEEKS and my breasts feel like they've been pounded with a meat tenderizer and I have never had soooo much cramping. On Seasonique, my period lasted for ONE day, no mood swings, no cramping, no fatigue, no weight gain = PERFECT. This generic is a piece of crap.! I'm only taking it because they decided to raise the price to $250...and I can't take it anymore. 3 weeks in and I'm ready to murder someone. The first month I was ever on Seasonique, my period was 2 days and I felt wonderful and ever since my period was maybe ONE day. 
Birth Control	tc_mommy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	4/16/2012 1:03:02 PM	I have been taking Amethia for almost three months now and i HATE it! I have never felt so emotional... everyone around me including my husband has asked me to change to a different drug because all i do is cry and get upset.... I haven't had any bleeding like the other women have reported but i have had the headaches and nausea...  over all i would not recommend this to anyone! 
Birth Control	 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	3	1			3/16/2012 10:15:43 PM	Amethia is the worst generic brand birth control. I was on seasonique for over a year unitl my insuance company switch me to the generic. While on seasonique I never had any spotting or bleeding. On the other hand with amethia I do. I have been bleeding for about two weeks its the worse I cant take it. This pill suppose to make you have a period every three months instead Im bleeding every month for about two weeks thats not normal. I do plan on switching to another pill. If you come across amethia dont take it try another birth control. Seasonique is the best.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	londoncalling4, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	3/12/2012 3:16:22 AM	I started birth control when I was 15 for my period. I am 21 now and still a virgin BTW. Before birth control pills, my period would last 6 months then stop for 2 days, then start again for another 4-6 months. It was extremely heavy. I would use at least 8 ultra heavy overnight pads a day. I went to the doctor &amp; asked for Seasonale. At the time it was new &amp; only had brand name. I took it &amp; 2 days later I had no period. I took it for years before having to switch to generic Seasonale, called Jolessa. Jolessa is just as good too, with a little spotting. Also I've never taken the inactive pills. I have not had a period in 7 years. Then one day I needed a refill but my pharmacy didn't have any Seasonale or Jolessa, so they called my doctor, &amp; she gave me a free sample pack of brand name Seasonique, which is exactly the same as Seasonale, except for the last 7 pills, which I have never taken on any of the 3 birth control pills. I love brand name Seasonique. Then I recently went to my doctor for a new prescription and asked for Seasonique &amp; was given a script. When I got to the pharmacy, they only had generic Seasonique, called Amethia, so I had no choice but to get it. Amethia is made by a different company than Jolessa. I had no problems with either brand name, or generic Seasonale. But generic Seasonique (Amethia) is HORRIBLE. My face constantly feels like it is on fire, my stomach always hurts, and I am throwing up. Remember I am a virgin so this is not morning sickness or anything. I won't be able to get a refill for over a month, so for now I have to suffer with these side effects of generic Seasonique. But when I can get a refill, I will pay the extra $100 to get Seasonique, or have them call my doctor for a Seasonale prescription and get the generic Jolessa.

I did not have any spotting or any of the potential side effects. Seasonique gave me headaches and a major drop in sex drive. This birth control has been great for me.

I was doing fine on Seasonique for over a year and half and then insurance switched me to Amethia and it has been horrible.  Pretty much bleeding the entire time (my time bleeding than not bleeding) with a lot of clots.  I'm going back to Depo
Other	Flygirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/26/2012 10:00:19 PM	I went through three packs of Seasonique and was happy, good mood, no spotting, light period, minimal breakouts. Last time the pharmacy switched me to the generic, Amethia. I have been spotting with clots, sometimes heavily (like a period) EVERY DAY for three months, have had breakouts and light cramps. Thankfully my mood is still ok. The pharmacy said it's the same as Seasonique, but it's clearly not! I'm switching back to the name brand for next time, it's worth the extra money! I'm happy to see I'm not the only one who's experienced this issue, the generic is NOT the same!!
Birth Control	Amanda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	2/18/2012 2:54:06 PM	I have been so nauseated for the past week on this. I've taken seasonque and jolessa(generic) and I was fine on those. But this is just aweful! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	2/14/2012 5:39:59 PM	Got Amethia as birth control - didn't really care what type of pill it was, this was just what my gyn recommended. Took it for 2 months, then quit. At first, it was great. I didn't really have a problem remembering to take it every day, only forgot a few times but remembered hours later. For the first 4 weeks it didn't seem bad at all - only complaint would have been some pretty annoying spotting that started around the 3rd week. It was daily, more brown and thin than a period and required a liner and sort of made sex a little awkward. That continued daily until I quit 5 weeks later, with a couple days scattered throughout in which I would randomly bleed. Bright red, thin, blood more like a cut than a period. Still got a regular period on week 4 since it doesn't really start regulating periods for up to a year. I didn't care to wait that long, though, as the side effects became more than just annoying. Breast tenderness was out of the roof, had more acne than normal, but most of all - TERRIBLE mood swings. Went from being more weepy at sensitive subjects or movies to being full-on depressed. Cried a lot - when people left from a visit, when I heard a sad song, when I was frustrated, when the weather was rainy. This coming from someone who maybe cries once a year, or at a death, NOT at a movie or good-bye. Felt it was making people uncomfortable, not to mention my embarassment. Dropped it a week after having sex (as per the directions) and within about a week I would say I was feeling pretty normal. Got my period back 30 days later, just a little heavier than normal, but no lasting effects. Overall, I hated this experience, not worth it at all (and my partner agrees - if your partner really supports you, they will, too).
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/11/2012 1:34:39 PM	Hair went from curly to straight. As soon as I stopped started to grow back curly.Slight hair loss. Mood swings, always felt like my period was going to start, more discharge. Not sure if this all a result of amethia, but all side affects began when I started.

I couldn't take it anymore and stopped taking it, will be going to my doctor for my exam soon and will ask for another brand, the Seasonique is worth the extra money!

I have been break through bleeding for the past 2 weeks. I'm switching to something else. I can't handle this. I'm glad to know others are experiencing this. The one good things that I've experienced is that I haven't gained any weight. I've also had mood swings like crazy. I dislike this.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods		1	4	1			1/12/2012 1:28:17 AM	Do not take this pill. I've had trouble with birth control pills since I started taking them several years ago and finally had some success with Seasonique. But when I refilled my prescription I was given Amethia. And since the first pill I have been on my period for three months. Yes the price is better but when you're on your period constantly it kind of defeats the point of taking the pill.
Other	Clinda80, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	1/9/2012 12:03:49 PM	I switched to Ametha 8 weeks ago because I hate having a period.  I tend to get mad or overly sad the week before my period.  I have only been on Amethia for 8 weeks now from Ocella.  I started breakthrough bleeding last week (7th week) and for the past 3 nights, I have vomited after dinner.  I take my pills in the morning so I don't know that this was caused from the pills.  I have lost 6.5 pounds since being on them which I love.  I have had a very minimul cramping even though I have been spotting for over a week now.  Hopefully this is just my body getting used to the new pills.

I have heavy enough bleeding that i can feel it gush out, and this happens even when im laying down. I do not recomend this drug to anyone. I had no side effects from seasonique at all. im going to ask to switch meds
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	12/6/2011 3:30:13 PM	I had used Seasonique for several years before switching to Amethia about 6 weeks ago.  I have experienced the break-through bleeding that others have mentioned, but mine has been has been minimal.  My main issue with the drug is mood effects.  I've had so many friends and family comment on my anger, impatience and frustration over the past 6 weeks.  They (and I) have noticed a significant change in my mood. I've decided to pay the higher price and go back to Seasonique.

Then the last time I went to pick up a prescription the pharmacy informed me that a generic form was available so my insurance would no longer pay for the name brand. I have been on it for two months now, the first week I was very tired and having dizzy spells, this past and I was doing for a few weeks then these last 3 weeks, I have been spotting,having horrible cramps and in addition to that my skin is breaking out even my back. I'm not sure if this is related but I have also been going back and forth from feeling slightly sick to my stomach to starving and not being able to get enough to eat. I will be talking to my pharmacy, doctor and insurance company to get back on the name brand.

Switched to the generic because insurance would no longer pay for Seasonique.  I had spotting within the first week which has not stopped yet and pain within the first 3 days.  Going back on Seasonique.

I switched from Seasonique to Amethia because of price. I had mood swings, blinding headaches, hair loss, breakthrough bleeding (like a light period) for over a month! I've had food cravings and every symptom I would normally have with PMDD. I did not experience anything on this level with Seasonique. It may cost more but I will have to switch back.

I have used Seaonique for several years without and problems.  I have had almost daily spotting/bleeding off and on the last 6 weeks of my packet, I will not be using it again!

I previously posted that his drug caused me headaches, severe cramps, and continuous bleeding while taking it. I failed to add that I had immense hair loss over the 3 months I took Amethia.  I went to a dermatologist last week regarding my hair loss. Now I didn't include this in the last post because I didn't associate it with the drug at that time.  However after my Derm appointment I learned I didn't have patterned hair loss or anything else wrong.... Thankfully! The doctor asked questions about any new meds etc. At that time it dawned on me.  I contacted my prescribing doctor who seemed to agree that Amethia was not working for me. She had me stop it ASAP.  I  was given a prescription written on it BRAND NECCESSARY.  There was also a cheaper alternative of the lesser branded EXACT DUPLICATE DRUG called Camrese (which pharmacy even accepted as the NAME BRAND).  I decided I would give it a try.  So one week later I am here to tell you my headaches, cramps, bleeding etc are gone. WHAT A RELIEF!!  Hope my review helps ladies!

With my last refill the pharmacy informed there was a generic available. I was happy at the pricing info.  However now on my third month I have been bleeding off and on for 2 months now along with cramping.  I thought there may be something wrong, but when I found this website I now see I'm not alone in my symptoms.  Also I have had headaches that I thought were stress related, however now after reading other reviews I think it may be related to my birth control.  Also I just read today that there are two generic forms of Seasonique: Camrise and Amethia.  Amethia is an authorized generic, however Camrise comes from the same maker and is an exact duplicate of Seasonique with the same EXACT ingredients.  I will be asking the pharmacy if this option is available and if not I WILL be switching back to the name brand.

No side effects, no breakthrough bleeding. My pharmacy switched me to generic Amethia as soon as it was available. I have had horrible headaches and have been spotting the entire 2nd month of the pack-Don't know when it will stop! I normally have very light periods. (I have NEVER had breakthrough bleeding with ANY bc pill I have been on).
