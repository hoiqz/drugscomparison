Overactive Bladder	Detrol LA 2mg, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	3-6	4/5/2012 8:40:04 PM	This has worked great for my little girl, she was unable to even go to school when her symptoms were at their worst.  She is now leading a normal life.  However, she has been on it for 6 months now and her side effects are weight gain, sore legs especially at night and I have noticed bruising, not sure if this is related.  Going to try and reduce the dosage and see what happens.

I had major problems with incontintency but after taking the drug for five weeks the improvement has been staggering. I had the op three months ago and was getting very depressed with the incontinentency. Being a 65 year old male I found the issues very depressing and at times I wished I hadnt had the op but now after taking the drug I am enjoying life once again. Hopefully I will stop wearing the pads in the next couple of weeks.  
Overactive Bladder	Debbie V, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Caregiver) 	4	5	1	Female		2/6/2012 10:39:07 PM	My 84 year old mother, who has dementia, had been taking 4mg per day for many years. Initially it helped a lot, but her incontinence has progressively worsened. The urologist had her try 2 other meds, and she was off of all incontinence meds for a full week before starting the next med. She was MUCH less confused and had fewer memory issues while off the meds. She has also had many more dental cavities lately, and I have read it can be related to the dry mouth that Detrol causes. We have decided to take her off the incontinence meds permanently.

Needing to Urinate Immediately	sunatrya, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	9/14/2011 10:27:30 AM	my main symptom was just suddenly needing to pee so badly that I couldn't hold it, usually hitting just as I walked in the front door or as I was trying to drop my pants.  Detrol reduced that symptom, but it made me have to pee more often instead.  It also made me incredibly thirsty (not dry mouth, plenty of spit!), gave me dry eyes and a horrible sore throat...it felt like swallowing broken glass!  I was about to stop taking it when I accidently found out that the sore throat was less severe if I took an allergy med at the same time (Zyrtec)  I MIGHT be albe to tolerate the side effects if I take the Zyrtec too, otherwise they're too bad for me to cope.  This makes me wonder, though, if the throat is an actual allergic reason instead of a side effect.  I'm going to see if the doctor will give me something else.

Overactive Bladder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/2/2011 5:09:38 AM	I have used this for about 2 months. Bathroom trips have reduced by 50% probably. The dry mouth is giving me a fit, despite several glasses of water. I take it at night, to take advantage of the drowsiness side effect. It doesn't seem to work well when I drink alcohol. Overall I like its effectiveness, just wish I weren't condemned to taking a pill for the rest of my life.

Dry eye/aching eyes...particularly bad at night when driving.  Also have dry mouth, which is tolerable.  Some problems with exhaustion and have noticed lately that my hair is falling out quite substantially, particularly when washed and dryed...does anyone else have this side effect.  I have always had very thick, healthy hair...never had much hairloss at all until about 3 weeks into the detrol.

Now that has gone away.  Before Detrol, I was miserale getting up every two hours at night, using depends and all kinds of pads, but still wet myself several times a night and sometimes during the day.

It has stopped the &quot;got to go right now&quot; feeling and leakiness. The only 2 side effects I have with it is being very sleepy after taking it, I have conquered that by making sure that I keep moving after I take it. The other is the dry mouth. I just have been chewing more gum and drinking more. Hoping that it continues to be so effective and that there are no other long term side effects.

I have experieced all of the side effects that they list.  I am tired all the time, and have blurry vision.  I also have the dry eyes, dry mouth and the constipation that are shown to be side effects.  But what we are not told is that if this medication has such a drying  effect on the eyes, mouth and bowels...what about the rest of our body???  The skin over my entire body is dry, and this medication has destroyed my scalp.  I am clawing at it all the time.  I have tried different shampoos as reccommended by a dermotologist and no relief.  Detrol LA is not smart enough to only dry the areas we are told about by the pharmisudical company that manufactures it.  It is drying the entire body.  I also suffer from urge incontinence, so I am always struggling with these issues...but I am going to visit a gyn urologist and see if I have any other options.  Living with these side effects is not an optimal way to live if there are other options.  I hope I can get off of this.  I also saw people posting memory issues...I just thought mine were hormonal.  Maybe not, I just don't know.

It provides about 70% relief in urge control.  I must still modify drinking habits if I go out for the day, but this provides some control verus using no medication and making bathrooom runs every 10-30 minutes, whether I drink liquids are not.  With the use of this drug and based on liquid consumption, bathroom runs occur every 1-2 1/2 hours.  Changes in insurance coverage is causing me to reduce the number of days I use the product.  Doctor has suggested I try OXYBUTYNIN again.  Previously this medication did not work for me.

The product works but the side effects were too much, I recently switched to another medication and it is working much better. I am not soooo tired. Detrol LA 4mg works better but was just too much.

I was hospitalized recently with several symptoms including headache, vomiting, and blindness in both eyes.  I was told that the reason for these symptoms was narrow angle glaucoma. I have no family history of glaucoma whatsoever. My opthamologist believes this condition was caused by the DETROL LA.  BE WARNED!!!!!

Urine Leakage When there is a Strong Desire to Void	ppattibpatt, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/18/2009 5:15:00 PM	I have been taking Detrol LA for over 5 yrs and I recommend this drug.  I have learned to deal with the side effects by sipping water during the day instead of waiting until I'm thirsty, and urinating ever 2 hours or so when I'm able.  This greatly reduces accidents and painful urges as well as my fear of going out.  I am able to hold it all night, although my bladder is painfully full in the morning!  I cannot hold urine that long during the day, once I have the urge I can usually only hold it for another 20 minutes.I have occasional constipation but only when I don't sip water all day long.  Dizzy spells are about 5 seconds or less, almost like a 'shift' and have decreased over time.  I didn't know about the adverse affects to memory when I started taking this drug, so it explains why I've been worrying that I was developing Alzheimer's at age 45!  It is awful!  This is something I'll discuss with my doctor the next time I see her.  In the meantime, I'll keep writing lists to help me remember.  Overall, this was an amazing product from the start and I am able to miss a pill on occasion should I forget to take it or something comes up.  I am going to try to take this pill every other day to see if I can reduce the side effects as I see some people don't take it everyday and still feel it's effective for them.  I haven't tried any other medication and wouldn't change it at this point.

It has changed my life! I have been on it for 9 months. I have had no bad side effects. One person mentioned aching legs at night which i do have though. I had never seen it mentioned as a side effect but perhaps it is? I will ask my dr. Other than that possible side effect this drug is wonderful.

At 43 it was making me feel way older than I needed to and was effecting my emotional state as well. Now with this medication I feel so much more confident and better about myself.

I have been extremely drowsy at times, and I have been having trouble with memory loss. I just discovered that detrol can affect your memory! That was not one of the side effects listed when I started this drug. I've been very worried that I was developing Alzheimer's, but now realize the connection with Detrol! I think this is not a good drug.

Overactive Bladder	Elizabeth, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	6/18/2008 2:48:53 AM	I took Detrol LA for three weeks in January of 2007. I didn't have dry mouth, or dry lips and nose. I developed severe constipation constipation which developed into chronic constipation. I have been suffering after taking Detrol LA for more than a year now. I never had constipation before taking Detrol LA. I took this medication for three weeks and discontinued it more than a year ago and am suffering every day since with Chronic Constipation. I have used several laxatives like Dulcolax, Senna Smooth, Ex Lax Chocolate Chews, and Correctol to name a few to combat my constipation. Including Miralax and Enulose. I am currently taking Amitiza for Chronic Constipation. I will never be the same again after taking Detrol LA. I do not recommend this medication to any one. I do not wish anyone to go through the horror that I have and am still going through.

Overactive Bladder	Angel1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/20/2008 9:04:33 AM	I am a female age 30 and have had bladder problems since I was 19. I have been on Detrol LA for about 2 weeks. I feel that it is working. I use to get up about 15 times at night. Now I get up about 3 to 5 times. I still get the pain when I have to go but hopefully the Detrol LA will take care of that once its in my system longer. I do not get the dry mouth or dry eyes maybe because I usually drink water all the time and do not get dry mouth in general. I would have to say I like the DETROL LA!! 
Overactive Bladder	blondeey, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	5/14/2008 8:44:38 AM	I was not able to take this medication because it is BLUE.  I am allergic to blue. So are many, many other people. You could sell more Detrol La if it wasn't BLUE. Ever thought about a clear capsule?

After only 3 days on Detrol LA I see great improvement. My problem was bladder spasms and when it happened there was absolutely nothing I could do to stop it. Very embarrassing! I had a complete hysterectomy 7 years ago and have only had this bladder problem about a year. I have had no side effects and am pleased with the immediate difference.

But it is kind of contradictory. It makes your mouth unbelieveably dry which causes you to drink more which in turn causes you to urinate more..... doesn't make much sense to me....
