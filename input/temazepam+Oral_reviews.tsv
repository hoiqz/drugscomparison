I know I have a high tolerance to drugs but nothing. I wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone unless mild drugs work for you. Time to find something else.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	3/7/2012 4:49:00 PM	It works within 30-45 minutes of taking it.  I'm taking the 30 mg capsule, and have been taking it every night for about 3 months now.  I have not noticed any decrease in effectiveness, so far.  I've had trouble with insomnia for over 3 years which is most likely related to pain from a severe car accident which has left me with permanent spinal damages.  I've been taking 40 mg of Methadone for pain per day for around 4 years and an increase in the dosage would probably help me sleep without the Temazepam, but I don't want to take a higher dose of pain medication yet.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Steve32, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	25-34	3/6/2012 11:01:33 PM	Was prescribed 30mg to take at night.. i worry and have increased anxiety over worrying if i will sleep well or not after 8pm or so.. the first day the 30mg gave me a &quot;hypnotic&quot; buzz kinda like Ambien does and then off i went to sleep.. second day was ok, third day it was no good and took 60mg and barely got me 4 hours of sleep! I was concerned about doubling my dose so doctor put me back on Remeron and then added Atarax hopefully the combo worked.. i took for three perfect years ativan 2mg with Remeron 15mg and slept perfect but then it stopped but three years of perfect sleep i will miss.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	2/20/2012 3:47:40 AM	became tolerant very quickly...i am a small person only about 101 lbs and i have gotten to the point that i take 60+mg (recommended dosage 7.5-30mg) and STILL can't fall asleep! Crazy! be very careful w/benzo tolerance and withdrawal, as it can be extremely dangerous... so in short, this drug works well initially and then after a couple wks your body becomes dependent on it and it doesn't work anymore.

The drawback is that I am always tired and I have periods of depression I never had before. I decided those consquences are better than chronic insomnia.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	EJS, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	8/2/2011 7:45:19 PM	I was taking Flourazepam for several months or longer.I found it to be much more effective than temazepam although it has a hang-over effect that I have noted and have heard the same with others the same.Not so with temazepam after two months usage.When my insomnia is worse I would prefer the Flourazepam but for now Temazepam seems to also do the job.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4		45-54	7/29/2011 11:30:34 AM	I have been taking this for at least 2 years now.  The only bad thing I would have to say about this is that there are times I can take it at my normal time &amp; then sleep at least 10 hours.  I try to get only 8 hours though.  I don't have any side effects like grogginess in the mornings.  It does work for me (99% of the time) within 40 minutes of taking it.

Been taking Prednisone, a steroid, on a long-term basis which would cause high amounts of anxiety and kept me up all night. I skipped the 15mg dose and jumped right into 30mg. Takes affect almost 1hr 30min after consumption but works great. Very satisfied with the results and have not noticed any addictions to to it whatsoever. Overall, one of the best sleep aids out there. Trouble sleeping? Consult with your doctor. Very well worth it.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	45-54	3/2/2011 5:23:41 PM	Prescribed this a few weeks ago, but only for 2 weeks, warned by GP its addictive and only suitable for short term use.  Didn't really knock me out but was a pleasant drowsy feeling...got some sleep but not much. Took it for the rest of the two weeks but it became less effective with each dose.  I find half a bottle of wine has the same effect but not very sensible  unfortunately.  I know what causes my sleeplessness, anxiety and stress caused by divorce and financial problems...if these were to resolve so would my sleep problems :-(

I am now on a low dose of alprolazame and I am finally getting the sleep that I need.I am going to stop the temazapam and see if the nightmares will go away. It is probably a good medicine for some but not for me.

I fell asleep with taking 15 mg, and I slept all night.  However, waking in the AM is hard.  I feel hug over and wanted to stay in bed.  I am not sure what I will do tonight, but definitely don't like the hangover feeling in the morning.  
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	CityBlade, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	12/30/2010 1:55:11 AM	Very cheap. I get 90 day supply of 30mg at Walmart for $16. Walmart is awesome.  Less scary thoughts running in my head as did the Ambien. If I need to wake again as for the kids or to pee, I can still think clear.  Only one complaint: I sometimes wake too early, around 5 am. Doc says this is normal and it is a result of a quality sleep session and I should get to something productive and no go back to sleep.  I recommend this drug as a non-medical expert, but as a user.

The drawbacks are that I feel a slight hangover the next day and I have a lot of trouble trying to go to sleep naturally the next night.  I use this med as an escape value after three nights of being up all night.  I try hard to avoid all meds for fear of psychological addiction.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	11/21/2010 10:21:07 PM	Since I began using a CPAP machine; I take 15mg for sleep.  It has a calming effect and does help me sleep.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Willene, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/20/2010 10:14:25 PM	I have terrible insomnia since menipause. Doctor prescribed this to help me get to sleep and stay asleep. 15mg didn't work at all/ 30mg works great. I sleep good and hardly ever get up during the night. But I am scared of becoming addicted. I wish there was something that worked this good without the addiction problem.

I did notice that I had a heightened sense of smell.  Many perfumes became offensive to me.  I have been off of the medication and no longer am nauseous at work from employee's perfume use.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	gbboo, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	2	2	Male		11/8/2010 7:34:38 AM	I have been using this drug for over 5 years and am now addicted to it. My original dose of 30 mg has been reduced by my doctor to 15 mg which I usually take twice a night, always once, unless I do have serious difficulty falling asleep. I have often had allergic reactions of itching on occasion as well as euphoric symptoms upon awaking if I take a second dose  mid-night to return to sleep. Vivid dreams are a pattern for me with this drug. I have not found any other sleep inducing drug to help me replace temazepam but would welcome one.

I also have central sleep apnea and use a bipap machine set to a pressure of 21. I am told that it is the not breathing that wakes me or keeps me from having a deep sleep. If I am sick with a cold or sinus, the Temazepam does not get me to sleep until around 3 am, and does not keep me asleep. The drug might work better for someone without the apnea.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Arlene, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/27/2010 12:56:22 AM	I started this medicine 4 weeks ago, beginning with 15 mg.  That did not work, however Dr. increased the dosage to 30 mg., and I'm sleeping through the night, usually only waking once to get a drink, then go right back to sleep. Have noticed none of the side effects.

It obviously doesn't work for me.

Temazepam was first synthesized in 1964, but it first came into use in 1969.

After about 30 minutes of taking this I feel like I haven't ate all day. It's great if you want to gain weight or would like to calm down or relax if you suffer from Panic Disorder. But it doesn't put me to sleep.

I can, actually, get to sleep a whole night without waking up and the best part is that I feel fine when I wake up.  I have tried all the over the counter sleep aids and nothing worked and I even tried Lunesta and Ambien with no results at all.This is the one for me.

My whole life has been damaged hopefully not beyond repair due to this. READ THE SIDE EFFECTS VERY CAREFULLY!!! This is a dangerous drug!!! I was hospitalized with a full psychotic episode, had severe pain &amp; spasms, was getting up &amp; doing things in my sleep ( the driving &amp; cooking being the worst), and much more. I still have severe memory problems  &amp; remember almost nothing during the NINE MONTHS that my doc had me on this (it's only meant to be taken MAX 2 weeks). Please don't let this happen to you or your loved ones &amp; if it does, please offer understanding &amp; patience &amp; know that isn't really that person. Also note that the original manufacturer only made a 10 mg dose but the generics gave it a different name (temazepam is generic for ristorel) &amp; increase the dosage (when I complained 2 my doc, I thought I was getting something different, not an increase of the same). Good luck &amp; God bless.

I take it every night and sleep like a &quot;baby&quot;.  It is really great for a good night's sleep.

NONE of the narcotic based drugs worked past a couple of hours, unless I intentionally overdosed, then I'd be in a narcotic &quot;trance&quot; and couldn't function at all.The doctor I have now knew exactly what I was referring to, and prescribed restoril. It was an absolute miracle for me, although I do have to take 2 capsules instead of one. That (to me) is an absolute blessing...and there's NO &quot;narcotic hangover&quot;. In the past 9 months, my life has done a 180 degree turn for the good- all due to the generic 'temazepam'.  
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	lindsk, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	5/29/2010 12:28:04 AM	I suffer from insomnia and have tried every OCT sleep aid. I have been on valium, ativan, rozeram, lunesta, and ambien. I also suffer from chronic migraines so I have been on at least 20 different meds in the last two years. The problem is that my body has a high tolerance for ALL meds. They will work once and then I have to increase the dose. I take 30 mg of temazepam already but it does not work at all. I need to know if it is safe to take 45 mg.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Sharbear50, 45-54 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	5/19/2010 10:45:54 AM	This was my sister, when taking it she experienced hallucinations of people being there with her when there was no one there. She made phone calls to people and would say really strange things and then not remember doing so. This is a horrible drug! My advice, go out and jog until you are really tired. Do something to get some exercise, run, bicycle, yoga, read or something.

I was waking up about 2-3 times a night.  I don't have that problem anymore and I feel great in the morning. For me.....it works !  I realize that everybody reacts differently to meds but this is the one for me.  I have M.S. and many problems that go along with that . Now, I don't have to worry about a good nights sleep.  I had tried all other kinds of sleep aids and quite honestly..they were a joke.  Not one of them worked until I tried this one. So.......I'm 100% for this.  :)

I never feel groggy in the AM. The only thing is that it loses effectiveness over time.

The next night I took it I fell alseep fast too. However, the next day all I wanted to do was sleep. And it continued into the following day too. So my opinion of this med is not good at all.

When I don't get sleep I get clumsy, disoriented, and emotional.  This medicine helps me get the 7 to 8 hours I need to be able to make it through the day.  If something wakes me up in the middle of the night, such as the dog barking, I can go back to sleep most of the time.  Sometimes I am groggy when I wake up but it goes away after a few hours of being awake.  If you don't have time to sleep 7 to 8 hours DO NOT take this medicine.  It happened to me one time and it was not fun.

My doctor just upped my dose to 30mgs cause 15 wasn't working. Some nights it works great, but others, especially if I've been stressed bad, it doesn't help at all. I know I shouldn't but when I'm real tierd and can't fall asleep I'll take 45mgs. I am trying to advoid the addiction so some days I will try to wear myself out and just hope for sleep without the meds.

I have, however, had some very serios problems wuth short term memory loss, doing things without knowing it (e.g. driving to the bank and eating an entire bunch of bananas) and problems with confusion thay lasts throughout the entire day. I've settled on taking it only on weekends, and a different medication during the week.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	usafsgt, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male	45-54	1/4/2010 9:06:17 PM	basically worthless. have been on all the &quot;pams&quot;- diaze, loraze, and now temaze pam. It is the least effective for the intended purpose. I am now going to search for the maximum dosage as my VA doctor is not doing too good a job. Maybe I need to enroll in the sleep disorder center to get assistance. have tried AMBIEN- KINDA LIKE GETTING HIT WITH A HAMMER.. save for the path worn to the fridge and accompanying weight gain. TRAZODONE- WORKS FAIRLY WELL.. save for the nasal congestion which is a BIG NO with chronic, bilateral, maxillary sinusitis. So apparently SLEEP DEPRIVATION, SECONDARY TO CHRONIC, SEVERE SPINE PAIN wins. I guess it is true that &quot;will get all the sleep needed when dead.

Temazepam 30mg works just fine for me with no side effects. 15 mg did not work most of the time. I sleep 7 or 8 hrs. I have been taking it for several months. Sometimes I have to get up at 5:00am or before and I can take Tam. and fall asleep in about 30 min. or less. I drive part-tme on my job from 150 to 300 miles a day.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Elsie, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		11/29/2009 3:47:15 PM	I'm 76 years old and have been taking Tam.. for about 4 years once or twice a week.  It works like a charm.  I'd almost never slept as well before.  It's energizing, but sometimes I feel kind of dopey the day after.  I look at it as a treat like chocolate.  It's so nice to look forward to a really good uninterrupted rest.  And the funny thing about it is if I do have to get up in the middle of the night to relieve myself, no problem, I just go right back to sleep.  In between taking the Tam...I take Melatonin which helps relax me.

Taking it does absolutely nothing to make me drowsy, and doesn't help keep me asleep once I finally get there. I also have lucid dreams when on it. The only good thing I have to say about this drug is that it somehow makes the very little sleep that I do get seem slightly more restful - I wake up more pleasant then I did before, even after short sleep intervals that would make anyone an unbearable bear.

Also these meds would mess with my digestive system which was very painful.  Also some of the dreams were so vivid, I would have to ask my family if these events really took place, and if it was an active dream, I would wake feeling worn out even with staying asleep all night. So when I was prescribed temazepam, I thought here we go again.  But with the first night I slept so sound I forgot what is was like. And to this day I still experience this kind of rest each night.

It put my body to sleep but kept my mind awake in turn giving me anxiety. It made my panic attacks worse, and deprived me of sleep until I stopped use. This is the WORST drug out there...stay away fom it.

Could not sleep for more than 3 hours a night for over a week. Took 15 mg and slept but woke after 4 hours sleep. Tried 30 mg and slept peacefully for 7 hours, without interruption. No after effects, no drugged feeling the next morning. Have not taken for more than 2 nights in a row, so cannot comment on long term use.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	dkf, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	6/2/2009 3:19:53 PM	Since I am on a few other meds for both bipolar type II and ADHD, I have severe chronic insomnia.However, even without any medication for many years, I just could never sleep, ever.I have gone many, many times without sleeping over several days.  My dubious record stands at 72 hours.My doctors have prescribed this to me for over five years.  I did have good sleep on Zyprexa and Seroquel, but after being off of those for a few times the chronic insomnia comes back.I have also been on Ambien, but that drug is no good for me because I get up and start cooking and doing stupid stuff and having no recollection of it.Regardless, I have had to go up on the dose from 15 mg to 30 mg.  This drug does help me sleep and counteracts the stimulant medication I take.  It helps with daytime anxiety.

When I did sleep it was low quality, waking every hour or so, with a lot of tossing and turning. I went as long as 49 hours (in a row) without sleep, then would sleep for maybe 3 hrs, then do it all again. (Tossing, turning, not sleeping for what seemed like days) My MD prescribed Temazepam 15mg and told me to try 1 (15mg) the first night and if that didn't seem to help to take 2 (30mg) the second night. So I tried the 15mg, nothing really happened so the second night I tried the 30mg and the sleep was AMAZING!!! After 3 nights of the 30mg I was back to a semi normal sleep cycle and didn't need to take the med. I must also add, I am a &quot;Shift worker&quot; so I often have different schedules and times to report to work and this has helped greatly with my sleep. I wouldn't take this if I had any less than 8 hrs to sleep, and no sooner than 30 min prior to bed, as it seems to be pretty fast acting on me.(F/23/5'7&quot;/165 lbs) When I start to drift into sleep it's peaceful and relaxing, not just a &quot;BAM and you're out&quot; type of thing, I truely relax with this medication.  I have taken Temazepam on several occasions over the last 12 months, all with the same effect, and have never taken it for more than 3 nights in a row (didn't need to) and have always awoke refreshed and ready to start the day. Overall, I think this is a great medication that has helped me with my sleeping issues.

I have been taking it for 3 years now, due to chronic insomnia. I take it about an hour before bedtime, and it works great for me. I wake up refreshed and ready to go. It doesn't make me groggy throughout the day. I have been taking the same dosage from day one. I do recommend if you are using this medication to make sure you are going to be getting at least 8 hours of rest. Also, I have no side effects at all. Works great.

I just recently went to full dose (15mg) at bedtime after getting off of Klonopin for sleep disorder/insommnia which I was on for a few years. Today, I feel absolutely awful after experiencing the WORST night in my recent memory. I do have Fibromyalgia and Sjogren's Syndrome so I'm on a lot of meds already, but I feel worse from side effects than I do from without sleeping at all - headache, tremors, eye pressure/pain, shakiness, and feeling really spaced out. It takes forever to get to sleep and when I do, I find myself waking up every few hours in between really weird and vivid dreams. Paying an $85/mo copay for GENERIC Restoril doesn't do too much to thrill me either. Calling Dr. ASAP to change to something else. Not worth the money or the possibility for addiction/codependence!

Works great 80-90% of the time;the rest of the time it just works satisfactorily.I'm happy with this med and suffer no side effects from it.I thought I might be abusing it till I read how long some of the folks in this article have been depending on it.Yikes.I'd have a talk with my Dr.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	tears and saddness, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/24/2009 9:13:59 PM	I am taking 30mg for 15days now. My main problem was that I would wake up in the middle of the night to go pee and then be awake for 2 or more hours... and then finally getting one more hour of sleep before getting up and ready for work. I wanted to see what exactly this medication was about so I logged on to read up on it. Now I am thinking that maybe my Dr. could have asked me a few more questions, or my pharacy could have told me the major contraindications as to who should not  be taking it... as I have in the past few weeks had very bad depression/ sadness and excessive crying - all for the same reasons anyone would be sad and crying, but it seems now that I may need to stop for a few weeks and see if this med has any effect on my sadness and excessive crying. Or it could just be that I am horribly stressed about work and about my husband going off to Afganistan for 13 mts.. hmmm but I do like sleeping until the alarm wakes me up. If I don't get enough sleep, I am a witch...

I am afraid I am addicted and want to get off. I cannot sleep without them now. I have heard horror stories about getting off them and am scared to death of the withdrawls. Any info out there about people using this drug for this long and having a bad time getting off. I have only been taking 15 mgs a night, but have had to go up to 30 due to increased tolerance. My Doctor says the benifits fo taking them outweigh not being able to sleep. Comments please.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	12/1/2008 1:42:53 PM	Taking 30 mg of Temazepam an hour before bed helps me sleep through the night, usually without waking. Some residual drowsiness occurs in the morning; I take the drug an hour before bed to mitigate this side effect. At this dosage, it is much more effective than other medicines I have tried. Taking only 15mg was not nearly as effective for me.

Thank goodness for doctors that realize effectiveness more than outways the chaace of dependence. The say this is only to be used for a short time but I disagree. I do believe you can and will build up a tolerance to it over time and the maximum doesage allowed by law in my State is 30mgs. I have gotten many a good nights sleep with this drug. I do not think I am dependant on it but if I am so be it...at least I am able to sleep and it does not disrupt any other part of my life or my ability to function like a normal person.

Other	chopinlover, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	11/26/2007 3:10:12 PM	I have developed severe lower back pain, in my spine, which makes sleeping impossible. The Dr. gave me painkillers plus the lowest dose of Restoril [7.5], until I can get my MRI and followup appt. It has helped me a great deal. I don't worry about getting addicted, 7.5 is the tiniest amount possible. If anyone is worried, don't take 30 mg., that's overkill in my mind, and you won't get addicted with the 7.5 mg, or at least have very little trouble coming off it. For me it's a HUGE blessing-I still have 3 kids to raise, I need to function. My Dr. says [and you can find this online too], that it has a good muscle relaxing effect that combines well with any injury treatments, without the nasty side effects of traditional muscle relaxants. Expensive, [my ins. is lousy], but well worth it to me. I hope that my Dr. can continue to prescribe this for me until my disc/nerve issues are healed. Don't be afraid of this drug, just use the smallest dose that works.

It worked GREAT before however, when I took it last night, it calmed me down but I never really fell asleep. I was dozing on and off for about 1.5 - 2 hrs all night. I fell asleep around 12:30 am (Took med at 9:30pm) and was up at 4:00 am, I don't even feel tired!!!! I also did this when I took Ambien. I had a sleep study done 2 months ago and only fall in to stage 1 and 2 of sleep. So I do have true insomnia. Has anyone else had this problem?

In a rare instance it takes longer than expected.  I think that is usually due to being over stimulated mentally. I usually wake up easily and after taking a shower I am fully awake with no after effects.  I started out on 1 cap of 75 mg and had to increase it to 150mg per dose and have been very successful at that dosage without any need to increase.In short this medicine works well for me.

It seems very gentle when going to sleep, I get 7-8 hours, usually straight through and feel great in the morning with no hangover or side effects.
