It started off well I felt it working, however I found myself running to the bathroom at work for bowel movements 3 to 4 times, gas has gotten worse, headaches daily and now my left eye is twitching.  I will stop the medicine until I can be sure there is nothing else going on.  The headaches scare me as I am already taking medication for hypertension.

After taking this only a few days, my acid reflex stopped.  I have been on it for several months and haven't had heartburn once! My husband even went and changed his Rx too as it helped him.  Only side effect is that sometimes I feel bloated, but its worth it.

No side effects at all relief within minutes of starting the medication. I have been on this medication for three months and have not had any problems with my acid reflux, My MD says it is possible for this medication to cure my hiatal hernia for good and eventually I won't ever have to take medication for it again. I'm very happy with this medication it has let me live a normal life with out watching what I eat or drink because of the worry it might kick up the acid reflux. It's the best medication I've ever been on!

Upper GI issues seemed resolved. Took it for 11 days and got Migraines for over a week, on and off, nauseau, mostly on, and diarhhea for over a week. I think it's Kapidex and not an illness. I had taken Prevacid and Protonix last year. Both worked for about 5-6 weeks and then the big &quot;D&quot; hit for several weeks. Pay attention to any changes in your body and report it to your Dr.

I no longer have lose stools and my stomach is simply great. I got on here to see if this medicine was also used as a diet aid because it has also curbed my hunger but I see no mention of that.

This went on for 2 years before they found the ulcers..No side effects at all compared to the pain I was in.  I thought I was going to die.

Problem is I've had explosive diarrhea up to 10 times per day. It seems everything I eat, which is mild and less than ever, runs right through me. As of today I'm not taking Kapidex anymore and my GI will be calling me with his diagnosis this afternoon. Even if they don't give me another script today, I will not be taking Kapidex anymore. I'll try basic Prilosec again if I have to. It's easy to take and cures ailments, but the side effects are too great. I was also very, very tired and felt dehydrated the entire 1.5 months I was on it, likely due to diarrhea all day long. Hope it works for you!

Within 3 weeks my cough is gone. I had been to many different Drs. Some prescribed Allergy medication, antibotics. Some didn't even try to address this problem.It has taken this lon to get something done.

My Dr. gave me a card to take to the pharmacy so even though my insurance will not pay, I pay 25.00 a month.  Well worth the relief I am experiencing.

My main problem has been salty burning taste in mouth...so burning it has made sores in my inside of mouth. I don't even have the belching or gas feelings...just the acid burning taste in mouth. ENT Dr. says it's LPR acid reflux- Has anyone else but me had this acidy burning taste?

Worsened my asthma and caused tight feeling in chest and palpitations. Stopped taking after 5 days. Had no appetite and was shaky and weak most of the time.
Inflammation of the Esophagus with Erosion	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/4/2009 9:08:52 PM	This drug has worked better than other products I have used (Nexium, Prilosec OTC, other OTC products).  I recommend getting the Kapidex discount card, which can take up to $55 off the price of the drug.

It seems to be an expensive medication and I wil probably give it a few more weeks, but I'm not if I will continue to take it or switch to another drug.
Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	cajunfoodforever, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	7/21/2009 1:10:21 AM	Seems to be doing as well as anything I have taken for the 6-7 years I had problems of this sort.  Cimetidine is readily available over the counter and also worked well as did Omeprazole.  Think I lost about 75 pounds on &quot;the purple pill&quot;.NOTE: If you are experiencing sleep issues are even close to making you a candidate for a CPAP do whatever it takes to get into the program!  When you start using it you will discover a big reduction in your of your reflux episodes.  For me, Cimetidine was all I needed for about 3 years after I began using the CPAP.  Other issues now have me going on to Kapidex but as far as a good nights sleep without reflux, goes, nothing has helped me like the CPAP. I can even stay awake in church now!

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	7/16/2009 5:42:36 PM	I only took this medication for about a week, but while on it I became depressed, homicidal, and suicidal. It did however treat my symptoms very well. After contacting my pharmisist I learned that this medicine can have this effect on some people and that people who have had or has symptoms of depression are at greater risk. Even though my doctor should of known my history with mental illness (it's in my chart) prescribed it any way. I wanted others to know that this is not a very common side effect and even though your doctor has your best intrest at hand these side affects could happen to you. If you are having these symptoms and are taking Kapidex contact your doctor.

It has worked very well, but I've followed a strict diet in conjunction with the medication.  Only serious side effect for me has been several loose bowel movements a day.

However because of the severity of my reflux I have also had to change my diet. So I am sure it is a combo of both. It really is too bad that this medication has to be so spendy.

Other	dingykc, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/16/2009 6:50:41 AM	I was diagnosed with gallbladder problem. only a 2% ejection fraction. Was throwin up bile,pain in back between shoulder blades, constipated and upper abdominal pain. went to emergency room. left there stable after the attack.was prescibed previcid 30 mg. Took 1 a day for about 30 days. My whole abdoman became bloated and had a dull pain constantly after that. Dr. changed med. to 60 mg kapidex time released.After a few days of this med. my symtoms were worse.Felt weak and tired,bloating much worse,upper abdominal pain constant. Stopped all medication 2 days ago. the bloating is much better and the constate upper abdominal pain has stopped. I am eating the same diet I was eating while taking the med.High fiber, very low fat, small portions several times a day.I know I will probably have another gallbladder attack before I get my surgery scheduled but the attacks only last for a while and then they subside. Can handle this far better than constant pain all the time. Hope this helps someone else.

This was substituted for prilosec. This helped with the acid reflux but doesnot help with the hives that was suppressed by famotadine and zyrtec which I had to give up once I took the kapidex.

Kapidex worked perfectly from the first pill I took.  My doctor did not say what caused the pain, but I had used Prevacid before this.  I had serious back surgery and thought the pain was reflected from the back nerves, but apparently it was not.

The pharmacist warned me that Kapidex might cause the same problems and it did.On only the third day of taking Kapidex, I suffered severe cramping, gas and extreme diarrhea, so much so that I could not stay at work.I cannot say if the drug worked as I only took it for three days. Perhaps it will work for other folks but I can't continue to take it.
