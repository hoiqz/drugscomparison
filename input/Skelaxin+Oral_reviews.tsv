Skelaxin 800mg (3 times daily) really helps with the pain. It can make one drowsy... but it only really bothers me if sit quietly. Activity trumps drowsiness.

I cut these in half, but still have difficulty swallowing them. As for effectiveness, Skelaxin kicks in much quicker than Flexiril has in the past for me.

Other	stever, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	4/9/2012 1:26:51 AM	I was prescribed Skelaxin by my PCP for pain caused by foramenal stenosis at C4/C5 after Naprosin didnt work.  To be fair, I think that this was not the appropriate Rx for my condition and level of pain.  I was suffering 9/10 pain from my neck through my shoulder and down my arm, and even though I am a conservative  middle aged man the doctor, who I had been going to for several years gave me no credibility as to the level of pain I was experiencing.  I got an MRI, dignosis of foraminal stenosis caused by spurs,  and after being in agony for 6 weeks, opted for double discectomy with fusion and plate.  The neuro surgeon gave me oxycodone 7.5 relieve pain prior to the operation which provided me with real pain relief.  When I realized that I had needlessly gone through 6 weeks of intolerable pain because my PCPs inability to discern my level of pain and prescribe appropriately, I was livid.

I will eventually have to have surgery to correct.  I have been taking Skelaxin for years and love it! It doesn't make me drowsy and I personally have never experienced any side effects. Takes the edge off the pain and allows you to go on with life without feeling like a zombie. Dr initially suggested Oxy and I said no way, just want something to help me deal with the pain to get through the bad days. A nice alternative to heavier meds, doesn't totally alleviate the pain but makes it more bearable.

There is no comparison between the generic and the real deal. The real deal works great.If you are one of the people taking Skelaxin/Metaxilone, and it is not doing anything for you, you may be getting the generic/knock-off and not the real deal. Check with your pharmacist, your Dr. and insist on the real deal, it works great.If you need it, you should be getting it, the real stuff!A satisfied user.

I can't take vicodin &amp; don't really like taking any habit forming drugs. My physician gave me Skelaxin &amp; upon taking the first dosage, I felt my muscles relax. I wasn't drowsy from it either. The only side effect was I had a headache the first day or two. It was prescribed for only short term usage. I would recommend this product if asked.

I was having really bad headaches everyday for over a year. Dr. perscribed Skelaxin as my muscles in those areas were very tight and part of the pain issue. I had taken Flexeril once for a muscle relaxer and it made me very sleepy but this Skelaxin does not make me sleepy at all and I can function just fine. It has really helped relax all of the effected areas and pain is gone at least by 85%. This is really great.

The sad thing is that with the first dose I could feel my muscles relaxing and was having less back pain.

HNP L4-L5, L5-S1, 20 years post-surgery. I have never experienced any negative side effects, but I have heard of numerous negative effects as other reviews here indicate. It either works well for you or not at all and a negative experience...it is for you or not. Over a number of years, one physician refused to prescribe this for me, 1 of 4. Without Skelaxin, 3 - 4 week recovery period. Typically, with Skelaxin, 5 - 10 days the episode is over and back to normal. However, I have never used this drug for longer than 2 weeks, TID.

Thank goodness it has finally come out in a generic so it is not so expensive, but honestly, it wouldn't have matter because I would have paid anything to help the pain go away and Skelaxin does the trick.  WOW!!!
Muscle Spasm	przed@rocketmail.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	4/28/2010 10:06:39 AM	I was prescribed skelaxin (and given the generic form, Metaxalone) for extreme back spasms, after telling my doctor that the valium (10mg) prescribed by the ER doctor casued slurred speech and made me feel loopy and very sleepy (though it did provide relief from spasms).  I took 1 dose of Metaxalone at 3pm and was incapacitated for the next 16-18 hours! I absolutely could not focus on anything or even stay awake.  My husband was in disbelief as to how completely out of it I was.  I still felt drugged and groggy at 10am the next morning--though I had a very sound sleep and was spasm free.  BOTTOM LINE: BEWARE!  I will NEVER take this again, and advise others to be very wary about it.  I ended up continuing my 800mg prescription of Ibuprophen simlutaneiously with the valium, cutting it in half (to 5mg)and stretching out the time between and have had no more spasms, am feeling better every day, and hoping to be done with it all in the next week or so.
Muscle Spasm	Christine , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	4/12/2010 8:50:58 PM	I have experienced terrible pain in my sciatic due to a torpedoing periformis.  The Skelaxin has subdued the spasming, at times completely, others about 70%, which is still an improvement considering the terrible pain I'd had.  Drawback is I am so tired about an hour after taking it that I don't want to do much but I have only been taking it about three weeks.

ER Docs gave me valium and oxycodone (no thanks, I'd rather not be a complete zombie).  Regular MD gave me Skeklaxin.  May as well be a placebo.  Spasms still strong after many days on drug.  Also, I had quite vivid nightmares each night on drug (of course, those could have been caused by the price!)  Trying flexiril next.

Muscle Spasm	Hall, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	3/8/2010 11:20:32 AM	 I have a herniated disc in my lower back. The pain was a 10+ at it's worst. I recieved a series of spinal injections which helped a lot but the pain would slowly come back. I had been prescribed Flexerill but quit taking it because it completely spaced me out. My doctor then presribed Skelaxin to take with Voltaren. I've had great results with no side effects at all and I can actually function while taking it. I usually only take two a day.

Yes it does not make you sleepy or Zombiefied but is to mild to really help.  If not relief why take a minor drug unless your pain is extreamly mild.

If you have prior experience taking another medication i.e. Flexeril or Zanaflex, I think you may be disappointed with Skelaxin. While working in similar ways to reduce spasms in various muscular tissue, Skelaxin does this in a much milder manner.    To elaborate, Skelaxin does not leave the user feeling &quot;zombified&quot; or groggy as other muscle relaxants do. If you have ever been prescribed Xanax (alprazolam) or other benzodiazipines, the overwhelming feeling of calmness and reduced inhibition is very similar.   For minor sprains, spasms, and/or strains, this medicine is great. People with previous history of alcohol or substance would be wise to start with Skelaxin as it poses a much lower risk for negative side effects and abuse.

I've been taking 4 per day for several months, with the addition of Skelaxin causing no appreciable change in my condition. I'll no longer be taking this drug, as the fact that the doc persists in prescribing this instead of another less costly medication makes me believe profit lies at the heart of his decision.

I will have to see a neurosurgeon in cple of weeks for upper spinal problems.  After a couple of weeks of skelaxin.  yes it relieved the headache.  but the tradeoff was uncontrollable diahrrhea, (I was house bound because of the constant going and intestinal upset), pale, weak,  drained  constant skin rashes and hives.  It is VERY expensive to become that miserable.  It should be taken off the market.  I will never take this again

Finally, after seven years of constant pain (fibramalgia) I can go outside without shaking and sweating.  It is costly, but  I would do ANYTHING to beable to go somewhere and not shake.

I was extremely disappointed with him after taking it, and believe the evil drug vultures (you know, the guys hovering around with briefcases around closing time) convinced my doctor that Skelaxin was the best drug in the world. When I first purchased it, I was shocked to find how much it cost compared to Soma, then was put further in hell by its ineffectiveness. Some time later, I went over to visit my parents and saw a prescription for Skelaxin for my mother tacked to their bulletin board. I asked her about it, and she told me it didn't do anything for her, so my guess was she had no intention of filling it. I'm convinced this drug is a placebo (a pricey one), and should be taken off the market.

This is not early as effective for me as Flexeril. However, I can actually function after taking Skelaxin. I occasionally get a little drowsy but I am often taking the maximum dosage level for a few days at a time when I have a &quot;bad stretch&quot; of several consecutive headache days. It is a compromise for me, in terms of effectiveness, but it certainly does help.

I'll take it for a few more days and hopefully all my pains will be gone.

It made me relaxed but not to the point of being unable to function.I actually cut the dose in half and it worked well for me.

Muscle Spasm	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	5	Female	35-44	4/8/2009 3:11:49 PM	My pain specialists wanted me to try this medication 800 mg and I found that it made me hurt worse, I took it for 2 weeks and stopped.  Several months passed and my pain completely took over my life, I was bed-bound with pain and stiffness.  I started the medicine again but, cut it in half and because I cannot swallow pills, I crush it and put it in icecream or yougart.  Changing the dose and taking it every 4 hrs., instead of 8 hrs., has made a tremendous change in my pain and stiffness.  I have suffered with chronic pain and migraines for 12 yrs and he has tried every pain medicine out there, including morphines, it made my pain worse.  With tramadol 50 mg x 3QD, and this medicine together, It has helped me so much.  When I see her in a week, we will be discussing Fibromyalgia, I have every symptom and all 18 trigger points.  Maybe someone that had no luck with this medicine at 800mg, try it by using it as 400mg, More is not always better, we all know that.  Good Luck!!!

She prescribed me flexmid first, did nothing, then prescribed Skelaxin. Again this drug did nothing for me. I took it at about 8pm and went to bed at 11:30, I could not sleep, I felt restelss and was hot and sweating along with some itchyness. this was a waste of time and $ for me. good luck to the others trying this drug.

After trying many different modalities of treatment, including other muscle relaxants, I suggested trying this drug . It is the only drug I have taken that I could describe the effect as being miraculous.  I am no longer bed bound and my life has become much more functional. The only slight inconvenience is the QID dosing schedule.  I've had no side effect problems except irratability. I have taken this drug continuously now for 1 year.  I am concerned about the long term effects of its useage.

I had had a series of epidural injections which helped with the immediate pain of the injury, but I was having massive muscle spasms due fibromyligia and the stress at work after the injury.  I take once a day, sometimes twice if needed.  My spasms are much better but not fully gone.  I don't think they will ever be fully gone, so the relieve I get from these are enough to make life livable again. I am also taking Lyrica which helps the nerve damage pain from the injury, so the two together work well.

I take it 4 times (for the last two weeks) a day and have not noticed any difference. It was incredibly expensive ($270 for 60 pills). The pills are fairly big and hard to swallow. The only positive thing I have noticed about this med is it doesn't make me dizzy or anything. It doesn't make me feel any different at all. If I had to pay for this med myself, I wouldn't do it. In fact, it is such a big waste of money that I will not get it refilled.

Other	Sue, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	1/28/2009 10:38:27 AM	My Dr gave me a sample of this medicine to take for a stiff painfull neck, post MVA from 2months ago,  the Dr instructed me to take only a half pill until I new how it would affect me and she said take it at bedtime as it may cause dizziness and drowsiness.  I asked the Dr if I could take my normal medications with this new pill and she said sure.  Therefore, I took 1/2 pill as instructed at 10 pm and by 11 pm I was very sleepy, I also took a baby aspirin, two tylenol pm and a multivitamin as I always do at bedtime. I awoke at 3am with a sore throat and had to get yup to get a drink but was tired enough to go back to sleep.  I awoke by my alarm clock at 6 am with swollen eyes and a sore throat and a red puffy nose.  My husband told me he ahd heard me snoring, which is not normal.  Called pharmacist to ask if this was a normal reaction and was instructed it is not a normal reaction but do not take it a gain and tell Dr about it.  But as far as stiff neck, it is less stiff after only a half of pill. My suggestion is not to try at bedtime because I feel my reaction would have been worse if I had not taken Tylenol pm which has benadryl in it which helps with allergic reactions.

Bad dreams, terrible headaches, very sick stomach...but the very worse side effect that I noticed was my mood changing into depressive mode!  Not a good place to have your head at when you are suffering from excruciating back, and leg spasms.  Please people read all the side effects...And do not, I repeat do not pay for it until you try it out! Ask for samples first!  I really envy those that have had good results...I hope those that come here to read up on this med will read all of the entries!  Consider the risks and if you are one that often has side effects to a lot of these types of medications be very wary!

I have fibromyalgia, back issues-spasms to say the least, neck pain, etc. I have been on this med for one full day and I feel so much better. Now mind you, I did sleep all day and could not go to work-and that was on 1/2 the dose, but I don't hurt like I did. Wonderful!!!!!!!! Expensive though!
Muscle Spasm	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	8/29/2008 11:06:33 AM	Using this very expensive med with Chiropractic adj. and exercise for lower back spasms. It is a great combo because I feel almost normal again. Not sure what is doing the most for me, but it's all working together.I'm starting my third day of 800 mg/3 times per day. First day, I was tired in the PM. Second day, I experienced some chilling. Both nights I experienced mild headaches. I have had three Chiropractic adjustments this week, too, and have done multiple periods of prescribed stretching exercises each day.

I had narrow angle glaucoma which may not have anything to do with this condition.  Well I hurt my knee and started taking more Skelaxin and since then I have bad eye pain that goes into severe migraines more severe and more often.  I have stopped taking skelaxin and the migraines have improved.  Has anyone had migraine problems with Skelaxin.
Muscle Spasm	fred, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	65-74	8/9/2008 10:46:46 AM	Skelaxin is very effective.  My lower back spasms have caused me to almost wreck my car and to fall on the rug from a sitting position.  I bite my 800 mg tablet in half (because a whole tablet makes me groggy).  My spasms start to take hold but don't progress to the &quot;spasm&quot; state.  And their occurance has become rare.  I only take a half tablet the first thing in those mornings when walking upright is difficult.  It's been over a week since I've taken my last half tablet.  I was introduced to Skelaxin on April 4th (today is August 9th) and the grogginess is no longer a factor.

Muscle Spasm	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	19-24	7/26/2008 3:55:18 PM	This medicatuion is a joke for muscle spasm relief.Skelaxin is actualy a mild sedative and doctors only believe it works because it is a sedative.Anybody who says it works never had a real problem in the first place.I was given it for a muscle spasm in my upper back and took it for a week and my injury got worse and I had to go to the hospital to get a real muscle relaxer so I could get better.I almost lost my job because of skelaxin and the fact it didn't work at all.

I took it for chronic back pain and it made the pain go away really fast! I had bad stomach aches and felt sick, but worth it to have the pain go away. However, I started having a &quot;rash&quot; (tiny red dots all of my body - not raised, just under the skin) and they itched. Stopped taking medicine, dots are still here two days later. Calling my doctor tomorrow to see his suggestion.

Woke up screaming one night, the dream was so bad. I had no relief of my back pain. NONE! I heard such good reviews of this medication. I am not impressed. 
Other	madmodgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/4/2007 10:38:15 PM	This is great for fibromyalgia pain and sleep problems. For the first time in 10 years, I wake up refreshed, pain-free, and ready for the day. Unlike Flexeril which knocked me out and made me groggy the next day, this didn't make me at all tired. I look forward to trying it during the daytime.

I did experience stomach aches, nausea, and minor anxiety.  As my back pain lessened, I decided to stop taking Skelaxin because the side effects became more painful than my back.

Muscle Spasm	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/3/2007 4:15:22 PM	This is the best muscle relaxer on the market that I have found!  You don't get the laziness or a case of the blah's.  Its' only effect is it relaxes your muscles and you can still function otherwise.  It is kinda expensive and Dr.'s, for some reason, have issues with prescribing it.  I love it and I have major muscle problems from my head down to my butt.  You have to make sure you take it as prescribed because I think it's addictive, though I'm not sure.

Muscle Spasm	Todd England, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	35-44	9/25/2007 4:51:28 PM	I had a car accident and suffered some minor trauma to my back and muscles.  I was prescribed this drug to relax the muscles.  I had massive muscle cramping, much worse than before the pill was taken. It happened within the first 60 minutes after ingesting the pill.  The Pharmasist informed me this was a very rare side effect and to contact my Doctor for an alternative.

Muscle Spasm	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	19-24	9/21/2007 10:11:07 PM	I've used skelaxin multiple times for back injuries.  It pretty much just makes me feel sleepy and lazy but doesn't really offer any relief to the spasming.  It feels more like a sedative than muscle relaxer.
