Head Pain	TMax, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	19-24	8/3/2012 9:26:38 AM	The medicine worked wonders for my headache, and I felt much better. However, I woke up very early in the morning because of sharp stomach pain and diarrhea. In the morning I usually eat breakfast, and I lost my appetite. Yes the medicine did what it was supposed to, but the side effects are not worth it. I rather wait a little longer for the pain to go away with Tylenol than suffer after goody takes the headache away

Its fast and effective. The only draw back is if taken often it can cause stomach problems. I've developed a stomach ulcer. I take them almost daily. I've been advised not to take them so often but I'd still rather my stomach hurt than my head.
Head Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/27/2012 11:10:54 AM	I re-discovered Goody headache powder in 2007 when I had a terrible headache and the only thing my aunt had was goody.  I have been a fan ever since.  I suffer from severe migraines.  Goody cool orange, works faster without the drowinsess than my prescription.  I have recommended it to several people and they are hooked as well.

Other	vet, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	12/8/2011 8:25:52 PM	i am letting people know that goodys powders is very addictive and can cause very major health problems. goodys can be very addictive. everyone in my family takes them,always have as long as i can remember. my aunts kidneys shut down because of goodys, my cousins stomach exploded,and i have had problems with dehydration. they should give large health warnings due to potassium and addictiviness. take this serious next thing u know u will be taking 6 or 7 a day and will cause rebound headaches,constipation,kidney problems, and there is no end to the problems they can cause, most dr's don't even know what is in them so if u have a question take the pkg with u to the dr. be very careful i would never believe this great pwdr for headaches could cause this many health problems.

I must say, iy's truely best to take with food 'n drink a full glass of water.  I use it for relief of a bone disorder.

Goodys may work but they come with deadly side effects. My Father claimed they helped him. He died as a result of a stomach bleed after using Goody powders for years and years.

He was hospitalized for fluid buildup and was recovering well after a week of treatment.  Then out of nowhere he started losing blood.  He had developed a stomach bleed. He passed away because they could not regulate his blood clotting ability in order to stop the stomach bleed.A physician at the hospital told me this was a very common problem with people who use  these headache/body ache powders...that they should have been taken off the market years and years ago.  If you or someonee you love uses these, please find another pain reliever. I asked my Daddy for years to stop using them, but I believe he was addicted to them either physically or mentally and they ate away his stomach lining.  The damage done is real according to a doctor.  I believe it.
Head Pain	jackieseals, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	8/3/2009 5:33:02 PM	I'm sure this post may seem confusing.  I rated the effectiveness as 5 stars and satisfaction as 2 stars???  Goody Powders are VERY effective in relieving headache pain, however...They are also very addictive.  Until 3 months ago, I had been using Goodys for over 10 years. At first, 1 powder every now and then would take care of the problem.  Then it was 1 powder twice a day.  Then 3 times a day.  When I kicked the Goody Powder habit, I was taking 2 powders at one time 6 or more times a day.  My doctor had asked me before to give them up because they were actually causing the majority of my headaches. This is called Rebound Headaches. Your body becomes addicted to the caffiene (32.5 mg ea.) and aspirin (520 mg. ea.) in the powders so after a while you have to use a larger quantity to stop the headaches you are having from your body's cravings.  Not to mention what all the aspirin and acetaminophen (260 mg ea.)is doing to your liver. He even offered to prescribe steroids to help me kick the habit.  Instead, I went &quot;cold turkey&quot;.  The headaches &amp; body aches for the first 2 weeks were very bad.  The 3rd week was rough but not as tough as the first two.  Now I RARELY have a headache.  And I do not reach for a powder if I do have one.  Aleve works well for me now.  Please do not make the misconception that if you are not popping as many powders as I was, you don't have a &quot;problem&quot;.  The sooner you stop taking them the better off you will be.  Even if you have to turn to your doctor for assistance.    
Head Pain	rb965, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	6/27/2009 9:39:36 PM	I have used Goody's powders for years for headaches and body pain. It is the only thing that really helps my headaches. It is easy and convenient to use. New orange flavor is best. The only side effect is I sometime have pain in the stomach if I haven't eaten properly before taking it. I have tried many other products and Goody's works best.
Head Pain	none, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	3/4/2009 9:34:00 AM	I use the Goody's headache powder for all muscular, joint and headache pain with very good success.
Head Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	12/12/2008 10:16:54 AM	I've been dealing with a constant headache due to whiplash from an auto accident six months ago. Goody's is the only OTC product that has allowed me to cope with this on a daily basis; the powder dissolves easily and provides quick relief.
Head Pain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/1/2008 2:52:53 PM	Goody's works when other OTC meds do not. The powder form is quick-acting and very effective. There are two things I never run out of at home -- coffee is one and Goody's is another.
