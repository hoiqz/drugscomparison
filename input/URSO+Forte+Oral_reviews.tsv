(500mg twice a day) and my blood work has been good. I do notice thinning hair as a side effect. I also have slight discomfort around by rib cage above the liver. Take advice and dont read then internet, and listen to your Drs. advice. Currently there are no other meds for this disease. I have contacted local NJ and PA hospitals to see if there are any trials on meds for PBC, but there are not. In the near future I would like to raise funds and awareness for others newly diagnosed.

My condition has been listed as inactive and stable. I really haven't noticed any side effects although in the last year I was diagnosed with Osteoarthritis and Lupus which is another auto-immune disease. The side effcts from the arthritis and lupus almost mirror the Urso side effects so now I couldn't tell if the Urso is causing them.

My thick hair is thinner, more straight than curl.  I don't like it, but cannot stop taking it. So far its worked on the blood levels.

It took about 12 months for my numbers to return to normal but since then, all tests have been normal. My only side effect has been an upset stomach when taken without food; easily remedied by taking with meals. I take 500 mg twice a day.  Once in a while I miss a dose.  I never take both doses at the same time (full 1000mg).  Tried it once and made me nauseous and headachy. Listen to doctors about PBC, not the web.

I have been taking it going 3 weeks and I continue to feel more tired than the day before. I was wondering after reading how it could be dangerous to a person if I took certain Antabioits along with other drugs example..xanax,paxil,thioroid, calcitrol,2 calcium 600 mg with Vitimin D in it 2 in AM  2 at bed time. However, back to Calcitrol, I use it 3 times aweek. I hope I made a little sense. I'm just concered as to why I feel so tired from  the time I get up and all day. If you could help me, I' curious if you could just let me know at your convince. I know some of the main reasons for what I have is due to drinking. I drinked wine from may 1980 to Dec. tthen I started one half year later drinkin mixed drinks. I had never drinked in my whole life But, Sept.25th 1985 I quit, COLD TURKEY and I have not drinked since.Due to a car wreck in 1970 I took too many TYLENOL over a peroid of years and found out how it could effect a person's Liver. I aam taking ALEVE since I can't take ASPARIN.Again, I appreciate your and hope I hear from you....Thank You..Patsy Moore
