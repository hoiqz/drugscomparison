Pain	aglass, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	10/25/2010 4:28:28 PM	Been taking this medication for 5 plus yrs off and on due to stenosis and a car accident. Already have had 2 back surgeries and am contimplating a fusion.along w/ the vicodin I also take curimin supplements which I have found relieves all my inflamation in my lower back to the point that I have been able to decrease the amount of vicodin that I take. My suggestion for anyone with alot of inflamation to go to a reputable health food store and take curimin it truly does work.
Pain	pyper1, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	9/1/2010 8:57:01 AM	I developed severe back pain after a car accident which aggravated an old injury to my back. I have been on vicodin now for about 6 mos. and have found pain relief to be sufficeint although there are those times when the pain stills expresses itself after taking the medication. I do not abuse my medication and often wait until I feel the first tendrills of pain before taking the vicodin. I believe that using the medication in this way has kept it effective for the long period that I have been taking it.
Pain	greatzoron, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/1/2010 6:23:53 PM	Have been taking Vicodin now for 10 years.  Was in a car accident and my knee was crushed.  The ONLY way I can work is to have some pain relief as I am in pain 24/7/365. That is reality.  We are addicts but it is so we can function and work.  I don't abuse any of the meds I take.  Have severe high blood pressure, which goes through the roof when I'm in pain.And I work in health care and see the best Dr's.  Hopefully I can last 10 more years and retire but I have to work.  Vicodin HP has been a god send for me.  Take it TID with Tramadol.  Don't be afraid to take pain meds. thats what they were invented for, people!!!!!  Plus my mood is so much better because I'm not focusing on the pain.  I can function and concentrate on the task at hand. Please get the addict word out of your head.  If you need to function, hold a job, be somewhat pain free (for chronic pain) this is a very good drug.  Oh and I guess I'm addicted to Blood pressure meds. as I have to take them also. ;)  Have also tried MS Contin timed release which was the best pain med ever but constipated me so bad I had to stop.OK story over.

Should I stop taking this drug because of the heart palps?  I just had a complete heart checkup w/catherization.  My heart is fine.  Thanks
Pain	 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		7/15/2009 3:23:15 PM	I have tried some different pain meds to manage my chronic back pain, and Vicodin HP seems to be the most effective for me.  It doesn't cause me any nausea or drowsiness, and it decreases my pain level enough so that I can actually work. It also allows me to continue running (which I really enjoy) and work out at the gym.  The med also helps me sleep through the night as it prevents me from waking up in severe pain every two hours.

Pain	dlew, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/1/2009 5:21:26 PM	I use Vicodin HP 7.5-750 to treat all the nerve pain I have due to two liver transplants.  Yes, not one but two!!  This drug is the only pain medication that kills my pain and I mean kills it.  I've been subsribed Vicodin since my first liver transplant in June 2004. They aboslutely kill the pain in my stomach, spine and pelvic areas.  After all this time; plus three hernia surguries after the transplants vicodin still very effective medication.  it's the best I've found except for the injections and my labs continue to be perfect!  But ask if I could quit taking them, honestly I don't know.  They are very addictive!

Pain	dave, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	2/9/2009 9:35:46 PM	I have 2 thoracic herniated discs. Since they are herniated towards the front, surgery is not an option. They went untreated without healing themselves for 3-5 years so it has damaged my spinal cord. When I complained to my Dr. about the pain, he treated me as if I was &quot;drug-seeking&quot;. Years later an MRI revealed the damage. About 8 months ago I was given Vicodin 500 which was useless for a 225 lb man. My Dr. switched me to Vicodin HP and it has helped a lot. One thing I will say is it went through steps. For the first 3 months it took the pain away and I felt a &quot;buzz&quot; which I didn't like. The 3rd - 6th months it took the pain away without any side effects. Now It doesn't seem to help nearly as much but I fear increasing to anything else because I don't want to build to much of a tolerance at 35 yrs of age. I have faith that my discs will heal themselves, but if they don't I fear living life without medication to mask the pain. When I have a good day now and I don't take the Vicodin, I feel my pain intensify greatly. This is a good drug but you can build an immunity to it quickly which can lead to stronger things without willpower. I reccomend not taking anything unless you absolutely need it. I had severe pain before, nut not everyday. Now that I've been treated, rarely does a day go by that I don't experience severe pain.
Pain	MICHAEL C., 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/13/2008 3:21:53 AM	I INITIALY STARTED WITH VICODIN 7.5/750mg. 5 TIMES A DAY FROM A HERNIATED DISC, THAT I HAD SUFFERED FROM AN INJURY AT WORK. I THEN DEVELOPED SPONDYLOSIS OF THE LOWER LUMBAR SPINE, (3 VERTABRAES)RESULTING IN 4 HERNIATED DISCS. AT WHICH THEN I WAS SWITCHED TO VICODIN H.P. 20mg. 3 TIMES A DAY FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS. JUST OVER A YEAR AGO I WAS INVOLVED IN A SEVERE MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT, THAT RESULTED IN MANY BROKEN BONES,INCLUDING 2 FRACTURED NECK VERTABRAE'S,CRUSHED EYE SOCKETS,AND MULTIPLE ROAD RASH SKIN REMOVAL. I ENDED UP WITH A TOTAL OF SEVEN SURGERIES, INCLUDING FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION,COLLAR BONE TITANIUM PLATE INSTALLATION, AND RECOVERY FROM 4 BROKEN RIBS. ALONG WITH CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT THAT INVOLVES TAKING MS CONTIN.(EXTENDED RELEASE MORPHINE SULFATE)100mg. 2 TIMES A DAY. THE VICODIN H.P. PROVIDES ME WITH WONDERFUL BREAK THROUGH PAIN MANAGEMENT.AS I HAD SAID, I TAKE 20mg. OF VICODIN H.P. EVERY 4-6 HOURS AS NEEDED. ALTHOUGH THE MEDICINE DOES PROVIDE EXCELLENT PAIN REDUCTION FOR BREAK THROUGH PAIN, IT DOES NOT GIVE ME THE &quot;DRUGGED UP&quot; DIZZENESS THAT OTHER BREAK THROUGH PAIN MEDICATIONS CAUSED.I.E;ROXICODONE OR PERCOCET. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE VICODIN H.P. FOR EITHER BREAK THROUGH PAIN MANAGEMENT, OR COMPLETE PAIN RELIEF MANAGEMENT ON IT'S OWN, TO ANYONE WHO IS SEEKING PAIN RELIEF, WITHOUT THE &quot;DRUGGED UP&quot;FEELING THAT OTHER MEDICINE'S MAY CAUSE.IT IS SIMPLEY A WONDERFUL PAIN RELIEVING MEDICATION.............

Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/28/2008 7:14:50 PM	I have used this drug off and on for many years.  I have used it for migraine, post surgery pain and broken bone pain.  It is very effective and allows me to function.  The best way to describe the effect is that I feel the pain becomming numb.  My cognitive function remains high while under its influence.  It gave my life back to me!

I used to be on oxycontin for my pain but it made me lethargic and lazy. this medication has given me my life back and keeps the pain at bay to boot. I recommend this medication to anyone with moderate to severe pain but with a fear of C2 narcotics.
