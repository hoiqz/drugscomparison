Chronic Inflammation of the Joints due to Gout	Fred, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Male	55-64	4/6/2012 10:01:32 AM	Colchicine caused severe vomiting and diarrhea. On refelction I would have rather have dealt with the pain -  the pain was horrendous. Allopurinol has done the business for me. I wouldnt recommend colchicine to my worst enemy.

It takes a day for the pain and inflammation to fade away, but it does work great. The only side effect that I get, only when I take more than I am prescribed by the doctor, is a severe case of diarrhea. I do reccommend this drug to anyone who does suffer from it though.

It really took the gout away but the side effects of stomach and diarhhea are brutal. Still, when I have a really bad attack I'll take it again becasue it works.
