I had a severe allergic reaction to them all. (Hives covering my entire body) I feel like my self again! The me I liked! Not tired, stuck, crying for no reason, or on the flip unable to make my mind slow down...I still deal with depression/mania with the lack of a mood stablizer, but I'd say my combo makes me able to function! I do agree tho that if I could I would definitely prefer thc in it's natural form!

I was given a prescription of 10 mg Marinol and I personally found using medical marijuana actually is what helps me and is so much cheaper than the $1400 price for ONE month supply of Marinol. I can have quite a lot more relief from medical marijuana which has many different blends/hybrids you can find one to help.

On one hand, it does seem to lessen the diarrhea symptom of colitis.  On the other hand, I can't stand the side effects.  I have to take it in the evening after all difficult tasks (mental or coordination-wise) are complete.  I am really struggling with the next day hangover, and here it is almost 4pm and I'm still dizzy.  I'm also really unmotivated, and would be able to sleep the day away, even though I had a good night's sleep last nite.

Other	 (Patient) 	3	5	4			10/27/2011 9:55:15 AM	For those looking for a high, dronabinol (Marinol) is not the way to go. Those of us with true medical issues may indeed notice some relief. I cannot say that there was a major decrease in my pain, but my body feels more relaxed, thus not in as much discomfort. Sleep is more restful. Day and night-time spasticity are reduced. I have noticed that after 10 days or so, the effects wane. Halting my use for 2-3 days, has been working for me. I had had to do the same with tramadol (Ultram), but discontinued its use when I achieved no more than 1 day benefit.  I live in Michigan and believe that cannabis offers easier and more convenience titrates. It also offer more ways of use. I do not like having to choose between pain and jail. As a man made product, dronabinol lacks most of the attributes of cannabis. A major plus is in the fact that dronabinol being legal to have in your blood system, and it is safe to purchase. This pill means not having to choose between pain and jail. I use a daily 2.5 capsule. I wish I could also get the 10mg so that I could use it as a topical. This pill cost me a monthly $10 co-pay. Fibrogirl, wrote that Marinol has been a Miracle Drug for her, then followed with since I don't have HIV or the big C it is illegal for me to take in Illinois.  Not true! Most any doctor can prescribe dronabinol. If it can be prescribed, it is legal to take. 
Other	Lula, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	9/8/2011 4:52:02 PM	Why are doctors prescribing medication of kind to the older people, knowing that bad side effects are usually tripled on elders?Doctors are too quick to prescribe medication that is habit forming, espcecially to older people.  Ninety percent of the Nursing Home guests are taking Zanax.  Why?  In my opinino they can keep the people sedated so they will not bother to ask for assistance.  I have had to get my aunt off of Valium, Seriax, Zanax and Thorazine each time.  She was falling due to being so tranquilized and breaking bones.  My advice to all these doctors is to back off perscribing these to the older people or anyone else for this matter. We have more percription drug addicts on the street today than street drugs.  All you have to do is work in the medical field to know and witness this.  This is cruel.

Other	Happy4U, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	4/20/2011 2:13:24 AM	After trying Vicodin (many side effects), Morphine (also has side effects) for Chronic Pancreatitis pain I asked my GI Dr in Portland Oregon about Dronabinol and she Rx me 2.5 mg 3x's a day. I took it a few days and I didn't notice much. I was able to sleep at night better though after it kicking in although I took two pills before going to sleep. I decided one day after having severe abdominal pain to increase it to 3 pills all at once and w in an hour I had a very bad reaction. I had difficulty breathing, emotional crying, my heart was racing to 139 bpm, and collapsed/blacked out in the car. I felt as if I was going to die. I was rushed to the hospital by my husband and kids. I had felt as time was going super slow and had day ja vu repetition of the time of check in at the hospital. I was so scared. I know it was my fault for taking 3 pills at once but was expecting a relief in pain and not the outcome of this feeling. I was given Valium IV at the hospital. I have since been skeptical about taking Dronabinol again. I'm currently  taking Morphine although I know it has more side effects and liver damage than if I were to take Dronabinol. I was told at the Hospital I had an allergic reaction to it but also because I took 3 all at once. I asked the Pharmacist about it and he mentioned that it works as if it were stairs working its way up since it's still in our system it accumulates per day, so yes I need to take as prescribed. So far I have used it as a rubbing ointment for pain in my shoulders and have gone without pain for up to 6 hours. I plan to give it another try and hope it helps me with my abdominal pain. My Insurance Thankfully covered it and all I paid was $15 through Kaiser Ins. I hope this info is helpful.

The drug works wonders.MIRICLE DRUG RIGHT FROM GOD TO A PILL!!! I've had no side effects. It worked the very first time I used it. Only took an hour to kick in after you chew it not swallow.with hot coffee..makes the drugs work faster.any drug.i take 10mg and sometimes more is needed for high tolerance for meds!! You can apply anywhere in the US for disability for the condition you have and once approved medicaide pays for it.so does united health. Just call local social security  office to c what you need to do to qualify. It works in RI. You can also get on medical marijuana program. Ask ur dr. For form and have him sign,dateand list condition.u may have to get form from dept.of health. Not a pb just call local office&amp;they'll mail it out to you. The real thing works just as well. If you can't offord marinol.a sript is about 2300.00 dollars. With medicade it's free or co pay.if you don't have a job or haven't worked in awhile that's ok. They will go by income not work credits.so it would be SSI. If no income still np they will give you a income for disability. Also remember not to use their doctors.u can use any dr you want. Don't let them tell you otherwise.if you live in RI or CONN a great MS. Dr. Is dr.guarnaccio..kathy wall is the best.nurse who takes care of all ur needs.

It prolonged his life for many years just by getting back his appetite, He didn't feel high, unsteady or any crazy feelings although it did help his back pain, I am very grateful the Doctor prescribed it. Make sure to take it no more than 30 minutes before you eat. I think he may have gained a few pounds too.

And best of all it the high you get from the meds is feels close to pot which is key to dealing with these headaches. I live in CA and I am getting my medicinal pot card. but I'm using Marinol for now. the only gripe is that depending on the dosage, it takes at least 2.5 hours to kick in it gets absorbed through the liver so that is why it takes so long. It works great but it nothing compared to the real thing.

Also, painful neuropathy in my left leg from the knee down.  The pain meds work, however the side effects make it very difficult to concentrate or focus...a 'scattered-buzzed' feeling.  I had to use marijuana to eliminate those side effects...and it also helped with pain management.  Although I didnt like having to 'smoke' it.  When I was prescribed Marinol, it worked exactly like marijuana.  The Marinol does produce a slight 'high' but this is much more manageable and acceptable than just the pain meds alone.  The Marinol actually eliminates the 'scattered' feeling and I can think clearly and focus easily now.

I didn't like the side-effects of short-term memory issues and feeling 'altered.'  It was worth it when it got bad enough and worked very well and fast when used, despite the disliked side effect of using it.  I had no trouble stopping but only used it occasionally.  I was told to keep it in the fridge and that makes it harder if needed when I'm out of the house-- usually at medical appts.

It helped control the nausea &amp; dizziness along with learning not 2 rise 2 quickly from a sitting or lying down position, not turning my head from side 2 side, and afer a long period of not being able 2 drive, learning 2 just use the mirrors. Still not able 2 drive if it is raining, or riding for long periods of time, or riding in the back seat of a vehicle.

I have had 4 surgeries and going on my 5th.  I have been on all kinds of narcotics and nerve medications and nothing has touched the pain.  After some research I found out about MARINOL and I've been taking it for about 3 months. It's pretty much been a maricle drug i can get through a day pretty much pain free if i keep up with the dosage.

It is very effective also reserch suggests that marijuana helps slow tumor growth in the brain so maybe it helps with that as well I have never been tested for results from the marinol but it could be helping.

I reccomend this to anyone struggling with treatment.
Increased Hunger	checky, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	10/14/2007 9:28:41 AM	I had cancer surgery to remove a lung, afterwards I was sick and could not eat, food made me nauseous. I had loss so much weight and was really weak.  I was admitted on a Friday and by Saturday after taking the pill overnight, it was like night and day, I was feeling great!  Absolutely no nausea and my appetite came back immediately.  I recommend this pill if nothing else is working to increase your appetite and I thank my doctor for suggesting it.
