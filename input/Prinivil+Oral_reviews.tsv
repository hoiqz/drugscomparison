High Blood Pressure	Jeremy, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	5/28/2012 1:35:02 PM	I was diagnosed with high BP 200+ about a year and a half ago. Put on Amlodopine 20 mg initially with a small improvement and later with Lisinopril at 20 mg. BP still running in the 140 to 160 range so Bendroflumethiazide 2.5 added which was the drug from hell made me impotent, somewhat indifferent to life in general and I could not venture out without knowing where the nearest urinal was and it did nothng for my BP. Now on Lisinopril 40 mg and 20 mg Amlodopine no side effects and BP below 135. Thinking about just Lisinopril as it works for me but I have to have an annual check for kidney damage. OK so far

High Blood Pressure	RAS, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/25/2012 3:22:21 PM	I'm actually quite surprised at all of the side effects that other users are experiencing. I have not experienced any, that I'm aware of. I have been taking 5mg of  Lisinopril for 14 months now. My BP was high, but not severe. My BP now is around the 120/80 range give or take 10 on either. I guess I'm one of the success stories. I felt like a new man once I was put on Lisinopril.

It was effective in doing so, but after a few months caused a horrible hacking cough that made me absolutely miserable. I couldn't even sleep. I discontinued it about two weeks ago now and the cough still remains. I'm not sure it is getting better.

I feel much better &amp; it has controlled my BP, but the cough/post nasal drip may be the deal breaker on this one. Too bad, because othewise it has worked great for me. I also wonder what it does to the lungs over time.

I had a SUDDEN  SEVERE allergic reaction. My tongue began swelling and within an hour I could not talk or swallow. I spent an afternoon in the ER getting IV prednisone and benadryl followed by prednisone and benadryl orally for a week.

My doctor told me to go home and gargle salt water! I changed doctors and the first thing he said after asking why I was there and what I was taking, &quot;It's the Lisinopril.  Let me give you something else!&quot; My husband is a diabetic and has really bad high blood pressure. He's been on Lisinopril for nearly 3 years.  Last Sat. I woke up to find him feeling his face and looking at his tongue which was swollen to nearly 5 times the normal size.  He couldn't swallow and could barely talk. I took him to the ER immediately - the triage nurse asked if he took lisinopril - we said yes and she said, &quot;We see this a lot!  About 50% of the people who come in with this problem (angioedema) are on the lisinopril.  He also has trouble with swelling in his feet and hands; has balance problems and has fallen several times.  I want to watch him to see if being off the lisinopril helps with these other problems!!  They should take it off the market!!
Other	all sewn up, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	2/26/2011 8:23:06 AM	All doctors insist that I take meds to prevent kidney failure since I am a type I diabetic.  Lisinipril made me very tired all of the time and foggy headed.  I could not concentrate at work, and eventually ended up quitting my job because I thought I couldn't handle it any longer.  I also experienced tightness of my muscles and tendons in my legs while taking this.  Everything improved when I finally realized it was the medicine that caused this and stopped taking it.
High Blood Pressure	protex, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	55-64	2/23/2011 10:15:28 AM	I work in a high stress professional field. I was put on 30 mg of lisinopril, and within 2 months had gained over 20 pounds with my regular 3 mile a day walk and work out. I felt as though I was working thru a thick fog and lost a lot of ability to concentrate. I dropped off the foul stuff, and feel like I am re-involved with life again. A good cigar with an after dinner drink is better to control things with than not being able to work or function properly. Horrible stuff.
High Blood Pressure	lkbarr, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	1/25/2011 7:08:38 PM	I had severe anxiety after taking this drug once.  When I slept I had nightmares and awake I had panic attacks about completely illogical things (what to wear, etc.)  The doctor and pharmacist said this was a rare reaction.  I'm someone who normally worries about stuff, but this medicine amplified a casual worry till it was fear beyond reason. Doctor took me off the medicine and gave me something else.  It did lower my pressure for 24 hours, though!

Recently though can't tolerate.  Developed very severe fatigue and brain fog - as if my battery (power source) was pulled and I just wound down.  Stopped drug and symptoms stopped.  Restarted and they reappeared after 3 weeks.  Wish I could keep taking it as  it's very low-cost but the side-effects I'm encountering have rendered it intolerable for me now.
High Blood Pressure	Better alternative, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	10/19/2010 12:58:28 PM	I was on a generic version for 2 years of misery. Tried other drugs (beta blocker) but had terrible side effects. Went to a combo of generic lisinopril + hydrochlorothiazide + generic form of norvasc. The lsinopril was the most effective component but side effects built up over time (severe anxiety, palpitations and muscle cramps). Dr. said I could be reacting to the filler in the generic version or to the drug molecule itself. The molecule in the generic is slightly different from that in the name brand. Since it was so effective at lowering BP she suggested we try the name brand version. It's like night and day. 95% of the bad side effects went away within 1 week with equally effective BP control. The only disadvantage is the extra cost ($38 per mo vs. $6).

Had a retinal detachment that was NOT caused by trauma/diabetes ect. Read up on possible causes of retinal detachment and severe caughing was one cause listed When I complained about my hacking caugh my doctor seemed to know Lisinopril was the cause. He changed my meds to eliminate Lisinopril and I do not cough nearly as much. I blame Lisinopril for my de-tachment. My operation to re-attach my retina is another issue...my doctor NEVER told me to stop taking Plavix before my eye operation and of courst my operation failed! I am blind in my right eye THANX LISINOPRIL AND PLAVIX

It has helped bring down my BP, but the aches &amp; pains, coughing and lethargy make me wonder if it's worthwhile to keep taking it.
High Blood Pressure	s kenney, 65-74 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1		65-74	7/11/2010 10:56:16 PM	I am now on my second bottle of lisinopril, which entails about 3 months.  I noticed a few weeks ago that I started with an alergy, or I thought it was an alergy. I started coughing, a tickle, then sneezed, then watery eyes.I felt nauseated and had very thick clear saliva that felt like I was choking. I had no idea it was from the pills, but decided to look it up anyway and was shocked to find out that other people had experienced the same symptoms.  Since it was July, i really thought it was an allergy. I also have swelling of my ankle, although that is why my dr. put me on it because I was presenting with high B/P and swelling of the ankle.  I will stop taking it and ask my dr. for something else.  I am also having joint pain and will mention this also to the dr.

If you take and experience any swelling, discontinue and see your dr!!!

Cut back to 10mg daily only helps lower pressure at a minimum. Still dealing with ocassional dizzy spells and fatigue.
High Blood Pressure	sureshot, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	65-74	11/10/2009 1:49:00 PM	I took 20mg for 8 days and when I got up from a sofa and started to walk I passed out and hit my head on a stair picket and cut my forehead severely. Was rushed to the hospital where i received 8 stitches and had to spend night in hospital for observation.  Was x-rayed, cat-scanned, etc.  After being examined by three MDs was told that the problem was the dosage of Lisinopril (20mg)as it had lowered my blood pressure to low to fast. When I passed out the second time my blood pressure was 6o over 40.  Now I have a permanent scar on my forehead and a $6,000 hospital bill.  I have been in perfect health for 65 years (I jog, do yoga and tai chi)...but when I turned 65 I went to get my &quot;free&quot; welcome to medicare checkup where the Dr. found that I had &quot;border line&quot; high blood pressure and he prescribed the 20mg of Lisinopril. If I had fell in a different direction, I wouldn't be writing this review, I would be in a cemetery.  When I visited the MD who prescribed the medication he showed almost no conern (he has three offices and sees one patient every 15 minutes); hence, how can he keep track of each patient.  Yes we have a health care crisis but, at times, the Drug Companies and MDs can make matters worse.  I stopped taking the medication.  The bottom line is that the medication can lower blood pressure...but an unintended consequence may kill you.  You are better off trying to lower your blood pressure by changing your lifestyle as opposed to taking this medication.  The MD never warned me that I may get dizzy and pass out...I guess I am lucky that I am still alive as it could have been worse.  Whatever happened to the motto &quot;first do no harm&quot;

After starting a rigorous exercise program and adding more fruit and vegetables to my diet, my blood pressure dropped so low that the doctor stopped all blood pressure medicine. I am now only taking 20 mgs of lisinopril a day which also keeps my kidneys clear of protien, and i feel great!!

I've noticed my sciatica has worsened but am not sure it's related to this medication.  My Dr. decided to switch me to Cozaar but I didn't go that direction since it is extremely expensive and is known to cause the dry cough, too.  All in all, the lisinopril that I'm taking is working OK...and is kinder to my diabetic kidneys than the previous med, Tenormin, that I took for many years.
