Prevention of Streptococcus Pneumoniae Infection	sasmom98, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	9/14/2012 5:23:31 PM	I am a 40 year old female with minor asthma and otherwise healthy.  I was vaccinated with pneumovax 23 5 1/2 years ago and then re-vaccinated yesterday.  The pain I am feeling today is 10 times worse than the original vaccination pain 5 years ago.  I needed help dressing and could not sleep more than an hour at a time the first night.  Even piggybacking ibuprofin and acetaminaphin every 4 hours is offering little relief.  Now on day two I am running a fever of 101 F and I am extremely exhaused and a touch nauseated.  Yuck!  This second round is nothing like the first one was.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/30/2012 4:42:04 PM	Allergist prescribed this due to me having 6 sinus infections within the last 7 months.  Some were so severe I had to take steroids in addition to antibiotics.  I wish the pharmacist had given me the drug information.  Got it on a Wednesday at 6pm.  It is now Saturday 4:30pm and I still feel terrible.  24 hours after the injection my right arm hurt so badly I could not sleep, wash my hair, dress myself, and was in tears.  This was not the normal pain you may be in after a vaccination.  The pain radiated up to my shoulder and down to my elbow.  I've been running a fever, feel achy all over, have a throbbing headache, and am basically miserable.  I would not have gotten the vaccine had I known I would feel this bad afterwards.  I don't know how much longer this is going to last.  I may get someone to drive me to an Urgent Care office in a few hours.

There is a bit of redness and tenderness at the site of injection.  It only hurts when I touch it, other than that, my arm feels fine.I did sleep a lot today but no fever.  Had a bad headache this morning but no other symptoms to report.  This is only day 2, so I guess we'll see...so far, everything seems ok..

Other	Thankful, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	3/25/2011 11:21:57 AM	I have been taking this injection since age 26 and I am now 41.  I've never exprienced and problems with the vaccine. I need this to live my daily life as I do not have a spleen and can't fight infections as some can.  However I also know exactly when this vaccine is wearing off and it becomes time for me to receive my next injection as every month I get very sick.  In reading the first few reviews, my heart goes out to those that expirenced paid behind taking the injection. As for me I'd rather experience that pain for a few days then catch pneumonia and can't fight it due to a compromised immune system.  Thanks for allowing me to voice my opinion on this injection.

PA put me on zithromax and prednisone. I had no problem with the first injection six years ago, but I will not take it again. My first injection was given intramuscularly and this one was given subcutaneously.  I don't know it that made the difference or what.

Within a week he was in the ER, eventually spent 10 1/5 months in hospital/rehab, 4 months on ventilator.  Guillain Barre Syndrome.  He is in a wheelchair with crippled hands.  Would NEVER take!!
Prevention of Streptococcus Pneumoniae Infection	sandy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	65-74	1/16/2011 10:14:34 AM	My doctor recommended I have pneumovax at my yearly physical for first time. Entire upper arm sore to touch two days after. Had chills and extreme dry mouth for two days. Probably would not have again.  
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	10/9/2010 4:00:17 PM	Got the shot on Wednesday and I still can't move my arm 3 days later.  Pain is excruciating!  Maybe they need to mix xylocaine in with this vaccination, this is more painful than Rocephin!  
Prevention of Streptococcus Pneumoniae Infection	PamW, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	9/22/2010 7:02:45 AM	I am a 65-year-old woman in general good health.  My doctor recommended this preventive vaccine during my annual check up yesterday.  Within 2 hours I experienced enough pain at the site (upper right arm) to make driving very difficult.  Sleepless all night because of excruciating pain.  Unable to dress myself or do any activity which requires me to raise my arm.  Tylenol and Advil don't touch the pain.  When my doctor's office opens this morning I will have a neighbor drive me to get something to make the pain more manageable.  Cannot sleep or rest.  Cannot drive.  Cannot work.  I have never had a reaction to a vaccine before.  
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	5/13/2010 9:06:27 AM	I was given this shot because my bloodwork came back as having a low immune system. I'm always having sinus infections, so my ENT doctors recommened this shot. I didn't have any pain on day 1. The middle of the night is when I started to expirence the pain in the arm. Horrible pain, couldn't touch it, couldn't raise my arm to do anything. Day 3 I have reddness and some swelling, it's hot. This is no where near the shot site, it's under my arm, I don't know if this is normal or not. I also have chills. I would never get this shot again.
Prevention of Streptococcus Pneumoniae Infection	Sandy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	65-74	4/21/2010 3:28:20 PM	I am a 71 yr old female in excellent health; had this 'booster' following annual physical yesterday, to prevent possible pneumonia.  Within one hour after injection in upper left arm, site of shot became hot, red and swollen.  Swelling spread to nearly elbow, and, site became hard. Called MD office immediately on noting symptoms, and they recommended:  Tylenol, ice the arm, elevate it.  Did all that, helped the pain somewhat. Pain is still pretty severe on this the second day.  Called nurse at MD office today; she said 'sometimes people have bad reaction' and MD will call back this afternoon.  I want to get this info on the record.I am grateful to read others' experience, it helps to know that mine is not particularly an abnormal reaction, but I surely feel sorry for all of us who have had this kind of pain.  Also, grading an immunization by using the stars is not an entirely accurate method of judging this drug.  I don't know if it will be effective or not.  God knows I hope so, after the discomfort!This has been most unpleasant, and I did NOT have this kind of reaction with the intial shot five years ago; at that time, I just felt a general malaise as it is termed.  This arm pain feels as though I have pitched 40 games in a row...

As precaution for overseas travel took Pneumo-23 in right arm, and varicella in left. By afternoon right arm hurt, was hot, and changing color. Next afternoon had 103.4 fever. Arm hurt from elbow to shoulder. Also red color for most of upper arm. Laid up in bed for next 3 days with ice packs on head. Two days of 103.4, and one day of 101 fever. Naturally this occured over a weekend. Went in to clinic Monday morning and started an antibiotic. Likely the sickest I have been as an adult. The previous 3 years I had not been ill with anything. I normally don't take any medications. I am in generally good health, low blood pressure. Scared the bee gees out of me. I wonder if with the high fever either vaccine was effective. I sure won't take it again. Maybe not any vaccine.

I had my first pneumovax in 2003 and I have not had one bout of pneumonia since!  I used to get pneumonia 2-3 times per year.  I just received another vaccine yesterday and my arm is extremely painful and swollen - my entire arm all the way down into my hand and fingers.  Warm compress has helped a bit.
Other	Jack, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	10/18/2009 11:32:30 AM	I had the shot Oct 2. 4 days later my left arm pit lymphnode swelled followed by a lymph node in my cheek.  Then the shot site hurt.  Dr gave me Doxycyline. Following day my left calf and quad muscles starting getting tight.  I reported the change in symptons.  Next day could not walk due to both leg muscles being too tight. Went to ER. They gave me steroids and reported body inflamation being 2x and white cell count being high. Steroids took care of symptons, muscle relaxers took care of muscles.  However the steroids gave me a yeast infection and I am male!!  This is a terrible vaccine.  I only recommend it to my enemies.  Merck should be ashamed of themselves. 
Prevention of Streptococcus Pneumoniae Infection	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	9/26/2009 10:51:10 AM	I had extreme pain and swelling in my arm to the point I couldn't move it or use it to lift anything and woke up several times throughout the night in extreme pain that couldn't even be relieved by opiate pain meds. I iced it, I tried hot compresses, nothing helped.  I also had a 101 fever from the vaccine. It has been 3 days and I'm still in severe pain but the fever is gone at least. Hopefully this horrible vaccine will at least prevent pneumonia!

Prevention of Streptococcus Pneumoniae Infection	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	9/2/2009 8:22:03 PM	Three days after I had a pneumovax injection, I began having a very strange symptom every night in bed, before going to sleep. Every minute or so, as I'm lying there, I feel a sudden jolt, much like an electric shock, that feels like it makes an arc through the middle of my brain. It lasts only about a second and strikes every minute or so, until I fall asleep. I've now had this symptom every night for 10 nights. I googled &quot;brain zap&quot; and found many descriptions of this symptom but almost all of them written by people trying to wean themselves off antidepressants. I've never taken antidepressants and don't take any drugs other than an occasional aspirin. I'm a very healthy 68 year old woman. I've never experienced anything like this before and it came on suddenly and with intensity.

Prevention of Streptococcus Pneumoniae Infection	charles, 45-54 Male  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	5/18/2009 11:01:37 PM	May 3, 2007 my 10 month old son received three vaccines. One injection intended for the right thigh caused the needle to shoot off the syringe and the vaccine sprayed me and the clinic wall and floor. Seven weeks later the right femur could not support his weight, and he continued to cry the next morning. To cut a long story short, the surgeon who investigated the bone said it was the consistency of cheese. full leg cast for 3 months, two surgical investigations, CT and NMR scans, no evidence of microbe histopathologically although one culture grew (common) microbe found in mouth. Unclear which vaccine was injected into the periosteum and box not checked on vaccination card for whether it was PCV or PPV23 nor for the previous pneumococcal vaccination. Doctor told me nurse was let go on a later visit. Neither the surgeon, nor the clinical immunologist believed he experiences a microbial infection. I suspect my sons 3rd pneumoccocal vaccination was probably the 23valent and it caused a massive inflammatory reaction in the periosteum which spread to the femur. 
Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	13-18	1/24/2009 1:01:06 PM	Started with managable pain and swelling at the site but day two brought severe pain that was made worse by touch and stiffness. The pain had spread from a site reaction up my arm to the shoulder and down to the elbow. Day three has also included nausea, vomiting, and low fever. Ibuprofen has helped only slightly to reduce the pain.
Prevention of Streptococcus Pneumoniae Infection	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	45-54	10/25/2008 6:50:35 AM	Pain at the injection site was manageable with massage &amp; Ibuprophen. You must massage the injection site 4-5 times in the first 24 hours after injection. This minimizes the amount of medication left in the arm, and helps 100% with the swelling. I've had 3 of these shots in the last 14 years, all with the same effect. I'll continue to use it as long as I can.

Injection site became quite painful about 6 hours later, interferring with sleep, dressing, and my generally sunny mood. My upper arm is quite swollen and movement is limited, but I have no other side effects. Ibuprofen helps a little, as does a cold compress.
