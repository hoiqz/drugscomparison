Other	25-34 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	10/25/2011 11:33:49 PM	I had a massive amount of mucus sitting on my lungs obstructing my respiration. Since I don't have insurance, I went to the local drugstore and asked three pharmacist for her opinion, and she recommended robitussin. I felt such a relief, and I'm glad I took it. I can feel the inflammation going down and the phlegm also. Were I to be placed in a similar circumstance in the future, I would take it again.

Cold Symptoms	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/28/2010 3:38:11 PM	I started going back to Robitussen because Mucinex (the miracle drug) just wasn't cutting it. It helped me keep working and improve without going into a more serious illness. Two thumbs up for the old Mom treatment. Thanks, Robitussin.

Within 24 hours, I developed nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness.  I couldn't get out of bed.  I have never felt so sick in my life.  It was scarey.  I stopped taking the cough medicine and it took two days for it to get out of my system and after that I felt fine.  Will never take any type of cough medicine again.
