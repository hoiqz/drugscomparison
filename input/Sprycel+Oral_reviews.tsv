Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia	Khaloud , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/6/2012 2:03:50 AM	At first like any medication you need to give your body time to adjust. For those that complain of yest infections wash you self with water every time you use the bathroom and dry with toilet paper. Don't just wipe with toilet paper.  I went to MD Anderson for a second opinion. I needed to know if i was taking all i need to take and if I could push my self or just lay  back and stay tired. After being told that I vould push my self I went back to the gym and started off as someone that just started working out. It takes time to get your body back to a normal routine. I did what I could and worked my way up. After a couple of weeks I was back to normal. Now I'm able to take two classes back to back and feel great. I do step, Total body wheight lifting, yoga, treadmill, eleptical,  my oncologist homogoligest  doctor put me on a dieratic for my water retention. You have to see a hemotioligest no just oncoligest.  If you could find on that is  both even better  I am not letting this control my life. I am trying to take control of it. I have my bad days, but very few. I was diagnosed in mid January of 2012.  My white count was back to normal within 3 months after taking the Sprycil . I have been in remition for 2 months now. I'm scheduled for another bone narrow on the 16th of this month in MD Anderson.  No one should ever give up. You can turn your self around. After all it could be worse. I am very thankful to god that Sprycil is available for our condition. I sometime forget that I have CML.

Minimal side effects on Sprycel. Full remission for 6 months now. Minor side effects: occasional nausea, heat intolerant. Able to fully function. This drug saved me :)

Four months later (11 mos. from diagnosis) there was no trace of CML left (PCRu). Some fatigue is main side effect, slight edema. Mainly, within two days of starting Sprycel, the brain fog lifted. Am very happy with Sprycel.

Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia	Tired, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	45-54	12/29/2009 12:03:32 AM	   I was switched to Sprycel after developing both resistance to Gleevec and intolerance of the highest dose. My first few months on the drug (at 140mg) were very unpleasant, with severe headaches, enlarged and tender breasts, and constant bouts of mild to moderate fever. I also developed anemia and mild heart problems. After resting from it several times and going down to 100mg/day, I now tolerate it well, and while my PH+ number tends to rise in Winter I have generally low numbers of PH+ cells. I have been using it for more than 3 years now and am still stable. I have had CML for over 15 years.

I have a long history of migraines, that, w/ daily medication, have been under control since 2001.When I 1st started Sprycel, I had an almost constant mild migraine (yeah - an oxymoron) for 8 days. On the 9th day no migraine &amp; I've been migraine free since. I've had no other side-effects. At my diagnosis, 88% of the cells in my bone marrow were leukemic. At my last biospy in 12/08, only 6.5% of my bone marrow cells were leukemic. So the Sprycel is working!
Type of Leukemia - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia	kitkat25704@hotmail.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/5/2008 3:50:58 PM	I was diagnosed 3 years ago with CML, I was put on Gleevec which after one year my body rejected it. I was put on Sprycel 140mg. I was  Philiidelphia Chromazone positive with CML. After one year I was reduced to 100 mg, now there is no PH positive in my blood, my leukemia is holding it's own on just 50 mg. I have had no side effects while on this drug like I did with Gleevac. My hair has grown back in, my potassium levels never drop out of the normal range now like it did on the Gleevac. I am extremely satisfied with this drug, and because it's less expensive then the Gleevac, it should be the first offered when first diagnosed.  Patient
