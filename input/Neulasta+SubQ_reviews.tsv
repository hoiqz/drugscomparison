Decrease of Neutrophils in the Blood from Cancer Chemotherapy	Pete, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	65-74	8/27/2012 11:11:31 AM	Neulasta injection was given day following chemo. I felt really bad and hurt all over, joints, muscles, skin, etc. as though I had a bad case of flu. Before pain took over, I took hydrocodon-acetaminophen 5-500 every 4 hrs. I also took Zofran 8mg for nausea. In a few days,I felt better and best of all, the neulasta worked. Neutrophils were restored and I was able to continue chemo. Yes, I suffered a little, but the results were worth it!

I had intense bone pian in my legs after each time, the pain lasting longer each time. My doctor put me on oxycodone, ibuprofen, and claritin. It worked great to control the main. My last shot was on June 1st, 2012 and I am getting the exact same pain not quite as intense randomly 1-3 times a week. Now I am wondering just how long the effects of this shot can last.

No I do not like the aches in my bones. This weekend I will do very little. But next week I will be me again. The treatment is definetly not worse than the disease.

Didn't mind chemo but thought I would die within 1 hr of Neulasta. Was like flu but no vomiting. 2 - 3 degree rise in temperature for 1 week. Got infection but treated with antibiotics. Tossed and turned day &amp; night with pain all over &amp; sweating. Have always been active and strong but this brought me to my knees. Will start chemo again today but different injection other than Neulasta tomorrow. Makes you feel like giving up but the alternative (death) is much worse so will forge ahead. I should get rid of the medi-port after these next 4 IV's. Thank God I have a wonderful oncologist and surgeon.

With Dr.s aid I chose neupogen. I have to have injections everyday for 3-4 days following each chemo. However after reviewing these comment, I'm happy with my choice. Minimal side affects . Minor achiness but no major pain or increased vomiting. Everything that can go wrong has for me this last 6 months. Including incredibly low blood counts. Have had to postpone chemo many times before starting these injections. Now I'm golden. I highly reccomend speaking with your Dr. About neupogen rather than neulasta.

It was at the end of cycle 1.  It was the shot from hell.  I have NEVER experienced that type of pain before (I gave birth with no pain medication whatsoever). I hurt all over.  It hurt to breathe.  It hurt to move. I took acetaminophen to no avail.  I took ibuprofen to no avail.  The only thing that provided relief was vicodin.  I told my oncologist that if that is how it's going to be, I can't do it.  He listened and lowered the dose by half.  Subsequent shots have been much easier to tolerate.  I have mild pain which can be managed with ibuprofen and the shot raises my WBC to a range that is good.  I hope this post helps.

I've completed seven rounds of chemo (four rounds of two different cocktails) every two weeks and I'm ready to complete my final round of chemo this week and will be ready for surgery in a few weeks. I have never missed a chemo session and have taken Nuelasta 24 hours after each chemo session.  I have had good white cell counts with each round. I have experienced insomnia and mild aches and pains but with all the medications a chemo patient takes I can't attribute the insomina and shin splints to Nuelasta or if it's the steroids given during infusion.  Haven't been sick with flu or colds the entire period and love getting out and about.  I continue to take a healthly dose of calcium and drink at least 8 ozs of skim milk each day which may be the reason I have very little aches and pains.

Bad side effets.  Rapid heartbeat &amp; pulse rate 2 hours after taking.  Was told, just have to wait until drug wears off.  Went on for well over 2 weeks.  Could not sleep, eating was a problemWent to see Johns Hopkins doc, he confirmed Nulasta did it.  Said they don't give it at Hopkins. I would die before taking it again.At $3,000 to $7,000 a shot you would think they could do better.

Besides everyone else's pain/side effects I would like to add that I went deaf for 2 10-15 min. periods, and my head felt like it was in a vice for 6 days; seriously considered suicide but no bullet for the gun.  Arthritis areas felt like they were being ground with a mortor and pestal.  This was my first shot of this drug and it will be my last - death is better than the hell this drug does to you. I have given birth to 2 children with no pain medication, suffered migraines 24/7 for 20 years, and I would gladly have the pain from both for the rest of my life on a daily basis than take another dose of this drug.  My hearing is still not normal, will go to a dr. to have that checked, the chest pains were like having a heart attack, knees hurt where they never caused me trouble before...this is not worth it! If you have trouble with one dose, I wouldn't expect it to be any better with the 2nd one. Think twice about even taking this drug once!

I did not experience any pain or flu like symptoms. I have had  Neulasta 4times now. The last time my WBC went very high: 48.I was worried about this elevation but my MD told me not to worry. I probably won't  get it after my next treatment.

I had a splitting headache and felt like my insides were vibrating.  I ached from head to toe.  Got severe intestinal cramping. Finally my husband called the cancer center.  They said to treat the cramping like it was constipation.  Did so and then had diarrhea for 5 days straight.  9 days later, my blood count was way up, 17.9, so my doctor said he will cut down on the shot.  I'm tempted to try the 2nd round of chemo without the Neulasta.  I will for sure make certain that I don't get a full dose this time.

My MD told me this was from the Morphine I take.  This cannot be so, as I've been on Morphine for years, and never felt like this.I have had this drug TWICE now, and I am saying now that I WILL NEVER have it again.  True, it makes me feel more confident about going out in crowds, but I'd rather be a recluse than to feel like this.  I can also recall having chest and rib pain the last time I had it, but so far (only two days out now) I haven't had this yet.  Who knows what may happen, as the Neulasta seems to have long-term side effects--that is things show up days and even weeks after receiving this injection.The caregivers at the place I go to make it seem like a foregone conclusion, that I will get this no matter what.  But I refused it once already, as my white count was about 7 and I didn't need it.  I am an RN and I know what a good white count is and a bad one.  You have to speak up and say NO, I don't want it.  They make A TON of money on this, so naturally they want to give it out.

When I called to tell them about the pain I am in they said  &quot;That's Normal&quot; I have had a lot of pain in my life ,Herniated Disc 3 surgery's for that, natural child birth 2 times,and nothing has come close to the extreme pain I am in from this drug.The first few hours it started at my neck and headache then it has moved to all over my body, I have osteoporosis and bursitis in my hip and knee and at first thought that was what was causing my leg pain but it has never been this SEVERE! I will NOT be given this drug again and I will insist on information about any further Drug treatment they give to me.I have small cell Lung Cancer and have had four chemo-therapy treatments 3 days at a time.I had a Tumor on my neck that was choking me to death 8cmx3cm , The chemo has shrunk the tumor down and I greatly appreciate my Dr.s Efforts to save my life. But the quality of life is more important to me than the quantity. I want to be around for awhile,I'm 49 yrs old and have 5 grandchildren and another on the way in Sept.But to live in this kind of pain , how can I enjoy any time with them or even hold my new Grandaughter .My Advice to anyone is to ask questions and INSIST on answers.Make sure you know what you're getting into, I wish I had read the comments posted here before I took that shot. hind site is 20/20.Doctors should be required to give their patients all the information on any given drug and warn patients of side effects.

Four hours after the injection I had a bout with the most horrible diarreha I ever had, the pain was so intense I almost passed.  I was take to the e.r. by ambulance, the e.r. doc and my oncologist don't think it was realated to the shot, I am not sure I agree with them.  If my white counts are low when they are checked tomorrow I am seriously thinking about not having another shot.  The side effects from neulasta were worse than the chemo side effects.  After I read the patient information for neulasta I wonder why I did it in the first place.  Had I had that information before the shot I would not have had it.  I know there is higher risk for infection for me, so I am very cautious.  This drug does scare me, especially how it is made-this processs involves E Coli.

Maybe a little achiness around the injection site, similar to what I have with a flu shot. Other than that, no problems at all.I realize everyone's experience is different, and there are many folks who seem to be having bad experiences with Neulasta, but I can't help wondering if some of the bad effects described haven't been from the chemo people are taking, and not the Neulasta. If you're taking two drugs at once, how do you know which one is causing the side effect? I had many of the symptoms everyone is describing, with the same onset timeframes (Day 3 after infusion), from my first round of Taxol, which is known to cause myalgia and arthralgia (muscle and joint pains). I had horrible arthralgia; so bad I was up all night and couldn't sleep. Tried 800 mg ibuprofen, nothing. Tried Vicodin. Nada. When I was able to get in contact with my oncologist, she prescribed dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, which provided complete relief within hours. Wouldn't your oncologist suggest that the side effects might be from your chemo and not the Neulasta?I'm just saying, please make sure you've determined where your side effects are actually coming from so you can make an informed decision about using Neulasta or not.

I had a fever and felt awful for three days. With my second round, I received Neulasta the day after the chemo. The next day, I felt like I had the flu - bone aches (mostly my hips and pelvis, but also neck and long bones), and very bad headache. What worries me now is the abdominal pain I have this morning. I had stomach pain (mild) after the first round of chemo, and lost my appetite a little, but was able to eat. This pain sometimes doubles me over. I have been reading about the spleen damage that is rarely caused, and will call my doctor this morning.

Tylanol did not help and I instead needed narcotic medication to deal with the pain. My doctor has recommended Neupogen for my next round of Chemo.

I was NOT prepared emotionally for the intense pain, and debilitating effects of the Neulasta.  If I had not had help from my husband for even the simpliest tasks I don't know what I would have done.  I received my latest Neulasta injection 5 days ago.  I am finally starting to get some strength back, and don't feel AS winded.  My first round of Chemo didn't include Neulasta, and I went thru it like a breeze, but with Neulasta, not so good.  Looking down the road at 5 more cycles of Chemo, I just want to cry at the thought of getting Neulasta and it's side effects.  Any advice?

Three days later I had extreme pain throughout my body. In calling my oncologist he told me to up the Ibprofin. The following week I was in ER fighting for my life. It had ruptured my spleen. Seven units of blood later and emergency surgury I made it back to the living. I have quit chemo and turned to natural healing. Life is precious and you shouldn't have to almost die to get your health back. So whatever amount of time I have to live will be as pain free as possible. There is a local surgeon doing a case study on me at this time.

I thought it was a heart attack. After many tests, all negative, they beleive it was from the injection. I have refused future injections because it was very painful.
Severe Chronic Decrease of Neutrophils in the Blood	magoo, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	10/20/2008 11:56:32 PM	I had been using Neuprogen for over 3 years taking a shot every 4 days.  I asked to be placed on Neulasta and each week after the first injection my white cell and neutrophil counts were in the normal range. At the end of three weeks my numbers were still good and better than i was getting after only four days on Neuprogen.  I have never experienced any side effects so these two drugs have saved my life.  I only regret that I am not permitted to take the Neulasta shot myself as Medicare will not pay for it unless I go to a Doctor's office.

Actually been admitted into the hospital.  Could not eat, drink, sleep, or walk for 4 days before being admitted.  Have been given Percoset every 3 hours for 3 days - no relief.  Now being given Morphine every 12 hours along with Dauladin (10 times stronger than Morphine) every 2 - 5 hours with some relief, not complete relief.  This is HORRIFIC!  The doctors completely underestimated the pain and told us to give her Tylenol when the Percoset didn't work - WHAT!?  I agree, with the other comment.  If you don't get in front of this pain, it is too late.  Before the next round we will start on the morphine 2 - 3 days prior so it has time to build up in the system and be ready at the first sign to attack it or be admitted into the hospital for pain management under monitored circumstances.  She became suicidal from the pain before we finally convinced the ER doctor to admit her.  The oncologist knew this and sent her home with more Percocet.  Why not give her a loaded gun?  If you are older, in poor physical condition, or have any bone problems like arthritis or osteoporois have a pain mgmt plan in place before starting the chemo.  Build up your muscles with weights prior.  Then hold on and be strong!
Decrease of Neutrophils in the Blood from Cancer Chemotherapy		5	1	2			9/15/2008 5:27:17 PM	The first time I got the shot it was as they say, mild bone pain. The second and third time were soooo awful. After 24 hrs my bones, muscles, skin, you name it hurt head to toe. I could not be touched. It was all I could do to roll over in bed. I felt like I'd been hit by a truck. I understand an infection can be deadly and that the two days of debilitating pain were better than death. But I definately had to be talked into that last dose by my doctor, and if it came down to me getting that shot again or coming down with cholora, berry-berry some deadly infection or whatever I would probably take my chances. A body can take just so much.

This was handled with pain pills, and I never hurt with subsequent injections.  Medication seems to have done what it is supposed to.

I was literally down for 3 days. The pain so severe I could not think, I too experienced some deep back bone pain but compared nothing to the migrane. I found that once the pain is so severe it is too late to manage it. This being a side effect not too many patients seem to suffer from. I agree too with Rose far worse than the treatment itself, something else to raise the blood count has to be done for I am not in it for round two, I would rather live in a bubble.

Sure do, but it's better than getting an infection.
