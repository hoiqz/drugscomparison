Type of Leukemia - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	War weary, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	3/15/2012 1:51:58 PM	After 8 years of watchful waiting including about 4 years on Chorambucil, I got put on Treanda.  The % of leukemic cells went from 62-65% down to 17% after only 4 treatments.  Had no side effects, did not lose any hair.  I don't know how long the good news will continue because I only got 4 of the 6 recommended treatments before my insurance (COBRA) ran out, but I feel good and now pay for a port flush and a blood check every 6 weeks.  My white cells count was very low, but hopefully will improve.  Doc said I may not need 6 treatments because 4 did very well.  We will see.

I could fall asleep just sitting and I did it all the time.  I did not expect the nadir to begin immediately so it was hard to deal with.  Treatments are every three weeks for two one hour treatments.  Next one is this week.  Ugh.
Indolent B-Cell Lymphoma	alesu, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	4/6/2010 5:45:28 PM	The first 3 treatments were easy, only a day and a half of nausea and 5-7 days of fatigue.  I needed the neulasta shot after my 4th, counts not recovering as well.  Also after the 4th the fatigue held on for almost 3 weeks.  Still functioned fine, just not as enthusiastically. Still have my hair, and no mouth sores so far, 2 more to go. Before my 3rd treatment we did a scan and no sign of disease, seems to be working.
Indolent B-Cell Lymphoma	will be back, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	2/25/2010 6:50:54 AM	Have had 3 2 day treatments so far. Low WBC counts-waiting on those to come back up. No real problems with this drug, other than some fatigue. It really helps to drink lots of water-6 to 10 bottles a day. I call it Chemo-light.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma	Kittylouise, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Male	65-74	9/19/2009 11:54:15 AM	My husband was Dx in Jan 2004 with MCL. Since that time he has been give many different treatments. The Treadra was started in July  since aggressive tumors (12 CM in Chest) returned. He has recieved 3 cycles with Rituxin as the 1st day followed by 2 days of Treanda  with a follow up Neulasta shot. He has extreme fatique, poor appetite, and weight loss. The upside is his Petscan 2 weeks ago  (after 2 cycles) shows tumors shrinking drastically. He has low platelets (15,000) most of the time and has been given a reduced dosage of Treanda. He will have at least 6 cycles and hopefully knock it completely down to an indolent state. This is the best response we have seen of all drugs he has been give.

The first treatment took about one week to recover; the second treatment has taken almost two weeks.  I will find out next week if I will have a 3rd.  The first Neulasta shot gave me spasms of pain controlled by Tylenol.  The second was insignificant as far as side effects go but kept my counts up.  I have had slight nausea, loss of appetite with the Treanda and hope the scans next week prove it is working.
