I was given Nasonex by my ENT today and I wanted to do a little research on it before I took it. Am I glad I did! After reading all of your commetns, this stuff is going right in the trash. I will take some nose blowing and sneezing over loss of taste, cataracs, nose-bleeds, headaches... -- WTH??  No thanks!  Thank you all again so much!! I love the internet sometimes! :-)

Allergic Rhinitis Prevention	NasalPolyp, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	6/3/2012 1:48:36 AM	This medication has helped to relieve my nasal congestion due to allergies and I'm hoping it will help to shrink my Nasal Polyps. I'm not able to smell due to the Nasal Polyps. This condition existed before I started using the Nasonex. I plan to go to my ENT to determine if Nasonex has helped to shrink the nasal polys. Has anyone found Nasonex to actually shrink nasal polyps?

I've been averaging two to three upper respiratory infections per year. and for someone with asthma it is very difficult to endure an added breathing issue. I'm now going to try and get my Dr to prescribe something else. which won't be easy but i just can't take these infections anymore.

It has no smell, no aftertaste, and no side effects. I have zero nasal allergy symptoms while I'm taking it (which is year-round unless I accidentally run out). No other allergy medicine has ever done that for me. I would highly recommend it to any allergy sufferer.

I stopped using it when I realized that it was causing nosebleeds and nasal irritation. Shortly after I stopped using it, I noticed a whistling in my nose. The whistling eventually stopped only to discover that I have a perforation in my nasal septem--a large hole in the cartilage between the nostrils. I have never used any other nasal spray or cocaine (or any other illicit drug for that matter), which I understand are other causes of this condition. I now live with nearly daily mild nosebleeds and constant congestion with dry, hard incrustations having to be removed every few hours to allow proper breathing. It took a while to realize what caused the problem, but the process of elimination makes it obvious that it was Nasonex.

I eventually did sleep and today I have taken it again....I can breath again...thank you...I read it helps with snoring and breathing at night which i have had issues in the past....so thus far  I think its ok.

Except now everything tastes like a combination of metal and cardboard. What a horrific side effect. I guess they could market this as a weight loss drug, too, since it makes food taste terrible. The taste is always in my mouth whether I am eating or not. I am throwing this crap away. I hope that my sense of taste returns soon. What a miserable thing.

Last August my hair began to fall out, with accompanying scalp inflammation.  All tests were negative.  Hair grew back,eventually, but began coming out this August, coinciding with allergy season and use of Nasonex.  Again, inflammed scalp, with eye irritation, redness, tightness and blurred vision on occasion.  I have also lost sense of taste and have experienced smelling cigarette smoke in my home, when no one is smoking.  I have had increased irritablity this summer.I do not take any medications except vitamins, am a very healty 66 year old! Have just completed more blood studies and a scalp biopsy.  The culprit seems to be Nasonex, based on process of elimination and also, some smaller studies desribing similar results. I do not recommend this product!!

His Dr. decided to try this.  My son is very sensitive to steroid medications so I was a little concerned about using this.  I tried it.  Withing 2 days he was moody, irritable, crying/sensitive...nothing like his usual self.  He reacted to this spray exactly like he does to other steroidal meds.  I stopped it right away.

Did 2 right there at the office, then two later that night.  That's it!  Why? Because I lost all sense of smell and taste.  I can't believe it!  This is FDA approved and all these people are losing sense of smell and taste?  And its not on the list of side effects?  Yes, I reported it to the FDA, and I'm hoping to God I get my senses back.  After 4 sprays?  Seriously?  Terrible product!  Just terrible!  Shame on the company for not taking it off the shelves when all these people are reporting this too.  Its only been a day, after reading all the other posts, I guess it will take weeks?  UGH!  Absolutely UNACCEPTABLE!

It was prescribed to help prevent nasal drainage into my throat that interferred with my sleep and a stuffy nose that caused me to sleep with my mouth open that resulted in snoring and dry mouth, which would also awaken me. Nasonex taken at least two hours before bedtime generally avoids these interuptions to my sleep.

My allergies are aweful and nothing ruins a day more than sneezing, watery eyes, and a stuffy nose, especially when you cant do anything to relieve it. After figuring out that no OTC medications worked for me, my doctor prescribed me Nasonex to prevent my allergies from flaring up. *Need quick relief??? Because Nasonex is a cortico-steroid, it takes about two weeks to begin working, so you have to take it before allergy season starts. Honestly though who knows when that is! If you need quick allergy relief and none of the OTC meds are working, Talk to your doctor about Xyzal. It is a tiny antihistamine that works wonders. After one dose I felt 10x better! So Yeah, Nasonex and Xyzal = best allergy treatments!!!

Other	Gunslinger1881, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	55-64	9/8/2010 12:02:34 PM	I had a chronic cough that my doctor suspected was due to a bronchial infection.  At no time did I feel my sinuses were inflamed or blocked but he gave me a prescription for Nasonex.  I used it once when I got it but did not feel it helped anything.  A few days later I took another dose, still with no effect one way or another.  About a week later I bought a couple BLTs and noticed they seemed to have no taste or smell.  I tried sniffing after shave, hand lotion, soap.  Nothing.  It's been two days and I can neither taste nor smell anything.  I'm hoping this is just temporary.  I have been also getting pains in my liver area that feel like muscle cramps but moving around or stretching the area does not relieve the pain.  I just have to wait for it to go away in 10-15 minutes.  I don't know if this can be attributable to the Nasonex.

I have been on it for almost a year and just switched ENT's. My current ENT told me to stop taking it and listed side effect. Heartburn, Nausea, Dizzyness, Loss of Smell, Loss of taste, headaches, Moodswings, fatigue, extreme muscle and joint pain, sinus infection, wheezing and difficulty breathing, extreme thirst, chapped lips. All of which I am experiencing. This is not the way a 30 year old healthy male (prior to nasonex) should live. My General Physician also told me to never use it again. I have been off of it for 4 days and should start to see side effects going away after 10 days.

The side effects are absolutely horrible. I thought I was losing my mind. Severe dizziness, headache, sinus pain/pressure, sore throat, blurry vision, eye pain/pressure, fatigue, nausea. I went to the Dr. numerous times to be put on antibiotics, sinus x-rays,CT scan, due to so much pain. Of course they found nothing wrong and could not explain my symptoms. Nasonex was prescribed for me 6 weeks ago, after a week I started having these symptoms and it has progressively gotten worse. I have been off the spray for just a day, after reading this. Other reviewers: please let me know when your symptoms subsided after stopping Nasonex.

Head pressure, headache, ear pain and popping, sever dizziness, loss of balance, vision problems, eye pain and pressure, neck and shoulder pain, nausea and irritability.  I would have never taken even one dose of this if I had known these side effects were possible.

In 2 days had lost all sense of smell. PLEASE STOP AND DO NOT USE. As a Fireman I need my senses to detech Smoke, Natural Gas, Exhaust from boilers etc. and not to mention cooking Firehouse food. If I can't taste,or smell the Dinner burning, they'll throw me out of the kitchen.Had to see ENT Doctor. He prescribed Prednisone 60mg x-7days,40mg x 4days,20mg x 2days,10mg x 1day to attack this aggresively to shrink the swelling around the olfactory nerves that are inflamed. Prednisone has some bad side effects but, only for long-term high doses 60-100mg 1-6 months. To me it's worth it. Just started dose today. I can taste sweet, salty and bitter at this time.

Started using the spray about 7 years ago and have improved immensley with all nose blowing stopped and sinuses clearing up and no apparent side effects. Currently have ocular hypertension (high pressure in eyes which bcan lead to glaucoma) and eye specialists have tentatively suggested that this might be due to the spray. My optician checked the possible side effects in an old medical book and ocular hypertension is listed as a rare side effect. Couldn't find confirmation of this online at Nasonex site or this one but been instructed to stop taking the pray for a while as an experiment and will then be tested again to see if pressure reduces. If my ocular hypertension goes away that will be great but I will miss the immense improvements that the spray has undoubtedly achieved. No doubt alternative remedies are available. I will update over the next few momnths as this experiment unfolds.

Especially if it is a irregular heart rate. I used it and had major problems with my heart and out of the blue painful palpatations right after using it. I noticed that I also had a increase in rate dependent bundle branch block(irregular heart rate from the left ventricle of my heart.) It is very scary. The drug works great for non cardiac suffers but no one with a cardiac problem should use this drug.It is a drug. People forget that because it goes in your nose, not a pill ect..It's says right in the rare side effects it can cause chest pain.. It does!!

After about 3 days my symptoms returned but I kept up with the treatment. By day 6 I had a metallic taste in my mouth when drinking water including my usual bottled water. I found this odd and disturbing so I looked up the side effects and found I am not the only one with taste changes. I find it upsetting I wasn't warned about this and also that people have been off this stuff for months and have not regained normal smell or taste. That scares me.

It made me stop and think every night before using: which is worse, the taste of the drug or the allergy symptoms? YUK.
Allergic Rhinitis Prevention	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	65-74	6/13/2009 1:12:40 PM	From the first day I started using this Medication I started getting a &quot;Pressure&quot; headach and it got worse every day I used Nasonex until I realized it might be the Nose Spray.  So I stopped and within 1 day my headache disappeared.  It was not a match for me.

Also my urine smells like burndt wood, very strong,.I think it must be from some chemical reaction in my kidneys from this drug im going to ask my ENT. 
Allergic Rhinitis Prevention	Brooke, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	5/15/2009 3:18:49 PM	I've been using Nasonex on and off for about 10 years.  I get occasionally nose bleeds and my immune system breaks down after using for more than 3 weeks.  It works when I do use it but when I get the side effects I take a break and until I'm really really in need. I try to use it as a preventative and also when my nasals are inflammed.
Other	Hank, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		5/11/2009 3:50:57 PM	Tried many different sprays and pills but was unable to get sufficient satisfaction to allow me to get sufficient sleep at nightand to breathe properly during high allergy seasons.  In addition to the usual sympthoms I had a slight swollen in my throat.  Since taking Nasonex, I am able to get sufficient sleep and to tolerate the allergy sympthoms.

I really suffer with allergies all year long but they are the worst in the spring and nothing else stopped my sneezing fits. This really works for me.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	4/21/2009 11:28:32 PM	After 3+ weeks on antibiotics for bronchitis turned into a sinus problem, Doctor prescribed nasonex nasal spray 1x each nostril am &amp; pm.  First time used was at bedtime and post nasal drip stopped within minutes without any side effects noted.  Second time used, my two front top teeth immediately began to hurt (4-5 on a 10 pain scale), within a few minutes I was dizzy and felt something odd in my chest that I would describe as rattling or a catch in my breath.  The odd chest feeling and dizziness went away within a few minutes, however, the pain in my 2 front teeth remained for over 24 hours.  Then the pain in my 2 front teeth came and went over the next 2 days until it finally disappeared.  I stopped the nasonex after the second treatment and am now using salt water gargles, saline nose treatments and honey lemon echinacea drops to treat symptoms which are slowly improving.  I don't think the sinus condition I have is allergies.  Doctor reported my lungs sounded clear and nose, ears and throat looked clear, however, I am still have clear liquid with yellow bloody discharge from my nose/throat daily.  I am on 8 other medications daily for heart and related issues.  My doctor assured me there would be no side effects with this medicine.  I was disappointed to experience side effects that are not even listed.  I am thankful the pain in my 2 front teeth went away.  I would not use this product again and will be wary in the future of nasal steroid sprays.

I have been taking it on and off for the past 8 years now.  I usually  start taking it when my sinus problems really flare up.  I have told doctors that I have found that I get bronchitis or a sore throat when I take this drug and they always ignore me.  One doctor told me that it couldn't be because I was on this drug. I think I know my body more than anyone to say that I believe my immune system gets shot to hell when I take Nasonex.  Right now I have what my doctor believes is croup - that weird baby cough? Yes.  Prior to this, less than 3 weeks ago, it was an eye infection and a different type of cough. Very phlemy.  I have had more infections in the past 5 months than I've had in the past 5 years.  I don't think this is a coincidence.

It makes you feel as though you have something in your nose, although you can still breathe fine. I would only use if I were desperate.
Chronic Inflammation of the Nose Not due to Allergies	Smith_11, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	4/11/2009 6:19:19 PM	Nasonex didn't take long to take its effect and help alleviate my pain of Chronic sinusitis. However, strange symptoms began to appear such as trouble swallowing, numbing of the mouth, tongue, and throat. I had symptoms of Cushings Syndrome appear, and my immune system shot down and I contracted continuous bacterial infections one after the other. It turns out that the nasal spray took the opposite effect and I had the negative reaction to the steroids. I would recommend Nasonex but warn others that there's a chance that you might recieve the opposite effects of using this steroid like I did.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	3/20/2009 1:07:44 PM	I have lost all sense of taste and smell after taking this for only two days.  I've never had a reaction to any other nasal spray and I can't believe that based on the number of people who have commented on this that it barely shows up as a side effect in Scherring Plows drug warnings.  Ask your doctor for another spray.

I have suffered night-time coughing due to severe sinus drainage and was only able to sleep 1-2 hrs a night for a year now. I sprayed each nostril once and within minutes felt relief in my nasal breathing. My cough has stopped and I am now able to get more restful sleep. Also, my husband says I am not snoring which has been a problem also.

However, Nasonex has such a fine mist that I was able to tolerate the mild discomfort.  In a few days, I experienced amazing relief after years of constantly wiping my nose and eyes.  Be aware that the cost of this medicine may be prohibitive, even with the prescription assistance provided by my employer provided medical insurance.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/30/2008 2:27:18 PM	After years of using over-the-counter nasal sprays to &quot;treat&quot; my year round allergies, I was finally fed up with always having a stuffy nose and nothing working. (I found out this was due to using the OTC nasal sprays so often) My doctor prescribed me this spray, and within 1 week I've already noticed an improvement. I'm not using the OTC spray as often, and I'm hoping to &quot;wean&quot; my way off of them (OTC sprays). It has also helped me to not sneeze as much, which is a HUGE relief for me. I overall am very happy with this medicine, and am hoping it will continue to help my allergies. I have not experienced any side effects as of this time.

In less than a week, no more stuffiness and I can sleep at night without my nose being stopped up. It is a miracle, I wish I would have tried it 5 years ago. I haven't experienced any of the numbness and loss of smell or taste. and I like it because it is not a steriod.

I recently found a natural supplement that works well.  I wish I had never started taking this drug.  I lost my sense of smell and after stopping it has returned but I smell cigarette smoke all the time even though no one is smoking.  Again I am really disappointed.

The only taste I have is sweet and sour and cannot smell anything. It is very upsetting and if I only knew that this could possibly happen I would NEVER have taken this drug! It has ruined a quality of my life and it scares me to think it is given out to young children!

Other		5	5	5			4/6/2008 9:19:37 AM	My step-son has been on Nasonex for two years, due to chronic sinus infections. The Nasonex is very effective, if taken correctly &amp; every day. When he does go to his Mom's house, he doesn't get his medicine because he &quot;doesn't need it&quot; so when he returns a few days later, his allergies are acting up. But, when he does get it everyday, it's very effective!

I had taken maintenance shots for allergies on two different occasions, and they helped.  But I found taking shots to be a big hassle and didn't want to go in that direction again. My doctor perscribed Nasonex and I experienced almost immediate relief.  I also had three surgeries for nasal poloyps throughout the years and hope to control them now with Nasonex.

It is very difficult to fit the fingers onto the push pump &amp; still fit the nozzle far enough into the nose to ascertain that it has actually released a dose into the nostril.  I much preferred the Nasocort AQ, but unfortunately, my HMO no longer will pay for the Nasocort.

At first sinus pain gone then began to notice a loss of taste and smell.  Went off a few days, but thought surely the medication would not have caused it.  Went about another week and decided to stop it.  Have been off it a week and one-half and still can't taste sweet or salty or smell very week.  I have noticed that at the back of my tongue I am beginning to get some taste back but almost choke trying to get the food back there to get a little of the taste back.  I have not contacted my doctor as I have out of town, but will contact when I get back.  I was happy to see someone else had the same problem.

I gave up on Nasel spray a couple of years ago and started taking Claritin-D every day for years.  It worked great but my kidneys took a beating and I started having bad kidney pain because of the decongestant.  My doctor prescribed me Nasonex and after 3 or 4 bad nights it started working.  It works fairly well but sometimes I feel that I can't breath very deeply when I play sports, I don't know if there is a mucas build up or some other side effect.

As of 1/2/08, I no longer have either at all.  It's like living in a vacuum with no senses.  Food tastes either sweet, hard, soft or cold.  Other than that, only the taste of mint is distinquishable.  I called my Dr &amp; he said he'd never heard of this issue w/ Nasonex.  I showed him the warning on the package insert &amp; he couldn't say that the loss of senses was due to congestion or Nasonex so he changed me to Rhinocort Aqua.  I'm hoping my senses return - I can't imagine going thru life without tasting or smelling again.  This is very upsetting.

Although the product worked effectively, it caused me to develop subcapsular cataracts in both of my eyes. I will eventually need a lens replacement operation.  The product insert indicates a possible risk of cataracts in patients who are predisposed towards them.  It also presents data from a study that found no increase in cataract formation.  Clearly the long term adverse-effect profile has not been evaluated by Schering-Plough.

I was previously trying to spray it straight up my nose and inhaling and that is incorrect.  It needs to be sprayed at an angle towards the eyes while gently inhaling.  This allows it to stay in the sinuses and work where it needs to work.  It doesn't relieve 100% of my symptoms, but it helps a lot.
