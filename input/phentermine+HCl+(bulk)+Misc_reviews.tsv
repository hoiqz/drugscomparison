Other	confused, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	65-74	12/28/2011 11:28:55 PM	For a little while I was having a fluttering in my chest but it just went away one day.  I'm having trouble with a lot of sinus drainage and I'm concerned it is a side effect of the Phentermine HCI.  I have it every day.  I hate to stop taking it because it gives me so much energy.  I exercise and do so much.  If I weren't taking it I would be laying on the couch doing nothing all day.  I don't know which is worse.  The feeling I had when I weighed 275 and felt like I was going to die compared to 246 lbs and feeling good now.  Which is worse, to be grossly overweight or taking Pentermine?

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/7/2011 8:07:07 PM	I good with the way I eat now. Im not eating as muuch as i used to eat. It's working fine for me. I do hate having the dry mouth, but Im drinking more water which is good. Its not all about taking a pill to make you feel good about yourself. working out helps alot also. I feel great.....

I have plenty of energy and feel very good.  The one issue I have is a slightly dry mouth.  I would recommend this product to others.

I am afraid not to take it as it curbs my appetite and helps with the removal of excess fluid build up. I have lots of energy without feeling jittery.

A friend recommended I ask my doctor about Phentermine HCL. I started taking it the week beofore thanksgiving (2009) and as of today (3/9/2010) I have lost 41 lbs.  Starting weight was 210 today's weight 169.  Phentermine has really helped me get off unwanted weight.  The only side effect I have experienced is some dry mouth.

Other	mymy30, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/4/2009 1:13:07 AM	I wanted to have a child and my Hormone Doctor said i had to lose weight. So I asked her what could I take to lose this weight, and be more healthy. She put me on Phentermine in Feb. of 2009 at the weight of 255 and height of 5'10. Now it is July and I weigh 217,and now I'm loving how I look in clothes. I changed my eating habits and i work out everyday, you have to put in the work to lose the weight, the pill isn't going to do it by its self. 
Other	tine0547, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/30/2009 7:12:37 AM	 Good Morning ALL... April 2007 I was almost 170lbs  I am 5'4'' and it looked real bad, I have always been 118 to 125 and happy. I had a BIG move and family stuff going on.  My wedding day was coming up in May so i asked Dr. to help me, i have tried over the counter diet pills, working out, etc.. NOTHING worked. She put me on 37.5 Phentermine and by my wedding 6 weeks later I was 132 :)... I felt so much better &amp; looked so much better.  With the phentermine pill taken every AM I drank water ALL day, and walked 3 to 4 miles 3 times a week and sit ups and leg lifts 2 times a week. Depending on how I felt I would walk another day.  I always walked at night cuz it was way to hot during the day and I worked 12 hr shifts in the ER.  I have since had surgery/re injury and have put 30 of those pounds back on and just started taking Phentermine 37.5 again.  I get headaches this time and It is safe for me to take with my synthroid (HYPO). I would say TRY in, it is worth it but you have to workout or walk a few times a week and come crunches or something. The pill does not work alone, yeah you wont feel hungry but wont give you the body you want.  I also suggest taking measurements, that made me work harder more than the weight dropping, you can be 2lbs more one day and 2lbs less the next.  I would measure and weigh myself maybe 3 times a week and kept a chart, adding inches falling off and then my clothes, I started to get back into them :). My goal is 130 and by 8/15/09..... GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF US....

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	1/24/2009 1:16:53 PM	I've been taking this for 5 Mo. My starting weight was 156. Within the first 5 weeks I lost 22 pounds. By the end of the second month I weighed 128. I had lost 28 pounds in two months. Great! Although, in those 2 months I was on a STRICT diet, (High Protein) and I was on the treadmill for 45-60 min. 4 days a week; WALKING at 3.5 at the highest incline, (10 on my treadmill) During the last 3 months I have not dieted or worked out regurlarly, and my weight has stayed the same. - I am a 5' 3&quot; 29 yr. old Female - This is a good way to lose weight quickly, but I also had the EXACT results on the same diet and workout without taking Phentermine two years prior, (Same starting weight)

It suppresses your appitite and takes away that drive to eat constantly. It shuts off that voice telling you to eat.  Unfortunately it is only approved for 3 months. Long term studies need to be doen to help those people, thast are truly not driven by hunger, but by thought of needing to eat.

Other	Dayna, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/30/2008 11:15:48 AM	I have spent the last 5 years trying to lose all the weight I gained after 2 neck surgeries.  I have lost 35lbs. in 4 months.  I now weigh 127!!!I'm eating so much healthier now.  My blood sugar is down, my cholesterol is low and I feel great!  I could not have lost this weight without phentermine.  I tried.If you are over weight...get your doc to give this to you!  Only side effect was a little bit of a dry mouth.  I chewed a lot of &quot;sugar free&quot; gum.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	3/21/2008 1:22:14 PM	Phentermine has worked great for me. I started at 152 and have lost 19 pounds. I am currently at 133 with my goal being 129.  This has occurred over the last 9 weeks. If you are considering this drug I can personally say it has worked great for me. I haven't experienced any strange side effects. It just allows me to control my eating since my appetite is suppressed. I still eat, but my portions are now a lot smaller. I also don't crave food anymore like I use to, so it's much easier to say no to certain things than it was before. My heart didn't speed up, my sleeping is still fine. These were all things I was concerned about and I haven't had trouble with any of them. The overall way I mentally and physically feel is amazing!
