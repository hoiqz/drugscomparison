Birth Control	cnw2007, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	10/1/2012 11:01:01 AM	This pill has caused me depression, sleep apnea, nauseau, anxiety and difficulty breathing.   I don't recommend it.  I only have been on it two months.  I was on Orthro Tri Cycln lo before and the medco switched me to this generic form.  Horrible.  No -sex drive.   
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	8/17/2012 8:16:22 AM	I was switched to this through Medco and yes it has prevented my from pregnancy.  That being said, my cycle is out of sync, my period can arrive anywhere from 4-6 days after I start the sugar pill and it lasts anywhere from 3-8 days.  I never had this problem with any other pill!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	8/16/2012 10:42:30 PM	I have had horrible experience with this pill. It has caused me to have horrible hormonal imbalance. I will never take this pill again. This messed my personality up while on birth control. Now, I'm on my 3rd month off from it and still suffer from depression, but it has gotten slightly better. I would not recommend it to anyone.
Birth Control	jerseygirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	8/6/2012 7:38:36 PM	I have been taking this pill for 4 months now as a generic for ortho tri cyclene.  I have been miserable! Completely beside myself with bouts of anger and depression.  I have gained a lot of weight and retain a whole lot of water.  I crave sweets all of the time and I have been breaking out in places I do not generally get pimples.  I also have had awful back pain and very heavy discharge for over a month now. Switching to NuvaRing and hoping it helps.
Birth Control	Daisy11, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	5/14/2012 11:19:39 PM	I have taken Ortho Lo for the past eight years. After my insurance encouraged me to use generics, I gave this one a shot as an alternative. Not a good idea. I've been taking it consistently for a year, and although it has kept me from becoming pregnant, it has created a host of issues, such as weight gain, irritability and mood swings. I have an OBGYN appointment this month and plan to go back to Ortho Lo.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Ortho-TriOnly!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	5/6/2012 11:03:44 PM	Before an endocrinologist put me on Ortho-Tricyclen, the &quot;gold standard&quot; as she said, I'd tried a few different generics to stop a continual though light flow that went on for three months. Ortho-Tricyclen worked very well for me for about 6 years. I would have continued to take it but a poor choice and drive to make more profit by Medco mail order pharmacy backed me into a corner sending me TriPrevifem. Instead of being assertive, I gave this generic a try. WRONG WRONG WRONG. significant increase in mood swings, anxiety, acne (even on my scalp!), breast tenderness, and joint pain. After only 14 days, I'd had enough, called my doc and the mail order pharmacy, and refusing to use anything other than ortho-tricyclen. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	4/30/2012 11:02:27 PM	After Tri Sprintec got recalled, the pharmacy switched me to Tri Previfem. I have always had issues with PMDD, symptoms like intense anger and depression, and the pill has always helped regulate that, until Tri Previfem. I feel depressed, anxious, angry, and sad constantly. I would not recommend this drug to anyone, especially those with PMDD.

Birth Control	Erin/Florida, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	1/27/2012 9:27:42 PM	I was prescribed this birth control by my doctor, not only for preventing pregnancy, but because of me severe migraines. I took this medication for 3 months and never missed a dose. I also used a second type of protection, thank God, because I have been getting letter's by the manufacture's warning me that for the past 6 months these birth control pills were not made with the right ingredients and so they were caused to be recalled. I am very disapointed in the fact that the drug manufactures could let something like this happen!! I will never take this pill again and would not reccomend that anyone take it.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	1/25/2012 10:02:28 AM	I have been taking Trinessa for several years and my pharmacy gave me Tri-previfem cause its cheaper. Since going on this med I have had some dramatic mood swings. Ive felt somewhat depressed and crying at even the slightest mishap.  I have never had such unusual side effects from BC. I called the pharmacy and asked to switch. If this is happening to you I recommend calling a pharmacist and telling them along with getting your Dr. to write u a new Rx. I didnt like how it made me feel.
Birth Control	mandilee428, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	1/21/2012 10:24:09 AM	Rite Aid switched to this brand.  I was taking Tri Sprintec and had no complaints or noticeable side effects.  I've been taking this for 2 months now and I've noticed that I have been feeling depressed, I'm always irritated with people, snapping at my family, impatient, having problems with my contacts, migraines.  I hate this pill and I'm going to be seeing my dr and getting a different kind.  Oh and of course I have no sex drive but that was also my (only) complaint with Tri Sprintec; I think that is a problem with ALL BCP's, unfortunately.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	11/15/2011 11:30:13 PM	I have noticed an extreme tenderness in my breasts that I've never experienced before, along with a 10 lb weight gain.  I do p90X 4-5 times per week and I'm still gaining weight.  Also, my eyes burn constantly and I read another review here where someone else mentioned that.  I don't wear contacts and I'm not allergic to anything but they feel like they're on fire every day.  If it is this pill that is causing all these awful things, I think I'd rather just use condoms.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Val, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	11/1/2011 10:32:29 PM	Horrible, horrible, horrible.  After 2 months of taking this pill, I have finally stopped taking it.  Going back to my Dr. to find out what I can be switched to because the emotional strain on me from this pill is just too much.  I was taking TriNessa 28 for 2 months prior to this one and when I switched to order by mail from my insurance they switched the prescription to Tri-Previfem.  The first month I get switched, they have a RECALL because pills were packaged incorrectly.  Thank goodness mine did not end up being part of the recall but still scary enough.  Unfortunately it took a major outburst with a co-worker to finally open my eyes and realize I've had horrible ups and downs in my mood the past two months.  I'm not one of those women that cries at every little thing, until I began taking Tri-Previfem.  I feel like a teenager again who is not in control of her body due to the fluctuating hormones.  My face has broken out horribly along my jawline and now two weeks of being off the pill it's finally starting to clear up.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	9/27/2011 1:15:49 PM	I have been on this BC for ONE MONTH and have had the worst experience. I was originally on Ortho Lo but because this generic brand was less pricey, I switched. MISTAKE. I have gained 5-7lbs, my contacts bother me constantly and my mood has gone up and down. I would not recommend anyone to switch to this BC has an alternative to Ortho Lo. I have been on BC for 7 years and haven't run into issues until now. I have decided to give my body a break from the drug and see how I feel. 
Birth Control	dreamxsickle, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	9/7/2011 1:18:52 PM	I have been on this for a year and a half and love it. My periods are light and only last four days without any pain. I haven't gained any weight and my skin has cleared. I even told my friends about it and now they take it too!
Birth Control	Shannon , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	8/21/2011 3:30:51 PM	I began taking this (again) in June and since that specific month my boyfriend and I of SIX years have been NONSTOP fighting. It took him saying, &quot;You've been in a bad mood for the past two months&quot; for me to realize that I was on the pills for the same amount of time that we'd been fighting. I'm depressed every single day and I cry at the slightest thing he does. I have ZERO confidence and if a girl even looks at him I get so irritable and angry I want to punch her in the face. Today is the absolute LAST day I will be on this pill, or else it will ruin my relationship for good. It's a horrible medication. Don't take it unless you want to be a complete wreck and ruin your satisfaction with life.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	8/16/2011 3:46:54 PM	I used to take Gianvi, but had to switch because of period irregularity.  My dr. prescribed this and I absolutely hate it. I have experienced so many horrible side-effects and I fear it'll lead to worse. Nausea, breast tenderness and growth, contact lens problems, increased acne, worsened cramps during period, migraines (which I've NEVER had), bloating whether on period or not... you name it. I've stopped it and am going to see my dr to make sure I haven't permanently damaged my body!
Birth Control	shea, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	8/5/2011 2:18:47 PM	I was on Levora and I changed because that pill made me break out so bad, I've been on this pill for 2 months and see no improvement and now I am emotional all the time, my breast hurt and my acne has not changed at all. I just don't want to take anything. My dr says to be on it a couple months and then we'll talk but I give up on pills and am just gonna not take anything and go back to normal.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/27/2011 4:06:10 PM	I have been on several birth control pills over the last 15 years and have been on this for 9 months.  I have always had acne since I was a teen.  My skin is completely clear now.  My hormonal swings were terrible and now I haven't noticed any depression.  The only bad thing I've noticed is that my cramps are much worse and I usually get a migraine right around my period.  The bloating has subsided.  I would take clear skin and being happy even if it means I have to suffer through a day or two of cramps.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	7/20/2011 3:35:44 AM	My breasts increased 2 cup sizes which is a bad thing for me because now I have chronic back pain. I'm young and had a healthy sexual appetite until switching to this brand. Now I have absolutely no sex drive. I even noticed some anxiety and dread when my very loving SO tries to show affection. While I haven't noticed a change in mood, I have noticed that it is harder for my SO to pull me away from my hobbies. It's like an unhealthy obsession. I never experienced this before. Perhaps it's just a distraction from the hormones flooding my body...either way, I don't feel like myself and I hate these changes. I would not recommend this pill to anyone.
Painful Periods	nyc345, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	7/5/2011 10:22:29 PM	Before taking this, I was on Yaz which made me get no periods for 3 months which wasn't good, and tri-nessa which was great. For whatever reason my gyno told me this would be the same thing, only cheaper so I went with it. BIG MISTAKE. I've gained 5 pounds in a month while dieting/exercising so I really should have been loosing or at least staying at the same weight. Also my cramps are still horrible AND my hands and feet have been swelling at random times and that is listed as a side effect. Not impressed
Birth Control	Lynn31, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	6/15/2011 9:27:17 AM	I originally started taking the Generic for Yaz for PCOS to manage ovarian cysts and regulate period but I lost prescription coverage so Dr prescribed this instead. It only costs $9 from Walmart pharmacy. It has cut down on pain/cramps asscoiated with my cysts, prevented pregnancy, and decreased hormonal headaches. It did increase breast size about a cup. Only complaints I I really have is sore breasts and almost 10lb weight gain over a couple months.

I have gained 15 lbs in three months even though I work out an hour a day, 4-5 times per week, have itchy pimples on my face(have ALWAYS had clear skin),am constantly hungry, sad &amp; bitchy! Now my Doc has switched me to Oscella&amp;I'm scared to start. Any advice?!?
Acne	scvindre, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	5/20/2011 1:22:47 AM	This is my first time ever taking birth control and ive been on it for 3 weeks so far ive already gained 5 pounds and my breast went up a cup size ive also developed low blood sugar and bad nausea and headaches i only wanted a birth control that would clear up my skin and regulate my haywire hormones not very happy 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	5/19/2011 1:55:45 AM	For me the pros (lighter periods, no cramping, no more acne, and bigger boobs) definitely out-way the cons (bloating and a 5lb. weight gain). Over all I would say that I am pretty content with it.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Me, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	5/5/2011 4:33:05 PM	I am having hair loss, and i am only 22 and you can tell. Also get bruise easliy i think i have been on it for 6 or 7 months. 
Birth Control	unhappy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	5/1/2011 1:55:01 AM	It works and is easy to take. However, the side effects were too bad so I had to stop taking the pills. The first week was fine, but on the second week I began to feel depressed for no reason. I began to break out in places I'd never had acne before such as my neck, chest and back. I got zits on my face and little red bumps on my chest, neck and forehead. I thought it would go away but it just got worse. Now I have had bad diarrhea for about a week. I also get cravings for sweets. I would definitely NOT recommend this pill.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	4/25/2011 1:54:11 PM	I absolutely hate this birth control.  In a month, I gained about 15 pounds without changing my eating habits.  My face has broken out everywhere.  Worst of all, I was prescribed this to control my hormones.  I have zero patience for people and haven't had one day without mood swings.  At this point, I can't even go to work because I don't have tolerance for people.  I don't understand why anyone would take this prescription.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/10/2011 1:47:18 PM	Ever since I started taking this birth control my hair has been falling out so much!! It's actually noticeable now. I'm only 28 years young. I'm also much moody and depressed. I absolutely dislike this pill!! DON'T TAKE IT.
Birth Control	V, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	4/9/2011 10:56:40 PM	I have been on Tri-Previfem for 4 months and I am not happy at all! My skin has gotten horrible. I haven never had skin problems in my life and now I'm on skin treatment. I also have gone up a cup size or 2. And that has been very depressing since I had purchased my wedding gown it fit perfect and now have to get it altered because my breast have gotten larger. I do not recommend this medication. I was on ortho tri cyclen Lo and I can't wait to get back on it. Only reason I went with Tri-Previfem is because it was WAY WAY cheaper than Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo. I am now willing to pay what ever is necessary to get back on my old birth control.
Birth Control	jenwilly703, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/2/2011 11:25:32 AM	I was switched to Tri-Previfem by my Medco supplier about 5 months ago (was recently on Tri-Sprintec, another generic bc pill). Ever since I've been on Tri-Previfem, I've noticed a HUGE change in my mood and overall emotional well-being. I've felt depressed, alone, I get upset easily over minor things, and I've had no sex drive whatsoever. It works great as far as doing its job as birth prevention (every pill I've ever taken was fine in that sense, thankfully), but my emotional well-being has taken a huge hit. I'm either going to switch or take a break from bc in general to let my body rest after being on the pill for nearly 6 years.

Ortho tricyclen lo is no longer available thru my mail order service and costs more. I experienced lighter periods but prolonged periods of depression. 
Birth Control	LP5130, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	3	1	Female	19-24	2/24/2011 5:06:34 PM	I was switched to this pill by my pharmacy and I have noticed I've gained about 5 pounds (a lot for me) and my breasts have gone up a cup size (not happy!) Its a good thing I go to my gyno in 2 weeks. Ready to switch!!
Birth Control	mscrystal, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	2/6/2011 7:57:39 AM	I had chronic bladder infections for over a year and after many treatments of antibiotics, I knew it was something more.  A visit to the Urologist revealed that I have crystals in my bladder! Also, my hair falls out way too much!

It has workd GREAT for both!!  She has not noticed any negative side effects, just positive outcome of taking it.  
Birth Control	OliveOil, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	12/28/2010 8:15:17 PM	I have been on this for over a month(2nd pack started) and it seems to be working well.  I was on Aviane-28 and was a hormonal mess.  The only side effect I am really noticing is bloating.  My overall mood seems better and I didn't have the major mood swings like I had before.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/16/2010 10:21:56 PM	CVS switched to this generic brand and I got pregnant after my first month of taking it! Not Good
Birth Control	Ash, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	10/20/2010 8:04:57 PM	I have been on this BC pill for 2 months. CVS switched it claiming that their supplier was now giving this generic form. depressive thoughts, lower sex drive, darkening of my face skin, neon yellow urine, oh and a trip to the ER for difficulty breathing. it's weird all these comments are popping up around the same time. DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL. I'm going to the doctor friday to ensure no permanent damage has been done to my heretofor very healthy body. If not I will be contacting someone's legal department.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	10/12/2010 10:00:16 AM	Medco switched me to this birth control and ever since I've been having spot bleeding and stomach cramps and back pains and I'm not even on my period. I'm very dissatisfied with this birth control and will not continue taking it due to the side effects.
Birth Control	Heather, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	25-34	10/10/2010 1:09:45 PM	I have been taking this medication for one month now...Medco switched this med on their own..for the past 3 weeks I have been having on and off nausea, feeling like my sugar has been dropping and weak..I just put two and two together that it has all been happening since I started this med. I was absolutely fine with the other generic I was taking, and why they swithched my pill is beyond me. I will not continue taking this pill for I have not felt good since taking it. 
Painful Periods	bobbyblue, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/3/2010 4:02:35 PM	I think it's effectiveness may be based on personal body type. I did not experience weight gain, did experience a little bit more acne than usual, but it's hard to tell if it's the pill or my stressed life. It absolutely did wonders for my cramps, bloating and fatigue.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	13-18	1/5/2010 7:05:13 PM	I'm spotting and it's my week to have my period. It makes me super paranoid that I might be pregnant. Although we always use condoms too. But still, it's annoying.
Other	andiedre, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	10/14/2009 8:34:13 PM	I switched to this because it was less expensive than Ortho.  I was only on it for one month, but that was long enough.  I had alot of new acne pop up and felt all of the pains associated with having my period.  I did not like this medication and decided to switch back to Ortho.
Birth Control	Deanna, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	12/22/2008 12:24:48 PM	I have experienced weight gain, acne has shown up, nausea, stomach pain.  Mood swings, and a huge defference in sex drive!  I also developed a rash down south, unsure if it is related to the pill but have never had it before.  I was accidently switched to this pill after previously having great results with a different generic.  I have been on this pill for 2 months now and I am extremely dissatisfied with the results. I have not gotten pregnant, but have felt symptoms of pregnancy.  I am used to taking the pill and not noticing anything unusual... this pill definately has symptoms, and unfavorable ones in my case.
Birth Control	bianco , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/13/2008 10:02:32 PM	I switched to Tri-Previfem when Ortho Trycline got to expensive...the switch was nice and easy and I was as effective. I do suffer from back pain during my period which this pill isnt to good for; however, it works wonders with cramping and bloating. I have been on Tri-Previfem for almost 4 years now and I am very content with it.
