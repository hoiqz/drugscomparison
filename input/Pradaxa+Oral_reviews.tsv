I am happier with warfarin and blood tests!

Started on Pradaxa to keep blood thin and possibly, and hopefully, prevent clot from causing a stroke. I also had two electrical Cardioversions, that required my taking and staying on Pradaxa.  I take Pradaxa two times a day...spaced 12 hours apart. I find I must eat something with it or become very uncomfortable with indigestion and burping. I do like that there's no food restrictions or frequent blood tests with this med. This will be a 'forever' med for me because of the A-Fib.  I carry my medicine info with me in my wallet.  The scary part of this med, is the potential bleeding issue.   Ask your pharmacist and doctor questions as to any other med you take interfering with this med. Ask and be aware of any drug interactions that might effect you. Be pro-active.

I've been on and off and on coumadin since 2004.  With Pdx, since January-20011, no more occasional &quot;whooosing&quot; in my chest from afib; no more special diets; no more weekly pin pricks; no more arranging my personal schedule around my pin pricks****Bad news**** blood became too thin (last 3 months on Pdx meant that I ALWAYS had to sleep with my legs covered; had to devise a method to take my 2 doses daily of Pdx (the special bottle became a real pain); swelling of feet(it progressively got worse and worse); I had to take extra medication to counteract the swelling (it gradually became less and less effective); tests showed that my kidney function was being affected (which, it seems, is a side effect of Pdx for SOME patients); I was diagnosed with Kidney cancer in both kidneys in 2003; I was diagnosed with gout in Feb. of 2011, a few weeks after starting my Pdx regimen.  I am urinating better, now

Two months ago, I had routine urinalysis and had blood in my urine - no visible signs upon urination.  5/23/12 Changed medication to 75 mg twice a day.  Will get urine tested in about 3 weeks.  Pharmacist commented that anytime you take a blood thinner, you will have blood in your urine.  I do not understand why.  My physician recommends seeing a urologist if I continue to have blood in my urine.  However, if blood will be in my urine as long as I take a blood thinner, I wonder if it is necessary for me to see a urologist.  Has anyone else had blood in urine which is not visible upon urination?

I used to have daily bowel movements like clockwork, but now will miss a day and when I go the next day have diarreah. Also, shortly after taking the 150 mg capsule I get upset stomach, twice per day. I take while eating breakfast and dinner. I have also experienced itching on my face, which I never had before. No other adverse reactions. Cardiolgist says 5x less chance for stroke, so I'll have to gut it out.
Prevent Blood Clot with Fast Irregular Heart Rate	Anna, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female		6/30/2012 9:12:33 PM	I have been on Pradaxa 150 mg x 2 daily since August 2011 for A-fib.  My cardiologist tried other methods to thin my blood that were not successful, so I reluctantly started on Pradaxa.  I have not felt very well from the point of stomach problems since Day 1.  My face, neck and shoulders became beet red, but 3 doctors blamed it on something other than Pradaxa.  My stomach cramps and I am dizzy.  I also am diabetic.  Yesterday I had an EKG with which my cardiologist was well pleased, and I have not had a run of A-fib in 10 months, so it must be working.  But at what cost?  What is it doing to me with the outbreaks of red skin?  What is happening with my gastrointestinal tract?  The cost is playing havoc with my drug plan, and I will be in the &quot;doughnut&quot; hole by August.  Then I will have to pay full price for the Pradaxa in addition to 7 other prescription meds.  So I am pleased with the fact that I have not had a stroke so far (thank God for that), but I am not pleased with the side effects and my disappearing retirement funds.  I feel so bad I can't travel anyway, can't go shopping anymore, don't enjoy eating out because of stomach distress, have become primarily a homebody.  But at least I'm alive with no stroke damage so far.  So I can rejoice in that my brain and body are functioning still and I am not in the ER with a heart rate of 240 or so.

I have A-Fib with slow heart beat.  A fib is common in my family: father, uncle, cousins, brothers.  The problems since my heart attack are decreasing Kidney function which may or may not be attributed to the Pradaxa....my nephrologist is working on finding out. I am also experiencing increasing GERD issues...which seems to be aggravating the A-fib and I have been hospitalized twice since the heart attack with A-fib symptoms and a final diagnosis of GERD in one instance and Gastritis in the second.  The question is whether it is the Pradaxa or the Multaq, or  the low doses of metoprol and simvastatin causing the simultaneous symptoms? Or is the past history of H-pylori?

I survived a stroke in January 2012 which resulted in no need for physical, occupational, speech, or other therapy.  It appeared the stroke was the result of a clot triggered by the A-Fib. Since 2004 I was on a strict aspirin regimen.  There were times Warfarin was prescribed when my A-Fib really got out of whack.  Following the stroke my electrocardiologist prescribed Pradaxa which I have found to be working as claimed by the manufacturer.  I trust the product completely as an anticoagulent.  I have had no side affects from the drug that others have indicated in their reviews.  My only complaint is the cost.  Conversely, when I wake in the morning I thank the Big Guy for another day.

I was taught in the hosp how to manage coumadin and then I said &quot;what about Pradaxa I saw on TV&quot; and was told &quot;Sure it is a  great drug if you can afford it&quot;. So I checked my plan and I was on board.  It has been great until about 3 -4 months ago and now I have stomach issues now and then. Feel like vomitting but is pasess away. I used to blame  it on my mild IBS problems but now I have begun to think it is the Pradaxa - especially since I see so many other dicussing the stomach issues. I am on 150 2xs a day .  NO other problems like I see others have like vision and joint pains etc.  I sure do not want to go on coumadin - way too much management for me.   Bleeding hemorroids are due to the tinner blood - not new hemorroids caused by the drug. I think we just have to suck it up and take Pradaxa.  The alternative is coumadin or a stroke.

I first took Pradaxa 150mg twice daily. Developed stomach burning and worsening of reflux. Stopped for a bit but eventually took it again, this time with food and didn't have stomach problem. But then my leg muscles started to ache. Went off again.I retried the drug recently at the lower dose of 75mg twice daily. Despite food, however, I felt like I was being stabbed in my stomach. I also had a bad headache, bad joint pain, and some dizziness. Went off med after only 2 days. Got better.A week later went back on Pradaxa at an even smaller dose of 75mg only once a day. All the previous symptoms I just mentioned returned. But I had more: My entire chest hurt making it hard to breathe, I felt very weak, was very pale, and started to run a fever of 101.5 and up. I was admitted to the hospital for two days for treatment. I was much better when Pradaxa was stopped. I also had to start taking an antibiotic because of a possible infection in my chest from when I couldn't breath right--because of the pain from the Pradaxa.At first I was very pleased with Pradaxa. Now I can't touch it whatsoever, and wouldn't want to since you cannot reverse it if you have a problem. At first I was given the bottle which you had to keep closed all the time and you couldn't put the pills in a medication container.I then tried the blister packs and found them to be too big for my pill container, so it was hard to keep track of my dosages.I previously tried Warfarin too and had some symptoms, but at this point I would take that any day over the Pradaxa.

I was formerly on Warfarin for AFib.  This drug has been a nightmare from day 1.  The stomach discomfort, pain discomfort in joints, blurred and double vision, lightheadness near the fainting stage, complete lack of energy, etc. are terrible so I started by getting a complete check-up from eye doctor (all A-OK), my cardiologist today, switching to Xarelto effective immediately, for AFib with different formula from Pradaxa.  I am on Toprol, Metformin, Omeprozole, Digoxin, and none of these are a problem.  This drug is downright scarry and I cannot believe the FDA approved something with all these side effects (which incidently are in the warnings).  Talk with your cardiologist and be forwarned, it ain't a happy pill.

I have found that it is best to wait 48-72 hours before re-starting Pradaxa after a colonoscopy or similar procedure.  If taken within 24 hours of the procedure, bleeding does occur.The other drawback is the requirement to keep it in its original package, rather than with other medications in a weekly pill dispenser.

Off Pradaxa one month, on Coumadin, now have same problems but every 3 days or so.  Very painful stomach cramps, too, but sick at night alot. Would recommend not staying on it if you are having problems like mine - they do not get better.  Such trade-offs!!! Not good ones, either.

According to the charts I have a 7% chance over the next 5 years of getting a stroke from a mild A-fib conditioning causing a blood clot.  I'll take my chances and not take Praxada and as an added benefit, I won't have to pay an excessive cost for the medication.  I'll continue to take 1000 mg of a buffered aspirin every day.  The nausea is gone, the upset stomach, the tiredness--my life syle has improved 100%.

I had my second known episode of Afib in Aug and was told to go on the Pradaxa.  The previous Afib episode was isolated and over 9 years ago.  I had 2 cardiac caths during that period and was told I did not need a blood thinner.  Now that a second Afib episode occurred, they want me on this med.  Have only had occasional heartburn and no other side effects.  My concern is the possible long term side effects.  Am I going to hear a year or so from now that it is recalled due to permanent damage done to some organ.  It's like car insurance, you only need it if there is an accident, but I feel this med is overkill for a problem that may not arise again for another 9 years.  I can't get a straight answer for why the Afib episodes happened and am very concerned about staying on this med long term.  I can't take Coumadin/Warfaren because of possible allergies to these meds.  Anyone in the same predicament as me?

The first week on it was fine, but the second week I suffered severe heartburn, nausea, dry vomiting and overall fatigue. I hope I only need to be on it for 21 days to have my cardioversion. I won't take it after that. I'd rather go back to the Warfarin!

Have spent 5 days with 3 of my private physicians and 1 emergency room physician trying to see which drug is causing it.  So far, Rythmol has been stopped but face is still red and flushed, tenderness around ear and temple and scalp itching.  Hopefully improvement is around the corner.

A fortnight ago my father suffered internal bleeding which led to a heart attack.  I might add he had never suffered from these complaints before.  He had been going along quite nicely on Warfarin but for some reason during a routine visit to his doctor he handed him Pradaxa (not available on prescription here in Australia yet).  I was very uneasy but Dad said 'the doctor knows best'....  As stated above within a week of starting on it Dad had internal bleeding and a heart attack.  Hospital of course, eventually stabilized his blood count.  His heart is so damaged now and given his age and physical condition no further treatment recommended.  He now has no quality of life and every minute is a struggle.  A couple of days ago he was experiencing severe stomach pain.  I am looking after him at home but his life is not measured in months or even weeks now - hour by hour and I expect him to 'go' at any time.  The stress this is causing him and me/us his family is overwhelming.  Why???  The old saying 'if it aint broke why fix it'.  Why on gods earth did the doctor/pharmeceutical company decide to play god with my Dad and others and Why can medications by handed out by doctors from their clinics before they are available on prescription.  It's wrong!!!

It's effective in a couple hours, AFIB takes much longer to cause a clot, so why take it all the time, and incur any side effects, plus it's expensive. But you must always be able to tell when you're in AFIB. Doctor will not tell you to do this, because that's not the way it was tested. And imagine what would happen to pradaxa sales if everyone did...However, my AFIB has become much more persistant, so now I will take it all the time.

I have been on Pradaxa for almost 5 mos. Seems to be working as far as Afib is concerned. Stomach problems have increased plus joint/muscle pain is almost unbearable. Can hardly stand for anthing/anyone to touch me.  Can't get comfortable sitting or laying in bed.  This has been happening for almost a month now.  Waiting to go to primary physician to determine exact cause.

I nearly bled to death from an abnormally heavy period one month after beginning Pradaxa. Once that problem was surgically corrected, I have experienced no significant side-effects other than occasional diarreha. After several years of high dosage Coumadin with inconsistent INR, I am thrilled to take Pradaxa. No blood work and eating dark green vegetables is an added bonus!

Took Prilosec and pribiotics and all the symptoms went away in a couple weeks. Definitely better than being on Coumadin. Seems to be working while my DVT dissolves (Yes, I am taking it off-label).

Also have diahhrea and bad heartburn. Am waiting to have another ablation so will continue to take it until then. I dearly hope I can quit after the procedure. It's said to be a wonderful alternative to coumadin but I've not had to deal with coumadin which sounds like quite an ordeal. I was told to take a Pepcid Complete with each dose but notice another reviewer was advised that interferes with the drug.

No mixed dose strenghts, no monitoring, no drug or diet interactions, and my cardiologist tells me it is 35% more effective at preventing strokes and embolisms than warfarin (coumadin).

For my husband who recently had a stroke, that's not possible. He chokes on them. Both doses uses the same size capsule, according to my cardiologist's nurse.They also gave him stomach pains.
