It helped my lengthen the time between my mood swings. I've been taking it now for almost 8 months months. I had stopped it for about two months, but was taken off of it to be on another medication trial then was put back on it right after. It helps control the mania, but it doesn't stop it. I recommend Lamictal to anyone suffering with Bipolar Disorder.

I have taken many antidepressants with some benefit, but nothing compares to the Lamictal for my depression. My shrink prescribed this as I was running out of options, and it works great. Most effective antidepressant I've ever taken.
Epileptic Seizure	ConcernedMom, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	3	Male	3-6	10/17/2011 8:43:50 PM	My son has been taking Lamictal ODT 200mg/day (100 am &amp; 100 pm) for seizures. I'm glad to say that he's been seizure free, but  my biggest concern &amp; problem with the medication is that since being on it, he has been suffering from severe anxieties, panic attacks, insomnia &amp; is very irritable at times. Also, since being on the medication he has withdrawn himself from participating in school activities or sports with friends.As a mother, I'm very relieved in knowing that this medicine helps him from seizures, but I also truly wish it would not cause all these side effects. I feel his pain when he  says, &quot;Mommy, I just don't know why I don't want to be  around my friends.&quot;  As a young growing boy, he should be enjoying himself &amp; not have to deal with these unexplainable fears. Of course, I've brought these concerns up with his doctor, but no known effects seem to be possible. He has an evaluation soon, and I'm hoping some thing can be done to take away these side effects.

Epileptic Seizure	Michelle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	5/31/2011 10:38:49 AM	I have used this medication for 4yrs, d/t having seizures activity. One of  main side affects is insomnia.  I have  tried 3-4 other types of medication which did not benefit me in any way. This medication has controlled alot of seizure activity vs. what I had used before. I finally found a doctor who gave me medication that helps my depression and my seizure activity.  I had other doctors who stated my condition was all psychologial. I am currently on 300mg/day and my doctor may increase my dosage to 400mg.   I do not want to change my medication, this has helped me in multiple ways.  I developed epilepsy after the birth of my one and only child @ the age of 28.

Bipolar Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	4/24/2011 3:39:44 PM	I've been taking the Lamictal ODT Oral 200mg now for five months and have noticed a great difference on it. With just starting with the titration of 25 to 50 to 100. The first week I noticed that I still had symptoms of insomnia, suicidal thoughts, rapid thoughts and voices, along with things not really being there. These symptoms became mild that I was about to feel much better than I had been within the past couple years. I was referred to some many doctors and no one knew what was causing these symptoms, until I had a full blow manic attack that I ended up being hospitalized for. This was the first time someone gave me the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, so finally I figured out that someone was indeed wrong with me, not just in my head. I've been taking the 200mg now for about four months now and I can see the difference along with my family. I've been told, &quot;wow you look like yourself today&quot; which is something amazing to me. Though I do take other medicines to treat the various aspects of bipolar disorder, but I have found this one to be the most helpful. And I recommend to everyone NEVER stop taking this medicine cold turkey, because you feel like you are going down a dark alley and will have all the side effects come to you at once.

It was like the sun came out and the clouds parted. This was what it was like to feel in control of my life. Much less socializing without abandon, drinking, partying and spending money I didn't have. I was able to OBSERVE my impulses so I could decide whether or not to let them take over me.I had NEVER known what being &quot;normal&quot; was like. I felt like I could handle the anxiety and stress surrounding me with grace, maturity. My mood didn't dictate my actions as much.Then, my state's insurance company dropped me because I was taking classes at community college. I couldn't afford anything, not my psychiatry appts or my therapy. Apparently, if I can pay for school, I can pay for Blue Cross/Blue shield lower income insurance.Despair overtook me and I fell into a manic spiral of rapid cycling destructive behavior and avoidance,hiding in bed, isolating, crying all the time for no reason behavior. One day I was on top of the world, and everyone wanted to be around me. I loved life. The next, I hated myself and wanted to die. When I came out of that, I was an arrogant Bitch who thought she deserved better. Then I would suddenly feel inspired to get things done and have a normal day. I could feel my adderall working on those days. I could focus, but everything was short lived.I finished my classes and the state insurance picked me up again. I got back on Lamictal but had to take the Generic. I didn't care. I was SO HAPPY to get back on my mood stabilizer! About a month went by, then 2 weeks, and I met with my PA. I felt very laid back about chaos in my life. I didn't notice anything different. My attitude and quality of life had not improved on the Generic. but it hadn't really gotten worse. I felt like I always had. She switched me back to brand name and things started to improve again. Now taking tablets instead of ODT because of Medicaid. I notice quite a difference in side effects. Has anyone else switched? Effectiveness/infectiveness?
Epileptic Seizure	melissa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	35-44	12/15/2010 12:07:44 PM	I have been on this medication for a while. I am taking 200mg a day and I have only had 1 seizure while being on it. I was having a colonoscopy and had a seizure during the procedure which caused me to be on a ventilator for 2 days. They think it was being with out the meds for too long before the procedure. The only complaint I have with Lamictal is the tired feeling. I thought it would go away but half way during the day, I need to lay-down or I can not make it all day. This med. has been better than the others I have used. I was on Topamax and after a year and a half, I had confusion and irritability. My doctor had me stop Topamax and go to Lamictal I can put up with the drowsiness , I am glad this has worked for me.

I have Bipolar 1 and have always suffered from severe mood swings. My roommate even notices a difference since I've been taking Lamictal. I've been experiencing some insomnia, nausea and loss of appetite. But they are managable. I drink vanilla sleepytime teqa to help sleep and its doesnt interfere with my meds.
Bipolar Depression	skram711, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/6/2010 12:15:40 AM	It helps keep the manic portion of bipolar in check. but sometimes I need a higher dose for it work. I've tried 100mg, 150mg, and 200mg. I like the 200mg best for controling the manic part of bipolar disorder. right now I'm on 150mg and I get manic attacks where I can't calm down and am extremely restless so I have to take a half of another 100mg to level me out.  I plan to ask my Dr. to keep me on 150mg, but allow for more pills per month for those uncertain times.
Convulsive Seizures	natalie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	10/2/2010 2:01:18 AM	I took this medication when I was 21 years old and had an unexplained seizure.  Immediately after taking this medication for the first time, I knew I did not like it, because it felt harder to move.  My doctor did not listen, and told me to give the medication a chance.  On the second day of taking the medication, my whole body went numb and I could not move.  It felt very difficult to breathe as well.  I ended-up at the emergency room, where the neurologist on call told me that I didn't really need to take a seizure medication after a single seizure.  The side-effects from this medication were one of the scariest experiences of my life.

I wasn't showing or feeling any anger issues, but for the last 2 days i was on it, i had this uncontrollable rage inside of me. I could feel this anger coursing through my veins and my head. It was very scary! I was constantly irritable. Many of the people i know that take this don't like it either.

However, I have been on a does of 300 mg/day since early 2007 and it has been a savior.  I still experience the occasional depressive mood, but it is a million miles from what I was experiencing previously and lasts only a short while.  Even if a I miss a day I do not experience any adverse effects.
Bipolar Depression	sanchezmay, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	1/3/2010 6:35:07 PM	I have battled depression for many years and tried every drug and treatment out there. ECT being my last resort someday. I research before I swallow and as a rule, I try to take as few pills as possible.  So adding Lamictal to my treatment did not make me happy. However, I had reached my medication plateau on Cymbalta and wanted to avoid having to try yet another antidepressant. This medication seems to do just that.  I have been able to keep my dose of Cymbalta at 60mg working smoothly, even if I miss a dose.  It was rough at first. It takes a few weeks for the body to adjust ,even at a 100mg doses, but two months later it was well worth it.  Once it kicks in, going to 200 is no problem.  I do keep an eye on my blood pressure.  I also believe (based on my own research and not fact) that it offers some protection against medication induced seizures. Sounds good to me?
