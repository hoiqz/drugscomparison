Feeling Dizzy Upon Standing from Blood Pressure Drop	nirnie, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female		9/25/2011 11:10:03 AM	I have been taking Fludrocortisone to raise my blood pressure but recently I still had fainting episodes or felt faint. In addition, I've been taking Midodrine for about a month and at first I had no side effects but now my head and chest feel full, my energy level is down and my concentration is affected. However, I haven't fainted again.

So far its not bad other blood pressure meds give me the runs as this one just loosens me up a bit, But I have not seen much of a raise in blood pressure.
Other	Kizanne, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	35-44	9/4/2010 4:25:20 PM	I had low blood pressure which was making me have days I had to lie down or fall down.  My doctor prescribed Midodrine 3 times daily. I wanted to just take it on days that I had trouble but he said to take it everyday.  It has made a tredmendous difference so far.  I have energy and feel better.  I have had the side effects of tingling scalp and occasional headaches at night when the medicine wears off.  But it has made a significant daily difference.
