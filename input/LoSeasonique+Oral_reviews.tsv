Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Great Pill, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	9/24/2012 4:44:35 PM	As a 35 yr old woman, I have tried many pills to combat my heavy, painful, and frequent periods. This is the only one birth control pill on the market that has worked! And has controlled my periods without side effects. In the begining there was some break through bleeding (a month long of off-on days) and some breast tenderness. Now a year later, I can't imagine taking another drug. Its expensive but when you break out the cost per month and factor in all the pads and tampoons and advil you won't need, it works out well.
Birth Control	t.e, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	5/9/2012 12:50:33 AM	I am on my first pack and I have been spotting for the first 2 months, almost every single day... What is the point of having your period every 3 months if you spot every day!? Considering a new method because this is too high maintenance!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/2/2012 3:44:58 AM	I have had very poor experiences with Bc in the past.  Found out I'm very sensitive to the high hormones meds.  My doctor put me on the once a month lodose Bc and I was very happy with it.  When I found out about the same med for 3 months at a time I was more than willing.  I had some spotting for the first pack and some Pms symptoms around when I would have stopped before.  After that my periods are light and only a few days when they're supposed to happen.  I love it.  Very happy. It's not for everyone but you need to find what combo works for your body.  Oh there's also a generic now. Yeah!

This past cycle, I was accidently given seasonique lo, not a good experience, I gained weight and I have had non stop spotting.  Fortunately my pharmacy is switching out my packs today so I can go back on the seasonique.  The seasonique line is great, but the seasonique lo is not for me.
Other	sw, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	2/29/2012 9:31:18 PM	I am currently on my 3 week and a half of my period on this birthcontrol. I have been on lo seasonique for 8 months now. There has been 1 month out of 8 that I have had a normal month, otherwise I have pretty much had a continuous period. This is rediculous.
Birth Control	LoriBug85, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	2/22/2012 2:40:51 PM	I have been on LoSeasonique for 6 months now, and I absolutely love it. I have lost 25-30 pounds since I started taking it, have only had two periods in the last six months, and no evident side effects. The ONLY downside for me is that it is so expensive! For one three-month pack it is $188 at my pharmacy, but when I started taking it there was a discount card given to me by my gyno, which made SIX months around $80! Talk about disappointing when I found out they discontinued the discount card! I have never had such a great BC before, I think I'll just have to shell out the cash!
Endometriosis	SammyK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	2/7/2012 9:15:43 PM	Started this for endometriosis &amp; abnormally long periods. I now have 3 week long periods EVERY month. I just stopped taking this because the nauseousness was out of control. Not a huge weight gain, but an obnoxious 5 lbs compared to other types of bc. I will say I have had trouble with every type of bc I've ever tried, but this tops my list. Not to mention I'm super moody! I'm NEVER moody!
Birth Control	lodose, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/30/2012 5:31:10 PM	I really have enjoyed taking this medication.  It never made me moody like past BC pills. I didn't notice weight gain unlike in the past, I even dropped a few pounds.  A reason there are so many comments about bleeding is because it is a low dose.  It may not be strong enough for some women, but for those of us who don't need it strong it works great! My periods have been lighter and I love it! only down fall is that it is super expensive!
Birth Control	KimInGA, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	12/20/2011 11:54:41 AM	I've been using 13-week-cycle birth control pills for 5+ years now - Seasonique and Jolessa. My doctor recently switched me to Lo Seasonique and it's been terrible!!  2 weeks after starting, I began to spot.  It never stopped until I took a week off from the pills and let a period come.  Then I began taking them again and lasted 3 weeks before nonstop spotting (nearly as heavy as a period) once again forced me to take a week off.  I guess you are supposed to just keep taking the pills and deal with 3 months straight of having a period?!?  Right, and I would explain that to my husband HOW, exactly?  Plus 3 months straight of cramps and PMS-like extreme annoyance -- it just gets better and better!  And did I mention the weight gain?  The only good thing I can say is that I didn't get pregnant, although it's basically destroyed my sex life with the nonstop bleeding so I'm not sure there was even an opportunity to get pregnant.  The minute I can get my doctor's office to call me back, I'm switching to something else, ANYTHING ELSE!
Painful Periods	RuthAnn24, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	12/13/2011 12:45:06 PM	So the first pack I loved got my period a week before the placebo week. I still have really bad cramps so it didn't really help that but it was nice only getting one period.. I started the second pack and it was perfect until the second month. I started bleeding at first nothing but a panty liner but then it changed to full on bleeding for 2 months literally 2 months until I got to the placebo week it got really bad with the cramps again.. Then I'm on my third pack now and no bleeding.. I'm going to stick it out with the third pack just to see if my body is finally adjusting.. And I hadn't gotten ahold of my doc pretty much useless in helping non pregnant girls. but I have had some positive side effects I have lost a lot of weight I weighed 127 when I was put on it and now way 114 I'm 5'10 so that alot for me.. my skin is really clear also.. 
Birth Control	HormoneFree, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	12/5/2011 8:50:58 PM	If you are hormone-sensitive, please read! I have tried every pill family on the market and my doctor recently prescribed loseasonique, as I have not yet tried this type. I have experienced not-so-pleasant side effects in the past from the other pills &amp; nuva ring (severe acne, migraines, nausea, melasma, mood swings, fatigue), so I had high hopes for this one. I had been off pills completely for 2.5 months and felt great. I took my first pill from loseasonique at 11pm Sunday evening, and by 11am Monday morning, I was experiencing shortness of breath, dizziness and even blacked out while laying down trying to calm the symptoms. I managed to drive myself to urgent care and get checked out to make sure nothing serious was happening, but I am 100% sure that what I experienced was a result of the pill. I am an athlete, in great health with a balanced diet, and have never before had these &quot;anxiety&quot; type symptoms. Again, everyone reacts differently, but if you experience something similar, please use caution. Doctors might say otherwise, but I believe that only you know your body best. Needless to say, I had enough of a health scare, and I will not be sticking around to see if these symptoms subside. 
Endometriosis	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	12/1/2011 7:42:01 PM	i've been on 4 different BC pills in the past 2 years, and LoSeasonique has given me the best experience. i have a pretty bad case of endometriosis. i've been on LoSeasonique for almost 5 months now and my first period was a breeze. i had cramps for only one day (usually 3-5) during my period, which only lasted 4 days. my only concern is that when i first started LoSeasonique i started getting awful migraines everyday from the minute i woke up to the minute i went to bed. luckily after about 3 weeks these went away. i get spotting every so often but nothing that's unmanageable. i also noticed that my bloating has almost completely gone down. i've gained a little weight, but only in my breasts (which is perfectly okay with me). so far, LoSeasonique is the best pill i've been on.

Birth Control	kay1991, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4		19-24	11/13/2011 2:12:18 PM	I am on my 4th week of LoSeasonique &amp; I love it! I was a bit nervous about starting it because of all the bad things I had read online- but I have experienced very little side effects. I have a history of acne, and I can actually not take my acne medication anymore &amp; just take this BC. I was supposed to begin my period on the 8th of this month- it's now the 13th &amp; I have began spotting last night- but nothing I could complain about. I love the idea of not having a full period for another 2 months &amp; so far my experience has been great! I am unsure as to the effectiveness, but it sure does seem to be working so far!
Endometriosis	truman212, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/8/2011 1:14:58 PM	Will finish second month of Rx today.  During the past 4 days, I have started having pre-period, brown discharge and lower back pain normally associated w/ a regular period cycle prior to period beginning.  Prior to this symptom, I have been satisfied with the medication.  I suffer from both endometriosis and PMDD and was put on the Rx to stop having menstrual cycles and to trigger sexual appetite (prior bcp had wiped it out). Because I am no longer having a period, it has reduced my PMDD related symptoms by 90% (my boyfriend is elated).  My sexual drive has increased only 10% though -- hopefully will increase with time.  It is possible that I have experienced weight gain, but could also be a lingering effect from my previous bcp and not-so-stellar diet.  I have started exercising and changed my diet so will be curious to see if the pounds start coming off.  One noticeable side effect I've had is the need to urinate in the middle of the night/early morning (sometimes both).  It doesn't matter how little or much liquid intake I've had for the day, or if I urinate before going to bed (which I do), I wake up with pressure on my bladder and the immediate need to urinate with a significant amount of urine produced (I wonder if it is the result of water retention from the pill escaping from my body??) I feel like an 80 year old!  This started within 2 days of beginning the Rx and had never experienced prior to.  So far, have found very little research or information on this side effect.  Will be curious to see how the next few months go.

The first 3 months I had breakthrough bleeding for 3 weeks! Now I have it again and have had it for 2 weeks! I've been on it 4 months, its ridiculous. I have awful mood swings, lose my temper even easier, and am an emotional wreck. I was NOT like this before I started this BC and my obgyn said I had to wait till im on the placebo pills to switch and i cannot wait to get off it!!

Either I havent getting periods like I should or now on LoSeasonique my period hasnt been off in almost 3 weeks. This is fustrated because im on the third pack and it was doing really good for me . And lets not get into the weight gain ... I have gained over twenty pounds .Im getting off of it very soon.
Other	CrzyinPA, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	10/5/2011 3:39:28 PM	I was out on this to help with extreme perimenopausal symptoms.  I have one 7 day period the second week that I took the med.  I'm on my second pack and have not had another period since.  I have noticed a slight increase in acne but I find that it is easily manageable.  I have had absolutely no weight gain or some of the other extremem symptoms that others are writing about.  I'm sticking!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	9/25/2011 11:57:12 AM	I have been on this BCP for 6 months. Not only is it not covered by my insurance..it was also very expensive. My body agreed with it the first 3 months, but the last 3 months have not been a good adventure. I have had breakthrough bleeding/spotting for 2.5 months straight. I have had no other symptoms. I was hoping this BCP would work for me, but it didn't. 
Birth Control	Kas123, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	9/8/2011 2:47:38 AM	I went on the pill to help with moodiness around my period.  Loseasonique was recommended by my doctor, but I have experienced cyst like pimples around my chin, dry splitting nails and break through bleeding.  I have been on this site to see if others are having insomnia with this drug.  I can't tell if it's the birth control or something else. I've taken everything out of my diet and I'm still up randomly. I do notice numbness/ tingling in my arms and my feet fall asleep easily when I cross them.  Sounds random, but I swear it's all come about after getting on this pill.  Thinking of stopping
Other	blueskymomma, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	2	Female	45-54	9/5/2011 3:07:45 AM	Am trying loseasonique because the idea of 4 periods a year instead of 13 sounds fabulous! Started 1st pack on July 17th, began spotting August 3rd its Sept 4th and still bleeding. Mostly spotting, but every day and going on over a month now. Twice in the last week have had serious bloodclots and heavy bleeding that occurs at night, weird. I really want to give it a chance, but wondering if this pill works for anyone over 45? Have a week left in 2nd pack and then one more pack to go. I am diligent about taking it at the same time and have not had any other side effects, just constant bleeding. 
Birth Control	iloveicecream, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/29/2011 6:20:56 PM	i am on my 6th week of loseasonique.  the first month was wonderful.  i didn't have any side effects at all.  i started documenting my weight everyday, because i had heard some women gain weight.  so far, i've actually lost a couple pounds.  i've always been a sugar addict and am trying to eat healthier.  but sometimes i just have to eat something sweet!  a month into it, i got my period just a few days before i would have normally.  i had no warning signs, no pre-cramps.  my breasts were a little tender, but i just thought it was effects of the pill.  the first 4 days were really light and no cramps at all.  but then it became like a full blown period, only it lasted longer.  i normally bleed for about 4 days.  i was wondering how much more blood i could possibly have that needed to come out!  i often get terrible cramps and take midol.  i wanted to see how bad these cramps would get.  they weren't severe enough for midol, but i just felt really 'blah' the first 2 days of regular bleeding.  in total i bled for about 10 days.  the first few days and the last few days were really light.  but for like 2 days in the middle, it was really heavy.  i bled through a super tampon in like 2 hours!!  i think i'm gonna stick it out and see if eventually my periods gets lighter and just the 4 times a year.  this is my first time to try any birth control, and i did want to start with a lower dose.  my main reason for taking this pill was to prevent pregnancy, but the 'only 4 periods a year' was appealing since i can have pretty intense cramping. and really, who wouldn't want less periods anyway, haha.

I dont know but, i have 3months worth left and if it dont get any better no more pill for me.
Endometriosis	tovabell, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	8/20/2011 12:17:10 PM	I take BCP's to control Endometreosis and have been on many brands (tri-cyclen, tri-cyclen lo, the ring, the patch, mircette, lo-estrin fe, and seasonale). After every surgery my doctors changed the brand/hormones in an effort to suppress growth of Endometrosis.Frankly, all of these pills have the same side effects for me and so I dealt with them - some had more bloating (patch, seasonale, tri-cyclen) others made me a little more moody (lo-estrin) and no sex drive to all of the above. The ring caused my pelvis to inflame and I felt the need to eat constantly (very strange for me). So, after my last surgery, my new doctor suggested LoSeasonique. I've had surgeries since age 18 and assumed she gave it to me because I have already been on everything else; but I find that I do like this pill. It really does seem different. After 6 weeks - no bloating, spotting, excess hunger or acne. Those things I had learned to live with weren't there anymore. So far, I am doing well and hope it will help prevent new Endo.Cons:It is new(ish) and is not always covered by insurance but it does have a savings program. When I switched to it from Mircette I did have some dreary moodiness which was already anticipated. But I've come out of that now.My hope is someday women won't have to go through all of this, with Lupron treatments or a hysterectomy as their only other option.

This is my second packet and I love it my period regulated I only get it the last week of my 3rd month like its supposed to. I had one month of very little spotting then went away my mood has changed,I love it. I have just adjusted to taking a pill every morning!
Birth Control	Toya, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	8/3/2011 8:25:47 AM	I'm new to bc pills &amp; have been taking Lo Seasonique for 1 mo.  After 2 wks, I began to have spotting.  My gyn told me this may happen until my body adjusts. When spotting occurs, she suggested stopping the pill for 4 days to allow my body to have a period.  I did as she suggested, had a short 2-4 day period, &amp; then resumed the pill.  The bleeding stopped for 2 wks &amp; then spotting has resumed again.  So, I have again stopped the pill and will resume after 4 days.  I plan to give my body some time to adjust to the pill b/f making a final decision.  I wanted to share this method of dealing with the spotting b/c I've read several posts indicating constant bleeding (there is a soluion).  Per the insert, a back-up bc method is required for the 1st 7 days after resuming the pill.  Hope this info helps others &amp; I truly hope this pill works for me as 4 periods a year would be a beautiful thing:)

I thought I'd try LoSeasonique because 4 periods a year sold me. My first month was great and no complaints but when I started my second month I got my period. My doctor told me I would have spotting, but I've had a regular period for 10 days already and I'm getting very annoyed. My boyfriend isn't too thrilled either. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	sandiegomama, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	7/5/2011 3:22:55 PM	My reason for taking this rx is to alleviate heavy periods, cramping and nausea. I am 43 years old and am tired of having a period, which has increasingly become very heavy over the past few years. I am into my 3rd month of pills. I have mixed feelings about it but will continue to give it a try and hope the pill does what it should in the long run and give me lighter periods only 4x year. Prior to taking the pill, I was off BC for 6 years. My period would last 5 days and like clockwork, I knew when to expect it every 28 days. After I began the pill, I got an unusual long and heavy period. I bled heavily for 6 of the 10 days. My next period started 28 days later. I spotted for 3 days, had a medium flow for 2 days, spotted for 3, medium flow for 3 days and it stopped, total 11 days. Weird! Then 28 days later, spotting off and on for 5 days and I questioned whether I was having a period. Then medium flow for 4 days and 5 more days of spotting, total of 14 days. During the periods, I had cramps and nausea 1-2 times a day. I am curious what my period will be like when I am on the one week placebo pill. Doctor says all this is normal as my body adjusts to it. I still have a great desire for sex and hubby doesnt complain of sex while spotting. No additional weight gain or loss. My hormonal acne seems to have gone away! I have some moodiness during the period but not sure if its related to the pill or my children. 
Painful Periods	Jennnnaaay, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	6/30/2011 7:35:36 PM	I was given this not because I am sexually active, but because I have PAINFUL cramps. They were horrible. I was glad BC was making it go away. But as of now...I HATE LOSEASONIQUE. DO NOT TAKE IT! I'm on my third pack, just finishing up the second month. First of all, it made me breakout. I didn't know what was wrong...until I read about the same things on here. I even broke out on my LEGS! :| Second of all, I don't spot...i get pretty much a period right now when i am not eve suppose to be on it for another MONTH! Third of all, I get cramps STILL. My period without this i would cramp for one day...and then it'd be gone, but now this stuff makes me cramp everyday. Not bad cramps...but still. I have horrible mood swings. I crave food. I did gain some weight. On the sample pack, it was fine. I spotted a little. The second pack i was still doing ok. But now...I cannot sleep, I want to eat everything, i have HORRIBLE mood swings, and more acne. I am switching BC when i am finally DONE with this. Ugh...
Other	Lynell101, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	6/27/2011 6:05:01 PM	Well, I started with the starter pack and into my 3rd month now. I really dont have many complaints, except the acne!!! Out of all the side effects I get acne. The reason I took seasonique was because I hate getting periods, so 4 a year instead of 12 sold me. I have not had my first period yet, which will be in 3 weeks, so I'm a little nervous there. I have had a little spotting, but nothing to complain about, usually if I take the pill around the same time, the spotting doesnt happen. Also, I do have the increase of appetite too, luckily Im small framed, so I dont really mind. I will finish this packet and see how things go otherwise back to Yaz it is, which helped keep my skin clear!
Endometriosis	AngelMyne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	6/9/2011 12:35:21 AM	Im having an adverse reaction. Numbness of the nose spreading to the upper lip and now the lower lip. Ive taken the med for only 2 weeks now. It other wise seemed to have no other problems for me other then a slight headache off and on for the first week? I cant find any mention of Facial Numbness for this drug and I May be the only one to experience this as a side-effect.
Endometriosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	25-34	6/6/2011 4:24:14 PM	I started taking this drug a year ago. I was trying to conceive and got accepted to a nursing program and put everything in the baby department on hold. At first I did not think that it was going to work because I had spotting but after a few months, as long as I took it everyday at the same time, the spotting went away. I do not take the placebo pills and therefore I have no period (which is nice because I could not have handled menstrual cycles while going through my nursing program). I have been having increasing abdominal pain and pressure the past month, but I feel that it is not from the medication but from the disease itself.
Painful Periods	jeniebeens, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/18/2011 8:53:48 PM	taking for painful periods mostly. I have always also had heavy/long periods and terrible PMS. I have been on this for about 1 year. I had some spotting during first 2-3 months. I've noticed slight PMS for 1 or two days NOT EVERY MONTH like in the past and then realize I'm in the &quot;yellow pills&quot;. This past 3 month cycle I didn't even experience the 2-3 day &quot;pill&quot; period and I'm not pregnant because I am not having sex. I LOVE this stuff! It's made life a lot easier. I know there have been negative reviews so I was prejudiced when starting but I can't be more pleased. I haven't had skin problems so I can't comment if it helps with skin problems. I don't know if it causes weight gain because I am on an exercise/diet regimen after my baby.

Other then the spotting i have no other complains.Sure puts a damper on sexlife.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	3/30/2011 7:32:41 PM	I just started this BC about two months ago.  I am not very comfortable with birth control pills, but unfortunately I do not have much choice because of an out of control endometrioma problem.  Ever since the second week, I have had a constant period.  I take the pill at the same time everyday, and yet it does not help.  I am already anemic, so it has been creating more issues.  I am hoping to get off this medicine ASAP, so I can find something that actually works.
Birth Control	violadae, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	3/23/2011 11:47:09 AM	I am on the last of my 4th month (1st month of 2nd pack) and have had major ups and downs with this drug. I bled for 2 weeks within the first month of taking it. I have not had anymore bleeding, I did not even have my scheduled period the first time. That was a bit unnerving. I have gained 7 lbs even though I eat healthy and eat no more than I did before taking this bc. I also work out, but alas, the lbs will not budge. I could deal with this (I was not overweight to begin with nor am I now) but on top of it I have been majorly bloated for 2 months straight. I mean it feels like I have gained 15 lbs just from the bloating. I am miserable. My headaches (the reason i got on this bc) have not improved. I know everyone responds differently to meds, but my experience has been sub par. I hoped all this would go away by now, but it seems the bloating is here to stay! I plan to get off of this bc once I finish the pack I am currently on. Imagine feeling liek you are PMS-ing all the time! Ugh, so wanted to love LoSeasonique!
Birth Control	Freestyle2410, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/22/2011 5:49:17 PM	This is only my first week of using Loseasonique, and I LOVE it! I had been on ortho tri cyclen lo for two and a half years but was experiencing problems wearing my contact lenses so my doctor suggested the change. At first I was terrified to take this medication after reading all of the horror stories from other reviewers, but I have not experienced any of that so far. In fact, I have noticed that the irritation with my contacts has disappeared, I feel unusually emotionally balanced and happy (before I would start crying over the littlest thing) and that uncharacteristically my libido has skyrocketed! The latter is actually what inspired me to write my own review because for over two years I went around feeling absolutely nothing and had to force myself to pretend to be turned on by husband (who is hot!). I realize it's only been a week, but so far I am truly thrilled. I must also add that I am extremely vigilant about taking the pill at exactly the same time every day and exercising frequently, so perhaps this is why I'm not experiencing any of the undesirable side effects others have mentioned. Fingers crossed everything stays on track. Best of luck!
Endometriosis	Charityellington, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	2/21/2011 12:39:15 PM	I've only been on Loseasonique for a week and i really haven't had any trouble. I have gotten a little nasuea but not where i can't handle it! Everybodies body is different so just because someone had a bad experience doesn't mean you will! I believe every bc can cause weight gain, bloating, etc, but for someone to say it gave me gallstones and kidney stones i don't believe that! It just so happened at the same time! Kidney stones are from caffiene and other stuff you consume by eating or drinking! I mean come on! Sorry I know i am not a dr but it just doesn't seem true that a bc pill can cause you to have stones! So far i feel fine dr told me to start it the first day of my cycle which i did and i still am bleeding a week later but that is normal for me, plus it takes time for medicine to regulate through the body! I am looking forward to seeing if some of these outrageous comments are true or not for me!
Painful Periods	lelan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	2/14/2011 12:21:46 AM	This pill is horrible! The extreme breast tenderness lasted for 1 month after I began taking it. I even developed horrible acne which doesn't go away and leaves scars. And the HEAVY spotting and cramping have lasted 3 full months! I finally got my doctor to take me off LoSeasonique and prescribe a different BC pill, but now I'm not even having a period. I'm married and in my 30's, used plenty of other BC pills before with no problems, and am definitely not pregnant (am infertile because of Endo and OC, which is why I'm on BC pills). I've never missed my period in my life until now! What gives? I can't even start my new BC prescription until LoSeasonique is out of my system and I have my period. Hate this pill! Would NOT recommend!
Endometriosis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	1/29/2011 12:08:12 PM	On my 8th week of this med and I'm done. I have gained 10lbs, breasts very swollen and tender, exhausted and have been bleeding straight for TWO weeks--and I'm definitely not pregnant. I think I will just deal with the pain of endometriosis and get back to my life. I have taken other BC and never had any side effects. Be warned.

Endometriosis	sortofhappy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	35-44	11/15/2010 11:44:30 PM	I've been on LoSeasonique for my 3rd month.  If I forget the pill more than 2 days, I will have a full cycle.  Nonetheless, I have experienced hardly any pain with my cycles, which is a miracle for me, my mood swings have improved over 80%.  The breakthrough bleeding is horrible though, 1-1/2 to almost 2 weeks as a 'punishment' for forgetting a pill and taking it the next day.  When that happens after 2 days forget it, I will bleed.  And my doctor's office said the same thing, it is &quot;normal.&quot;  Get outta here!  I love the less pain though.  I can't beat that with a stick.  I love the mood swings almost gone, and my poor family does too.  I just had a repeat mammogram and it seems that all of a sudden, I may have breast cancer.  That is a red light for me.  I also got the pills as free samples, but they are extremely expensive if I choose to contine on them. Now that I have read others' comments, I don't think I will start the new &quot;free&quot; box of pills.  I think I would rather have the horrible pain instead of the breakthrough bleeding and wondering if it has given me breast cancer.  
Painful Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	13-18	11/8/2010 8:23:02 PM	i have been on birth control since 10th grade. i have been on different birth controls but this one is the best by far. the only thing i don't like is the sickish feeling when i start it and the fact that i'm hungry 24/7. 
Birth Control	Em,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female		10/20/2010 1:00:54 PM	I started taking this BC on the first day of my period (Thursday), which was almost over 2 weeks ago. My last period only lasted 4 days, and my previous periods lasted no longer than 6 days. Since this is my first time on a BC, I didn't really know what to expect, but I knew something was off when I continued to spot with thick, dark discharge after my period ended. I tried to trooper through it by continuing to take it up until the Saturday after the first week. It is now Wednesday (a day shy of the two-week mark). The spotting stopped last night, but now I'm experiencing bright, liquidy discharge. I don't have a medical diploma to tout, but I know enough to say that this is not normal.During the 1.5 weeks that I took the BC, I had constant cravings (mainly for sugary treats and meat), was agitated by inactivity, had shaky hands, could not sleep during the hours I would regularly go to bed. Before you mark me of as neurotic, I have to assert that I'm as easily stressed out as a pet rock. I'm about as mellow as a person can naturally be. In short, if taking a BC would put me under this much ... I don't even know what to call this... I would much rather not take it and go with the old-fashion route: using condoms and calculating the days of the month to have sex.

Endometriosis	tired, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	10/5/2010 5:05:05 AM	I have been on this bc for 4 wks. My doctor put me on this to see if the itching down below would stop. It hasn't. I have no sex drive. I'm bloated, I hardly sleep, I've gained weight and I do workout. I am always hungry and I have bad cramps like if I'm going to start my period. I have acne on my chin and noise. I haven't spotted or anything like that but, with the cramps I wish I would.  I am going to stop taken this bc and ask my doctor to put me back on Lutera.  At least I know with Lutera I had the itching problem, but I didn't get any of the other side effects like what I stated above. 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Tracy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/26/2010 9:59:33 PM	I just finished my first package of pills and got my period exactly as planned,  I had mild cramping prior and a very light period.  I am very pleased with the pill. No weight gain or side effects.  
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Ladymel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	9/21/2010 10:17:40 PM	I have had hormone problems since I was 13. Im now 35 have had two children while taking progesterone and NOTHING has ever worked for me like this has. I used to have very heavy bleeding that would last up to 20 days. When my dr put me on these pills I stopped and I have not had a period in a year now. The only side effect I have had is vaginal dryness but the other benifits are well worth me buying something else for that problem. And I have lost 16 lbs!
Endometriosis	anonymous, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	8/19/2010 12:14:03 AM	I started out with Seasonique and took the pill for three months with no period, until I took the sugar pills. However, I became extremely depressed, felt pregnant the entire 3 months, and felt sick the entire time. I have recently switched to Lo Seasonique and it is no better. The Lo Seasonique has resulted in a lot of spotting and has made me extremely emotional with regular mood swings. The Seasonique is effective in that I do not experience a lot of pain during my cycle. I intend on switching back to Yaz, because Yaz has been the best birth control I have ever taken. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	7/25/2010 8:20:08 PM	I am SO glad it's not just me! I got my tubes tied in Oct 2009, and since then have had horrible periods with excessively heavy flow, severe cramping, and ridiculous mood swings. My doc started me on LoSeasonique to try and help. I started it three weeks ago and hae been bleeding since the fourth day. I've also gained three pounds and am constantly hungry! I will be stopping the pill effective immediately since seeing that I'm NOT the only one with these problems!
Birth Control	mila, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	7/12/2010 12:27:24 PM	this bc is horrible! a had break through bleeding every month and almost every week of the month and also started bleeding at the end of my 7th week on the pill and now im on my 13th week and still bleeding, called the doc she said its normal. will be stopping the pill once Im done with this last week of the pack, no other major side effects though, maybe a little more moody but who wouldnt be if you bleed for more than a month? 
Other	Susan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	7/3/2010 4:20:12 PM	Tried it to get erratic periods under control, also hoped that the low dose estrogen would alleviate the hormone triggered migraines that came with my periods.  All was fine until a month and a half on the pill. I started bleeding like a regular period - it's been 11 days now without easing up. I read other accounts of multiple week bleeding. I am giving up on this pill.   This is a fail.   
Birth Control	hateseasonique, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	6/30/2010 12:58:23 PM	I started LoSeasonique bcs I wanted 4 periods a year - HAH! I started this AWFUL BC on April 11th, began bleeding on May 7th and still have NOT stopped bleeding!!! I have now been bleeding non-stop for 54 days!!! My GYN says it's normal - NOT!!! She does not seem to think there is a problem. Since I am one to &quot;see things 'til the end&quot; I am finishing up my 1st &amp; ONLY 3-month pack of this HORRIBLE BC and going back on OVCON-35 which I have been on for the last 11 years - hopefully my period will finally stop and my body will get back to normal once going back on my original BC. Ladies, if it &quot;aint' broke, don't fix it&quot; - don't let the fantasy of having only 4 periods a year fool you, this BC is HORRIBLE it should be taken off the market IMMEDIATELY!!!  
Other	syracusemom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	45-54	6/16/2010 6:28:58 PM	I am a 50 year old perimenpausal woman who has been struggling with mood stability.  I have been working with a psychiatrist for medication that has been helpful.  She is working with OB/GYN to stabilize hormones thinking that would help.  I have never been on birth control before.  I am in my second week of this and I have swollen, painful breats.  I feel like I have perpetual PMS and morning nausea.  
Endometriosis	Eva500, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	3	1	Female	35-44	6/5/2010 9:50:07 AM	I've been on this medication for 3 months. I have had a period every month for 12 to 15 days. I have headaches and legs that are numb. Also the endometriosis pain has not gone away and usually is strong pain lastinng 90 minutes to 2 hours. 
Birth Control	DebDoes, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	6/3/2010 4:31:03 PM	After 3 packs of bills (9 months or so) I had gained some 30 plus pounds, had knot-like acne on my chin, around my mouth and nose (I never have acne), was having numbness in both arms and achiness in my left arm (as if I was wearing a blood pressure cuff that was too tight); I was seeing 'stars'; constantly hungry, and migraine headaches.  I wrote a list of symptoms and took them to my doctor. She swears that at least half of these are not 'documented symptoms', but I was having all of them. Oh, and I didn't mention a decreased sex drive, and insomnia...I was awake more than I slept.  After 2 weeks off this pill, I felt like a new woman.  3 weeks later I feel more energetic, am sleeping thru the night and generally am better...and I'm not hungry all the time! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/29/2010 7:09:22 PM	I started LoSeasonique about a week ago. Previously I have had every birth control under the sun: IUD (I was allergic, got hypopigmentation, eczema), Yaz (Had to go on anxiety medication, englufed breasts, horrible acne), DepoProvera (Bled for 6 months straight, severely anemic, depressed), and I am allergic to Latex, and have Endometriosis. Doctor wanted to put me on Lupron and have surgery, I wanted to try something less invasive first. She suggested LoSeasonique.I take it every day at the same time (set an alarm on my phone to remind me), but unfortunately yesterday I took it a little late and ended having some breakthrough bleeding yesterday and today (Which isnt a big deal because I usually bleed randomly all the time). I think the key with this medication is timing. Also I have had a little nausea but nothing bad. My breasts are NOT tender, which is a first (extremely cystic breasts). I have had no cramps. My appetite has actually DECREASED and I feel less bloated then I normally do. Overall I am pretty happy so far, if the nausea would just go away I would be a even happier camper.  
Birth Control	ebie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	5/16/2010 3:45:48 AM	am on 3rd week now bleeding everyday...filling tampons...terrible upper abdominal pain. nausea.im her husband shes doubled over right now waiting on monday so her doc can end this...her doctor had her take 10 of those pills over the course of 4 days...to no avail on the bleeding and the pain hurts me to watch. we have a 2 month old son she cant spend more than a few minutes with before being sick. doc acts like its not a big deal. doesnt return calls. apparently this is normal??? id rather wear a rainsuit and pray there are no long term damages done by her use of this obviously wonderful drug... good times
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	5/12/2010 10:42:06 PM	Although it has been effective in me not getting pregnant my side effects are horrible. I feel nauseous a lot have had chest pains and anxiety and dizziness since taking this. I switched from loestren because I felt nauseous but this pill is not working for me either. I did not get a period when I got to the yellow pills. I am in my second week of my 2nd pack and started bleeding today. I feel like I have the flu but I know it is the pills. I am calling my gyno tomorrow and stopping this pill immediately.  The side effects outweigh not having a period every month.
Painful Periods	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	4/29/2010 2:11:50 PM	Only on my second month, but did not have a period the first month or any breakthrough bleeding! I have gained some weight, not sure if it's because of the pill, or just cause I'm not doing what I should be doing for diet and exercise.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	4/19/2010 7:06:00 PM	I take this medication primarily for birth control, but also because I have problems with prolonged, heavy, and painful periods. I have experienced weekly spotting that lasts for 3-7 days with a flow that is slightly less than a normal period. I also have experienced breast tenderness, vaginal dryness, an increase in discharge (clear),a sense of feeling overly tired, and an increase in appetite and cravings (sometimes intense). Overall I am dissatisfied with this medication - I have been on it for 8 weeks now and will continue to take it through the full first three months, but will be consulting my doctor at that time to discuss finding a medication that will yield better results and fewer side effects. 
Birth Control	Jen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	4/12/2010 6:57:56 AM	I am on my third pack of pills and  haven't gotten my period in over a month.  No, I'm not pregnant, but am extremely moody and have gained 10lbs.  I'd rather have a monthly period than have the emotional roller coaster that I&quot;ve been on!  I'm calling my dr today to switch!
Painful Periods	pens87, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	4/5/2010 8:52:24 PM	horrible....enough said...I have had my &quot;period&quot; for six weeks...migraines...nausea...naturally the Dr says its breakthrough bleeding...lol...
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/22/2010 11:06:32 PM	I've been taking LoSeasonique for just over 1 month and am going to stop taking it. My doctor told me to give it the full 3 months to see how my body adjusts to it, but I just can't wait it out that long. Since switching to this pill I am always hungry and have gained at least 5 pounds! I haven't changed my diet, even though I am always hungry I try to ignore it, but the weight has still come on! My skin and hair seem like they are very oily lately, and my face has been breaking out like crazy! I've experienced increased anxiety and when it comes on it is most often severe. I also am extremely sensitive and I find myself bursting in to tears out of no where. I've been getting a lot of headaches and just feeling like I'm out of it a lot of the time, very spacey. Also in the month I've been taking this, I have been spotting so much! Once I started this pill at the end of my cycle, the first week in to my pack I had a full period again! And since then have been spotting or having discharge constantly. I know they say you may spot when starting this, but it just hasn't stopped! I had been taking Yasmin for years, and switched to Loestrin in the past for shorter periods (my period would last about a full week on Yasmin) but the Loestrin also made me feel extremely anxious and my moods were horrible so went back on Yasmin. Decided with my doctor to give LoSeasonique a try, but I am done changing pills, I'm going back to Yasmin. Other than the lengthened periods, I had no negative side effects on Yasmin. I'd rather have my period for a week and feel normal the rest of the month, a few days shorter period is not worth it! If you are happy with your current pill, I would recommend sticking with it. I would not recommend this pill at all. It is the worst birth control pill I've taken and the side effects are horrible!!
Painful Periods		3	5	2			2/9/2010 10:54:49 AM	I, too, went on this pill so I wouldn't  have to deal with a monthly period, but I've had consistent spotting or breakthrough bleeding the last month of each pack.  Everything is fine the first two months of each pack, and then I bleed every day for the last month, which defeats the purpose of my going on this pill.  I thought this spotting would go away after the first few months (pack of pills), but six months later, I'm still experiencing it.  I'm going back to the tradiitonal birth control pills.

Birth Control	tyh211, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	12/29/2009 2:06:28 PM	I have been on this pill for 10 weeks now and have been having &quot;spotting&quot; and a little &quot;breakthrough bleeding&quot; almost every day!  Its extremely frustrating because the whole reason why I chose loseasonique was to only have my period 4 times a year.  My appetite has increased slightly, and I've had minor mood swings here and there, but nothing major.  I understand that your body needs to adjust to a new BC.  I used to take Yasmin for years (which was great) but I decided to switch and try something different because I hate getting periods!From the other reviews I read on this website and others, it seems like the side affects of this pill are extreme, and overall no one seems very satisfied with it.  I'm going to continue with this pill for another month or so and hopefully the spotting and bleeding will stop.  I personally have had no other problems with using loseasonique, but the daily bleeding (even though it is minimal) is becoming such an awful nuisance and really needs to stop!!  Or I will have to go back to using Yasmin.Best of luck to everyone out there using loseasonique or whatever BC method you choose!  Wish me luck. :)
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	tmk711, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	12/6/2009 11:55:09 AM	I started taking this b/c because I have terrible cramps every month and my doctor suggested this. First month was fine, halfway into my second pack I started what seemed like a period, even had cramps! I am on my last week of my 3rd pack and still on this &quot;period&quot; It has been on and off for a month! I would rather have cramps than have to worry about starting a period. I also gained 6lbs and had bouts of acne that I never had before taking this.Talked to my doctor she said its completely normal. After this week I am done. Too good to be true! I would not recommend this b/c to anyone I know.
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	12/22/2009 3:33:53 PM	I am currently on week of the 3month pack. First 4 weeks was wonderful. No side-effects at all. Started spotting during week 5 which progressed to cramping and heavier periods since week 6. Cramping resolved after 1 week but continue to have period still. Not as worse as a regular one though but seems to last forever. Also worsened my migraines in the first 4 weeks. 
Painful Periods	birthy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	12/17/2009 6:35:57 PM	My doctor placed me on this birth control due to my painful periods and pelvic pain.  I have had bleeding from the 2nd week I have taken the pill (I'm on the 7th week now).  Trying to be patient for results.  I believe this medicine has altered my moods and eating habits.  As of right now I am not satisfied with this birth control. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	MyAngel91704, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	12/14/2009 2:25:52 PM	I started taking this pill on November 15,2009...I did alright on it until December 8,2009....I have been bleeding for a week now...I think i would rather suffer with the cramps and headaches rather than bleeding for a week or more....
Birth Control	Spotter, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	12/13/2009 11:17:40 PM	Well, I haven't gotten pregnant yet, so that's good.On the first pack, once the second month rolled around, I spotted for about 6 or 7 weeks straight. It's gotten better, and I've been spotting less, but I'm still spotting a lot. I've noticed the tendency to start spotting around the first of each month of the pack, when I'd normally get a period. I used to suffer from painful periods, and haven't had any pain so far.I know some people said they've gained weight, which hasn't happened to me. However, my breasts have grown considerably. I'm not sure if this is due solely to the pill, or just my body, but I went from a small 36D to a 36DD, so I'm kind of hoping they'll stop growing. So far as the moodiness or horrible health problems, I haven't had any of that. My main problems have been breast size and a lot of spotting. I'm almost at the end of my second pack.OH! And another thing. I've been taking free samples from my doctor, but be warned: this stuff is expensive! The cheapest you can find a pack online for is $180, and it costs over $200 if you just get it at a normal pharmacy.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	11/15/2009 7:29:42 PM	I am on my 9th week of this birth control. I have experienced no breakthrough bleeding which is good because my periods were pretty bad. However, I have experienced dizziness/lightheaded, a rash of whitish pimples on my chest and forearm that I have never had and an increase in my eating habits. Is this common or will these side effects go away? 
Other	NACALEE , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	11/1/2009 10:43:39 AM	I HAVE BEEN TAKING THIS MEDICATION FOR ABOUT 3 1/2 WEEKS AND HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERAL SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDING WATER RETENTION, DAILY HEADACHES, EXTREMELY LOW ENERGY,FEELING LIKE I HAVE TO THROW UP,ACNE,AND WEIGHT GAIN. I'M VERY TEMPTED TO STOP TAKING THIS PILL BUT I PLAN TO TAKE IT A FEW MORE WEEKS TO SEE IF THE SYMPTOMS GO AWAY. I HAVE ALSO CONSUTLED MY DOCTOR AND WAS TOLD TO CONTINUE TAKING THEM FOR AT LEAST THE 1ST 3 MONTHS AND WAS ALSO TOLD THAT SINCE THIS IS A LOWER DOSAGE THAN REGULAR BIRTHCONTROL THAT THE SIDEEFFECTS COULD BE GREATER ON A HIGHER DOSAGE.ANY FEED BACK IS GREATLY APPRECIATED.    
Painful Periods	madashell, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/26/2009 8:51:35 PM	i'm on my week 12and i have been bleeding for almost four weeks and i might have to have a surgery to hopefully stoop it for good.  I think this medication is a bunch of bull and should not be taken at all.

I have been bleeding heavily for 7 days now. I have consistently taken the pill at 7pm every night and plan to call my doctor tomorrow morning for advice. I'm definitely planning to stop taking the medication and will begin researching other OC's.

My doctor prescribed estradiol 2mg for 10 days to stop the bleeding. He said to continue the birth control while taking this. Its been 12 days since starting the estrogen It has slowed down but the bleeding has not stopped. Is there any advice for me while I await my next appt? 
Birth Control	TabiCat, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/8/2009 7:52:14 AM	I am through my first month of taking this birth control and I have not experienced any sort of break through bleeding, mood swings, acne or weight gain. The only complaint I would have is my breasts are slightly sore, but nothing horrible. So far its a great birth control! I am 24 years old and I suffer from severe periods with extremely bad cramps and now I only have to worry about having a period 4 times a year, not every month. My husband is glad to see me not having that pain every month and so am I.I would recommend this birth control!
Birth Control	Meri, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	10/5/2009 10:18:50 PM	After 3 weeks on Loseasonique, I have developed extremely high blood pressure, gallstones, and a kidney problem.  I didn't have any of these problems before.  I am not happy. This is a dangerous drug.
Birth Control	goozzzi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	9/30/2009 2:52:39 AM	So far on the ninth week on the pill, I've had two periods of spotting for a couple of days and one prolonged period (1-week) of bleeding, which wasn't as heavy as my regular period, but was definitely longer.My main concern though is that my appetite has become virtually uncontrollable and I've already gained quite a few pounds. I am just constantly feeling hungry, which is disconcerting.Moreover, I've been experiencing constant fatigue, daily headaches and frequent nausea, and started feeling increasingly depressed. Seems like most of the forewarned side effects have manifested in my reaction to the drug. And a couple of days ago I started getting these scary anxiety/hyperventilation attacks... Has anyone else experienced the same effects?Now, I also have family history of breast+ovarian cancer, strokes, and high blood pressure. My dr. is aware of this but still said that the pill shouldn't increase these risks in me. However, I'm growing more and more skeptical given that I've been showing the other side effects already. Any thoughts/advice would be highly appreciated. I'm torn whether to stop taking the pill altogether or are the risks and side effects not so great and will dissipate with time?!Thanks a lot!G.

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	FancyFace, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/10/2009 5:14:49 PM	I LOVE this pill.  It is great for women over 35 who need a low dose.  And, since it is a low dose, it doesn't cause yeast infections like OrthoTriCyclen does.  I haven't had any spotting or bleeding.  I think the secret to that is to take it the same time every night and not miss any pills.  I take it right before I go to bed the same time every night and I haven't missed one pill.  I used to have horrible heavy periods that lasted TWO weeks!  Well, NOT ANY MORE.  YEAH.

Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	8/27/2009 11:34:06 AM	I've only been taking LoSeasonique for about two months. The first month went great. I didn't have any spotting or anything. However, about the time the second month rolled around and I would have normally started my period, I started spotting. And. it. has. not. stopped! I've been spotting for about a month (it has been very very light, so it's not EXTREMELY bothersome). My sister also had the same experience, and one other person I read about has as well. I'm going to hold out for about another pack and see if it gets better, otherwise I'll probably end up switching.
