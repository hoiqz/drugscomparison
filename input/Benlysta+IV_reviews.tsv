Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	9/10/2012 9:50:26 PM	I am taking clartin rather than benadryl before the treatment.  Benadryl makes me feel groggy.  The first 2 treatments were fine, the third was like a miracle... I actually woke up not feeling tired!  It lasted 3 days.Now I am getting the treatments once a month.  I broke my foot 6 weeks ago, therefore I am not getting the exercise I normally take to feel higher energy.  The end result is I am feeling tired and I my ache, probably from sitting on the couch most of the day.  I am hopeful it will help.  I'll write another input in 3 weeks.  My joint pain varies, most days good, some days not.  I need to note I am feeling tenderness in my breasts, I'll talk to my doctor on November 7
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	GJT, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/27/2012 2:45:58 PM	I had my first infusion on Friday August 24th. Today, August 27th I feel better than I have in years. Don't get me wrong I did suffer Friday evening and all day Saturday with side effects which included migraine,stomach upset,awful joint pain, and extreme fatigue. However,by Sunday the side effects were lessening and today I feel amazing.The joint pain is there but far less than it was before Benlysta and the fatigue I felt as soon as I woke up in the a.m. has diminished a great deal. This new drug is awesome. I can handle feeling like crap for a day and a half if the rest of the time is this good. Praise God.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	DJ, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	6/2/2012 12:23:44 PM	I have only had the first 3 initial infusions of Benlysta, and from the very being I could feel a difference in my body.  I have never had anything, other than my first steroid injection, that gave me this type of energy.  I do still have days that I am not well, but not as often and I recover within a day or two, whereas it use to take up to 5 to 7 days of complete rest to get over my major flares. I am still in the beginning of this treatment, but at this point I am very happy with the results.  No one should have to live the way I have for the past 15 years not knowing what day is going to be a good day or not a good day.  It is like having the flu all the time living with lupus. Now I am able to get out and enjoy my life, and some days I still have energy to spare!  That is a miracle.

I have seen much improvement in my fatigue. I am somewhat dissapointed that my joint pain has not improved more.  Since I was diagnosed 6 years ago I figure it will take some time to get my immune system under control. I do have headaches and feel bad for a few days after my infusion, but it is certainly better than feeling bad every day.

The first 4 infusions left me with nausea, severe fatigue and joint pain for several days after the infusion.  Now it is just fatigue for about a day.  I am seeing overall improvement in the area of fatigue, and brain fog.  Slight improvement in joint pain and swelling.  I have begun to lower my prednisone and mtx : )
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	let'sfindacure, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	2	Female	55-64	4/30/2012 3:05:15 AM	On April 6th, 2012, I received my first infusion at UMC Cancer Center in Tucson, AZ. I had some itching and draining down my throat, but at least the needle in my hand didn't hurt too much. Now my Dr.has me take benadryl 25-50 mg before infusions. For about three days after I was depressed but had energy. I thought I must have done to much as I had a lot of feet, hands, knees, neck and shoulder pain. Second infusion the RN realllly hurt my hand, so I am wondering about a dripline being installed. Energy, pain, and depression for several days after treatment. I will give this 3-4 mos to see if I want to continue with it. Thank goodness for insurance so that's a big plus.

For 1 week after infusion, I feel like I've been hit by a truck. Severe pain in joints and muscles, headaches, nausea and unbelievable fatigue. Also, I'm having trouble with episodic aphasia and insomnia. It has reduced my oral ulcers, raynaud's and cardiac symptoms, so it is effective. The administration and side effects are very demanding.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	anon, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Male	45-54	3/31/2012 8:01:45 AM	I have had positive results from taking this .  my joint pain has lessened and I have more energy and less fatigue . I am making other changes in my life with diet and exercise and don't know if they are the reason for the improvements  or the Benlysta.   I still experience occasional vision problems and dizziness unfortunately .

Noticing less joint pain and increased range of motion.  Best of all no flares. I feel more energy than I have had in 2 years and am able to stay more active.  It appears to be helping me a lot. I am so grateful for this miracle drug.  It's given my life back to me.

Slight reactions after the first treatment of fatigue, short-lasting shooting headaches and occasional dizziness for 1 week, but no reactions after the subsequent infusions.  My symptoms began greatly decreasing about 2 weeks ago.  I am feeling a great deal better, with less pain, more energy, improved cognition, reduced joint swelling, reduced malaise, overall feeling good for the first time in two years.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	dovecote2_, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	65-74	10/22/2011 3:05:57 PM	The first infusion left me with a 3 martinis reaction.  Then some nausea and very tired for a couple of days.  The second was quite different in body response. Mostly just very tired and no appitite. My third is scheduled for 10/31 so I'm sure it will be intersting afterwards. No change in pain or the myriad of other lupus symptoms.  Dr. said after the fifth I should start noticing small increments of relief.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	Stacey, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	9/27/2011 1:58:46 PM	Started with my first doses in August.  I didn't have any side effects except for a metallic taste in my mouth for a few days and being really tired and run down, more then usual, for the first 48 hours after the infusion.  After this past I felt wonderful.  I was able to reduce and almost stop my pain medication and after seeing my doctor she stated my test results were so promising that she reduced my metho weekly dose!!  I know when it is time for my next infusion because I start to experience the symptoms of this disease more.  I am so happy I am taking this medication!!

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	Jack, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	7/31/2011 3:31:47 PM	I have received my second infusion.  Both have brought severe flares such as I have not had for two years.  Joints ache, stuffy sinuses and severe headache are also present.  I'm so tired, that I have slept off and on between bouts of pain.
