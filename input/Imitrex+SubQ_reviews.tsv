Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	7/11/2011 6:31:16 PM	Didn't really get rid of my pain but my head didn't get any worse either? Left me feeling awful for more than a couple hours.  Felt sick to my stomach, hot, flushed, chest was heavy, some pain in neck and jaw and basically miserable and uncomfortable, not sure if the feeling after the shot is worth it or not, but I will try it again next time I feel an attack coming on.
Cluster Headache	mahinahoku, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/13/2011 8:21:21 PM	I suffered with cluster headaches for over ten years before Imitrex came out, I had to go to the ER everytime I had a headache, and nothing helped.  After using Imitrex injection, I thought it was a miracle, in ten minutes my headache was gone.  Side effects are nothing compared to the headache.  Because I suffer from cluster headaches, they become full blown within five to ten minutes, so I have to use the injections.

Migraine Headache	Wooly Mama, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/25/2011 7:03:44 PM	I agree with most other reviewers who loved this drug, with 1 exception. I use the individual vials with a 28 gauge needle. These are the old style insulin needles. The current 30 gauge are too small for the imitrex to smoothly inject so I have to ask the pharmacy to order them for me. 100 are usually about $30 here. I have taken imitrex since 1994 and LOVE,LOVE, LOVE it.I used to have 5 migraines a month lasting 3 days each. Day 1 was excruciating pain, day 2 was pain and vomiting/dry heaving and day 3 was pain and not giving a darn. I never missed a day of work and with frequent promotions. I did this for 30 years; I didn't know any different life. I sometimes wonder what my life would be like if there was Imitrex back then.So you see why I love Imitrex so much.There was a time I had to use the injector-type. I would still use a separate syringe. I would just pull out the plunger, inject directly into the syringe, insert the syringe needle into my abdomen (my preferred place) and carefully put the plunger in and complete the injection. I have even dropped the syringe with the imitrex already in it (liquid gold!) and didn't lose a drop. The viscosity is evidently high enough that it doesn't spill easily and I guess this is also why the new smaller insulin needles don't work particularly well.

Migraine Headache	Smith, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	45-54	9/9/2010 2:49:17 PM	I get 10 or more migraines every month. The imitrex injector is the most effective triptan, always clears the headache in 15-60 minutes. It is especially good when nausea makes taking pills difficult. The injector mechanism is too strong and leaves bruises about 1/3 of the time, but that's a small price for relief!

The pill did not do anything for me and the nasal spray replaced my headache with a horrible taste in my mouth that made me sick and lasted for 2 days.  The injection, however, is AMAZING! Within minutes pain is gone. The flushing and temporary tightness in my throat was a little scary until I read that it's typical and usually subsides quickly.  It is totally worth 15 minutes of slight discomfort to reclaim the rest of your day. The injections are a little awkward and one time mine shot out all over the floor when I removed it from the cartridge. It almost made me cry when I was so looking forward to getting rid of the pain. It only happened once though and I still highly recommend Imitrex injections for migraine sufferers. It's a wonder drug in my book!
Migraine Headache	cperez, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/6/2010 1:01:48 PM	I have been taking Imitrex for 17 years, and it is still working great!  I have 1-4 migraines a month, but this medication allows me to BE in the real world and not in bed in the dark and in pain.  The only thing that was difficult for me was that the injector seems to 'slam home' the medication.  The noise of the spring has made me jolt before and leaft a bruise. I used to have to psych myself up to use it.  I actually remove the injection from the auto-injector and use a sterile q-tip for the plunger. I can inject it at a slower and steady rate.  I have tried the nose spray and it does taste terrible!  You need a strong Altoid or Hall's afterward.  It worked just as well for me.  The tablet took much longer to work.
Migraine Headache	CNG87, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	5/24/2010 2:02:48 PM	I have been having severe migraine attacks for about 5 yrs now. I have tried almost everything. When I started using Imitrex (pills) they only worked sometimes which I found my self in hospitals at least twice a month for a &quot;shot&quot; which was the Imitrex but the shot was amazing I was finally prescribed it since it's the only medication that works. Afer about 15 min of the flushing feeling it seems to take away the pain which takes away the sick feeling. Though the shot is a little painful the pain of a migraine is much worse and last longer. It works best at the onset of one and I found if caught soon enough there is not a rebound migraine.

Migraine Headache	susan, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	1	5	Female	35-44	9/24/2009 12:49:22 PM	EXCELLENT for what I call &quot;level #2&quot; migraines. My only desire would be an easierinjection devise,perhaps one as simple as a lovenox injection. Imitrex is not simple to use and has SO MUCH waste of plastic for the landfill!!!!!
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	8/5/2009 6:03:26 AM	Ooooo...I tried this injection twice by my doctor and both times he mixed it with phenergan to subside the nausea that comes with it. The first time it worked okay but the second time, I was sick and it did not work! Can't say I didn't try.
Cluster Headache	Dezzit, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/24/2008 9:26:11 AM	I've suffered from clusters for about 10 yrs before discovering Imitrex Subq. It was like, where have you been all my life!  Even the pills didn't work for me. The small needle is nothing compared to the time my clusters last and relief comes very quickly.  As was said in previous post, the needle is small, there is a slight burning and a flush feeling then aftwards pure relief.  So I as long as you aren't alergic I'd recommend it.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/13/2008 4:48:35 PM	I've been using imitrex for about 6 years now and swear by it.  As for the person injecting to stomach - my dr instructed me to inject into fatty part of my leg (below hip).  I'm only 140# and have enough fatty tissue there to inject into.  Much easier, I'd think.  Imitrex relieves my migraine and nausea completely in 5 minutes or less.
Cluster Headache	Angel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	11/21/2007 11:44:32 AM	I was hesitate to use an injection but the nasal spray was AWFUL.  The needle is VERY small.  The sensation was like getting the flu shot....it burns for a few seconds.  I felt a flushed for about 10-15 minutes afterwards.  My headache was gone almost instantly.
