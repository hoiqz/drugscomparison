High Blood Pressure	NYM, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	4/18/2012 9:46:45 PM	Might as well be poison. After starting this medication, I experienced a multitude of symptoms. Although I could probably live with the headaches &amp; flushing of the face, some symptoms I absolutely refuse to tolerate. The worst was the spiraling depression, nearly constant rage, muscle twitching, and racing heartbeat. I got more symptoms as time went by. I refuse to risk my health any further by taking this terrible medicine. I stopped taking the pills a couple of days ago, &amp; I'm now experiencing new symptoms as my body tries to rid itself of the medicine. My doctor advised that this may happen. I'm back on the treadmill in an attempt to lower my BP without drugs. I will only consider HBP meds as a last resort &amp; if nothing else works. I'm glad for those who have a more favorable experience with this medication. Sadly, it's not for me.

Other	djpence_57@yahoo.com,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		9/15/2011 2:23:56 PM	I do not believe this medication should be on the market!  I have low blood pressure and a history of it.  I knew it was to help chest pain and that it does, but it also caused me to feel like I was losing it, exploding.  Severly depressed, constant crying and I believe it has the potential to cause suicidal tendency.  I called 1-800=FDA-1088 to report this.  I honestly believe it can be hazardous to others and my health.

High Blood Pressure	Knoxville, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	6/9/2011 1:50:43 PM	Since I've been on this medicine for three months I have felt VERY nervous, jittery and shaky, and my heart pounds EVERY time I climb steps. Also just feel like I'm a walking zombie. Did NOT have these symptoms before taking this drug. Very scattered in it's effective in lowering my BP. I complained at the last visit, but wasn't on it but about a month then, and my cardiologist thought it was a wonderful drug. Might be for many people but NOT for me. I'll insist on being taken off it on my next visit.

High Blood Pressure	baltman480, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1		55-64	3/27/2011 10:48:07 PM	My ED was bad enough before taking Cartia, since I have been taking Cartia 240mg AM and 240mg PM sex has been imposible! After I stopped taking Cartia for 2 weeks I am &quot;back in the saddle again&quot;. I also take Lisinopril and Cardura which take away a lot of my sex desire, but I could still function. I told my Doc 4 BP meds daily is too much, my BP would average 140/80, thats not bad, but he wanted it lower since I am a type II diabetic. Losing my manhood and my marriage is not worth a BP I cannot function sexually or physically!

Prior to the hard last artrial fibrillation I had several minor episodes which I was able to make them quit on my own.  The doc started me on 180mg dose and then on my last appointment he up the dose to 240mg. I cant really help other people with advise or if I am experiencing any side effects because I am on other medication at the same time.  I will share this: since I started taking all the crap I have had a skin beak out on my forehead ever since starting the meds, dizziness, flushing sensations, headaches, and numbness on the right side of my forehead.

Immediately, I felt nervous/edgy...wired, as if I had too much caffein. Also, the pounding heart. Due to get it rechecked next week and will complain...although, blood pressure cuff at home showed lower figures in the upper number, the diastolic still wasn't low enough.

When I started taking it, I put on 5 pounds in 9 days.  One person on here said bloating, another edema.  So I guess that's where the weight came from because I don't eat much.
Other	alpha001, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	3/15/2009 5:05:40 PM	I have been digonosed with Proxymal Supreventricular Tachcardia (PSVT). I was originally placed on Atenolol (25mg twice daily)before a failed catether ablation in Jan 2009, at which time I was placed on Flecainide (100mg, twice daily). The combinations of Atenolol and Flecainide lowered my blood pressure too low, and caused lightheadedness, cold hands and feet and numbness on my right hand. So, I was taken off the Atenolol and placed on Diltiazim (CARTIA 120mg, once a day).The first time I took this drug it caused burning or flushing sensation in my chest and also in my lower back--my cardiologist never told me about this. Since this is a time release capsule, I can feel when it releases in my body due to this burning sensation. Is anyone else having this sypmtom? I also have this feeling of lump in my throat when I swallow and is relieved by driking water which makes me burp or belch. This have possibly developed acid reflux, another side effects. I am taking Aciphex for the reflux, but recently discovered online that Diltiazem or any meds in the calcium channel blocker category can cause this side effect.  Because the side effects outweight the benefits, I have seen a Naturopath to minimize the side effect and improve quality of life. However, the Naturopath it's not covered by insurance. He tested me and found that my liver, stomach, and lung is not functioning properly. So, he requested to have my blood tested for numerous tests. Tests that my cardiologist or doctor should have ordered. So, I am waiting to have the test results, ER Records, along with all X-Rays, Echo, etc, compile them and take it to him. From there he will determine what type of treatment or cure to put me in. This is all herbal--so no side effects.   In addition, I met a person while walking on the treadmill who also has palpating heart. She must have had a great doctor who disgnosed her Thyroid is not working properly and she's doing great! So I will ask for TSH and T4 test also.

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	1/17/2009 5:33:58 PM	Have been taking the 120mg dose once a day for about 5 years, and when combined with Diovan 320mgs along with HCT 12.5mgs was very effective in controlling my HBP.  Doctor recently upped the Cartia dose to 120 mgs twice a day, lowering the Diovan to 80 mgs.  Was ok for a couple of days, BP was lower, however, caused gastrointestinal distress ie: gas, pain and diarrhea.  Was told by doc today to try taking both Cartia at once in the am, and Diovan at night.  Don't know if that will work or not - but hope so.

I find it very difficult to release each dose from the package. On average 70% of of capsules are smashed on at least one end.  I haven,t broken any capsules open but have come very close.  Is there any possibility of exploring the possibility of packaging in bottles in lieu of the cardboard punch out method?? They are packaged as Diltiazem CD and are generic for Cartia XT 180/24HR CAP.
