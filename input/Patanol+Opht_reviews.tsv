Allergic Conjunctivitis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	4/23/2012 11:14:41 PM	I have used the medication during allergy season for many years. It works great. I tried OTC first and had no relief. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars for overall is because of the expense. I have excellent insurance and my copay was $50.00 but it has been worth it.

Very expensive but works wonderfully. I suffer a lot since everyone has a wood burning stove or fireplace so I use all year around. $75 copay. Pharmacist just recommended Zaditor which cost me about $11.00. Use to be perscription, now OTC. Works well but not as well as Patanol. Am using Patanol only when eyes are really, really bad. Also take OTC Claritin and I get by.

Allergic Conjunctivitis	amanda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	4/6/2010 6:16:19 PM	I was given a free sample last year for Patanol. I remember it working and was very happy with it. I have dry itchy and red eyes all the time.I was prescribed it this year and hate it. I now have a feeling like there is something in my eye all the time and it hurts. I wish I could get my money back. It was very expensive! I would recomend others to just go with over the counter.

I had been suffering with a (yet undetermined) allergy for years and this provided the relief I so desperately needed.  Incidently, I had tried OTC eyedrops and have determined that THEY are a waste of money.
Allergic Conjunctivitis	Kathy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	6/30/2009 9:28:10 PM	My Doctor recommended Patanol because he said that my eyes looked red. It is too expensive. My co-pay was $50.00This medicine caused blurred vision and also my upper eyelids were puffy.I had much whether have slightly red eyes than have blurred vision and puffy lids.I did not like Patanol and thought it was a waste of money!

I have had to discontinue use of Patanol and use OTC eye drops to lubricate my eyes about every 30 -60 minutes depending upon my activity.This is a great disappointment to me as the drug has been very effective for many years and also I have to pay full price for it and my hayfever season has just started. $80 wasted!

I went to pick it up at the drugstore and the copay was $35.00 so I cannot imagine what the cost to the insuror is.  I bought Clear Eyes ACR and took Claritin generic tablets and the toatl cost was $11.59.  I had great relief and saved alot of money. Oh, by the way I am also a pharmacist who knows drugs but will always go to a physician for my eyes.  MY FP approved of my suggestion and now has given his patients options when he considers Patanol.  That drug is a major rip off.

Allergic Conjunctivitis	sunshine247, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	65-74	6/7/2008 11:15:31 AM	I have suffered for many years with this condition and finally found a doctor that helped me. There's no more burning, itching and swelling. He also has me using Systane (lubricant eye drops) several times a day. This has really helped with dry eyes. I tried other well known lubricants in the past, they never worked as well as Systane.

It was sad because the school would call me to have him pick up so that the kids wouldn't tease him, now he doesn't have that problem at all with this medication.  It works well.

Using the drops with OTC allergy pills have helped him a lot.  He still has some burning/itching in the eyes, but he previously couldn't even go outside in the grass in the spring.

I've been  following orders and wearing my glasses while doing the drops; however, my eyes feel like sand dunes and ache. I've developed sinus problems since taking them and I have a funny &quot;coating/taste&quot; issue going on in the back of my throat. They work but don't use them if you develop sinus/severe allergy problems. Remember to tell your Dr. everything; meds and symptoms!

Put a drope in each eye and every thing clears up, soar throte, cold nose.I feel much better very fast and can sleep much better.
