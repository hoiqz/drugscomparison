Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	DJ, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/13/2012 8:01:50 PM	I had resisted going on meds. After struggling to control bg with diet only for a year and having poor results, I started(2000 mg) Metformin XR daily, 2 500mg tabletswith breakfast and dinner.Remarkable results, I test between 100 and 125 consistantly and am able to add back nutritious foods to my diet within reason. Some mild nausea, bloating, and gas at first but mostly gone after a week, still some belching depending on what I eat {red bell pepper is worst)Should have done this sooner!!!
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	65-74 Female 	2	2	1	Female	65-74	6/8/2012 9:10:12 AM	when on this drug I saw little difference in my blood sugar. I just recently had a cat scan with contrast &amp; had to be off this med for 48 hrs.During this 48hr period my urinary incontinance disappeared. I have stopped the med as per my Dr. and on a strict diet and I'm hoping to be off any diabetic meds forever. My icontenance was more trobeling to me. I can't tell you how happy i am not to be wearing diapers

Yes, it will give you diarrhea. When I first took it I thought - no way. Dr wanted me to take 4 daily. I decided to ease into it starting with 1/day and gradually increased up to the 4. (I take 2 after lunch and 2 at bedtime) My body became accustomed to the medication and the diarrhea is not such a problem - more of loose bowels. However, I have noticed that WHAT you eat has a great impact on this side effect.  Monitor your diet and decrease or eliminate the foods that increase the problem.

It strikes fast and furious. I have been recently switched to Glucophage XR 500mg 2 2 times daily and it has calmed down. Problem, insurance won't pay for it and it's too expensive to buy.

I noticed when I switched to generics my sexual drive kicked into overdrive. I try to tell my partner its the medication. If you don't believe me read the leaflet you get from the pharmacy when you pickup your prescription. Now I understand why this drug is also given to women to aid in conception. Overall I've been able to control my sugar level and lose weight.

Other	 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female		5/9/2008 12:08:54 PM	I had some health issues post hysterectomy and a year of terrible anemia.  My issue was a quick wieght gain during this time and all the problems that go with excess weight.  I started with high blood pressure, enlarged abdomen, anxiety, etc.  I've been taking this for about a month every other day - extended release.  It's actually making a difference and is helping me digest food, etc.  I'm not diabetic but my MD felt metabolically I was a mess and this would help.  :)  I've not had any major problems.  We shall see how things continue......
