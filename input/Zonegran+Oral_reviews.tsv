Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	9/21/2012 8:26:25 AM	Zonisimide was prescribed as an &quot;off label&quot;drug to help with anxiety/depression.Although initially it did seem to calm me a bit after a month or so I began to become very moody ans jittery,irritable.I believe it almost changed my personality and my husband would attest to this.It was frightening to be so changed by a drug. I am off of it about 5 weeks now and feel so much better. My psychiatrist says my experience was not typical but I just wanted to throw this out there. I was beginning to think I was crazy but it was the drug.

Using Zonegran along with Vimpat was a last try before the surgery and has been very successful.   I am on a VERY large dose and still face no concern of &quot;addiction&quot;.  I know when I missed taking med because I feel my equalibrium changes some and my appetite increases quickly.Because of my large dose (800mg) I face confusion and memory recall issues quite often. I decided it was better to face those issues than uncontrollable seizures.

I have only had 4 big seizures in my life that been documented, but mostly bofore I started taking medication, my problems were partial seizures.. This medication takes away the partial seizures which allows me to focus in school, and I never feel like a zombie compared to Topamax.. It is hard adjusting to this medication at first, but I decreased my original dosage after 4 months of taking it..After that it has veen smooth sailing.

I take 200mg at night. So far it has worked better than Tegretol &amp; Keppra. I have no seizure since being on any of the meds, but the side affects of Keppra was not good. I slept in, gained weight, stayed up late. Not real interested in anything. So the Dr. switched me to Tegretol, even thou I begged to to be on Zonegran. He denied me &amp; put me on Tegretol, &amp; once I started taking that pill, all worse side affects happened. I gained a lot of weight the first week. Could not go to the bath room, even taking meds that was suppose to help clean the system. I was really angry. My depression self esteem hit rock bottom, &amp; I just felt like I was on a path of life not looking good. So now here I am, Zonegran. So far so good. Thanks to reviews, &amp; studying seizure meds, it has opened doors for me to understand what are my options.

I still have good and bad days with my fibro pain and back pain, but I have lost 24 of the 40 pounds that I gained while on lyrica. I did this with no effort or diet change, but feel so much better. Now I am watching my food intake and making better choices with what I eat......just been great!

For several years I had intractible seizures, and my body just plain didn't seem to like anti-convulsants.  I suffered with side effects, some life threatening (literally), until this was introduced.  I must admit, even since the surgery I have had quite a few strong auras (I get complex partial seizures) but absolutely NO side effects.  And in 8 months of being on this medication, I've only had my dosage increased once for seizure activity.  That's incredible for me.  It usually gets increased monthly.  I will be taking this until I'm finally able to be weaned off of anti-convulsants altogether (here's hoping...:-)

But for the most part, my migraines are somewhat under control.

My body doesn't tend to respond well to them.  This is the ONLY one with which I haven't experienced negative side effects!  I had brain surgery 2 months ago during which the source of my seizures was removed and am still taking the same dose.  I have had 1 seizure since being on Zonegran which, ironically, was after my surgery, but I had missed a dose the prior evening.  Overall this drug is a Godsend compared to the other anti-convulsants I've had (Lamictal, Trileptal.)

After just a few days with out taking it i felt much better,much more talkative and alert,hopefully I'll be myself when I'm back on Lamictal.

My moods were very stable then medicaid would not pay for them and I could not afford any longer so here I go again riding the bipolar rollercoaster.  Really not fair when they find a drug that actually helps then for one reason or another they take it away.  Please send this to the FDA so it may just be possible for Medicaid to give me back Zonegran the one drug that helped me tremendously.

I was taking Depakote for about 8 years until 2 1/2 years ago.  I haven't lost weight, I've lost quite a bit of hair.  I experience stomach upsets and gas-embarrassing. I recently had 2 bouts with kidney stones in less than 1 year and the meds given at hospital did nothing to improve memory-only added to the confused state of mind once I was released from hospital. I now have difficulties with time.  I can't seem to keep track of the amount of time it takes to do a task, play a game or read a book.  My ability to complete sentences has worsened also.  Does anyone else have the same problems with time?

First they put me on Keppra, which was a disaster. Then they switched me to Topamax, which was okay but didn't completely stop the seizures. Then I was on Lamictal, which was actually working for a while, but then I had two series of break-through seizures. Last year, I was put on Zonegran, and haven't had a single seizure. I just tend to be exhausted more frequently and eat a lot less.

Going through multiple seizure medications trials due to allergic reactions, my doctors put me on Zonegran about 10 months ago and it is working wonderfully!  The only concern is the dramatic weight loss, 30 lbs! I am thin to begin with, so just be very careful. I still have issues with some memory, not being able to find the right words to say when having a conversation, and occasionally my motor skills are off but in the big scheme of things, if my seizures are under control I am very happy and can deal with it.

I lost weight on this medicine was easy take.  The downside I came across was while taking this the doctor said I needed to take 1200mg of potassium daily as it messed with your potassium levels which meant another 8 pills a day.  In the 4 to 5yr mark of time I suddenly started developing kidney stones.  I have no other medical conditions and this is not something that runs in my family.  After the 5th time in the hospital it was finally determined my body had built some type of immunity to the drug causing me to develop the kidney stones.  *off to the next drug*

On top of all my other meds that is alot of pills to swallow. A secondary effect is my mood is greatly improved and I feel so much better. A down side is alot of intestinal gas that is painful and embarassing.  I don't have to worry about getting seizures do I after taking this med? I sure hope not. Because so far, this has been a good med for me.

My doctor had me taking Depakote AND Zonisamide at the same time. I could feel my brain as if it were &quot;boiling&quot; in my skull. EXTREME paranoia and hallucinations. Terrible side effects on my liver and kidney function that I still suffer today. My memory was COMPLETELY gone. I could not even finish a sentence. I have never felt more out of control of myself than when I was on this drug. I was on an emotional roller coaster so severe that I was suicidal. FINALLY, in desperation, I begged my doctor to just put me back on Depakote. It has it's share of side effects too, but at least I don't feel like punching my ticket and checking out. Zonisamide is a VERY dangerous drug. The only good side to it is that I was so hyperactive and not the least bit hungry, that I lost quite a bit of weight. I've since gained it all right back since I quit though. Take it if you must, but if you have ANY of these signs, talk to your doctor IMMEDIATELY!!!

The two years I was taking it was a holy hell. I immediately began losing muscular strength  and had tremors in my arms and legs. At 41 and very healthy that was weird. My memory and cognitive abilities dropped like a stone.( I was  PHD in Math)They tested me for things like MS etc, and psych tests. Finally I got a good neurologist and after a month off of the drug I was  thinking and spelling and reading, doing complex math at my pre zonegran state, without tremors etc.I'd rather have a migraine then lose my brain- this drug should be off the market.

ALTHOUGH, I had severe gas, painful. I would find myself sleeping all the time, yelling at my son and having no interest in him whatsoever. I would cry myself to sleep at night thinking he too was in some way depressed bc of the situation, although being only three. Christmas Eve, I had a car wreck, totalling my car because of a seizure, and now I am paying for it. I am left with nothing. Thank God, though, I still have both my son's life and mine. I just basically want an answer as to why I have the seizures. No trauma, no history, nothing. They just started in Feb 06. When I try to have a reg. convo., I can't think of the words I want to say, now I can't drive for six months. I've been on topamax, naproxen, dilantin, now this. Nothing seems to work.

This medicine has made it so that I do not have any.  I can't imagine not using it.  It is also easy as I can take all 5 pills at one time rather than through out the day.
Other	gina, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	12/3/2008 11:29:03 AM	I have Fibro and have been perscribed Lyrica,Neurontin and now Zonegran. I couldn't take Lyrica because it caused me to be like a zombie, Neurontin was okay to start with then it caused me to go into a seizure.It scared me to death so i stopped that one. Then my Dr. gave me Zonegran. I already have violent and major mood swings,and this made it 100 times worse. That was my experience on these medications.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	11/26/2008 4:37:02 PM	I took this drug for MANY years as migraine prevention.  I started at 100mg when that was the only one available and slowly lowered my dosage until I finally was able to go off it.  It worked wonders, I went from having 2-4 migraines a week to 1 a month and then none at all.  I have stopped the zonegran for a few months now and I have not suffered a migraine!
Other	sunshine, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	45-54	10/26/2008 11:18:40 PM	I was prescribed Zonegran for severe migraines.We had tried Topamax but I had several side effects to that medication. It took a while for us to regulate the amount of zonegran needed.I was taking 400-500 mgs daily. I lost 40 lbs, was nauseated, had difficulty concentrating.It was worth it to have control over the dibilitating migraines.My quality of life improved. After taking this medication for 3 years, I stopped it on my own, thinking I could get by without it. (I had a hysterectomy and the headaches were less frequent.) I was sick of seeing doctors. This was a mistake. I now regret my decision.Gained the 40 lbs back.Would have liked to have kept the 40 lbs off.  I can concentrate better and do not feel like I am in a &quot;fog&quot;. However, I also feel the migraines returning and feel the shocking sensation shoot across my brain prior to a migraine. If zonegran works for you...do not discontinue it. I'm sorry I did. 
Simple Partial Seizures	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/22/2008 10:03:15 AM	I like this medication because I can take it all at one time rather than taking it in the morning and at night.  It's easier for me to remember.  It helps both with the seizures and with my Migraines.  I can live with the side effects as I had most of the same side effects on Topamax.

I was on Trileptal for 2 years.  I gained 50 lbs and I was still have seizures.  My doc finally changed me to Zonegran and I think it is a miracle drug. I lost the 50 lbs I gained and nest of all...  I have been seizure free for almost 7 years.  He told me I could go off of it if I wanted to but I am too afraid that I will have one while driving and I don't want to take that chance!
Simple Partial Seizures	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/4/2008 2:40:43 AM	My seizures began immediately after an auto accident in Oct of 2002.  I was first placed on Neurontin what further debilitated me and I even had grand mal on this drug.  Lamictal caused Stevens-Johnsons syndrome.  Keppra put me in a coma.  Tegratol reduced my seizures and along with the addition of a seizure alert dog gave me some independence.  After adding Zonegran, my seizures ceased.  Beware of generic though, they contain lactose as an inert ingredient that is not generally made known to doctors and pharmacists.  I am severly lactose intolerate and got very sick before we discovered the lactose hidden in the 4 100mg generic Zonegran I was taking daily.  As soon as we switched to brand name and make sure it is always brand name ordered by doctor and approved by insurance I have been great since 2006.

Other	sunset, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/27/2008 4:30:43 PM	This is the best Epileptic Drug to control the Complex Partial, Simple Partial, Electrographic, and Absence seizures. Absolutely no side effect at all. It is the main antiepileptic drug which normally is considered to be an adjunctive drug. As intractable (or refractory) as I am; having been on this drug now for nearly 3 years without any side effects at all - been doing one heck of a job when all the other antiepileptic drugs could not do or last due to allergic reactions or severe side effects. It is working great alongside with Klonopin (Clonazepam). I strongly recommend the brand name Zonegran over Zonisamide due to formulary differences.

Several pills a day but works great. Better than the other 5 seizure meds I tried. And the side effects are minimal compared to how I feel. ED being my biggest complaint along with hyperactivity.

They need to make pills for higher dosage, though, taking 5 of these plus other stuff every day is a pain in itself!!

Convulsive Seizures	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	2/1/2008 10:34:51 PM	I have lupus and started having convulsive, and partial focal siezures. I started on dilantin then went to dilantin with lamictal and now I'm on zonegran with lamictal and this has been going on since 1999. I didn't have any real side effects with the first treatments until I went onto the zonegran and now I seem to have the works memory loss, extremly tired, mood swing very angry mood swings,loss of interest in my children,  nausea, stomache pain. They all started when within a couple months of starting this medication and my Doctor never told me that these could be possible side effect and now that I've been on it and there isn't really any thing  else left for me they just want me to deal with them. I ever have gone to the gastro doctor who has given me 4 differnt meds for the stomache pain even though they don't know whats wrong. Not to mention the fact that I yell at my kids and then go cry because I shouldn't have. If I had know the risks I wouldn't have taken this medication because I don't think its doing a good enough job. the doctor didn't either I now have a vagus nerve stimulator but have to take the meds till it works. 
Other	metomic, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	3	4	3	Female	55-64	1/27/2008 11:46:29 AM	My doctor prescribed this to help with neuropathic pain in my feet after I suffered chronic inflammatory demylinating polyradiculoneuropathy and was paralyzed and intubated for 5 months in the hospital. This was after trying several other meds.  The combination of this and nortriptylene has helped this nerve pain.
