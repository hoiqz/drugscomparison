Dry Eye	elf59, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	8/16/2012 6:05:11 PM	I have sjogren's and keratoconjunctivitis sicca...severe dry eye. My eyes were so dry that blinking became difficult, and my lids would actually stick to the eyeball, or in any area with airconditioning my eyes became unbearably dry. When I started on Restasis I was amazed at how well it worked for me. My opthalmologist and the pharmacist both said this drug has no preservative in it but if kept in a clean pill bottle or etc, that it could be used more than for the one day application. I've done this with no problem of infection, etc, for about 4 years. I however am like almost everyone here who finds this med is just too expensive.  Although it works well (I can actually wear a contact lens in one eye!!), it is just too costly to use daily. And you do have to continue on it regularly for full benefits. I've gone to OTC drops like Bion Tears which help.Blurred vision is one annoyance of it.The burning does eventually decrease if you stay on it faithfully long enough (at least for me it did).
Dry Eye	Gigi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	55-64	7/27/2012 2:24:07 PM	I have had some improvement in feeling like I had grit in my eyes; however my eyes continue to be irritated and red. I have noticed that my lids are very dry and my formerly long eyelashes are thinning and break off. I have also had difficulty with repeated sinus and bronchial infections. I am now stopping the restasis.
Dry Eye	Marie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	7/21/2012 12:23:40 PM	My optometrist noted that I have dry eyes and gave me a prescription for a 3 month supply of  Restasis with 6 refills. I balked at the price especially since I have not noticed that my eyes are dry. She informed me that there is no cheaper alternative and highly recommended that I use Restasis. I purchased the smallest amount, a 2 week supply, and used one drop per eye according to instructions. It burned as mentioned in the instruction sheet. So I waited for the burning to subside. It didnt. After one hour I looked in the mirror and was shocked. Both my eyes were bloodshot, the left one worse the right. Several applications of Refresh eye drops had no effect. This was at 8pm. The next morning my eyes were still very red but gradually improved in the course of the day. It took till the following day for my eyes to come back to normal. Obviously, I will never use Restasis again and some $130 go into the trash. I should mention that my eyes are unusually sensitive to cigarette smoke resulting in burning and tearing. Also I could not tolerate eye makeup which I wanted to wear when I was young. Onions and certain chemicals seem to affect me more than other people. My optometrist was informed of that.
Drying and Inflammation of Cornea and Conjunctiva of Eyes	Proc3000, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	25-34	7/16/2012 10:34:44 PM	Ive been taking restasis for about 5 months now.  I have had a history of severe dryness of the eye and inflamation.  This has also led to bacterial infections due to over active oil glands as well.  My doctor advised me to put in the drops, cap the tube, refrigerate it, and I could get about 3 doses out of it.  This makes a month supply last about 45 days for me and helps on the cost. Its pretty expensive.  With my Insurance I pay about 30 dollars for a month supply.  I know without insurance it would cost me about 150.  I do get a burning sensation in my eyes a few mins after I take it.  I have found putting artificial tears in about 10 mins before taking restasis helps and storing it in the fridge and keeping it cold helps as well.  Overall Im satisfied with it, and it has helped my condition.  It di
Dry Eye	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/13/2012 1:02:51 PM	This medication provided relief from dryness after about 3 weeks of use.  It helped blurred vision and sensitivity to light.  Also relieved eye pain related to dry eyes.
Dry Eye	Dave, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male		6/30/2012 11:18:27 AM	I was having extremely blurry vision to the extent I didn't feel comfortable driving my car.  In July 2011, I saw my opthomologist and he stated I had very dry eyes and prescribed Restasis.  I used it twice daily and noticed improvement. After 6mos I went back for a check and continued using Restasis along with OTC eye drops.  During this time my symptoms were stinging, redness and scratchyness in the eyes and throat. I also noticed I developed nasal drip, coughing, and sleepless nights.My eyesight had improved enough so I stopped using the all drops in December.  By the middle of February my eyesight started to get blurry again.  So I started using Restasis along with OTC drops twice daily.  The same symptoms returned along with a new sympton this time which now include nose bleeds.  The cost $150 for 30 days was just to expensive for me being retired and due to additional symptoms I have decided to stop using it.   
Dry Eye	cantsee, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	65-74	5/25/2012 7:30:55 PM	I have been using this drug for 1 month now.  My eyes sting, vision is blurred, am feeling very uncomfortable all day due to the effects on the eyes, eyes continue to feel dry.  This drug is very expensive and am considering stopping use.  My doctor said the drug takes 2 months to start working.  Am trying to wait it out as I have an appointment with the doctor next month.  I really am not happy with this drug nor the price of it.  I also use otc drops 6/7 times daily.  Seems my eyes are feeling worse since using Restasis.

I was using OTC lubricating drops recommended by my doctor. I tried plugs twice. I then went on Restasis with high hopes. I used the drops for six months along with Lotemax and OTC drops as needed. I had a moderate amount of relief but noticed my vision was becoming blurry even with my corrective lenses. This frightened me so I came off the Restasis about a month ago. So far, my vision is still blurry. I may try the Restasis again after my next visit with my doctor, if he recommends I do.

Dry Eye	alligator1, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	4/10/2012 3:03:18 PM	I have been on Restasis for a couple of years.  I am amazed at the side effects that I am reading here as I have some of them and would never have associated these with eye drops and my doctor never asked me about any side effects.  I did not know that this drug suppressed your immune system and my ophthalmologist never suggested that I first try over the counter eye drops just this very very expensive Restasis.  I have had constant draining down my throat since I started this drug and a terrible time sleeping.  I just went off the Restasis on my own and onto over the counter eye drops.  I will update to let you know if over the counter eye drops still relieves my dry eye's as I do have dry eye's.

The congestion in nose &amp; upper respiratory from drops running down back of throat were ignored at first because of the benefits. I have a chronic sinus condition also so I am used to these symptoms. However they got worse. I recently had a chest x-ray due to breathing trauma that was an allergic reaction to levaquin antibiotic in IV during surgery. X-ray showed white sticky stuff in lungs. I had no doubt it was from the Restasis. I don't smoke, haven't had bronchitis or pneumonia in many yrs. I quit takng Restasis &amp; will notify eye doc.
Dry Eye	catmomseven, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/7/2012 4:01:26 PM	It was a nightmarish experience for me.  the worst effect was that my eyes burned so badly, it scared me, and I stopped using it.  Secondly, it is grossly over-priced:  you use one drop per eye, and one month's supply is over $250!Not worth the money or the side effects.

I noticed for the first tim on a TV ad for Restasis that it said &quot;can cause temporary brain sensations&quot;.  What does that mean????

I have much less inflammation and eye watering. (Who would have thought excessive tears could be a symptom of dry eye syndrome, but it is). I have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but already have seen a big improvement. The drops do sting and burn for about a half hour after I put them in, but I can put up with that for the improvement I have seen. My eye doctor also told me I could use the same vial for the morning and evening dose, as long as I don't touch the tip of the dropper and make sure it's used within 24 hours.

Still i will continue with Restasis. No side effects like im reading here.
Dry Eye	DonD, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Male	65-74	3/22/2012 10:20:35 AM	I was diagnosed with extremely dry eyes. The test showed a reading of 2 in both eyes. My doctor put plugs in three times, no help. He sent me to another doctor and he put plugs in also. Still no help. Doctor #2 suggested that I try Restasis and to give it a 3 month trial at least.So far its been 6 weeks and now I only have to use the OTC relief drops about 3 times a day instead of 10-12 times a day. So far so good.

I was a little scared by reviewers who reported stinging senstations; that hasn't been a problem for me at all. For those with insurance, I found it much cheaper to order from my insurance company's by-mail program. It costs $65 for a three-month supply, vs. $40 per month at the local pharmacy.

Dry Eye	ADK fan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	11/19/2011 10:13:11 AM	The first time I used it, I thought I might be having a reaction to it.  Within an hour, I felt stuffy, sore throat, runny nose.  I have only been taking it a few days, so I don't know how effective it will be, but the stuffiness and throat issues seem to have lessened. I was glad to find the reviews from other users, to learn this isn't all that uncommon.  It seems wasteful to only use the dispensers once.  I am using it prior to Lasik and hope that I don't need to use it long, due to cost, even with insurance and drug company discount card.  It seems complicated to find a place to even store it.  I haven't had much problem with burning, or blurred vision. In the past, I used over the counter tears and I have no problem with continuing to use them.  Part of my dryness is due to a dry office environment, and I am running a humidifier there and home to help.

Dry Eye	CJ, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/6/2011 10:49:56 AM	I had Lasik Surgery a month ago.  After effect is dry eye.  One week after surgery, the doctor gave me a prescription for Restasis.  I use 2X day, once in morning and once at night.  I have little stinging but that is it.  I noticed that the second dose in the evening is soothing.  Like a few others, I cap it after the morning dose and put it in the refrigerator so the second dose is cold when I put it in my eye.  I find this soothing.  I also noticed a &quot;ticke&quot; in the back of my throat along with post-nasal drip. Doesn't bother me but this started about one week after I startd using this medication.  But other than the little stinging, I find this drug very helpful for the dry eye. And, fortunately I have a prescription card so it only cost me a few dollars for the prescription.  Hope this review helps others.

After the very first time I used Restasis, I noticed an immediate relief from the dryness.After using Restasis, it made me think of the otc eye drops as feeling like water.
Dry Eye	None, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	9/6/2011 11:26:34 AM	I wear daily (only one day) contacts and remove them every night.  I also use a CPAP machine every night. Several yrs ago I developed dry eyes - red, ichy eyes always watering; had a hard time maintaining eye focus.  My father had the same problem later in life. I tried antibiotics, steriod eye drops, hot compresses, all forms of OTC eye drops.  Any relief was only temporary.  I've been using Restasis for 4 months and the above symtoms have disappeared.  I am very satisfied with the product.  After six months, I plan to quit using Restasis and see if the symtoms return. My only concern is the long term effect on my immune system, as with any drug that suppressed your immunity.  However, because of the improvement in my quality of life with Restasis, I will take the chance.
Dry Eye	mitzi, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/25/2011 10:33:35 AM	I am on the 2nd week of Restasis only, finished w/pre-drops (Lotamax).  Contrary to many opinions here, I have no issues other than tiredness/mild burning after application.  No blurred vision, no side effects at all.  Restasis has few if any side effects so I was amazed at what I read here.  Perhaps those using Restasis and having problems have other issues as well and should not be using the drops or are not using them properly.  I am happy with this medication, dry eyes are much better.

Dry Eye	Beth_53, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	7/31/2011 1:29:32 PM	In 2004, I was diagnosed with Sjrogren's. Restasis was prescribed for the eye dryness. The drops burned, but I noticed that my saliva started to return. After months of use, I stopped the drops because of the burning. At this same time, my kidney function dropped to 31%. I was also taking anit-fungals for a yeast infection. Prior to the drops, my kidney function was normal. In the 7 years, since discontinuing the drops my kidney function has returned to 45%. In 2009, I adopted a dog with dry eyes. Her vet prescribed a dog version of Restasis. I remembered not liking the drops so I went on the Web to research. At that time (2009), I found a link that stated that Restasis should not be taken with anti-fungals because it can damage kidneys. Luckily, my dog stopped needing the drops. I currently use Alrex for my dry eyes. (It's wonderful!) And my kidneys are improving! Please be careful if prescribed Restasis.

It has been effective for me, but I do get burning on occasion.  My concern is more about the immune suppressant part of the equation and I'm thinking of stopping it. I have been using it for a bit over a year and in the last year have had more colds (and sever ones) and a bit more post nasal drip.  I have also, most recently been having some inner ear problems with my ears not adjusting to pressure going up and down hills and on planes.  The latter may not be related, but eyes, ears, nose, throat....all go together. The other option provided to me by my physician was plugs in my eyes.  Seems a better way to go

At his suggestion I started using the drops. He told me to give it at least 3 months before the optimal results. I do not see that it has helped. I had mild dry eyes previously especially when I had to take allergy or cold medication. I had to increase my sustane eyedrops after beginning Restasis and that has not changed. It still causes burning and itching and I have developed a rash on the back of my neck which I think may be related. I am stopping using the drug as of today.

Restasis changed my life. Twice a day dosing is easy. my doctor rxed a steroid to help with initial stinging and I felt soooo much better in 3 weeks! My co pay is $24.  If you are a cash pay patient, it will be expensive as will EVERY medication.  The more severe your dry eye, the longer it takes to feel the benefits, but it starts working instantly, just takes time to clean up the years of inflammation built up.  Ask your doctor about the steroid, it can help you get started!  LOVE Restasis   google:  restasiscopay.com  type in your zipcode and it will give you the top 5 insurance plans and the coverage.

Dry Eye	Sandy, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1		55-64	1/3/2011 8:52:25 AM	This medication caused extreme pain and sensitivity in my eye and eyelid.  I had what looked like a blister to appear on my eyelid and puffiness surrounding both eyes.
Dry Eye	nane, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	12/21/2010 11:12:38 PM	The Restasis has helped my dry eye's, I have been on this prescription for 18 month's. But for the past 18 month's I have had one sinus infection, ear infection, headache after another. I had never had an ear infection in my life and I have had 4 within the last 6 month's as well as a pnuemonia and a bronchitis. It maybe or may not be the Restasis but I am stopping the medication and going back to my regular dry eye drops. I guess I'll see if it is related.

Dry Eye	momusa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	12/19/2010 5:44:58 AM	I've been on Restasis for two weeks and have an itchy swelling rash around both my arms, under my arm and towards my back. For the first few days of the rash I thought it was dry skin as winter just started so I've been lathering up with lotion.  But now the rash is so itchy red and swollen, it has to be an allergic reation and not dry skin.  I've also been having stomache aches too.  I'm going to stop taking Restasis to see if the rash goes away.

But after 10 months of use, and several months of worsening sore throat, post nasal drip, and an occasional nose bleed, I have stopped and started the Restasis enough times to confirm that those symptoms are due to the drops. Don't know where those of you who spend $150 per month are getting it so cheap -- it's almost twice that for me. And despite having three boxes left, I am quitting.
Dry Eye	TL of Indy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	11/5/2010 12:26:59 PM	I wish I'd never started using this. My opthamologist prescribed it. I was only told the TV commercial version of side effects (I was never told anything about Immune problems). Upon my first few months of using Restasis, my eyes burned, I had uncontrolled eye twitchings, feelings of being in a fog or haze, very painful head &amp; neck stiffness and last of all throat pain. It was not worth taking. I told my doctor my symptons and he did not believe me. He said none of the symptons were on a list of side effects he was given. I had stopped taking the Restasis. He asked me to try it again. Against my better judgement I did. I was in side effect hell. I stopped taking Restasis, stopped seeing that doctor and I am still visionally dryed eyes, blurred eyes, have arthritis in my neck/back of head and I had neither of these before I started taking Restasis. I would very much like to sue but no money, but if a class action suit is started include me in on it.    
Dry Eye	dave,  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1			10/19/2010 3:38:48 PM	I took it for about 3 weeks. At the same time I developed a heart Arrhythmia (missed beat every 2-10 beats. Dr. ordered echo, EKG, stress test. By the time I got to the stress test the Arrhythmia quit. I had been off restasis for about two months. Now I thought I would try it again. Took Restasis one dose four days ago and the Arrhythmia started immediatly and continues today...
Dry Eye	KBC, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	10/12/2010 11:09:45 PM	I went for an annual eye exam and mentioned that my eyes felt like allergy eyes, but no itching. He diagnosed me with dry eye and started me on Lotemax and Restatsis for a month. I had burning which took about an hour to go away, but my eyes felt worse, more watery. After 1 month I was rechecked and the dry eye had improved per exam. I have been on it about 6 weeks now and I have not noticed a decline in eye burning and watering, I have also recently been plagued with difficulty falling asleep during this time period. It has become so bad I dread going to bed just to lay awake for hours. I searched for all of the side effects and this is the first place I have seen any mention of the sleep difficulties. I will be stopping this medication to see if it helps. If there is no improvement in my sleep issues after stopping it for a couple weeks, I may consider retrying it on a limited basis, perhaps once per day. Sleep issues aside, the watery eyes, swelling and burning I still have may be enough reason to stop this medication. I will post if there is any improvement in my side effects.

Dry Eye	eye burner, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	9/23/2010 4:34:04 PM	I have been on restasis for 5 months and have severe reactions...like putting acid in my eye. Became even worse after an iridotomy procedure, which, by the way, needs to be repeated.  Dr. has now prescribed Lotemax (steroid) as a supplement and preservative-free tear drops (optive) AND refresh ointment at night...they still burn.  I asked if I could go off...he said no, but since my daughter is getting married in 9 days and I don't want my eyes to be burning, I think I will self-unmedicate against his directions.  Scheduled for plugs in one month.  Will post progress.
Dry Eye	mrstriggins, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	2	Female	45-54	9/17/2010 10:17:31 AM	I have severe (frontal) headaches in my sleep so bad that they wake me up throughout the night.  This means I have a headache in the morning and am exhausted all day.  I am going to stop using them today and start using my OTC natural tears again.
Dry Eye	H.,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		9/12/2010 4:54:13 AM	I have been using Restasis for over two years and aside from the cost, have been pleased with the results. I went from using over the counter eye drops seven plus times a day to using it 0 to 2 times a day after the first six months of using Restasis. I do have some skin irritation some days after using Restasis, but it is not so pronounced as to be a problem. However, I do have significant sleep problems. I fall asleep almost immediately, but wake up every two hours. If I'm lucky, I can go back to sleep after a bathroom visit, but if I wake up after 2:00 a. m. (which I usually do), often that is the end of my sleep for the night. Needless to say, this effects my daytime functioning significantly. After re-reading the list of side effects by the manufacturer and noting that Restasis can get into breast milk, I am wondering if it can also effect brain functioning, and therefore sleep patterns. Anyone out there had a similar experience or have any information on this speculation?               
Dry Eye	paix, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	65-74	8/3/2010 11:30:08 AM	I have been using Restasis since it became available which is several years.  Other than an occasional burning sensation, I have had no problems.  I have severely dry eyes.  Doctor says on scale of 1-10 that mine are 9.  Always shake the the container.  I then lay down, blink after applying and keep my eyes closed for a minute and a half.  I do reuse the container to save on cost.  I cannot function without this medication.

Dry Eye	marciann, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	6/12/2010 2:33:56 PM	I have had burning and post nasal drip with use.  Also discovered when I use it at night, I do not sleep. Bad news for an insomniac.  My eyes continue to burn and hurt at night, making it difficult to read and watch TV.  Not worth it to me.
Dry Eye	Kirk, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	2	5	Male	45-54	6/3/2010 11:40:31 PM	I have been on this medication for 6 months.  It took about a month to notice a change, but now my eyes feel much better, and I use OTC drops less.  Keep the vials in refrigerator to reduce burning, notwithstanding the directions for use, use one vial for both AM and PM use. The drug company is covering itself by directing to use two vials a day.  The vials have a cap that can be snapped back on after use.  Why would they do that if it is supposed to be thrown away?  The 12 hours apart dosage is somewhat problematic.

Dry Eye	linda, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	5/22/2010 5:31:07 PM	I used Restasis for about six weeks.  My vision became blurred after about three weeks. I decided to stop it to see if that helped, and it did--my vision was no longer blurred. I won't use it again.
Drying and Inflammation of Cornea and Conjunctiva of Eyes	Priscilla, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/20/2010 7:38:03 PM	This has been a huge help to my dry eyes and it's helped enormously with my rosacea which spread to my eyes. There is a mild stinging sensation at night when I'm already tired, but otherwise I have no problems. I use the drops immediately when I get up in the AM and last thing at night. They've helped so much I can wear my contacts again. I'm thrilled.

Dry Eye	Christie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	4/9/2010 1:19:43 PM	I use these drops for over a year and my eyes got worse and worse, finally, the ophthalmologist said if they havent helped in a year, you might as well quit using them. As soon as I quit, my eye werent nearly as dry as with the drops. These made my eyes feel like sandpaper!
Dry Eye	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/4/2010 8:15:33 PM	My dry eye symptoms were so intense that I had to pull over off the road and rest my eyes so I could continue driving.  After 3 weeks of restasis therapy, my eyes are 80% back to normal.  I'm on week 6 now and my symptoms continue to improve.  
Dry Eye	NKL, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	3/21/2010 5:39:58 PM	  The Restasis is working for me.  Before starting I read many of the comments posted here and had concerns about whether it would work. But so far, I've had no problems.    I have very dry eyes and over the counter eye drops were not working.  My doctor, an optophthalmologist, was concerned about dryness in the eye because it could lead to blindness.  He wanted me to take Restasis.  But before starting me on it, he had me take steroid drops for about a month. And told me it owuld help the Restasis to work better.   When he gave me the prescription for Restasis, he told me that it would take 4 to 6 weeks before I would notice any difference, to continue to sue the steroid drops and to continue using over the counter eye drops as needed, especially at night.    Last week, the doctor checked my eyes and no dry areas.  Id been on Restasis for two months.  The amount of over the counter eye drops has dropped considerably but I still need them occasionally.  My doctor told me that it take three months for the Restasis to be operating at full strength and to keep taking it  it was working and he could see it when he checked my eyes. Thats the reason I only gave it four stars for some of the items.   After a few months, Ill update my experience.     I mentioned to my doctor that the Restasis burned a little.  He suggested storing it in the refrigerator and said that his patients told him it reduced or eliminated the burning sensation.  I havent tried that yet.  I have a very good eye doctor.  I was higly recommended to him by my ophthalmologist when he retired.     Anyone who has questions about how long it takes Restasis to work or whether it is working should ask their doctor.  
Dry Eye	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	65-74	3/13/2010 2:08:20 PM	My lips are dry and swollen after using it for 1 1/2 months. However, my eyes used to blink involuntarily and that has stopped to some degree.

My eyes became more light sensitive and the burning sensation lasted 6-8 hours, only to be relieved by using over the counter drops every 10-15 minutes. I've stopped using Restasis completely and am better without it.
Dry Eye	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	2/28/2010 10:45:54 AM	After 10 days my lips got swollen for two days. Two days later I started to feel a pressure in my chest. My family insisted that I had to go to the emergency due to the nature of the pain. I went and of course they admited me, did all the tests to check my heart and everything was fine. I am sure the Restasis is to blame. The pain lasted 3 more days after I stopped the drops. Was a very bad experience.
Dry Eye	Sundlower, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	2/23/2010 2:43:58 PM	My doctor put me on Restasis for dry eye and told me it might take a year before I noticed any significant improvement.  I have now been on it for two years and haven't seen any improvement at all.  My prescription has run out, and I quit!
Dry Eye	Joy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	2/23/2010 12:57:38 PM	I didn't know I had severely dry eyes until my eye doctor pointed it out. My eyes were itching often but I thought that was just normal, or maybe I was wearing bad mascara. Since I have been using Restasis twice daily, I notice a significant difference in redness, itchiness and dry eye.  In fact, if I forget to use the medication I often am reminded by now having a sense of a dry eye. It is likely I will use this eye medication forever and I am okay with it. Also, its expensive but I have learned you can reuse the vials. The snap that comes off can snap back on and is airtight, so its completely sanitary to reuse the vial drops if you are careful not to let the dropper come in contact with anything. I find comfort in this because I did not like wasting so much of the drop (there is a lot left in the vial after you used it) and, I have been able to make a 30 day supply last 90 days which eases the burden of the high cost.

I had been using OTC drops approx 20 times a day - now I'm down to approx 8x/day.  My eyes are still bloodshot, and they still burn.  I am still on the lookout for something better. I have taken fish oil, flax oil, evening primrose, eyebright, caroteen, etc.  and I sleep with a mask.  all this and my eyes are only mildly better.  = ( 
Drying and Inflammation of Cornea and Conjunctiva of Eyes	patient, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	65-74	2/11/2010 2:30:37 PM	I've been using Restasis for 41/2 months. My right eye, the dryer one, is often very red, aches and burns. My optomitrist said it often takes 6mos. to see improvements. I'm  orally taking fermented butter oil caps from Green Pasture which also have omega 3s in them and using Simply Saline in my nostrils to cleanse  and open them. I'm really disappointed in the Restasis which is why I'm trying to do some research on this product to determine if I want to continue usage. My co-pay is $30.00 which is still too much if  I'm not getting results and possibly doing damage to my body. I'm going to  read the contraindications sheet carefully.
Dry Eye	Joely, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	2/3/2010 4:44:59 AM	The dry eye part really helped my eyes.  I could hardly wear my contacts anymore.  After about 2 wks, I could wear my contacts for several hours again.  The side effect that I have had -- I do not see anywhere on here or in &quot;side effects&quot;.  Evidently, my skin is allergic to the drops.  Beside my eye- where the tears may seep out at night, my skin looks chapped and hurts, and is very red.  If I touch it -- wow!  I tried creams, etc.and could find none to help, until I tried chap stick!  That helps, but, it still hurts and now has begun to peel off - as though I've been blistered.  Also, on the underside of my jaw and my neck I have had raised 'bumps' that itch and turn red.  Cream helps a little sometimes. I finally decided that it had to be the Restasis, because I haven't changed anything else.  I am not going to use it for a while and see if that is really what is causing my reaction.
Dry Eye	judy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	2/3/2010 1:44:27 AM	My eyes were driving me crazy with the burning, hurting and feeling like a foreign object was in them. Went to an ophthamologist who diagnosed &quot;no infection,&quot; recommended artificial tears and sent me on my way. Very expensive and not very helpful. Tried various brands of artificial tears and gels. None really helped. Went to my optometrist who diagnosed moderate-severe dry eyes with scratches on my cornea. Gave me a sample of steroid drops, Lotemax. This seemed like a miracle. Lotemax stopped the pain and my eyes looked less red. Lotemax is not supposed to be used long term. Tried Restasis. Terrible side effects including eyes looked worse with more redness, felt worse with more pain. Quit using it. Found Similasan homeopathic Dry Eye Relief at Sprouts Market. So far so good with for 2 days without Lotemax and with Similasan. I hope it lasts!  
Dry Eye	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	1/19/2010 11:06:34 AM	This has been a miracle drug for me.  I had been using artificial tears every 1 1/2 hours.  Started using Restasis - zero side effects - and within 3 weeks could cut back to artificial tears once every 2 hours, and after 6 weeks once every 2 1/2 hours.  But the best part is that my eyes feel normal again, which they never did with artificial tears alone.

Dry Eye	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	12/4/2009 12:17:43 AM	I have been taking Restasis for about 9 months.  I have Sicca Syndrom and I can tell a big difference when I use the tear drop.  I have not had any side affects, with the exception of the stinging.  I have even been able to stop using my OTC drops as frequently.  Also, one thing to ask your doctor about is plugging your punctals if you have severe dry eye.  Good luck to all who use this product, I highly recomend it.

I've seen other posts here about arthritis so I think it's the Restasis. Never a problem with arthritis before taking it. I'm skipping today's dose. Hope my thumb feels better.

Since using this medication I have developed severe pain like slivers of glass in my eyes besides burning and foggy vision.  I feel that all my new problems are being caused by the use of this medication.  I now have severe eye problems.
Dry Eye	dry in WI, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	11/18/2009 9:49:32 PM	I have been using restatis for about 3 mons. I do not experience a whole lot of burning or stinging when applying it (it helps to keep it in the fridge).  my eyes burned from being dry to begin with.  My main complaint with my eyes were my inability to wear my contacts and the constant tearing.  My eye dr put me on doxycycline.  within 2 days the tearing has all but stopped.  What a relief.  My current regime is 3 drops of restatis, 1 tablet doxycycline, 1 drop of lotemax, 3 fish oil capsules and wetting drops as needed daily.  It sounds like alot but it seems to be working.  Hopefully by January I will be back in my contacts although my eye dr thinks it will be daily wears only.  It the restatis helping?  Not sure yet but my eye doc thinks my eye looks better so I'll give it more time.  I have not experience any side effects with it.   Remember dry eyes in general make the eyes burn and sting.

I also take Flax seed oil. However, in the last six months or so, I have been experiencing chronic minor sore throats, minor hoarseness and post nasal drip. I am a singer and my voice has been affected by these problems.  I am afraid to stop the Restasis, but don't want permanent damage to my voice.
Dry Eye	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	11/14/2009 10:58:47 AM	I put this stuff in my eye only one time.  It was SO painful. Every time I blinked, it burned, and burned so badly that my eyes watered for an hour.  I guess that's how you get rid of dry eyes?  I know I should try using it for a longer period of time, but every time I try to use it I put it back down. My memory is too long and I'm not stupid.  If a medication is that painful, how do they expect the patient to use it.
Dry Eye	bcr, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	11/8/2009 10:46:26 PM	I have had tremendous relief of dryness, but recently have began to experience dizziness.  Tonight, after taking fish oil capsules to deal with hand pain, I became even more dizzy... not sure if the two are interacting, but will not use restasis tomorrow...
Dry Eye	dolphin, 75 or over on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	4			11/4/2009 7:07:48 PM	I have used restasis for 2 months in preparation for lasik and have developed arthritic swelling in the underside of my fingers and palm of my hands.  The swelling has caused two knuckles to temporarily dislocate when I bent my fingers too aggressively.
Other	disgruntled, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	10/18/2009 10:16:57 AM	I went to the eye dr. to get a prescription for new glasses. He said I had dry eye and that I need restasis (even though I did not complain of dry eye; he said my eyes looked inflamed). I tried the restasis samples he gave me and they made my eyes sting, and my new glasses do not work because they also made my vision blurred. I stopped using it after two days and I hope my eyes go back to normal so my new glasses will be effective. I think the Dr. is being induced in some way by the company that makes restasis to over-prescribe it. Also, the drug instructions say to not re-use any drops left in the vial, but the dr. told me to store it upright in the fridge and re-use it, and that the manufacturer said it was okay to do it.

I was lucky to have a very well informed eye doctor and staff. They told me to use the holder in the starter kit-refrigerate the vials so they burn much less-open the vial, use in AM-place opened vial in the holder-which holds it upright-back in the refrigerator to use again in PM. They said a representative from the company told them to do this. This system works very well for me-I use the butter dish compartment which has a cover-keeps it clean. My eye doctor was very pleased at my last checkup after I had been using Restasis for several months. Much less abrasion of the cornea. It still burns a bit for a few minutes, but I have been able to drastically reduce the amount of lubricating eyedrops during the day. Still use Bion tears at night. Unfortunately my eyes are still very light sensitive.
Dry Eye	imisery, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	65-74	9/20/2009 11:49:29 PM	The first time I used it I developed inflammation and discharge after a couple of months, which was relieved when I stopped. I have one punctal plug in each eye, use Lotemax, and Eurythromycin for infection. One year later my ophthamologist wants me to use it again. Three days after starting my eyelid with the plug is swollen and feels that the plug is protruding. Pretty miserable. The web site says Restasis will not increase tear production with punctal plugs or topical steroid drops, or active eye infections. The packaging, cost, and waste are outrageous, and I have no indication that there is improvement in my quality of life. Dr.'s recommendations run counter to Restasis web site info. I am in constant discomfort since restarting Restasis, as opposed to intermittent discomfort. I can't live like this! Quitting Restasis and getting a 2nd opinion.
Dry Eye	Judye, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	65-74	8/15/2009 11:39:58 PM	I was on Restasis two years when I decided to stop using it a month ago. For three or four months my eyes were redder and watering like crazy. For two weeks following cataract surgery in May, I stopped the Restasis. I noticed the watering stopped and my eyes were not as red. They actually felt better than they had in months. That's when it dawned on me the Restasis was probably the problem with my eyes itching, watering, and extreme redness. I've stopped it completely, and my eyes feel much better even though I continue to use OTC eye drops. This expensive treatment is in the past for me.

I was still having to use the &quot;tears&quot; as often as if not more often as before. Definitely does not live up to it's advertisements when it comes to the needs of my eyes.
Dry Eye	Ashley, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/6/2009 12:11:39 PM	I am really surprised to hear how many people are having negative side effects. I have had none. Not even burning. I really doubt this drug causes the strange side effects people are writing about. I have done my research on this drug. It has to be taken exactly how the directions say in order to be effective.My dry eyes were so bad that they blurred my vision during my 2nd pregnancy. This is a miracle drug. My eyes are 100% after using for 1 month!
Dry Eye	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	8/6/2009 11:58:41 AM	Felt like it was working a little the first couple of months, then by the end of the 4th month my eyelids became swollen and inflamed. My eye doctor recommended I stop using it and two weeks later, my eyes are back to their normal dryness but with no swelling or redness.
Dry Eye	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	7/30/2009 2:26:58 PM	Had Eye burning from start. After 3 days burning/eye pain continuoued all day. Blurred vision got worse. Swelling under-eye; could not sleep; throat pain. Arthritis flare-up (painful small red bumps) in fingers after 3rd day use. Called Dr. Discontinued use. Pharmacist advised that drug can impact immune system; therefore I believe arthritis flare-up in hands. Using Gentile gel for severe dry eye and optive drops now; no side effects from this. Has anyone else experienced arthritis pain  flare-up? Are side effects listed above more frequent in older patients? Can anyone tell me what is in this med. that causes such side effects?

Dry Eye	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	6/26/2009 10:15:41 PM	My doctor prescribed Restasis for dry eye caused by contact lens wear and computer use. I also switched to daily contact lenses. The Restasis helped my dry eyes and the daily contacts have been wonderful. I have used Restatis about two months and about two weeks ago i started experiencing severe dry mouth and burning of my tongue. I stopped using Restasis about 3 days ago to see if that was causing the dry mouth problem,
Dry Eye	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/8/2009 8:05:17 PM	I have been on Restasis for 6 years now and would never get off!  It took about 2 months to work, and I noticed a decrease in my dry eyes.  I tried to reduce the dosage to once a day, and could tell a difference and went back to 2.  I use to use OTC eyedrops about 6 times a day and now I am down to 1.  This drug is a miracle and I have no side effects.  I just wish it cost less.

Hope it helps but the price is prohibitive.  Looking for low-cost alternatives or programs.  However, I noticed a few posts about fish oil.  Please try to find a vegetable source for Omega 3 and Omega 6's!  Fish oil can be toxic!  I have arsenic poisoning from taking the fish oil in mega-doses that doctor recommended.  Do your own research on this, please, but save yourself and find vegetable source.  
Dry Eye	herliv, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	3/30/2009 2:14:53 PM	Burning was present each time for approx. 1/2 hour.  Very expensive.  Could not sleep and I could not figure out why I was dizzy!  then I read the other reviews!  Doctor never mentioned any side effects!  Remembering every 12 hours was very burden-some.  I quit using it, have all but one vial used and $300.00 later!  Hated the experience and the cost.
Dry Eye	jousangel, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	3/28/2009 11:56:46 AM	After battling Sjorgren's for many many years, I have found fantastic relief after only using Restatis for only 1 month.  I have stopped using all other eye drops &amp; ointments. However, I have been having sore thorats, post nasal drip and headaches which began about the time I started the eye drops.  I'm not sure if they are related but sadly after reading other reviews I believe so.  Has anyone had these side effects and did they disappear after longer use than 1 month?  The drops have worked so well - finally releif - the sore thorat/nasal drip are almost worth enduring.  Any suggestions to help with the side effects???
Dry Eye	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	3/14/2009 12:19:43 AM	I tried this drug initially 2 years ago for severe dry eye. At that time I used it for two months with no results. Six weeks ago my eye doctor insisted I try again, using it in conjunction with lotemax, warm eye compresses, and fish oil capsules. I have been extremely faithful to the regimine, only missing on average one to two nights a week on the warm compresses, and have had no results. I have had no side effects such as stinging or itching, but for me it simply hasn't worked at all. My eyes still feel like the Sahara and I still have to use eyedrops throughout the day and even during the night. Fortunately my insurance plan covers the cost, or I would be livid at this point.
Dry Eye	carlreck, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	55-64	3/11/2009 1:06:44 PM	I think that restasis is effective for reducing dryness in my eyes, but my vision is getting so bad since I started taking it. I'm going to stop using it in hope that it'll improve. It's like looking through a dirty window-very unclear vision. It started after about the 1st four weeks.
Dry Eye	kwikkleen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	2/26/2009 6:08:39 PM	I have been using Restasis for about 3 weeks.  So far I am experiencing burning when applied about 90% of the time.  I still experience scratching at night.  It takes about 4-6 hours for my eyes to adjust after using.  Reading becomes difficult in the early hours of the day, clearing up by mid day.  
Dry Eye	cmg, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	2/20/2009 9:38:20 AM	I have worn contacts for 40 years; after menopause my eyes became very irritated; after treating the inflammation with steroid drops, I again got reflux tearing. The ophthalmologist recommended only using preservative free lubricating drops, Occusoft cleanser weekly, and warm compresses daily for blocked meibomian glands. After this was improved, I started on Restasis with great results. Within  a month, I am again wearing soft contacts, using refresh classic once or twice a day.
Dry Eye	judi, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	2/17/2009 6:06:10 PM	I have only been using for 2 weeks.  I understand it will take 6 weeks to obtain the full benifit.  I sometimes scratch the cornea at night, which increases the  burning when I use it.  I really hate anything in my eyes making it difficult to administer the drops. 
Dry Eye	JoJo, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	2/8/2009 1:40:40 AM	Much advertising was seen on commercials. Restasis seemed the answer for my dry, itchy eyes.This drug was not effective. Also, I was in the mid part of my insurance and this drug cost me over $400.00 out of pocket.
Dry Eye	dmf63, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	2/3/2009 3:26:57 PM	Restasis and punctal plugs helps reduce the misery of Sjogren's Syndrome.  I tried Restasis a few years ago without success, but plugging tear drainage ducts seems to help it work better, possibly because it must remain in contact with the eye longer.
Dry Eye	AnaManuel, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female		1/27/2009 8:04:01 PM	As prescirbed by my physician I have used this Restasis for the past two years.My experience has been less than satisfactory and discomfort from day one to present is severe..burning..stinging!!
Dry Eye	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	55-64	1/24/2009 9:43:00 AM	I have used Restasis for 6 months. For the most part I believe it has been effective. However, I have experienced nose bleeds and blood discharges for quite some time. I too had an increase in Blood Sugar. I never made the connetion until the nasal blood discharges (mostly thick) became a chronic issue, and I read a post here that a person had experienced this as well. My dry eye has improved but I will try not using for a while to see if blood in the nose subsides.
Dry Eye	KateN05, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	1/14/2009 5:40:36 PM	These drops made my vision so blurry I couldn't drive.  Since it has cyclosporine in it which is an immunosuppressive drug which raised my blood sugar level very high (I'm diabetic).  So anyone who has a blood sugar problem shouldn't use it.  It also gave me nose bleeds. Since it does suppress the immune system it probably explains why some people on here are getting infections in their eyes.  I quit it after a few days and my pharmacy gave me my money back....maybe they know!

Drying and Inflammation of Cornea and Conjunctiva of Eyes	Elaine, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	12/19/2008 10:15:00 AM	I wrote earlier about using all of the contents of the vials.  My Dr. said not to throw away the contents after one use.  I also called the company and the woman I spoke to said to follow my Dr.'s advice.  She said that the reason they recommend throwing away the contents after one use is because they use no preservatives.  I feel ok  using all the medicene in the vial because there is an over- the -counter homeopathic eye drop that has no preservative and that co. recommends throwing it away after 1 month. That greatly reduces the cost of the medication.

If this product is used it should be used just for a month and then stopped.  For some reason eye doctors think this product is god's gift to eye inflamation.  I am now just using artifical tears and an eye ointment overnight and my vision is very clear, no dizziness and my eyes are not burning or stinging.  DO NOT USE RESTASIS EVER
Dry Eye	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	11/27/2008 7:36:20 PM	It is difficult to put in the eye.  The drops burn for a long time afterwards. I have a bitter taste in my mouth after using Restasis. Is it just me?   Teresa

I still can't put my contact lenses in for more that 3 hours. I use it at night and in the morning. I noticed that if I have to get up during the night, my eyelid feels like it is stuck to my eye. I hope it gets better.

I have decided to discontinue using it as I have found no relief and felt better without it. My eyes constantly burned and were extememly red all day. Also, I was told to use it at night before bed, which I did, and found that I could not sleep.  It is not worth the money. I will stick with my good old eye drops for my dry eye. Less expenisve

It seemed to make my eye blurrier even several hours after the drop was put in.  And the cost was horrible even after insurance.  However I have been using it for 4 months now and my dry eyes have improved to the point that I no longer need other drops during the day. And since starting Restasis I have not had any abrasions to my eye as a result of it drying out.  I had reoccuring corneal abrasion on a monthly basis as a result of having dry eyes.  I have noticed post nasal drip, sore throats and increase sinus problems.  My eye dr told me that once the drop is put in close your eyes immediately to absord the drops and blink them down into your tear ducts.  I don't do this and maybe thats why I have the nasal/sinus problems.  For me restasis has helped immensely.  It took about a month for me to like the drug and get used to the cost.  I hope that everyone who needs it will be patient and give it at least a month or two before nixing it all together.

I don't think it's worth that price. I checked Costco drug list on line and it was $300 something there.

Dry Eye	Mike, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	55-64	9/19/2008 3:18:54 PM	My doctor recommended restasis after cataract surgery for both eyes and follow up lasik for my right eye.  The restasis caused burning and discomfort and I felt or saw no improvement in vision.  On the other hand I started suffering from constant post nasal drip, burning and hoarseness in my throat that became very painful and worrysome.  I have stopped the restasis to see if my throat improves.  My eyes actually feel beter after stopping the drops 3 days ago.

I have been using it now for 4 weeks and have found immense releif for my reoccuring corneal abrasion problem.  I didn't realize how this was affecting my sleep at night--I was anxious about waking up with the pain-after a week of using Restasis along with steroid drops and Systane eye drops I was sleeping better at night.  After 3 weeks I was not having to use the Systane so often during the night.  For me its worked.  I just had to be patient.

It has a vial holder which allows you to get at least three applications out of the vial. The vial sits in this holder and you refrigerate the unused vial. 
Dry Eye	littlerke, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	65-74	8/10/2008 8:36:34 PM	I have not used restasis, but did ask my eye Dr. about it for dry eyes. I asked if it would &quot; make tears&quot;, as I haven't shed a tear for 10 years, and I don't feel it is healthy to not be able to shed tears. He said restasis would not do that and neither would the prescription &quot;Fresh Kote&quot;, that he gave me..but he said it would help dry eyes and was less expensive. I appreciated that info. as I don't think my drug card will cover restasis or fresh kote. Has anyone heard of fresh kote? I'm glad I read these reviews because I am cautious about drugs that haven't been on the market very long.

Its only been a week and i have continued to have abrasion problems.  Plus I often feel like when I blink I am getting a film over my eye that won't go away and causes blurred vision.  The drops burn sometimes and sometimes not.  The cost of this drug about made me have a heart attack.  It does sound like this drug is pretty much in effective though and I appreciate everyone's comments as it will help me to make up my mind on whether ot continue with this expensive eye drop treatment or just have the surgery.

Dry Eye	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	7/27/2008 7:47:04 AM	I had been using the Restasis for four years. $$$.  Did not help at all.  Then I found out they are ineffective if you have plugs in your eyes. When I confronted my Doctor  with that information, he said I could quit them and  use over the counter drops.  Why isn't this information included when you purchase the drug, or why doesn't the pharmacist tell you this?  Better yet,  why doesn't the Doctor know this?

Dry Eye	Bright eyes, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	2	1	Female	45-54	5/20/2008 7:53:12 PM	I began using Restasis for dry eyes at my optometrist's recommendation. I have had Lasik surgery and persistent dryness prior to the surgery. The Restasis drops were very expensive, and my doctor told me to use the vials multiple times, which I did (the directions say use them only once). The drops burned my eyes, blurred my vision and gave me a bad runny nose and post-nasal drip. I contacted the manufacturer about my problems and they advised me to immediately discontinue the product. The pharmacy would not refund the $90 I spent, so I wasted my money, my time and caused worse dryness to my eyes. I now use an HLA supplement for dry eyes and it is working great! I also use Bion Tears, which works much better than Restasis did for me.    
Dry Eye	Cathleen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	55-64	5/4/2008 10:31:18 AM	It started helping me great for the first 3 years.  I was diagnosed with Sjogrens Syndrome 31 years ago.  Now it burns my eyes and it is not as effective.  Total years using this product is 6 years.
Other	Well Informed, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	45-54	4/2/2008 10:41:11 PM	My opthalmologist recommended I start using this twice a day before and after Lasik surgery.  I had never had dry, itchy eyes until I started using it.  In addition, my throat has been scratchy to the point of hoarseness. I do not plan to continue using it after reading similar posts.
Dry Eye	Alexandra, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	3/20/2008 10:22:30 AM	My eye dr told me to use a single vial for a.m. and p.m. dosage--of course, taking precautions to avoid contamination.  I used the drops for a couple of years and then noticed the burning upon application returned worse than when I first started.  The burning lingered and became a problem with my work, so I stopped using it for several months.  Having 2 new boxes left, I started using Restasis again a few weeks ago.  The last few days I have had a burning sensation at the back of my throat.  I had this problem awhile back when I was on Restasis and did not associate it with the drops. My family dr diagnosed it as acid reflux at that time.  I began drinking PH balanced water, as I was told it could help acid reflux.  The burning sensation,went away; so I assumed the water was indeed helping. I did not associate the burning sensation at the back of my throat w/Restasis.  A few weeks ago, I stopped using the water and about that time started using the Restasis again.  The burning sensation at the back of my throat has returned, and I am wondering if the drops are irritating my throat.  Does anyone have any input concerning this?  
Dry Eye	Icanseeclearlynow, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/11/2008 8:00:36 PM	For years, I was suffering from dry eyes and had eye pain, blurriness, and difficulty opening my eyes when I awoke in the morning.  After a few days of using the Restasis, I have noticed a huge improvement.  I no longer use eye drops throughout the day or gels at night.  I have a slight burning sensation after inserting the drops, but it doesn't last long.  It really helps to press on your tear ducts for about 1-2 minutes after inserting the drops.  This prevents the drops from getting into your sinuses, which can cause your nose to run. 
Dry Eye	scootercats, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	55-64	2/29/2008 4:18:08 PM	It seems very wasteful to throw away such expensive medication. It burns a little, have been using for about six weeks. No improvement yet, time will tell. Over the counter drops are so much more soothing to my dry eyes.
Dry Eye	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female		2/21/2008 9:38:44 AM	Although the drug is expensive, it has helped with my dry eyes.  I went to my eye doctor because I thought I needed a prescription change.  He said my eyes were extremely dry.  He recommended I try Restasis first to see if my eyesight improved and it has.  I get a slight burning sensation when I first use the drops but it disappears quickly.
Dry Eye	mizunderstood, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	2/12/2008 11:14:35 AM	The side effects I have experienced: burning, itching, redness, blurred vision and runny nose, are far worse than the dry eye problem I was previously treating with over-the-counter natural tear replacements. The medication is very expensive and is not worth the price or the discomfort for me. I was unable to return my unused vials at the pharmacy. I'd recommend researching this product thoroughly and asking your eye doctor questions before spending money for the drug. I believe my thyroid condition and menopausal state contribute to the fact that this drug didn't help me; take these factors into consideration if you are considering using Restasis.    
Dry Eye		5	4	5			1/13/2008 11:42:41 AM	For some reason, I haven't experienced any of the burning sensation that others have. It took a few weeks to really make a difference but it certainly has.

Dry Eye	Happy Patient, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	12/29/2007 9:08:57 PM	I have had no problems with Restasis. (Burning, etc. ) I have severe dry eye in one eye only and was facing surgery. I had no tear production for two years. I was using eye drops 12 - 15+ times per day. My eye no longer feels dried out, and I am only using additional drops 3 or so times per day. 
Dry Eye	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	12/27/2007 8:35:14 AM	I don't like to use this medicine because it causes an uncomfortable constant burning sensation.  My eyes even show less inflammation when I am not using it, but it is the only treatment that eases the eyelid twitching.

Dry Eye	mdgower, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	65-74	11/23/2007 6:57:21 PM	I seem to be having unusual feelings of mild pain in my neck glands. Have no idea if this is one of those hidden side effects. I wonder if anyone else has had this happen. It stops when I stop the med and returns when I use it again.

Why if you are extremely careful can you not use the rest of the vile at 150.00 a RX?

I use muoro ointment at night to stop the pain while sleeping.
