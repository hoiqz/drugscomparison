This has definitely helped with the pain I thought I was doomed to have. I did have weight gain as an unfortunate side effect but I continue to take it. 
Depression	lakeshore, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	3/8/2012 7:57:58 PM	I've taken imipramine since a bout with depression in 1988.  Now I take it in conjunction with MS and sleep difficulties because of excess trips to the bathroom at night.  It keeps me calm and not so tense.
Panic Disorder	vulgar, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/15/2011 3:48:03 PM	Well I can only say that i only tried one dose before I had to quit, I turned into a zombie basically, slept for 12 hours, leaving my mother and husband in charge of taking care of my 3 month old son, because I could not lift my head without getting sick, and I could not stay awake. Now, about 20 hours later, the effects are wearing off. I might try this medicine in the future, but I believe it requires some time to get used to, and I cant afford to be catatonic at this time.
Depression	Katherine, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/14/2011 11:37:53 AM	I have been taking Tofranil (Imipramine) for 29 years for anxiety disorder and depression. It has worked very well for me. I was able to feel &quot;normal&quot; again. I finished my Master's Degree and worked on my PhD while taking this medication, and I have also held several very responsible jobs while taking it. The only side effects I've ever had are dry mouth, occasional constipation, and weight gain (but I am also hypothyroid and that needs to be taken into consideration for weight). If you truly need this medication, I highly recommend it. However, it should be noted that all antidepressants are habit forming and should never be stopped without being under the care of your physician.

I had a csection about 9 yrs ago and couldnt walk for 2 days after it.  I had alot of feet pain...mainly burning.  Doctors decided it was neuropathy but not from the csection..I disagree with them. As long as I take this medication the burning in my feet subsides.  
Bedwetting	daphne, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/25/2011 12:03:22 PM	I was fed Tofranil by my mother from the time I was 6 years old until I became &quot;big enough&quot; to simply refuse to take it anymore.  She also kept increasing the dosage, because it was ineffective.  I remember being nauseated most of my childhood, and my memories are severely impaired.  I believe that the effect of this SSRI on my developing brain is what caused me to develop suicidal tendencies during my teen years and eventually be diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  I honestly believe that administration of Tofranil to a child is the equivalent of setting an LSD timebomb on the brain, scheduling it to go off sometime after puberty.  All so that my mother wouldn't have the inconvenience of washing the sheets.  And it never even really worked for that.  For this reason I faithfully avoid doctors and pharmaceuticals to the greatest extent possible, and still get nauseated if a little pill is put in front of me.  I think their only goal is to create long term profitable illnesses.
Depression	Chloe, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/20/2011 7:53:24 PM	I began taking Tofranil for depression and anxiety disorder when I was 21 years of age only to discover that I could pay attention enough to read book, something I could never do before. I had no idea I had ADD until I started this drug and read about other effects it has. I was able to get a B.A. at a university and a good job. I still have problems with housekeeping (which goes with ADD) but have been very happy with the drug overall. 
Depression	MIKE, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/20/2011 3:25:04 PM	This one leaves all other depression meds. inthe dust! This includes the new &quot;wonder&quot; drugslike Cymbalta,Effexor,etc.gives a natural good mood, and I get less sideeffects than I did from the new &quot;clean anti-depressants.Prozac and Zoloft gave me a very unnatural feeling and I found myself doing things I wouldn't normally do.Tofranil givesme a constant mild euphoric state, the polar opposite of how I felt when I started using it.Less side effects than other older anti-depressants.In my opinion, the best anti-depressant, hands down, and I've tried 9 different ones.Tell your M.D. you want to trythis one first!

Depression	MarkC, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/22/2011 7:52:39 PM	I have been taking toffranil for 36 years with about a 2 year break in the middle.  During the two years depression slowly returned and I restarted the medication.  It has been so effective I have never had an instance of depression on the medication.  I originally was on 25Mg/day but after time upped this to 50Mg.  I have no side effects and it has allowed me to thrive and excel in life.  Only closest friends know of my history but I will gladly share this with anyone showing signs of depression.  I can only hope my story can save lives for others and remove the stigma of depression and effective treatment.

It began working exactly 14 days after my first dose; it was like a huge wheight lifted off my shoulders. For a few weeks it made me very tired but that went away. Side effects were dry mouth and some hardening of the stool. Also it's good to take with food because it can cause heartburn. This stuff is amazing it saved my life. I tried going off it once but the anxiety returned.

Other	arskjs, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	6/16/2010 9:49:54 PM	I was put on this medication after having problems with food digestion ( constant vomiting resulting in 35 pound weight loss in 2 weeks) Anyways a week after taking this medicine I was unable to urinate. Went to the ER and they did a bladder scan and immediately did a Foley cath. After a week of being in the hospital with the cath, A Urologist came to see me. He said it is definitely this medicine that caused me to retain urine. It was another very uncomfortable two weeks in the hospital before my bladder woke up and I could pee on my own again. Very horrible medicine!
Depression	Careful user,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	4	1	Female		4/28/2010 9:49:15 PM	About 40 years ago, I was perscribed Tofamil by a doctor.  I was clueless to the side effects. As I took the medication, my depression became more severe and in the second week, lead to a suicide attempt.  One month later, the prescribing doctor successfully committed suicide.  Even though I suspected this drug, my inquiries were met with rebuffs.  Since installing the Internet, I was able to confirm the truth of my suspicions all these years.  I have learned to never take a prescribed drug without reading the side effects.  If I do not like what I am reading,and consider it dangerous, I will not take the drug regardless of the benefits.  My age at that time was 40.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/8/2009 4:36:46 PM	My GI doctor prescribed this for my Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  I have had problems with having diarrhea about 30 mins after eating meals.  It has helped so much.  I believe this is because of the side effect of constipation (med slows down whole GI tract).  The only side effects I experience is dry mouth and eyes, which to me is a small price to pay considering the IBS symptoms I was experiencing.  **For those of you who have experienced constipation - try taking Colace (docusate sodium) 1-2 times a day.  It is a stool SOFTENER, not a laxative. It is OTC and only costs $2-3 per bottle of 100 capsules.  Pregnant women often take this to ease constipation that is caused by taking iron supplements during pregnancy.  Also, a lot of post operative patients take this b/c it helps prevent constipation caused by post-op pain meds, decreased activity, etc.  If the plain colace does not help, there is Peri-Colace with is the stool softener combined with a mild laxative, dont take that daily, only as needed. But plain colace is fine to take 1-2 times a day.  Increasing water and fiber intake can also help alot with the constipation caused by this medication.**
Depression	giant slayer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/28/2009 6:36:59 PM	In 1986 (age 26)I returned to finish last 2 yrs. of college; earlier I had embraced an  organic diet, lots of rest, exercise; no money worries, &amp; always excelled @ studies. Yet 1/2 way thru 3rd sem. experienced sudden memory loss, wakefulness, unrefresh-ing sleep, &amp; loss of appetite. In less than a week I had suicide ideation-yet reality was I was very satisfied &amp; happy! After get-ting both physical &amp; mental health assess-ment, the campus psych. diagnosis: mild seasonal depression, or SAD (though it was July.) Now I say it was PTSD from my prior military service. SSRI drugs (i.e., Prozac, Lexapro) didn't exist; only tricyclics back then (1st produced as an antihistamine, imipramine trials incidently reported as 1st known drug effective for depression. Tried Elavil with intolerable results (felt very angry &amp; impatient), but Tofranil returned me rapidly to nor.m. Very lucky to accessed a Psych Dr. who's wife was diagnosed with depression, &amp; also that I'd found a solution so quickly. My grades didn't suffer. The clinical dose of 100 mg. was overkill though; I found 25mg. was good for me; my sleep returned, my studies continued, and I aced the finals as usual. I learned hydration, avoiding caffeine, and good fiber diet critically essential (all of which I was good at, but did better). I got off of it after six months. Over my life span (age 52) I have experienced three additional episodes, and each time very comfortable on low dose Tofranil for 6 months. New evidence shows my symptoms might be my way of style of coping with stress: my survival style by choice is to supress feelings until well after the crisis until I feel safe; then begin suffering mental &amp; physical disturbances. By the way, many mental health pros tried to push me to try the newer SSRIs-but given I'd found a safe, tested and cheap tricyclic, I refused. That is until this summer (facing physical disability issues). Tried Lexapro, then Prozac. Moderate doses of each caused severe suicidal dreaming.
Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	13-18	10/9/2009 6:03:52 PM	I was told by my doctor that I was prescribed this for my problems sleeping and headaches.  I did not know it was an anti-depressant. (I'm underage, I'm guessing my parents knew).  At first I was hesitant to take it, but this medicine has helped me with my symptoms.  It was only mildly effective with my sleep issues so I take Melatonin as well.  As for depression, my doctor recently upped my dosage.  My only side effect has been loss of appetite (and therefor weight loss).  
Depression	ladeanjanel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	9/28/2009 8:33:44 PM	I was on this medication for a long period of time (about 4 years) for a permanent mood disorder.  I experienced muscle twitches on the beginning of treatment and my doctor reassured me that they would go away once my body adjusted to the medication.  These twitches later turned into tremors affecting my right hand.  Medication was discontinued however, the tremors have become permanent.  They are severe to the point that I have lost most use of my right hand.  Please be extremely careful with this medication.  Short time usage will not/should not lead to long term, permanent side effects, but use extreme caution in long term usage!
Bedwetting	NYBowtech, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	8/21/2009 11:16:04 AM	I started taking this grug when I was 10 years old. I have been on it ever since and I am 34 now. Now the bedwetting has gone away and I at a 25mg dose now. When I first began I was at 125mg. I have stayed the medication becuase I went off of it and I had extreme mood changes, in a not so good way. I was on a 50mg dose over the past 15 years and after going off of it and having problems I went back on at 25mg. It's a small price to pay becuase this drug saved my childhood. As an active male who was into scouting and other outdoor activities it kept me able to spend nights away from home and not have to worry about being belittled due to bedwetting.  I'll take the medication until the day I die if I have too.  Again, it saved my childhood years.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/29/2009 6:33:33 PM	After years of depression and trying several newer antidepressants (that had bad side effects), I was prescribed Tofranil by my dr.  I take a very low dose, but it is a &quot;miracle&quot; drug.  I have my life back.  Constipation is a side-effect, but it is controlled by an increase in fiber intake.

Anxious	mcngi2@verizon.net, 65-74 Female 	3	3	3	Female	65-74	2/12/2009 1:19:11 AM	I took Tofranil MANY years ago. I was only 32 at the time. It worked SO well for me. Is it because I was so young and only treated my problems because of my husband dying and it was my HORRIBLE life experience.  I was the total caretaker - kidney machine etc. etc. etc.Now I can't find anything to help me without feeling like a drug person with even more anxiety than then.  Is it because I was so young and healthy or is it because I am now older - I am now 72 - that no one even talks about this anti-depressant.What was so different with this older anti-dpressant than these new ones? Is it because of their brain cell activities - was it my youth - what made that drug so much better than anything I can ever get today.,  What is it - was it my youth and my demanding life - or was it the ingredients in this drug.Please, some doctor explain to me so I can know if it was the right medicine for me cause I'm starting to try new ones.  I HATE MEDICINE - but I am willing to ask &quot;what happened&quot; to me&quot; when I thought I was being helped. I am a horrific person for pills - my doctors get SO angry with me that I stop taking even my necessary heart pills.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	1	2	Female	25-34	12/30/2008 1:35:35 PM	This was the first antidepressent that I took 20 years ago when I was 13.  It was hard core stuff with terrible side effects-- severe constipation that caused hemorrhoids (which is extremely embarrasing for a 13 yr. old), loss of concentration, and terrible insomnia.  It is a very old school drug, one of the first classes of antidepressants. I am surprised they still prescribe this med.
Neuropathic Pain	 Female  (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female		12/7/2008 2:46:46 AM	I have pain in my neck from an accident from years ago and I also have MS.

It helps with sleep,but I'm going to get off it ASAP and switch to something else!!

Depression	biggiecheese, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	19-24	10/2/2008 3:32:32 PM	This was the first medication I took. It seemed to work, but I had so many side effects, the medication developed into another stressor. Before this medication (and even before any medications) I slept well, no issues. After taking it, I had nightmares every single night causing me to wake 2, sometimes 3 times per night. Huge withdrawl symptoms when I came off it and I only had it for 1.5 months.
Other	bff, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/22/2008 4:33:49 PM	I suffer from migraines and when my doctor gave this medication I was insulted because its main treatment is for depression. After a couple of weeks I was so grateful. Most of my migraines were brought on by anxiety and some depression. (I didn't want to accept that I was depressed because that meant my best friend really died) I'm now being weaned off which is scary because this medication helped me so much. I'm not as anxious, working through my depression, and have about 2migraines a month. If any of this sounds like you ask your doctor it could be a cure for you as it was for me.

About once every two years, the doctor ups my strength, but this drug has been a GODSEND!!!
