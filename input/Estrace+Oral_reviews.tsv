Low Estrogen After Operation to Remove Ovaries	Lolla, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	45-54	8/21/2012 4:03:10 PM	I've only been on this med for 2 weeks and will remain on it for 1 month just to be fair and allow it to work its way through my system. Side effects, yes, one: body aches. I'm a runner and hiker and this tiny pill is proving to be a pill. Because I know my estrogen level is low, I will give it a fair shot. I just don't like when anything interferes with my workout regiment.

I cannot say that the medication caused this but it scared me enough to discontinue using it. I had a biopsy and the lump was not cancerous.

After being on it for so many years, the Dr. then decided to put me in Estrace, it does take the hot flashes and mood swings away, but the weight gain, headaches, body aches are becoming unbearable. Have an appointment with the Dr. to change it. I have headaches that are debilitating and I don't like it!

I began experiencing vision problems and became intolerant of my contact lenses. It took a lot of research to figure out that my eye problems were caused by the Estrace. I have stopped using it and my eyes are back to normal.

Started having hot flashes, dizzyness, feeling frail six months ago. Mentioned these symptoms to my doctor and he started me on this and it is like a miracle. I feel GOOD. The only drawback is the pill looks almost exactly like xanax, i really have to check and double check that i am taking the correct pill.

Seven years later I had DCIS (non-invasive breast cancer surgery) and was taken off my estrogen for seven months.  I elected to start it again and had been fine.  Last year I stopped, thinking at age 67 I was past needing estrogen.  WRONG!!  Insomnia, warm flashes, mood swings all came back.  Just started back again on 1mg 3 times per week and looking forward to feeling better again soon. I'd rather live 10 more years feeling good than 20 more years feeling like I've felt for the past few months.  I've been cancer free for 10 years and have yearly mammograms.  My doctors say the benefits outweight the risks. 
Post-Menopausal Osteoporosis Prevention	shocked, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/5/2009 3:21:23 PM	I had a hysterectomy in Janaury 2009 in order to take estrogen to stop my bone loss. It was the only safe way to take this medication without the risk of cancer, as it runs very highly in my family. I also have had severe reactions to 4 osteoporosis medications, and my doctor and I have decided that I should not take any more of these medications. They have caused lasting medical problems for me. So far I am very satisfied with my estrogen treatment.
