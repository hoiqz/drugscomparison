After progressing steadily for five years it halted my symptoms. I was in remission.  Oh happy days! Asymptotic for 3 yrs.  Then my cholesterol was high and my dr. insisted I take a medication for that. Against my better judgment I did, and lo and behold I started progressing again. Now trouble speaking, cannot stand to pull up my pants, wheelchair 24/7, lots of falls.  I asked my Dr. for a booster round of novantrone but she said no. I got the max. I volunteered to be a test case be no go.

I had 3 major attacks before starting treatment, including neurological vertigo.  Had 8 treatments (2004-2006), and was in total remission from that point on and for about 4 years.  Had a minor attack after gallbladder surgery 6 months ago.  Still doing great!

Had some hair thinning after first couple doses not as bad now notice I don't feel as unbalanced can walk longer distances without holding on to someone or something.  Overall been a good experience

A day or 2 before each treatment I underwent a MUG-A scan to check for heart damage. I experienced vomiting and hair loss. BUT...the therapy seems to have halted the progression of my MS. I'm no better, but I'm no worse, and I'm happy for that.
Other	25-34 Female  (Caregiver) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	11/11/2008 10:54:51 PM	my sister just passed away from myocardiopathy which is a &quot;rare and infrequent&quot; side effect associated with taking this drug.  please beware.  make absolutely certain that you or your loved one with ms is monitored prior to, during and especially following the administration of this drug.  visit the fda website and lookup the alerts that have been issued with regards to this toxic medication.  with proper monitoring of cardiac function you or your loved one with ms may benefit from use of this medication but please take all necessary steps to ensure that cardiac function is monitored on a regular basis even months and years after completing the regimen.  i dont want anyone else to have to go thru what we have and are going thru as a result of the toxicity of this drug and the lack of proper monitoring in the months and years following administration of it. she was 31 years old, my best friend, my &quot;big&quot; little sister and she had received the last dose of novantrone in 2002.  she passed away (according to the death certificate, we are still awaiting autopsy results) from myocardiopathy, severe pulmonary hypertension and ms.

Since my wife, an MS patient, has started treatments we have noticed a blue/green discoloration, of all things,  on the toilet seat.  We have two toilets and the &quot;coloring&quot; is in the same spot.  The stain appears to be 'permanent' since nothing I have tried seems to remove it.  It is as if some sort of 'dye' has seeped through her skin.  Medical staff unaware of similar experience.  Any thoughts?Thanks

Thgey have given her this drug and it has seemed to help in the past but the last three treatments havent been working like we have hoped. Has anyone ever had this disease and been treated with this drug?

I do have one other symptom (some ringing and hearing loss in one ear) that I wasn't aware of before starting treatment. Overall, I'd say remarkable improvements.

I'm not sure if that is normal or not.
