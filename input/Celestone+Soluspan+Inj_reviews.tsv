Rheumatic Disease causing Pain &amp;amp; Stiffness in Backbone	SimplyMarvi, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	10/8/2011 2:27:11 AM	I received a spinal epidural yesterday to treat chronic pain and arthritis in my C-7-T1 vertebra. During the procedure, I started having muscle spasms in my mid back. These subsided upon applying an ice pack and taking a muscle relaxer. These have continued for 30+ hours so far. But I do have more back problems. Not sure if these spasms are from the celestone specifically, the procedure itself, or the the combination with the other meds injected (2 other steroids and Toradol).  Not sure if this Med has been used in any of my many previous injections. I'm also experiencing flushing and intermittent low grade fever,weakness, lack of appetite. Overall,  I have satisfactory results from these injections. Some last 3-6 months, others up to 2+ years. My physiatrist/pain specialist is rated #7 in his field, in the US.

One shot and 20 minutes later--gone, permanently. That was one shot three years ago. I'm telling you, it is amazing!

I would never take it again, I've also missed 2 menstrual cycles and have never missed them in the past except during pregnancy, and I am not pregnant.

I have been having major problems with adverse reactions. Restless leg syndrome, the most awful feeling x the next morning after injs. So far a whole week without sleep except for maybe 1 or 2 hrs a night. Also I'm prone to depression. I have felt very bad. Even suicidal. Its been one of the most miserable weeks of my life. This inj. is supposed to last x 3 months. I can only pray the reactions I've had will cease soon.

Joint Disease which may include Attacks of Acute Arthritis	nck, 75 or over Female  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female		10/24/2008 6:57:04 PM	For arthritis in two joins on top of foot.  After first injections I had terrible pain for 4-5 days and then almost (down to 3 out 10 pain) no pain for 6-7 months.Have just had second injection following after 9 1/2 months of first injection.  I was told I probably would not have the &quot;steroid flare&quot; this time and so far within the first 2 hours I have not.  It would be worth it, though to suffer 4-5 days to have such great pain relief.
