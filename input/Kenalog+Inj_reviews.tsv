Joint Disease which may include Attacks of Acute Arthritis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/25/2012 4:36:25 PM	I received an injection into my knee for pain relief, which was completely gone within 24 hours.  Injection itself was applied with much less pain than I was expecting, but that could be just a great Doctor!.  However, it has been less than a month, so I do not know how long the effect will last.
Other	OkcGuy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/11/2012 9:03:10 AM	I got this shot to relieve sinus allergies and asthma.  Very happy with the results.  I did review the medicine before agreeing to the application to make sure I knew what I was getting into.  It's been over a week and my head is no longer stuffy everyday.   I have started backing down on the daily meds I was taking, claritan, etc.

Other	BEWARE!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/26/2012 4:45:57 PM	I needlessly had a number of epidural injections w/Kenalog 40 in a short period of time, all because of a misdiagnosis. Realized after the damage was done that the manufacturer mandates against its use for epidural injections, also realized too late that I was given far too much of the stuff (200 mg over 6 weeks and Im under 100 lbs). The last injection was over 5 months ago and Im still suffering from debilitating side effects, namely non-stop pain in all extremities  particularly acute in my hands and feet, and extreme fatigue where Im exhausted all day and literally cant get up and move in the morning. The pain is unlike anything Ive ever experienced before and difficult to describe  a deep itching, electrical sort of sensation and aggravated by any movement (such as typing). It seems theres no end in sight to this. Ive consulted w/numerous doctors about this reaction and they either deny any connection to the injections or are clueless. The havoc corticosteroids can cause on the body is extraordinary. I appreciate that these meds help some people, but doctors are far too cavalier in dispensing/injecting them, are irresponsible in not warning patients about side effects, and oddly, seem completely uneducated themselves about the side effects of the very drugs they routinely administer. Or perhaps they are lying for liability purposes and out of greed . . . I dont know. 
Other	lorece, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	7/6/2012 1:35:00 PM	I understand this drug is not a miracle cure for everyone, but it is for my severe allergies to mites, dust, etc. I used to get an injection every six mnths (which enabled me to clean out a large old house we own in a dust-bowl area). However, I haven't been able to get an injection recently because the doctors are very concerned about possible osteoporosis even tho I have never been diagnosed with such. Anyway, we are about to go back to work on our house again so I may have to resort to Benadryl which puts me to sleep.

I had allergic rhinitis for months due to seasonal allergies and the dust from a home renovation.  I was taking Sudafed with Advil during the day, then Allegra and two Benadryl at night and still had no relief.  I still had to take the Sudafed/Advil a couple days after the shot but I have not had to take any for the last 2 days.  I'm am SO happy with the results!  I can finally breathe again!!  I haven't noticed any side effects except maybe light spotting but my body is still adjusting to the Mirena that was implanted at the end of July so it may have no relation to the shot.  I would definately do this again if my allergies got that bad again.

I do still feel hazy and tired but that also may be from the Ativan. I am just eager to get this poison out of my system and get my life back completely and I am sure my husband would say the same.

To make things worse I am suppose to go on our honeymoon in 4 days and I am not even excited to go because I have so much dread and doom that something bad is going to happen to me.

My family doctor ordered this drug along with Rocephin to knock out a nasty sinus infection.  Strangely it got rid of a chronic ItBand inflammation that I've had for years.  The pain and weakness is very debilitating so I was happily pleased with the relief.  I've had 3 injections in a year. Not sure this is good.  Nothing else has worked, even pain clinic injections.  However, if I do any strenuous exercise the pain will return down the outside of my left leg. So I must be careful not to overdo.

My allergies and asthma were so bad that daily function was nearly impossible. The shot was fantastic for both the allergies and asthma! However, the first year I got the shot I had my period for 8 weeks solid. For the second shot I visited a new doctor who swore that the extended period had nothing to do with the shot and advised me to get it again. I got the shot again and though it again cleared up my allergies, I had my period for 10 straight weeks. It is very frustrating to me because nothing clears up my allergies/sinuses like this shot, but side effect is just too much.

My rheumatologist suspects a Spondyloarthropathy type disease. Severe pain in sacorilliac joints and hips, coincides with irritable bowel issues for at least 10 years. Every 3 months I have been receiving intramuscular kenalog. It usually begins working by the 4th day. It seems to keep it in remission. However, as a 41 year old woman I cannot continue to take it. This time post injection, I noticed breaking out in a sweat, nausea, horrible flatulence and not feeling well. This time I have a horrible gastro colic like episode with putrid sulfuric like flatulence, diarrhea &amp; pain in the right upper quadrant. I normally do not get this kind of gas ever, not even from spicy food. I don't feel well at all. GI is just observing for now and said clear liquids. No more kenalog if I can help it. Next step, Humira.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	10/8/2010 6:42:19 PM	I was given a Kenalog inhaler around 1988 for seasonal allergies - lead to MS-like symptoms, muscle spasms/dystonia, mood fluxuations, allergic reactions increased &amp; even bing maxed out on Benedryl didn't stop the reaction. Kenalog nearly put me in a wheelchair. My endocrinologist In 2010, I was given 4 sympathetic nerve blocks w/ Kenalog for RSD/CRPS of the R foot/leg (&amp; possibly spreading?) Had a tear in R shoulder connective tissue that was inconsistent with slight jarring which was clearly inconsistent with the fall, but after antibiotic Tx which could explain that injury. After 2nd Tx, developed kidney stones/infection/pyrexia x 1 month. Generalized pain was increased post-op. Pain in L side (wondered if I'd coded in surgery &amp; paddles had been used-neg.) After 4th block, now have bone pain in hips, neck, shoulders; extreme generalized pain, body-wide muscle wasting, vomiting, arrhythmia, chest pains w/ numbness of L arm, extreme photo-sensitivity &amp; eyes burning(possibly other photo-sensitivity as well - can barely stand a 60w light bulb or dimmed computer screen), a few bouts of incontinence, possible seizures, bruising on legs &amp; arms, sleeplessness &amp; a drug-induced mania that lasted for days without sleep. I had increased intracranial pressure from a nasal inhaler around 1988 &amp; likely far worse this time around.My hope is that this drug, as well as other corticosteroids, will be strongly regulated, with a requirement of patients being counseled on effects, side effects &amp; possible adverse reactions &amp; a requirement that patients sign off on any procedure at least 3 days before it is done with ANY corticosteroid use with full disclosure of any and all potential side &amp; adverse effects. I had a prior reaction to this same drug &amp; had there been this requirement, I would not be in the condition I am in now. A prior adverse reaction to steroids was overlooked and as a result. I hope OTC cortisone preparations become prescription only &amp; more regulated than opiods.

The doctor informed me that the medication would lose its effectiveness over time and then some type of oral pain medication would be necessary. He advised that it was only a matter of time until knee replacement surgery would be required. He also informed me that this condition would spread to my left leg. I have reached the point where the injections are no longer effective and I am taking more of the pain reliever, Darvocet. I anticipate that the doctor will recommend knee replacement surgery on my next office visit.

Giant Hives	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	8/6/2010 1:02:29 AM	I was given this drug by injection for acute allergic reaction and subsequently developed a fat necrosis at the site.  When I saw the dermatologist, he said this was common and this was the dumbest thing to give for an allergic reaction. It may take years to get rid of the fat necrosis at the injection site.

Stings after initial injection for a brief time. My eczema begins healing in a day or two, unfortunately once the injection wears off, back comes the eczema. I have dimpling in the injection sites on both cheeks.  Try to only get an injection when in dire need, when topical and oral medications don't due the job due to out of control eczema.
Giant Hives	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	6/4/2010 5:54:39 PM	One Kenalog shot in my life...now, 20 years later, a permanent listing in my files NOT to give me another!  Given a shot for hives related to a food allergy.  Didn't even get home before turning around &amp; going back to dr. with internal hives that were closing off airways.  Not allergic to Kenalog, but what the inj. is suspended in to make it time released.  Dr. brought everyone in the office in to see me, the &quot;freak&quot;, b/c he'd never seen it in 50 yrs. of medicine.

I suffered for years before a smart move I made in seeing a Rheumatologist for the Arthritis AND Bursitis I had after four back surgeries. I was told that I could have a KENALOG injection every three months so I certainly will! Folks, it changed my life and I now have the ability to leave my house because the pain has been eased! I'm a person of Christian FAITH; I feel that God led me to this Dr. and I praise HIS Name for this medication! I have found an answer to many prayers!! God Bless Ya'll!

Thus far for spinal stenosis I am very satisfied with this treatment.  I know others who have not had a good experience, however, their injections were not given by an anesthesiologist.  I will try to remember to update my results from the 3/17/10 procedure.  The process was simple, the physician and staff were highly qualified, personable, answered all questions pre and post injection.  I had to be driven to and from the center and they had to stay with me for an hour or so afterwards as a precaution for any adverse reaction.

I have 2 cc's administered by injection and I works great! It usually takes about 8 hrs for it to really kick in...but it's well worth the wait! My sinus swelling goes away n I can breath perfectly, and it reduces my sneezing and runny nose down to almost nothing!  If you have alergies and over the counter meds don't work...the kenalog is for you!!!!!!!!

My ENT suggested I have a steroid shot. He did tell me about side effects, including a prolonged or heavy menstrual cycle. What he didn't tell me is that my period would last for over TWO MONTHS!  I also experienced severe constipation for the same length of time.Although all of my symptoms of Sinusitis are gone, I do not know if I would have another shot. I guess I will wait until that time comes to make my decision.

I didn't relate the two at all. But then almost two weeks later a started getting a rash in the same spot on both hands, right where the Kenalog was injected. It has been three weeks now and my arthritis pain is definately better, but not gone. I realize that i am clearly allergic to this medication. Will I get the injections again? Not if there is other arthritis treatments out there, I will have to go with an alternative.
Allergic Reaction caused by a Drug	45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1		45-54	12/27/2009 3:33:14 PM	Went to the Docter for severe seasonal allergies... eyes gushing water and post nasal drip that just would not stop.Antibiotics prescribed caused severe diarrhea. Dr. said I'll give you a shot to help with this. No discussion about side effects, or that it was a steriod with body altering side effects.  Now I have a &quot;crater&quot; at the injection site in my upper arm, and a sort of numbness in my entire arm, plus my monthly cycle is completely haywire. It seems to me like she used a sledge hammer to kill a fly. No Dr. should give a person this injection without letting you know the possible side effects so a person can make an informed choice. For me it was not worth it at all I got little or no relief from this shot. I'm extremely upset and disappointed that my Dr. made such a bad decision.   
Allergic Reaction caused by a Drug	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	12/26/2009 12:25:36 AM	I was given 40mg dose of Kenalog IM inj in my left arm to help alleiviate seasonal allergies. I only took the inj once and was given some oral pills called Loratadine along with the kenalog and felt fine. About three months later, i noticed a two by one inch deeply atrophied area around the inj site. I went to my doctor to find out if there was any meds or exercise i could do to regain muscle mass. He told me there was nothing i could do and that he had only read of this particular side effect. He had never seen it before on a patient. Yes the combined drugs helped my allergies but left me with a piece of my muscle gone and still experiencing more symptoms as time passes with the atrophy.  I highly recommend to all who read this to read up on any and all drugs your doctor tries to give you before they give it to you. I am nineteen years old and will always have a piece missing out of my arm and who knows if the atrophy is done spreading. No one told me this could possibly happen. I will be posting more if other symptoms present themselves.

Joint Disease which may include Attacks of Acute Arthritis	shelby7, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/3/2009 3:59:16 PM	I had a fractured hip 20 years ago and since then the area around ball and socket has deteriorated badly and also have 3 spurs in joint area.  I am now 42 and recieved 12 injections over the last 5 years. They inject in the front groin area after numbing with lydocain under Xray to make sure they are in the correct area.  I don't like being sedated so I chose not to.  You can be knocked out for this but it only takes 15 minutes in-out time on table. Relief is wonderful, instantly when combined with marcaine.  I can't complain at all.  To list I did have some side effects afterwards like acid reflux, tenderness of muscle at site and insomnia the first few nights.  I expected these because before I chose to do this I read extensively the pros and cons.  I would like to comment on that part here.  I have read so many posts that says my doctor never told me this or that side effect.  Be prepared for side effects with any medication introduced into your body.  To not think that, your not doing your homework pertaining to YOUR body.  I understand all treatments do not work for everyone but I absolutely would of had a hip replacement 6 years ago at age 36.   I feel I bought,so far, 6 decent years of wear and tear on the artificial one.  I would recommend HIGHLY for people in my situation of severe joint pain especially of the hip.
Other	Alison, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	11/20/2009 6:29:03 PM	I have had ongoing bouts of granuloma annulare / actinic granuloma for a number of years now.  The most effective treatment has been extremely small amounts of Kenolog injected directly into the individual eruptions which present themselves, primarily, on sun-exposed skin.  This therapy is administered anywhere from every 30 to 90 days, dependent upon the severity of outbreaks.  I've tried PUVA light treatments, Accutane, Prednisone, Plaquinil, topical Clobetasol &amp; Clobex without much success (Clobex lotion &amp;/or spray gives some relief in specific areas...it will lessen the severity; eruptions decrease, yet slight discoloration remains &amp; over time, skin texture roughens &amp; after discontinuing, eruptions will reappear).  The only thing that has helped, so far, has been the Kenolog.  However, if too much is injected into one site, it causes bruising which may (or may not) eventually subside.  Oftentimes, there's nominal bleeding at some of the injection sites.  Another downfall to Kenalog injections for this ailment is that continual use causes the skin to thin, resulting in periodic petichiae &amp; superficial veins to appear.  Bottom line: this therapy does work if administered by a knowledgeable &amp; competent medical professional, yet only as a temporary fix for unsightliness &amp; discomfort.  Ongoing treatment is required; thus, the positive results outweigh the bad points.  There's always a trade-off.

Many biopsies and treatment over last three years. Have seen three different dermatologists. This is only treatment that helped reduce the swelling, redness, and itching (Dapsone has also helped with itching). Have had hives, anaphalaxis, etc. for 41 years with many, many drug allergies along with adult-onset asthma. This was a painless injection with immediate results that just keeps getting better and better. Lesions have been so ugly and really embarassing. This was very exciting to have something actually work. I looked up the drug as was curious if it was a corticosteroid only to find out it's Triamcinolone. I was just prescribed that also (ointment) for my skin too and have loved the help that's also been.
Inflammation of the Tendon	trenee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	11/6/2009 11:03:50 AM	I twisted my back cleaning and had some back pain. I went to the doctor and she gave me Kenalog 60mg. As the week went on my pain went from my back to my right buttock where the injection site was, to my hip,down my right leg. I could hardly get out of the car and this was happening after a week. I couldn't understand why I was in so much pain from some back pain until I read the reviews of my symptoms. With no medical insurance, I have to save money for another month to go back to the doctor.

I have been given Solu-Medrol in the past, which worked well, but my doctor only had Kenalog.  I got the injection yesterday and all my symptoms are gone. However, I did almost pass out when I got up this morning.  I got nauseous, clammy and dizzy and had to lay on the floor with an ice pack on my neck.  I also had a drop in blood pressure.  After a nap, I feel better, but still feel a little jittery.  My pharmacist says my reaction is a rare side effect.  My doctor says she thinks it was caused by my illness brought on by the allergies.  I think the pharmacist is right. I feel so much better than yesterday, the temporary discomfort was worth it.  But, next year I will go back to Solu-Medrol.

I asked prior to the shot what the side effects were and was never told about possible muscle atrophy and there seems nothing on Kenalog website but if you google Kenalog side effects apparently quite a number of people are experiencing this side effect.

After 3 different skin biopsy's and inconclusive results, the 3rd dermatologist suggested a shot of Kenalog. I saw a vast improvement within a couple of weeks. No side affects as yet. After 6 months recieved my 2nd shot, and after 2 weeks the rash is almost completely gone. Side benefits were reduction in seasonal allergies, decreased joint pain, and improved breathing. Great stuff!

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	2	1	1	Female	25-34	8/13/2009 10:35:45 AM	I received 2 Kenalog injections for a herniated disc. I was never told the side effects that could occur. I have had vision changes, mood swings, depression, weight gain, fluid retention, dizziness, migraines, and my hands have been shaking so bad that I could not do my job. I am a registered nurse and luckily I recognized the side effects from the steroid and asked the anestheologist about them. I was told that it rarely occurred. I also had to go to the emergency room a week after the second injection due to breathing difficulties. I would highly recommend talking with your doctor about the pros and cons of this steroid. It has changed who I am and I have to live with it every day. I am in my 20s and am unable to receive a third injection due to the breathing issue. My only other option is to have the surgery where they fuse the vertebrae together. And unfortunately with the second injection, they had to use less steroid due to the Cushing Synd side effects I was already having. The 2nd injection never really worked and I have had to suffer with the side effects.

Within hours I experienced a drop in heart rate that was very severe and did not know if I would make it home.  I have had this drug before and never experienced that but not sure the drug caused this.  I am seeing my cardiologist the 17th of this month and will discuss with him as it is still happening.  Within an hour this happened after the injection. This injection was done by a orthopedist Has anyone had this happen to them.  I would appreciate any feedback I can get as it drops to mid to high 40's and arond 50 hbm.  Thanks Phyllis

Not only did it clear up the poison ivy, but the breakouts on my scalp (which I had for 10+ years and had been unsuccessfully treated by 3 dermatologists) cleared up for 7 months.  Two days ago,I got my 1st (since last Fall) attack of poison ivy, so yesterday (June 12) I went to the doctor &amp; got another injection of Kenalog. I'll let you know the outcome, not only with the poison ivy, but also with my (1 month old) scalp breakout.

SIX DAYS FOLLOWING INJECTION IN MY NECK I WAS HEADACHE FREE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE! I REMEMBER MY FIRST SEVERE HEADACHE AT AGE 3. I HAD A HEADACHE IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD FOR 5 DAYS FOLLOWING THE INJECTION.I HAVE HAD THE INJECTIONS IN MY BURSA IN THE HIP THREE TIMES AND IT RELIEVED THE PAIN FOR ABOUT 1 MONTH AT A TIME. THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISE IN MY BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS BECAUSE I AM DIABETIC.I HAD TO INCREASE INSULIN AND FLUID INTAKE AND HAVE TO BE VERY VIGILANT WITH MY DIET AND TAKING BLOOD SUGAR TESTS MORE OFTEN.  I AM CURRENTLY UNDECIDED IF I WILL CONTINUE TREATMENT AND MUST DISCUSS THIS AND THE LONG TERM SIDE EFFECTS FURTHER WITH MY SPECIALIST.

I had so much fluid in my head, it felt like i was on the ocean, but i'm 500 miles from the Gulf of Mexico! Got another shot today, and hopefully this will tide me over until the end of Cedar Fever season.  I've never had an allergy before, and Kenalog keeps my symptoms away.

Releif from pain was immediate (once light sedation wore off) and inflammation was completely gone in the knee within days.  Ankle inflamation remains.  I'm just relieved she is not complaining of pain anymore!  IF she needs another injection it will be at least 6 months from the first.
Other	swhite, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/13/2009 9:43:28 AM	I developed a symptom called &quot;trigger finger&quot; in my thumb in which the knuckle locked and won't bend unless I force it (which is very painful). I received a shot of Kenalog and Marcaine (0.5) mixed together into the tendon to help with the inflamation and pain of the tendon which swelled and prevented me from bending my thumb. I was surprised to see than no one here had the same problem as myself.  I just received the shot yesterday and my thumb doesn't hurt like it did before.  The Orthopaedic Dr. said it can take up to 3 weeks to go back to normal.  So this isn't an instant fix, so I will wait to see what happens.  So far so good.  My thumb is still locked, but no pain or any type of negative reaction.

It was very uncomfortable even with my eye being numbed. My eye watered for 2 hrs and had a blood spot on lower corner for 3 days. That was a month ago and so far it has done nothing to relieve my eye swelling or the blindness I have been eduring for the last 5 months. I am 42 and not ready to lose my sight yet and I am getting very frustrated. I do not want my career in the medical field to be over because of my sight. I am due for another injectiton but do not know if I will have it because of he lack of response from the first injection.

One injection seems to last about 20 to 28 days. It relieved many other aches and pains I didn't realize I had, I felt alive again and ready to go. The actual shot takes about 20 min and I start feeling a difference, it seams to have a diuretic affect for about 3 days, my leg and ankle swelling is gone, my allergies are gone, my hands and fingers bend with ease again. I really feel great for about a month then I need another shot.    My Doctor said I can't take it all the time because it masks symptoms of some illnesses.  I am 63 years old fair health very inactive after knee surgery , that went wrong, this is a good drug for older people that want to be active again..
Asthma	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	35-44	11/26/2008 7:01:44 PM	Not sure if Kenalog works well for Asthma treatment.  In my opinion, this drug has too many negative side effects and reactions to use for treating basic allergies.  Do not recommend taking any type of aspirin or tylenol products while using Kenalog due to the inhancement of side effects such as: upset stomach, headache, body ache, and irregular heart beat. I hope this drug works better on other treatments. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Richard, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	11/10/2008 3:40:31 PM	I received an injection for arthritis pain in all joints.  It worked.  No pain for 23 days slow pain for 30 more.  Degenerative disc pain reduced greatly. It also kept me from getting a huge poison ivy rash.  Maximum result time 3 months.  Nothing else helps and I can't get the injections but twice a year.  I spend most of my time in pain except when I get the kenalog.

I continued to break out, a small amount, for 3 more days. In the past I have taken oral steroids. after that, my skin cleared up rapidly and well. However in the week following the injection I suffered with nausea, and dizzy, &quot;jumping&quot; eyes that caused much distress. I did feel &quot;crazy&quot;. I questioned my thoughts and needed to have a friend stay with me. I had a couple days of severe back and hip pain, making it almost impossible to walk. Then that disappeared as did the other problems. I would not use this drug again.

It did make my hip feel better and it clear up my poison ivy.

Other	tuckertoo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	5/22/2008 9:38:37 PM	I received$ a Kenalog injection for chronic abdominal pain one week ago, and since then, my pain has risen to a 9 on a scale of 1-10. After the injection, I didn't know whether I had to pee, poop, or vomit. I felt like I was having a miscarriage. I couldn't talk without wanting to scream, walking was barely manageable. I called the surgeon back on Monday (the injection was on Thursday), and the comments I got were: &quot;That isn't supposed to happen&quot; and &quot;She won't give you that shot again.&quot; I now must have an abdominal ultrasound, ordered by my primary, to determine if damage has been done, or if it's just a reaction. I am taking so much Percocet that I should be flying, but my pain level actually surpasses the pain killers.This has been one of the worst experiences of my life in terms of medical misfires.
Other	SBQ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	35-44	5/17/2008 11:51:58 PM	I have received 2 kenelog inj. of 80mg each, 1 month apart in my epidural space for pain relief. I have Cushing's Syndrome now and I don't know if this is the cause and it will go away when/if this ever wears off, or if it exaserbated an already existing condition. but I have spent HOURS researching this! The first shot, I had 3 weeks of pain relief and the second, 5 weeks. Not worth it for the misery I'm in now if this is in fact the cause.I marked the ease of use as difficult only because I have to travel 1 1/2 hours to the hospital to get the injection done, then I need a driver to take me home.

I am able to move about as normal.  Two years ago this was unsuccessful with my left hip because the disease process had progressed too far.  I eventually had a total left hip replacement.  The injection in my right hip is giving me more time before the eventual replacement of my right hip. My orthopaedic surgeon administered the injection by flouroscopy.

It turned the injection site into a white, round circle and is now going up my arm.  I now am having &quot;red&quot; spots around the injection site and also going up the arm.  These red spots are now bleeding and won't stop bleeding until I put a lot of pressure on them and use a bandaid, stuck on very tight.  I am going to speak to an attorney about it.

I have never been irregular before, and at 34 (with 2 children) never thought I would be until maybe menopause - but I was informed by my gynecologist that this could happen - and it did to me. I have had 4 menstrual cycles in the last 8 weeks. It has been miserable, and the doctor said it could take 3 months to clear up. Not worth it!!! I will gladly take a sudafed everyday that have to endure the inconvenience and the moodiness. My poor husband:) Just thought everyone should know that this side effect is out there for this drug. I have since talked to a friend, and the SAME thing happened to her. Just be warned!

Bronchitis	andy1967@embarqmail.com, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	10/14/2007 12:04:27 AM	From July 2007 to the present I have had a constant dry cough, symptoms of sinus infection, alot of throat congestion and mild chest congestion with tightness in the chest.  I went to the emergency room numerous times and I was mostly treated for upper respiratory issues. On two occasions  I was given this drug (either Kenalog inj or kenalog 40 inj, I don't know) in the emergency room on 2 different occasions.  The first time that I was given the drug, I was given a shot that contained one dose.  The next day I noticed that tightness in my throat was gone and no cough and no side effects.  The next time that I was given this drug, the doctor gave me 5 doses in one shot.  He also gave me a shot of Ativan (probably 2mg) in the same visit. Moments after, I became very confused.  It was hard to think.  When I would talk, no one could understand what I was saying.  I didn't know what I was saying.  I couldn't read or write or spell.  I went to another hospital and they did a bunch of tests and kept me overnight for observation.  The effects did wear off by sometime the next day.  I am convinced that I had an overdose of this drug. If any doctors read this, please tell me what you think.  This was very scary. Additionally, my symptoms are still with me.
