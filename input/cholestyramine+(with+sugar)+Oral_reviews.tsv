Poisoning by the Heart Medication Digitalis	judster, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female		1/28/2012 12:28:35 PM	I have been itching since march 2011 and no one had been able to help me, no meds or shots helped,I found out I was diabetic which made it even worse.  Itching constantly was horrible and I was starting to get sores from the itching that were not healing fast.  Then I had an ultra sound done and they are trying to determine if I have a liver condition.  Bingo!  The liver problem could be causing all the itching.  I had to go see a new dermatologist for a skin problem this month jan2012 and he had seen in my records that I had the itching last march and with the sores asked if I was still itching.  I told him yes and also about possibly having a liver issue and that the web said that itching can be caused from a liver problem.  He told me that he knew of a wonderful medication that helps people with liver problems with the itching.  I told him I was game for anything.  He gave me the RX for this medication and I got it filled.  What a blessing.  The itching has cleared up about 90% and of course the sores have almost healed and gone.  I take it twice a day .  The only sympton so far is constipation.  It does make my sugar level go up some but my diabetic counseler says it is still fine.  So the medication is a life saver,  I was ready to scratch the skin off..

Chronic Diarrhea	Florida Woman, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	10/28/2011 12:34:22 PM	Have been dealing with nausea, cramping, diarrhea for the last 5 years after my gallblader surgery. Finally my GI doctor prescribed this medication.  I am a complete different person, it has changed my life as I do not wake up every morning with &quot;morning sickness&quot; and I do not have to be afraid of eating and going to the bathroom all the time.
Chronic Diarrhea	Amanda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	6/21/2011 11:57:18 AM	I dealt with chronic diarrhea for years after my gallbladder removal. All the doctors I saw told me I just had to deal with it. Finally I went to Mayo Clinic and the gastroenterologist prescribed this medication. I am finally able to eat without fear! I drink it every morning with very cold water. I dont mind the taste or grittiness too much, it is way better than the alternative. If I dont take it even one day I am soon reminded of how my life used to be before Cholestyramine. Dont wait as long as I did. I didnt push my doctors to prescribe me something, mostly because of the embarrassing topic. If you have chronic diarrhea tell your doctor you want to try this medication. 
Chronic Diarrhea	Toby66, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/11/2011 2:02:30 PM	Saved my life.  I was prescribed this after surgery for Crohn's Disease.  Went from 8-12 bathroom visits a day to less than 4.  Works very quickly, within 24 hours and I can take one or two doses per day.  I get three big containers, which lasts for 3 months, verses the individual packs for less than $10.  Just be sure to drink lots of water after each dose.

High Cholesterol	lucymac, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	10/25/2010 11:35:22 AM	I couldn't figure out why I was in so much abdominal pain - my stomach would bulge and then I would double over in pain - then came the burping and gas.  At first it was only at night time - now it strikes me almost any time I eat.  It lowers the blood cholesterol - but the pain is hard to live with.

Chronic Diarrhea	Sooze, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	55-64	6/22/2010 4:35:30 PM	It works well for diarrhea, but it is a bit troublesome to pull out the packet and mix it, especially if you're around others.  I've been getting headaches after taking it.  Has anyone else?  Has anyone taken this in conjunction with imodium (though not at the same hour, of course)?
Chronic Diarrhea	DN, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	5/1/2010 9:14:03 PM	I experienced what I am certain was food poisoning, beginning with severe diarrhea for 2 days after eating bad chicken at TooJay's Restaurant (which was infested with gnats, and addressed w/the manager who said he has been battling them for two weeks now! I am sorry we didn't leave as soon as we noticed this problem!) and I haven't felt this horrible since I had H-Pylori twice in 1999!My doctor prescribed Cholestyramine, in addition to Amoxicillin and Lomotil, and this medication definetly helped my severe diarrhea, which later became extremely frequent bowel movements, but in addition, Cholestyramine caused extremely severe and frequent urination-as if someone kept opening the flood gates, along with severe gas,and severe abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant.So, in spite of the fact that it helped my beginning diarrhea, I did not enjoy the other side effects associated with thie drug, so I stopped using it.I also followed a complete day of fluids, followed by the BRAT diet-bananas, rice, apples (without the skin) and tea.It has been two weeks since the onset of my illness, and I am still not feeling well.

Chronic Diarrhea	Blessed, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/2/2009 9:30:30 AM	Had diarrhea after everything that I ate.  Tried several different meds; even tried herbal supplements, but nothing worked until I was prescribed cholestyramine.  It has made an amazing difference for the last 3 months.  I would highly recommend speaking with your doctor about it.

Does anyone know how much sugar is in the regular fomula, or should I just return it and get the light that has nutrasweet in it?

Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/29/2009 2:13:27 PM	Gallbladder/pancreatitis surgery left me with fecal incontinence and itching.  No one could find the answer to this awful condition until my Gyn recommended this drug and my life is living again. The doctor said since I no longer have a gallbladder to store &quot;bile&quot; the excess bile is spilled into my system causing diarrhea and fecal incontinence.

I finally went on the internet to webmd and put in life after the gall bladder. that is when i found a testimonial of a women with the same symptoms as mine and that is where i found the cholestyramine. i went to the doctors and requested she put me on this medicine, she did and now my life is somewhat normal the only thing is if i don't take this medicine everyday then my diarrhea returns like it never went away.
