I was rushed to the hospital. Before they took me they gave me a shot of Epinephrine and it apparently was that drug that helped bring down the swelling of my tongue. It took about two hours for the swelling to be totally gone. Scary experience.

Asthma	itstolate, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	3-6	1/7/2010 5:58:41 PM	When my son was 2 1/2 years of age he was diagnosied with asthma.  They started him on Decadron (liquid form) when he was 3 for severe asthma attacks.  He is now 21 years of age and I am telling you that this medication isn't worth the trouble.  The family doctor overdosed him with this for weeks at a time.  The pharmacist even called and questioned the Doctor of the dosage.  He has had gray hair since he was 16 years of age, he has had several corrective surgeries, that aren't genetic or inheritated.  He gained 60 pounds in a three month time period.  He has muscular problems now, shaking of the hands and feet, eyes are really bad, and even has some head trauma due to the overdose.  Please don't hesitate to question your doctor.  I really wished I would have.  I am here to say that when he turned 4 years old we started doctoring with a pediatrition.  He was only on the cortisteriods maybe one or two times after changing doctors.  He has finally outgrown the asthma to a point but isn't able to hold down a job due to the physical and mental problems this has caused.  We never know what medications are going to do to us in the future.  I really wished I would've known.

Other	SharKe, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	35-44	7/22/2009 7:41:36 AM	I take decadron to treat inflammation caused by radiation and chemotherapy for a malignant brain tumor.  The drug is a blessing and a curse. The brain swelling causes a host of neurological problems, such as grand mal seizures, right-sided weakness, memory and cognitive impairment, and severe headaches, which have severely affected my quality of life.  Although decadron has reduced these symptoms, even a dose of 12 mg/day combined with 3 anti-seizure medications has only given me a piece of my life back.  For the first 6 weeks on decadron I did not sleep more than an hour or two or night (sleep meds were worthless) and I was hyper-aggitated and extremely irritable, but eventually my body adjusted and those symptoms improved. Although trivial in the grand scheme of things, decadron resurrected my adolescent acne problems. I'm 41 and going through puberty again.  Ugh. I get tremors in my hands, tingling and/or pins and needles in my legs and feet, and my legs get weak walking up stairs. I take Nexium to avoid the GI upset/ulcers expected from decadron, but I still get a lot of acid reflux. I also have a ravenous appetite so I keep an eye on my weight.  The bottom line is with long term use decadron can cause serious side effects as it shuts down your adrenal glands. Some patients develop a bloated appearance and moon face. Unfortunately it is hard to get the adrenal glands to kick back in to gear, so the weaning process is slow and painful.  My doctors worked with me for 6 weeks to wean down my dose to 2 mg per day, only to have to return to 12/mg a day because the seizures returned. Ultimately the goal is to find the lowest effective dose.  Good luck to those, like me, who have no alternative but to take this drug.

They sent me home on Decadron.  We have tried for months to figure out why I am swelling and having several new symptoms.I have had most of the side effects listed under this drug most severe.  I have the moon face, muscle pain, headaches bloating/weight/water gain, tiredness, mood swings, high blood pressure which I never had a problem with, and now change in blood cells. I just had my 6 week post partum papsmear come back abnormal cells.  It has always been within normal limits. MANY MANY MORE side effects It is an awful drug and should be removed from shelves.  I suggest everyone refuse it unless there is no other alternative. The severe pain in my neck is minimal but now I have more symptoms than I can deal with.

Decreased Function of the Adrenal Gland	CGW, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/21/2009 10:55:31 PM	I was mis-diagnosed in 1987 (at age 24) with Adrenal Hyperplasia and began daily oral use of Decadron. I had a baby in 1993 while on the drug. My daughter has had 2 surgeries for huge ovarian cysts (at ages 13 &amp; 16). She has other health issues which I believe are due to the steriod use. I was assured there was no danger to my unborn child. I began having constant headaches, gained alot of weight, my face became round.I took it until 1997 when I saw a different endocrinologist and found I had poly-cystic ovarian syndrome and not  adrenal hyperplasia. I began the extremely painful process of withdawal from the Decadron.Needless to say, when you take a drug (especially a steroid) for a condition you do not have,very bad results occur. I suffered tremendous pain in my bones-it was nearly unbearable. After a few months, the pain subsided a great deal and  I began losing weight. My doctor said I would probably always have pain in my bones. I have endured twelve years of bone pain that is  progressively worsening. My family and I had no legal recourse as I did not die from the mis-diagnosis/steriod use. My daughter is also suffering and will probably have chronic health situations due to this awful drug. My pain is intensifying as each year passes ( I am now 45). Lately, it has been waking me up during the night. I take over the counter drugs such as Aleve, as I do not want to take stronger pain pills for the rest of my life. This drug &amp; a negligent physician have stolen alot from me.

Use as last resort ,usually 4-5th day ongoing migrane really limit use or delay use because of side effects.  Side effects: Insomnia, red faced, hyperness, agitated.  Because it is so strong I do not take many of them and only need to use them over a 24 hour maybe 48 hour period.  My MD chose these because longer doses of prednisone made me emotionally over the top - irritability, anger, irrationally upset, tough to live with etc.

Weight gain is the biggest part- I gained about 35lb in a few months.  Other side effects include emotional instability.  And joint pain (knees and ankles) if not taken at the same time each day.  It's gotten to the point where I've crawled out of bed and not been able to walk for a few hours.  And if you drink alcohol the pain is MUCH worse the next day.  I know this drug is necessary for for me but I hate thinking that I have to take it for the rest of my life.

He was started on this after surgery and has tried to be weened off of it 3 times now and each time was unsuccessful. It caused lethargy, confusion, vomitting, head ache, and tremors. This was because the swelling reoccured during the titration process. It has also caused wakefulness, and caused him to be very very very shaky. There are times where his legs just turn into noodles and falls. Another complication with this &quot;falling&quot; is that he loses control of his bladder and urinates involuntarly. This has become a frequent problem and his doctor has put him on Ditropan to help control his bladder. Hopefully this helps.

Other	cliffb, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/7/2008 11:10:46 AM	I was prescribed Decadron to reduce the swelling of a brain stem tumor caused by Neurofibromatosis 1(NF-1).  Original dose was 4 mlg 3 times a day.  Attempts to reduce the dosage prior radiation treatment resulted in the return of life threatening symptoms. Dosage now is 3 1-mlg tabs twice a day. Initially, side affects like intense hunger, some irritability and inabilty to sleep were bothersome, but easily dealt with. This drug is a complete life saver for my situation and would be in the hospital without it or a similar acting medication. I have yet to start radiation treatment at the time of this writing, and am hopeful that reduction of the (inoperable) tumor will be sufficient to no longer need the drugs.

At first I had energy and sense of well being, although it cause my ankles to swell and hot red skin on my face and neck.  It helped because I only have flu like symptons on the fifth day after chemo.This month, the side effects have changed.  I become very sad, nervous and cannot control crying fits.  I cancelled my chemo treatment.  This drug, for  some reason, has reversed it's side effects.  Ths doctor has told me to take half the dosage.
