Migraine Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	7/17/2012 12:45:12 PM	I am very pleased with this drug. I have been taking it regularly for about two months now and the only real problem I have had with it is I need to make sure I always have a drink or gum with me becuase I get marked dry mouth when I talk a lot or at night. Considering what it is relieving me from (debilitating migraines), I will take the dry mouth over anything! I had problems sleeping before as well and this has helped to get me into a regular sleep pattern.

Gained 5lbs but would rather have that then a headache.My appetite increased no too much just a bit more.  All round it has been a life saver not to have headaches at all.

It doesn't stop me from getting them necessarily but i rarely feel them anymore. But however i tried to stop taking them one and the first night i barely slept the second night it was like i couldnt shut off my brain to sleep. the third night it was like someone had their finger stuck on the channel button of random sounds words pictures of words and pictures that were all totally unrelated. by the fourth night i was bawling it was making me so nauseous from it never siccing so i went back on em and it stopped. But then i got pregnant and my doc told me i have to get off them... well that didn't go to well... And one time they stopped making them and i couldn't get any of the proper dose for almost 3 months.

Initially prescribed for depression but it does help arthritic joints relax and rest.  The initial &quot;hangover&quot; feeling doesn't last for more than a few days to a month.  Now that I am disabled and retired I can sleep for up to 10 consecutive hours.  Couldn't do that through most of my working life.  Lots of my nights were zero sleep up to four hours.  Elavil really is a gift when you cannot sleep.

I was given generic Elavil. I had to slowly work my dosage up to minimize side effects and decrease my pain. I've now been taking 40 ml before bed for 10 years and only rarely have breakthrough. It has been lifesaver because I couldn't have lived with the pain this long and side effects have been minimal.

Its been 9 months and he still takes it at bedtime.  He says it helps him fall asleep and stay asleep but he has to time it very carefully for when he thinks it will work, for example, when he feels drowsy.  If he takes it at the wrong time he says it doesnt put him to sleep.  With concussions sleep and staying asleep are an issue.  He wants to continue taking it, but also says it doesnt knock him out.  There were no side effects that we could notice....and it helped I suppose with  the neck and shoulder strain too....

I dont have a solution, but If I am in another situation which mocks the pain of a heart attack. I had all of the tests and dealt with all of the Doctors and this pain is enough to cause me Migraines which made me vomit. If I got a migraine, I would vomit. I was stuck.I have been through 26 yrs of trying to identify the source...endoscopy just last wk. I use 150 mg noghtly. I have been using it along with Hydro codone and Cyclobenzaprine for pain in addition, as needed. I am using much less Hydro &amp; Cyclo at this point which is usually brought on by cold weather, rain and the like.I fell and I hit the corner of a cinderblock with the vertebrea @ braline in 1998. I have always attributed that part of my pain/problems. I have had multiple surgeries since 1986, so I havent really faced life as I should, however I do maintain a good nights' sleep, and I do have a schedule I try to maintain. I do have a couple discs in my back that cause pain. I am able to remain mobile, I feel, because of the rest Amitriptyline at night, and lots of Walking. If someone told me I had a tumor the size of A grapefruit between my breastbone and my spine, I would not be shocked. Thats how &quot;thick&quot; my pain is. Pain med during the &quot;pain&quot; does nothing. It is esophoghus spasms. I have no sensation to go to the bathroom, just so the spine issue is not relieved yet.

All other therapies (physical, ibuprofen, Soma) were not effective. I have never had to increase the dose. I recently accidentally skipped 2 doses and opted to quit to see if my TMJ pain had healed. It hadn't and I was in so much discomfort &amp; pain that my quality of life was nil. Began taking it again and within 2 days the TMJ/neck/facial pain was manageable again. Although I might have to stay on it forever to have a high quality of life, Elavil has been a wonder drug for me.  Oh, and sleeping is easy and deep, contributing to my overall health. For me the benefits FAR outweigh any side effects.

Depression	Cheryl, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	6/1/2011 6:56:04 PM	I have been taking Elavil for over 15 years - originally for depression but it worked in helping me get more than three hours sleep a night which thrilled me. Undiagnosed PTSD - it helped with that, also.  I gained weight immediately and it is a struggle to get it off because I crave sugar. I can devour a pie in an evening.  I now take Ambien for sleep so I am going to see if the doctor can reduce my elavil gradually and substitute with another med. The worst side effect is chronic constipation. I haven't had a normal bowel movement in years - 10-15 years at least and have to take a strong laxative once a week and that is the only time I &quot;poop&quot; - every Saturday is poop day and I stay home all day.  In other words, 52 days a year of my life I am stuck here at home for the day. I truly am &quot;full of it!!&quot;  Elavil has saved my life. If I had only known about this when I was a single mother with three teenagers all our lives would have been better. But,now I am ready stop it.  Say a prayer for me.  Thanks.

Ive been in treatment for panic attacks and inability to sleep for about 2 yrs now; diagnosis was PTSD due to a sudden divorce.  During this time my internist has prescribed multiple meds; all with too many side effects. I find myself coping with living alone for the 1st time in my life, hence the panic attacks: unsure of the future. Its been a growing experience for me; good &amp; bad (dating again after 25 yrs). My panic attacks are hopefully under control now (with the help of therapy and Wellbutrin in the am), but the sleeplessness was driving me crazy.  Not only does Elavil help me relax &amp; fall asleep but I stay asleep which is a nice change. Side effects include occasional ringing in ear, weight gain, dry mouth, drowsy/difficulty getting out of bed, odd dreams &amp; talking in sleep, being forgetful and very relaxed.  I welcome the relaxation part since I used to be a control freak and perfectionist.  My kids and I like the new relaxed me.  I do take low doses of both meds, so side effects are minimal. The only side effect that was a concern was the weight gain, but I now eat less and exercise daily @ lunch time. Ive never had to watch my weight, but I do now.  Give it a try for @ least a month; I highly recommend it!

So far it has worked for me, I have very little headaches anymore instead of all the time, and now their very light instead of the extreme pain I use to get.

Migraine Prevention	Alisa Ali, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	3/5/2011 12:32:21 AM	I was prescribed Elavil 25mg by my neurologist to treat and prevent migraines, that I seemed to have almost on daily basis most likely due to stress I have been going through.Shortly after I start taking it I have noticed a dramatic change in my condition. Migraines and stress often caused me not be able to sleep well, which was one of the reason my doctor prescribed it. I have noticed that migraines frequencies reduced to about 2 times a week, sometimes just once a week. A lot of weeks I feel just wonderful and go through a day with out any pain. Elavil does help me sleep much better. The only side effect I experience from it is difficulty getting up in the morning.I have been taking it for 2 months now, and I am not sure what is going to happen if I stop. I seem to be strongly effected by stress and pressure at work, which could possibly mean I need to take Elavil on regular basis. But with out further doctor examination I can't be a 100% sure of that.I think it is a very good medication, that does not have any major side effects. It works, it helped me, and I never expected it to help my intense headaches as much as it did.

Started out on 20 mg before bed. I also have had problems sleeping for about the last 10 years. The medicine gives you a very nasty taste in your mouth. Ihad trouble getting up in the morning. Started taking drug during the day instead of night. Makes me fell tired and run down Dr. increased dosage to 30 mg. Now I feel even tireder don't know that it is helping for the GI pain. I have been having headaches similar to sinus headaches. I think I'm going to back off of the 30 mg and go back to 20 mg in the evening.I did not want to take it because it being used for an anti-depresant. I don't know if it is helping but I know I don't like the way I feel.

Then I recalled reading that elavil helps to prevent them. Called my dr. and he prescribed 10mg dose at bedtime. What a difference! I have had no migraines since starting it almost a month ago. I also have fibromyalgia and it has worked wonders, alleviating the terrible neck and shoulder pain. My only complaint would be the fatigue that remains with me through the day, but I will put up with that in exchange for the blessed relief from almost constant pain.

MOST doctors are practicing medicine, they do not know what these drugs actually do to people. My advice is to throw it in the trash.... causes more depression with taking it. Get rid of your problem with getting rid of the people that cause your depression.

Suffer from chronic leg spazams, nerve pain in hip back and legs.

Allows me to sleep thru night with no problems.

It hurt to touch my head. It affected my vison slightly, though not blurred just strained. So far it's lasted 4 hours. I'm taking half the prescribed dose. The pharmacist said to just take Tylenol or Motrin. I took Aspirin but no help so far. The pain increases,like a spasm, at one hour intervals. Even ice paks aren't helping. Not able to get to sleep at 1AM.

My doctor wanted me to take elavil every night before bed. I absolutely love it. I only take 25mg but it does the trick! I always sleep well, and my only complaint would be that it takes me about an hour to an hour and a half to take effect. My suggestion to the people feeling like zombies is to ask your doc about your dosage. 100mg would knock me out. A little goes a long way. Overall, very effective against my panic attacks!

Even the simplest of things. I didn't even notice it until my Grandmother asked me if I was ok and I told her, &quot;I guess I'm alright, Why do you ask?&quot; And that's when she told me that I've been overly forgetful and confused. I do NOT like that! Who would?! Has ANYONE had the same thing happen to them?I've talked to my Psychiatrist about it and, as usual, he blows me off. Ugh .. So frustrating and embarrassing!

After reading these reviews, I don't know if I want to take it. Am currently taking 150 mgs of Zoloft daily and Medrol for the pain but need to come off the Medrol due to osteoporosis. I don't know what causes the bilateral arm and leg pain, and no doctor seems to be interested in trying to find the cause. They just put you on pills and hope for the best. Will have to do a lot more research before agreeing to take this medication.

Finally by the time I was in my late 30's, I had it with my migraines, which I didn't know they were migrains since I don't have the typical signs of migraines.  Also, could never fall asleep for hours.  Finally a student of mine who was a pharmpist told me about Elavil.  I asked my doctor to prescribe it, and finally for the first time, I could actually fall asleep sooner rather than later, and am not a night owl anymore.  It's easier for me to go to bed early and get up early, for it was torture to get up early.   I probably will need to stay on Elavil for many more years to help cut down on the migraines and help me sleep.

Neuropathic Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	6/18/2010 12:54:55 PM	I was prescribed Elavil 25mg due to chronic severe pain, neuropathic pain &amp; Insomnia.  I had to play around with the dosage, per Dr's orders in order to find the correct mg needed.  I have been on Elavil now for 3 weeks.  I finally am on the correct dosage of 100 mg, which is working tremendously.  It takes about 3 hours before I feel tired enough to go to sleep.  I finally sleep a full 8-9 hours without severe pain during the night.  I dont usually feel groggy in the morning, however on a rare occasion it happens.  The perfect remedy for this is a hot shower when you wake up.  You come out feeling refreshed and ready for the new day.  I have also noticed, I am less stressed in my life.  Things that normally would've aggravated me, don't seem to affect me now.  I am very thankful for this treatment.  I am no longer suffering from sleep deprevation, anxiety, and severe pain while sleeping.  I hope this review helps one of you out there! =)

I noticed for myself that there is no positive benefit to my symptoms while the side effects(diarrhea, dizziness, etc) made it more difficult to function daily than with depression alone.  Why physicians insist on prescribing meds that have shown throughout the entire history of the medication to have little or no postive effect with the barrage of negative side effects can only allow me to draw the conclusion that my health is of the least concern in the order of business.

I do NOT have any horrible side effects as I read about such as feeling like a zombie or my body parts not connected. I would recommend anyone to try it and see if it works for you or not. I am still trying other meds as well for my i.c. Hope I can get this pain under control soon.

I wish I didn't have to take a fist full of medications for my Shingles, however, I really couldn't imagine the full run of pain that comes from having shingles.  I am a worry-person and take too much ownership of everyones problems and issues that affects me. My mother just passed away 1 month ago, although I have turned to this wonder drug years ago to help me stay level headed...  I am now having issues with talking/screaming in my sleep EVERY night ALL night long.  Screaming wordswhile sleeping that I wouldn't dare say while I am awake.  So, a friend recommended Valerian Root to me.  I am now taking Elavil and Valerian Root at bed time and my sleep talking has gotten so bad I am now in tears when I wake up 4 times during the night.  I really hate all the medication I am on right now...  Wellbutrin XL, Effexor and Elavil every day.  I want off! Stop this I want to be done. I am hurting inside enough to feel it every day all day.  I don't want a full blown shingle attack that will make my world unbearable.

I was taking this to help with chronic pain. I was having problems with emptying the bladder and the Dr. took me off of the medication.  After just a couple of months off of the medication I noticed that my hair was growing back, and is now much fuller.  I had no idea that the medication could cause my hair to get so thin. If you are a women taking this and your hair is thinning, check with your doctor about it.

I would sleep for 14-16 hours and still feel incredibly tired yet my heart was racing like crazy. Very bizarre. Horrible dry mouth, no coordination, incredibly angry, high blood pressure. I already slept all the  time so it made no sense to give me this drug. Do Psychiatrists have any common sense?

I use it as a sleep aid and to also help with my migraine prevention. This medicine doesnt really effect my migraine issue, but my sleep is helped anormously. I can go to sleep and stay asleep, when I wake up I dont feel as groggy and tired/sleepy as I did with Ambien or Lunesta. This medication is cheap compared to other sleep aides, and I would recommend Elavil (amitryptaline) 100% for a good night's sleep.

Because it made me sleepy, I started taking it at night. My doctor increased the dose to 25 mg and I've been taking it for aprox. 8 years, along with Ambien. It helps me fall asleep and the Ambien keeps me asleep. I take a low dose of Ultram for pain but it just takes the edge off. The doctor suggested taking 50 mg. Elavil during the day and at night because it works so well on the pain -- better than anything. I'm wary of trying that high a dose during the day, but may be willing to use 50 at bedtime.  It's a great med and I've had NO problems with it.

The latter to get to sleep, the former to stay asleep.  Amitriptlyne is effective at keeping me asleep but I haven't experienced waking up feeling refreshed in years.  That may be due to my being BiPolar.  If I take 2 50mg tabs I hallucinate and see a black lace print on all surfaces.  This is very disorienting.  I recently skipped my Ambien to see if I could get and stay asleep with just the Amitriptylune and not only did I not get to sleep but had a bad headache.

I first started taking 25mg. My doc is wanting to up the dose soon. I am bipolar so I was a bit nervous about being on an antidepressant but she reassured me that since I was on mood stabilizers that I should be fine. At first, this medication caused drowsiness during the morning hours which was to be expected so I took it earlier in the evening with my dinner. I would go to bed earlier so that I could get a good 8-9 hours of sleep straight so that I could wake up at 6am. My dreams are a bit odd and very realistic, but that subsided within about 4 weeks. They weren't every night either, so they were manageable. I could sleep straight through the night with no getting up constantly to pee, or because tiny little noises would get me up. When I lay down to sleep now, my mind is clear and not a jumbled up mess with worries about the following day. As far as my migraine pain, the migraines are not as frequent, they aren't as severe, and I am no longer going to the ER once or twice a week anymore. I am also on topamax(for migraines) and lamictal (which keeps me awake for my bipolar). The only drawback to this medication that I have had is probably how thirsty I am. I drink tons of water. I can't poo, and I get pretty tired easily during the day. I take classes in the evening so my body is like, &quot;okay I have had enough, time for sleep&quot; during class. Overall, I have been pretty happy with this medication. And if given the chance, without giving up so quickly, I think a lot of people will be too. It has been around for a very long time. And with all drugs there are side effects. Be aware of all that you are taking.

Works very well for getting a full 8 hours sleep. I wake up without being groggy. I did put on about 35 lbs which I can't seem to lose. But being able to sleep through the misserable pain I had in my legs is worth the extra weight. I can't imagine going back to my life without this drug. It helped with the chronic fatigue from having Fibromyalgia and the nerve pain in my legs. It is a wonder drug for me.

Other	bram44, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	35-44	11/24/2009 5:36:29 PM	I checked myself in to an inpatient detox program in Aug 2009 for alcohol, cocaine, vicodin.  After my release from the hospital my Psychiatrist would not refill my rx for xanax, which I had taken and surprisingly did NOT abuse since I was 16.  Instead I was put on Seroquel, Seroquel XR, Nuerontin, Visteral, Cymbalta and eventually Elavil.  The Elavil was prescribed for it's sedative effects w/o the addictiveness of Benzo's. The sedation took place immediately.  So did the crazy sugar cravings, ravenous &amp; insatiable hunger.  Within 6 weeks I gained 20 lbs.  Unacceptable.  I took myself off of everything 1 week ago and I have dropped 10.5 lbs in that short amount of time.  I truly blame the Elavil for the rapid weight gain, but I'm sure when cocktailed with the other prescriptions, the gain was amplified.  Yes, I am having some withdrawl symptoms--nausea, chills, disrupted sleep, etc. BUT I am also beginning to feel like a real person again and my libido has returned with gusto; I had truly forgotten the joys of physical pleasure.  In a nutshell, I figure if I paid to get myself off my recreational drugs of choice, I don't need to pay a doctor to get me hooked on &quot;safe&quot; prescriptions--especially ones that make me fat!

While it worked for the pain, I experienced every side effect imaginable. I was always tired, dizzy, gained weight, more depressed, at times suicidal, etc. My DR said this is a very old drug, developed in the 60s, that he refuses to prescribe because of the side effects. I was on it for 10 months and have just finished weaning off of it and switching to Cymbalta (He has only had one patient complain of side effects on Cymbalta, and even then only drowsiness). I do have a few residual side effects, but they are lessening day by day. I've also noticed a significant decrease in anxiety and panic attacks since quitting the medication. I would suggest anyone prescribed Elavil take a long hard look at the side effects first (or even after taking it for a time) and look for a newer, alternative.

By the 3rd night of taking 20mg..I had a very hard time waking up, in a fog all day, short tempered, anxious, very irratible..sounds were amplified..not good with 2 small kids.  I decided to stop taking it all together..not reccomended withdrawl effects are very severe!  Dizzy, foggy, memory loss, fatigue beyond anything.  Day 3 post not taking it, severe migraine, vommiting, wound up in an emergy care center...was told could have had seizure from stopping these medicines!  Day after migraine..brain fog..tired!  My advice, read all the literature all the side effects and withdrawl effects are very real and horrible.  Would not take this medicine unless last thing I could do!  And be sure you want to stay on it!!  Oh also..will lower your sex drive and ability to achieve orgasim..and really not make you care about anything.

I cannot believe even with stress it SEEMS to be helping this intractable problem.  Moreover it does help wtih sleeping.  I have a terrible anxiety disorder and am SO fearful of psychotropic drugs.  I would love to try more and probably will as the reviews seem to be so good and NO migraines...yet.  It's the panic/anxiety that is absolutely a killer to me.  I would LOVE it to help that!
Neuropathic Pain	SS, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/12/2009 7:13:58 PM	In 1995, I had excruciating neuropathic pain in my feet; I was tested for MS, Lupus, Lymphoma, AIDS, lead poisoning, Lyme's Disease, and Guillame Barre Syndrome. Neurologist never found cause of pain and I have permanent nerve damage in my feet.  Was on MS Contin for 2 1/2 months until I could put my feet flat on the floor again; had 2 months of physical therapy in order to walk again.  I've been taking 50 mg. of Elavil every night for 10 years and it still blocks the pain message from brain to the damaged nerves in my feet.

I started seeing a new doctor and immediately she told my to try the Elavil; she told me it would help with my insomnia depression and migrains and well i haven't had a migraine in over two months since starting the medication, I've actually been sleeping 100 times better and well I'm a lot happier than I was on any other anti depressant.  Also I feel that it's very convenient instead of taking at least three different medications like i was before I take 1-2 of the Elavil a day and I feel great.  I definitely recommend it

Taking 25mg.at night, have found that I am get very sleepy during the day also, unless I am up and going. Almost fall asleep driving to work in the morning and can hardly stay awake at work while working on the computer. The doc wants to up me to 50mg because of my pain, but I don't think I will because I get soooo sleepy. I would rather take something else for the pain but it seems docs frown on giving pain meds, don't know why. I have gained a few pounds on this med, it seems I am hungry alot.

Depression	Chill96, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	3	4	1	Male	45-54	7/17/2009 3:41:26 PM	My experience with this is as a caregiver.  My boyfriend suffers from depression and bi-polar disorder.  Dr has him on 200mg of Amitriptyline every night.  He has horrible dry mouth all day and has gained about 30 lbs.  He can barely function during the day and has become forgetful and dopey.  I think this is way too much medicine of this nature for a person to take.  He is trying to get on disability now because there is no way he can work under these conditions. He's like a zombie most of the time...Sleeps off and on during the day, but then even though he falls into a deep sleep almost immediately after taking the med, he still has horrible restless dreams and wakes up alot during the night.  I would not recommend this medication to anyone in this dosage that wants to function during the day.

For the first couple of weeks I was groggy (almost felt like being hung over) but after that I was fine. I noticed that I have to sleep at least eight hours or I'm sleepy for a few hours after waking. It helps to calm my thoughts before bedtime,before it was like my brain had no off switch. The only strange thing I've noticed is that my dreams are a bit odd. Including dreaming about people I havent seen or thought of in years. Also I have a lot more nightmares which isnt that bothersome....I'm just glad I can fall asleep and stay that way!

I do not have any history of seizures and neither does my family. The next morning I scheduled a cat scan of my brain and also a sleep deprivation test. Both came back completely normal! The neurologist told me if I never take this medicine again, I have a 99% chance of never having a seizure again.

Also getting up several times to urinate.  My doc suggested using elavil,and I immediately stated &quot;I don't want to use an antidepressant&quot;.  He reassured me, and I tried it, and really grateful for it because my sleep is soooo much better, and I feel better as a result of good sleep.  I wish I did not have to use any medication for sleep, but this is the greatest help for me now.  My job can be stressful and very busy, and trying to function on little sleep was just aweful on some days.  Now I don't have that problem.

I sleep approx. 4-5 hours interrupted on it and less without(even more interrupted) it but doctor does not want to put me on stronger sleep aid.  Noticed on my own and during a sleep study that since I have been on this medication and paroxetine I talk in my sleep (hold conversations) which I did not do previously and it was not noted in my first sleep study.  I think this is a side effect of the medications that is not noted on either of them which further erodeds my sleep quality.

The migraines have gotten worse in the past 7 yrs, at least one everyday and sometimes constant for 8 to 24 hours. I usually take Fioricet w/codeine and am tired of taking so much of it so my doctor asked me to try Elavil. I take 1 elavil in the morning and 2 - 2hrs before bed. The only bad thing is I still have a headache when I wake up in the morning, so I take 1 Fioricet and have no headaches all the rest of the day! This is so wonderful, and I am hoping gradually to not have ANY headaches at all.  I recommended Elavil (amytriptaline) to anyone who can adjust to it, it does take a while to work correctly, it took about a month for me.

Still suffer from menstrual migraines and my thyroid disease is close to under control; was sent to neurologist that changed my meds all up (put me on palmar and then lexapro which threw me into major depression) because he said that the Elavil only caused to make me fat.  I'm overweight because I don't make the time to exercise like I know I need to and eat the food that work best for my body, it's my own laziness, not the drug itself.

My Dr tried adjusting my dose a few times and it would seem to work for a few days, then I would be right back in the same situation.  I guess it really depends on the person and your body chemistry, but this was not the medication for me.

I would take this at night, to help me to sleep.  Little did I know that I would gain almost 30 pounds in about 7 weeks.  I am a small female, and have always weighed around 105 to 110.  The sudden weight gain, has caused me major problems with depression, extreme psychological problems.  It is so bad that I would tape newspaper over the bathroom mirrors, and leave the light off, just to take a shower! When I talked w/doctor about the sudden weight gain, he immediately did a blood test for thyroid problems.  Everything was fine, but no one seemed concerned what this weight gain has done to me. I did my own research on WebMD, and looked at the side effects of all the medication that I am on, I had over 20 of the symptons that were mentioned!  I have an appointment this month to see the doc, and I have written down all of the symptons that I have, and hopefully he will listen to me and the concerns I have.  He doesn't seem to like it when I mention information that I have researched pertaining to me.  I pray that he will REALLY listen, and adjust my meds.  I wish I had researched WebMD sooner, and maybe I could have saved my emotional probs with the weight gain and side effects that this medication causes.

Migraine Prevention	S. Davis, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	1/28/2009 1:33:37 AM	I've experienced lesser headaches than normal but my appetite has increased tremendously.  I gained seven pounds within the first two weeks of taking this medication.  I'm not big on eating sweets but my second week on this drug, I ate a 1/2 gallon of ice cream and dish of banana pudding that could've served at least six people.  I'm also a nighthawk and a light sleeper. But now when I hit the pillow, I'm out for the count.  Overall, within three weeks, I've had two headaches (not migraines)which is a plus!! But my eating habits are uncontrollable...This is what I call taking 2 steps forward and 3 steps backward.  Looks like I'm at point A again...

It works very well, even after all this time.  I have some negative effects, such as headaches.  There have also been times where others tell me that I do things in my sleep that I don't remember, like eating and walking around.  The only potentially serious thing that happened was that I took multiple pills in my sleep once (I think I thought I was eating).  Nothing bad resulted from this, and now I keep the pills in a place so that they are very difficult to get to in my sleep.

Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	12/11/2008 7:21:53 AM	Elavil is an old school antidepressant that is now considered a &quot;dirty drug&quot; because of its undesired side effects. One of the unintended side effects is to relax the skeletal muscle tissue. I use elavil off label to treat my TMJ.  Even with the best night/brux guard I still grind my teeth at night unless I use elavil.  I take 25mg two hours prior to bedtime and sleep like a baby. There is a weeklong haze of grogginess I have to overcome when starting elavil.  After that I'm fine.  I never had to increase the dosage over a two year period.  TMJ is worsened by stress.  I go off and back on elavil from time to time depending on my stress level.  I don't seem to have any problem getting off of it quickly, but I understand some do. Bottom line is I find the benefits of elavil outweigh the minor side effects for me.

I also have lower back pain, and soreness of my left arm. I don't know if this is associated with the prescription or not.

I'm now in a major depressive episode, my doctor prescribed this as my Wellbutrin and Celexa was not helping.  While I can sleep w/ Elavil (slept through the night w/o waking which is unusual for me)my crying jags have increased (tremendously), as has my ability to make decisions.  I don't even want to go into work or socialize.  I've left work several times in past two weeks.  And to top it off I've gained 10 pounds in 3 weeks. Went to see my psychiatrist and had a melt-down, obviously it's not working.  SO starting tomorrow I'm going on Cymbalta, my 12th-just want to feel normal.

The problem was pain, particularly pain keeping me up at night. I have been on Amitriptyline 50 mg. for over two years now and it has been very helpful at letting me get into deep sleep. There was some initial morning drowsiness in the first couple of weeks but that has quickly worn off. This drug is both cheap and effective for sleeplessness due to pain.

I had gastric bypass surgery 6 years ago so to gain this weight is depressing. I have had chronic pain in my lower abdomin. I have had scar tissue removed (4 surgeries in same location)this has been the best as giving me relief for the pain. I am concerned about the weight gain; Also getting the dosage correct was a very scary thing. I would get up in the middle of the night and fall, say things I don't recall. My family was very worried. It does not work as a sleep aide to me. I still need to take a Lorazapan to sleep.

Anyone with Fibromyalgia or constant pain can attribute how frustrating it is when you get up after a night of @ least 8 hrs of sleep&amp; feel more tired than when you went to sleep.  I took Elavil 4 about a year and GAINED a whopping 65lbs.  The pill worked great &amp; I woke up after taking it even with only 4 hrs of sleep &amp; felt like I slept 10.  I dreamed for the 1st time in quite some time, so I know it stimulated stage 3 &amp; 4 sleep which I was not getting any or a very tiny amount of.  I was prescribed this medication by a psych provider who had the same conditions and had previously had the same problem getting the &quot;rest&quot;, but started getting it after she was prescribed it by one of her own drs.  She advised me that it was originally used as an anti-depressant, but not prescribed near as much because people would be zonked on it or experience lots of daytime sleepiness.  That provider left about 3 months later and I kept complaining that I was gaining weight to all my drs until one day my pain mgt dr said, &quot;Get off the Elavil, I see numerous pts balloon up while on it&quot;!  I must say though I was extremely hesitant about it because of its effectiveness, but am happy to report that now after being off of it about 11 weeks now I have dropped 40lbs and from size 20 something to 12's almost being too big now.  I am not exercising more, eating less, or doing anything different than before EXCEPT NOT TAKING ELAVIL.  I have had a tough road and am still trying to find a good medication that had the effectiveness or even a combo that would work as good.  I have back problems, feet problems, knee issues, etc and I would go back on Elavil, BUT 1 LB. OF WEIGHT ON YOUR BODY CAN = 4 LBS OF STRESS ON ANYTHING BELOW THAT WEIGHT &amp; THAT'S NOT TO MENTION KILLING YOUR SELF-ESTEEM BECAUSE YOU'RE FAT.I have witnessed the same w/ others taking Elavil, but cannot speak 4 them here.

First tried elavil 25 yrs ago when my kids were little and could NOT stay awake. My current Dr. wanted me to get off Rx pain meds so started me on 10mg. I truely did NOT believe it would work, but it has! I'm up to 30mg. at 8:00pm and sleep well. I have a HARD time waking up in the morning, and still have some daily headaches which acetaminophen usually takes care of. However, for the last few months I have been experiencing increasing bouts of anxiety, depression, irritability and longer daily headaches. The depression scares me for it feels overwhelming and uncontrollable. Yes, I have had some stress in my life recently with work and family problems, but I don't remember feeling so &quot;crazy&quot; except with PMS. (hysterectomy took care of all that 15 years ago)I'm seeing my Dr. soon to reevaluate things. I can't live with this depression! I, too, have had some weight gain that I can NOT get rid of.

By age 25 I was experiencing nearly a migraine a week and a &quot;regular headache&quot; almost daily. After trying chiropractic care, regular OTC drugs like advil and excedrin migraine as well as prescription drugs such as Imitrex it seemed like nothing would work for my migraines. My doctor prescribed this medicine to me to help prevent my migraines and so far it is working. I have not noticed any significant side effects other than it makes me sleepy and I find it difficult to get up in the morning if I take this medication less than 10 hours before I need to be awake again. I do find that I have a persistant &quot;fuzzy&quot; feeling in my head sometimes but for me, this is better than pounding pain and nausea. I would recommend this drug to someone with a similar migrain history. As a bonus, I seem to have less anxiety problems when taking this medicine regularly!

It began to work the secound day I was on it!  The only side effects were dizzieness the first couple days.  After a few months though I started feeling a little nervous again and IBS symptoms. My DR. at the time didn't want to up my dose so I got off and have yet to find anything else that helped with little side effects.  I have a new Dr. now and I am planning on seeing what she thinks about me going back to elavil. My anxiety has been pretty unbearable.  I can't go anywhere long distance without getting myself all worked up into having IBS or bladder problems, just from worring they will happen.  Good luck to you all. I hope this helps you as well as me!

Neuropathic Pain	kat, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	45-54	6/1/2008 1:47:07 PM	I have been on 10mg at 5pm for about a month...to help get to REM sleep due to Fibromyalgia.  Although I fall asleep and stay asleep, I even wake at 5am without difficulty, but I stay sleepy all day long, unless my brain is exceedingly active.  I find that driving and watching TV I literally *cannot* hold my eyes open!  I missed a dose by 2 hours and immediately had nausea, chills, and vomitted.  I have not taken it since, it's been 3 days and I feel like I have a flu or something.  Everything hurts and my stomach is on edge, and I'm having hot flashes and chills.  Of course it's Sunday, and what to do?  I think tonight I'll be taking it again, because at least I can sleep while I'm on it, and they say that is the number one thing to treat the pains of fibromyalgia.  I also have been taking 200mg of Ultram ER, though do not feel that is the medication causing the difficulties, as I've been on it off and on, and side effects (sleepy during low brain activity) have persisted while NOT on the Ultram Er...  Oh, and I'm crying way more than while I was 'on' the amitriptyline.
Other	angie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	55-64	5/22/2008 8:56:57 PM	My doctor prescribed this drug to help my sleeplessness during a streesful period. It worked well for this. I am on only 10mg and am now trying to cut back and eventually stop taking it, but everytime I cut back, even a small amount (eliminate 1/4 dose every other day) I experience nausea, dizziness, severe chills, grogginess and general aches and pains, to such a degree that I am unable to work and have to go to bed. I will *never* take this drug again. Does anyone have any suggestions?

Prescribed by Pain Mgmt Dr. for pain and panic attacks that I have just started experiencing. I'm a light weight when it comes to any med-I was started out on 10mg, the lowest and I was really knocked out-slept great though. I cut back to 5mg's for next two nights and ate a little protein before I took med before bedtime, and found I wasn't as groggy the next day. Since taken at night, I have slept great, I'm now back to 10mg/day.

The first few nights I was a little tired the next day, but now I feel wonderful.  I can't believe it worked because I was very skeptical.

I also had trouble sleeping at night because of the pain. My doctor suggested elavil and I gave it a shot. Thank goodness I did. I rarely ever have migranes now, and since i have been getting more more sleep at night, it did away with my daily headaches.

I had IBS since a child and think the IBS was all anxiety related from the start.  From the IBS (I thought) I then had panic attacks everytime I would go some where, thinking I was going to have the IBS attacks and ofcourse by thinking it, it did happen..  I was afraid to travel far.. Now I can sleep well,  I can go anywhere, even fly, Almost never have an IBS attack.. Feel it has made my life 100% better. It did take a while to get use to the sedation left over in the morning, I did have weird dreams in the beginning, and I cannot go with out the drug.  Felt like I needed rehab when I tried to stop it.. I decided to stay on it I guess forever because I do not want to feel like I was before Elavil.. I would definately say it has changed my life for the better!!!!!

My dr. put me on this to help with sleep, severe depression and spinal pain.  I take 150mg at bedtime.  When I first started taking it I felt very tired and in a trance for about an hour in the morning but that side effect went away quickly (within 3 days). It seemed to work at the beginning when I first started taking it for the sleep problem and the pain but seems that it has quit working.  My shrink wants me to stay on it none the less if for no other reason for the depression benefit.  I also take citalapram and 300mg of welbutrin for depression.  diagnosis is borderline personality disorder and pain.

Found it also helped reduce the pain from my fibromyalgia a great deal. Found that 20 mg helped best with pain, but had to reduce to 15 mg as it induced a hypomanic state (bipolar II). Wish I could take more for fibromyalgia, and for better migraine prevention, but still this is the best medication I've found for all 3. Highly recommended. Just don't cut back quickly without medical supervision esp. if you think you may have bipolar.
