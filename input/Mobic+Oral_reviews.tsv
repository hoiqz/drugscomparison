As the Naproxen left my system I realised that the pain I was in was increasing hourly and the new drug was having no effect whatsoever.  I was able to walk (short distances), stand and at least wash a few pots at my sink before having to sit down, I was able to sleep without being woken frequently by pain when moving, I rarely got headaches.  Since changing to this other drug I can hardly stand up, I can't move my arms or legs without severe pain, I can no longer sleep for more than 20 minutes before I am woken by the pain, I have reached a point where I can hardly do anything for myself any more.  I don't believe that this drug has any useful effects whatsoever and certainly has reduced my quality of life to almost non existent.

I felt really good tonight after 4 days of taking Mobic.  I usually come home after work and can do hardly anything because of my knee pain.  I was able to actually do a lot of physical things around the house tonight.  I don't know if I'll have any side effects yet, but I'll continue taking it and find out.  Mobic actually helped the arthritis in my back, too.  I'm liking Mobic so far.

I'm sure it is the cause.

I took Mobic for 2 days only. In those 2 days, it relieved all the pain in my knee. Unfortunately, it also caused my heart to race for two hours after taking it, so my doctor stopped me from using it. If it didn't have side effects, I would take this everyday. I felt awesome just in the two days that I took it.

I am considered as a precondition and can not purchase health insurance as an individual.  There is no treatment and no cure.  Renal damage is not reversible.  Due to Mobic, I now can not use any NSAID for pain relief. I do not have kidney disease, but in a sonogram, my kidneys had an abnormal texture due to Mobic use. I had asked my Dr. if this product was safe to use, due to hearing about celebrex causing kidney damage, and he said it was a safe product, and he would take it if he needed to.  He laughed when an insurance company refused to cover me based on renal failure.  ( this is how I found out I had renal failure). He said, I should go to church, and eventually by the time I need dialysis, medicare would cover it for me.  Seriously!

I have had chronic hip &amp; knee pain for at least 2 years now.  Knee xray only showed &quot;arthritic changes&quot;.  Aleve &amp; Motrin can't do what this drug has done for me.  I feel like the old me is back.  Within a couple of days I wasn't limping as I walked.  I can't say enough about how happy I am with the results.  I take one pill a day.  Usually in the evening because it can cause drowsiness.  Also, I don't know if this is related to my migraine relief, but....I haven't woke up with a headache since taking it, as well.  If you have joint pain, please ask for a prescription  of this from your doctor.

I had no idea why I was having such terrible pain at my age. I was prescribed this drug in my early 20's after the doctors finally figured out that I had RA. Please understand if you are younger arthritis does not know age it can effect you and unfortunately it does take different trials of different meds before you find the right one that agrees with your body. I'm glad I have a Mobic to help me out. I do have to be cautious when I take this though as I tend to get sleepy from it and you will gain weight but your doctor will tell you that weight managment will have to be incorporated. With the help of Mobic and weight loss I have fewer bad days. I can still have bad days even when I take this medicine but they are not near as bad as if i had not taken the medicine at all. It is nice to be able to sleep and move in the morning and be able to write and do my art. I'm glad I have Mobic to take.

My doctor told me to take aleve which didn't touch the pain.  He referred me to a specialist who told me I needed my shoulder replaced.  It felt like 6 knives were stabing me all around my shoulder joint and it felt eith jamed or out of joint and kept popping in and out as I did things, very painful.  The first day on mobic half the pain was gone.  The second day all my knives left and there was just a little muscle sourness left.  A month later I am almost pain free.  I don't know why it wasn't prescribed a year ago.  I can sleep at night now since my shoulder doesn't lock up every 10 seconds.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Fed Up, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		6/23/2011 5:55:27 PM	I started generic Mobic one week ago.  Since taking this drug I have had a headache every day, all day long and have had several episodes of a flushing feeling over my entire body.  Had to go to E.R. with the flushing, nausea and found out that my blood pressure was extremely high.  Was told to discontinue the Mobic as everything else check-out o.k.  I would definitely NOT recommend this drug.  Still have headache but not taking it again.  Would like to know if anyone else experienced the flushing (hot) sensations.

He said that i should not go by what was said about the drug and try it because ya/all were full of crap. So i said ok i will give it a try. I was  given ultram with it and flexeril.I took it for 3 weeks 7.5 1/a day.I was not feeling right. I had diareha ,nausea,swelling in my hands,ankles,allergy symptoms,and it did nothing for the pain if i did not take the ultram too. I stopped taking it as it was doing nothing for me,and all the other problems stopped too. I did not even think it was the mobic. I was back in the ER again,and was seen by a PA,that listened to me and seen what the DR had given me and said that she was going to fix me up this time and gave robaxin,lor-tab 7.5 with a low dose of acetaminophen. I have no med ins and can't work due to my back,so i have money to see a reg-DR.I am so glad that i came back here to see all the pros and cons. I am glad to hear it works for some,but i will stick to the tried and true narcotic drugs when taken right that work for me.

The doctor prescribed Mobic for treatment before and after surgery. I took Mobic for a month before surgery and it did not relieve my pain at all.  I found that I was also becoming nauseous when taking it so I stopped.  After surgery, I did not resume taking it until a few days ago (it's been 2 months since surgery and I still have pain).  I started taking the Mobic again and this time as of right now, my legs are so swollen they are about 3 times their normal size.  Personally , it has scared me to death to have my legs so swollen .  After reading other reviews here, I made up my mind never to take this medication again.  I'm throwing the remaining pills out.  The doctor never told me this was a side effect and neither did the pharmacist.  I had to come here to find this side effect.  No more mobic!

I have been on the medication for 2 months now. Only side effects are a bit of an upset stomach now and then and my mouth and lips have been itchy and sometimes swollen. I take 15mg a day. I love Mobic but may take a week off and take Ibuprofin and see if the side effects go away. If so then I will use Mobic not as often. Over all I can't complain and have loved the mobility I have now.

However, prior to taking the medication (generic for Mobic) I had worked hard for 1.5 years to lose 30 pounds.  After 2.5 weeks on the drug, I have gained 12 pounds total.  I am hoping it is fluid retention.  I plan to quit taking the drug and hope the heel pain and inflammation does not return.

I'm sorry to hear about the awful things that have happened to others, but really people - ALL medications have side effects!  ALL medications have horror stories!  The same thing can happen to you taking ASPIRIN!!!Here are some side effects of one particular substance:   headache, personality changes, changes in behavior, confusion, irritability, and drowsiness, difficulty breathing during exertion, muscle weakness, twitching, or cramping, nausea, vomiting, thirst, and a dulled ability to perceive and interpret sensory information, bradycardia,seizures, brain damage, coma or death.Guess what substance this is?  WATER.  This is what happens to you when you take in too much WATER.Instead of telling people to AVOID MOBIC AT ALL COSTS because of your horrible experience, how about encouraging people to ensure they are properly consulting with their doctors, properly monitoring their own reaction to the drug, etc???  Why deprive people of potentially life-changing improvement of their condition, only because YOU had a horrible experience, when in fact ALL DRUGS can have adverse reactions in a small percentage of people, up to and including death?

I have osteoarthritis pain and stiffness, which is progressing into rheumatoid arthritis.  I also take a pill which mediates the stomach problems discussed by others.  I am always concerned about long term effects, and am going to limit my use to only times when I feel I need it.  I think it is a miracle drug..

I only took one dosage and within 30 minutes I began to react to the medication. I called my doctors office and was suggested to go to urgent care. It took me approximately two weeks to recover. I still have ringing in my ears but the pressure in my head and body has subsided quite a bit. I have been referred to an allergist for testing and hope will find out in couple of weeks why i had such a reaction. I was prescribe this medication because was experiencing severe need pain and had difficulty walking. the symtoms began with head pressure, ringing of the ears.I always read the medicine information but this time i read it after i took the dosage.I became even more concerned when I read to contact my doctor immediately if I began to experience ringing in the ears and pressure. I also experience hot flashes shortness of breath, pressure on my shoulders and chest. Even after being given benadryl and two treatments of saline that night, the next day i was experiencing body numbness througout my arms and legs, weakness, vision, dizziness, head and neck pain. I went to see my doctor and was given another injection of benadryl, then prescribed methylprednisoline six day treatment along with benadryl. Well, I am thankful I am still here today but it was a scary situation especially looking at myself in the mirror looking pail white will puffy eyes tearfully wandering when the effects would subside. Hopefully the lab results will showed what went wrong with the medication and whymy body reacted the way it did. Hopefully the ringing in my ears will soon be resolved. God Bless..

I could tell if I didn't take it, the pain was almost unbearable, but I also had to take ibuprofen to get enough relief to sleep. I only take it because the neurologist said it is easier on the stomach than OTC anti-inflmmatories, but it is not much more effective and seems to wear off before the 24 hours it is supposed to work. I had to take something else in the morning while I took this in the evening along with some other type of pain reliever.

I fell and hurt my right knee, because of that I was walking funny and the pinched nerve in my back started bothering me, because of the way I was walking my hip was effected which caused pain in my upper leg.  So far so good, on my third day and the pain is GONE!  I am hoping that after two weeks of walking normally without pain I can stop the medication (I hate to be on meds) for good. I am willing to give it the two weeks because the pain was so bad.  I was walking like I was 80 instead of 57.  I do HAVE to take it with food!

I did manage to gain 10 lbs in the month that I was taking it. I also managed to start having moderate to severe stomach pain, and a week after that shortness of breathe and chest pain approximatley 2 weeks after I quit taking it. In the process now of going thru test to get a proper diagnosis, dr is leaning toward Gallstones. Can't for the life of me figure out why my dr put me on this medication with my medical history of Asthma, diverticulitus, and IBS. I guess there is no need to complain now the damage has already been done, I NOW REED ALL OF THE HEALTH INFORMATION THAT COMES WITH MEDICATIONS, EVEN IF I HAVE TAKEN THEM BEFORE.

For the first several years it was a lifesaver.  I then began to develop severe diherea but no other symptoms or problems. I continued Mobic but at a reduced dose. After eight years I still take the Mobic, still get diaherea, but still get the benefits.  I now take 2mg once a week which gives me a lot of relief for three days.  I then have 3-4 hours of diaherra.  I wait for 4 days to let my system clear and then take the next dose.Mobic effects different people different ways.  It's not for everyone.  But it has allowed me to work at a high level and to enjoy the last several years.  So far there is no indication of other complications and while I don't like the diahera (and doubt it's doing me any good) the relief has been worth the risk

I have had 2 knee scopes, intermediate+ psoratic arthritis, and spurring in the spinal cord due to a neck injury.  I understand an NSAID is supposed to reduce inflammation of joints, but I have not noticed any difference since starting to take it.  I am planning on asking my doctor if this is a placebo on my next visit.  If it helps some folks, that's a positive, but it has done nothing for me, however- it might explain the stomach and disgestive issues I've been having.

Initially, I found it hard on the stomach, causing heartburn but, I have found that when I take with a meal I have no side effects. When I cannot take with a full meal, I am able to avoid heartburn by taking an antacid. I have taken this drug for approximately one month and am very satisfied with it and with my doctor for prescribing it. At this time, I have found no other side effects and am still ecstatic about the amazing reduction in pain that other NSAIDs were not able to control.

I stopped taking it because all my joint pain was gone, the side effects stopped but my joint pain slowly came back within a month to the point where I could not function so I started using it again by cutting the pills (7.5) in half, the side effects were reduced to a tolerable level and most of the joint pain went away enough so I could function and sleep again.  I have tried other medications and they did not take the pain away like this does so it may be a matter of getting the dosage right for you.

However, I began to have more sever leg &amp; feet cramps/spasms about 1 wk into taking this med.  I ended up taking 6 advils per day on top of the Mobic so I just stopped the mobic &amp; got iimmediate relief from the spasms.

The drug has worked extremely well for the intended use, well enough that I stopped taking it for almost a year.  The symptoms gradually returned over time to the point I started taking Mobic again, and that's when I noticed the side effects - bloating with weight gain, and swelling in the extremities (I actually had to take off my wedding ring last week).  I had been struggling with weight control over the last few years and during the time I was off Mobic I was losing it at a fairly satisfatory rate.  After I started taking it again, my weight jumped back up after only a week of taking it.  I really like how it controls the pain but I'm going to have to be a little more careful in how I balance the pain management with my weight management now that I've made the link.

I can do every day things and am now playing golf again. I noticed a difference on day one. I've told my doctor that this is a wonder drug. The only downfall is that I get a little upset stomach when I take it, but it's worth it.

Just about pain free now, but since I have a lot of damage I dont think it would last long.  But for now it is the BEST drug I have tried, &amp; I have had quite a few for pain--i.e-Bextra, Celebrex, Daypro, Ibuprofin, Naproxin, &amp; now this. Noticed a big difference by day 2 of 1st started taking it, so I am pleased. Wonder now I need my knee replaced after all, but the xrays show bone-on-bone &amp; NO cartledge left so guess would have to get it done sometime. Plus I know if I dont take it by 2 days later I could not walk, get up or do anything. So this works for me at this time, but not sure how long I will continue to get relief from it, but it is buying me time &amp; w/ a LOT less pain, swelling &amp; etc.

I was given this RX by my GP and specifically asked him if there were contraindications, to which he reported none!  Nothing could have been further from the truth.  I began experiencing what I thought was severe indigestion so scheduled an endoscopy with my Gastro.  I have MANY ulcers both in the esophogus and stomach which he feels were caused or aggrevated by this drug.  He also told me to stop taking aspirin at this time.  Perhaps we all need to study EVERY prescription that is given us to prevent damage to our bodies that we are attempting to keep healthy.

I have had several hip surgeries and had to go to the emergency room to make sure there were no blood clots.  Still not over the whole mess!  Dr. did not ever ask me about any kind of heart problems or blood pressure issues and he never did want to see me in his office.  Barnes Hospital in St Louis MO Dr. Barrack's Office prescribed this medicine.  Now have prescribed a gel, but have decided not to take or get the gel. Very bad experience with drug and dr's office was not concerned enough to want to see me.

I have taken most of the other anti-inflamitories and they over time cause stomach issues. Mobic actually helps me within 24 hrs of using it. Its easy on the tummy and helps ALOT.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	25-34	12/10/2009 5:59:57 AM	I started taking Mobic, soon after it was prescribed for my right knee. On day 1, I found my self falling asleep in the car after I arrived to work. I stopped taking it in the morning, to see if it was just that I was already tired. Started taking it when I was on my lunch break, found myself falling asleep on the couch at home. Needless to say, I stopped taking it all together, in fear of thinking I was &quot;ok&quot; to drive and passing out at the wheel. The pain and swelling in my knee isnt as severe now as it was when I first started taking Mobic, but my knee still hurts when I stand for extended periods of time. For the most part, the side effects aren't really worth it for me at least. I don't need someone to call my mother because I had taken a prescribed medication and have to tell her that I fell asleep at the wheel. Isn't that just as bad as getting behind the wheel drunk? Sorry, about the depressing moment everyone. I have to say that I did feel more depressed when I was taking the medication than I do now.

Having reached the stage where I had stopped taking Ibuprofen due to the fuzzy state of my head, not knowing where the pain was really coming from, also the fact that after weeks of not taking the dugs I did not feel any worse that when on the drug, but did feel better because I felt that I was beginning to take control of the situation.  Meloxicam 15mg has been sufficient to reduce the pain and apparent inflammation in the smaller bones of the hands and feet but not quite the same effects on the knees hips and shoulders. General well-being has improved greatly and I hope that this continues, close monitoring will ensure that I do not slip into complacency. My Rheumatologist says that he doesn't know what causes it and my Orthopaedic Consultant say, &quot;If you walk in here, then you don't need me&quot;. I want to know and I want to work on curing it!

I found it difficult to work and couldnt play sport. Taking Mobic has relieved my symptoms so i can live a normal life. However this drug can have serious side effects so ensure you read the directions and know the warning signs. I didnt read them properly and was accidently overdosing. Because the side effects did not seem to surface for some time, i didnt realize that the side effects were related to the drugs. At first i got serious abdominal pains and lost my appetite then a couple of days later i had pain in the centre of my chest. I then had trouble breathing and got headaches and blurred vision. Taking Aspirin for my headaches only made my symptoms more acute. I had to take myself down to the emergency hospital for treatment. The only comfort i could get was by lying down on my back. Once i found out the problem and stopped both the Mobic and Aspirin, i started to feel better within a couple of days. I am still going to take the Mobic but i am now a strong believer of taking as little as possible (less than that subcribed if possible). I ALSO READ ALL THE INTRUCTIONS AND WARNINGS NOW 
Other	Ally, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	35-44	9/10/2009 1:01:28 AM	The Dr. said this was a good medication to take as opposed to a regular anti-inflammatory ie: Ibuprofen, Naproxen... because of the stomach upset they can cause.

I am not satisefied with mobic &amp; I believe it will soon go the same way that some of the other joint medicines &amp; get pulled off the market for compounding &amp; or creating other health problems in the people that use it.

I had 2 strained muscles after being in a car accident where I was hit from behind.  The medicine definitely helped to reduce the pain and swelling within 2 days.  There are some side effects, such as my reflux being worse, lightheadedness, and tiredness.  These are all minor and so far not enough to stop me from using it.

This drug has not really helped me. I still have to supplement tyelenol especially at night. The worst part is the severe reflux. I experience it even if i eat before taking it. I can't take it daily because of this and assume that is partly why it is not staying in my system.

I will be having a knee replacement in the future. Mobic has helped with the stiffness that I would have especially in the a.m. It has also helped with the achy nagging feeling that I would have all day. I can bend my knee easier and can walk a little longer without the achy and stiffness returning. I am very pleased my Ortho Surgeon chose this medication. I have not experienced any of the side effects since using this medication. Thank you.

Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/15/2009 3:59:01 PM	I have shoulder impingement and this was prescribed to me after I told the doctor that the pain was so bad that loratab would do nothing to help the pain.  This medicine was a waste of money.  It did nothing for the pain and made me very sick to my stomach.  I stopped taking the medication after one day.  Unfortunately, the one medicine that does manage my pain well the doctor does not want to perscribe to me because it can be habit forming, which is meprozine.  i can take one of those at night and have the pain controlled for up to two days.  But he would rather prescribed loratab that I take more than the prescribed dosage to get any relief.  Go figure?

It isn't as swollen, or as stiff, and I have more mobility when standing up after sitting for a period of time.  I do experience a minute or two of mild dizziness soon after taking the pill, but it goes away almost before I can say &quot;Gee, I am dizzy.&quot;  If this drug continues to work as well as it has so far, I will be VERY pleased.

Still on the Mobic to help with pain control from gout developed last year. If it helps, I can't tell as I hurt still. Also it causes my blood pressure to go up requiring medication to lower that. The medication for the blood pressure causes gout which requires more medications. Planning to quit the Mobic as it's not doing enough to warrant my continuing to take it. More damage then good.

When I decided on my own to quit taking the Meloxicam, all the symptoms went away, except for the a-fib. The doctor prescribing this med should inform his patients of the possible side effects and warn them to call him immediately if they experience any of them. Also, other doctors should consider the meds a person is on when they are looking at a potential problem.

It even seems to delay my next attack and I, therefore, take it only when needed, not every day.  Even this occasional use of the drug is most effective.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	4/7/2008 12:56:50 PM	I was prescribed Mobic after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. I had had total knee replacement three months prior to the accident. My replacement knee was doing fabulous, no pain, etc. The accident jostled the replacement knee and since then pain and swelling daily. Doc said accident would set back my replacement recovery a bit but its worse than ever and was prescribed Mobic. I got severe nausea and horrible headaches so after three weeks of trying it once a day with no relief I have stopped taking it.

After I rolled in pain for 3 months, my doctor prescribed Mobic.  I rolled another month before actually taking.  I took it for 3 days and felt relief and was able to get a good night sleep.  I only take Mobic (or any other medication) as needed.  When my pain is too severe for me, I take the Mobic. I haven't seen any side effects to taking Mobic. But I may only take it once a month or so.

After the operation in 12/06 went to rehab for 2 mos. but never felt like the ops improved my condition&gt; I got depressed, stopped excercising and gained 100 lbs, even worse for the knee. Changed Drs had MRI doen with my current Dr and he suggested i take Mobic 15mgs. I couldn't get my butt off chair without feeling excruciating pain, now I can work out and move around relatively pain-free. The only side effect thus far is stomach gas. So far I've lost 15 lbs in 3 weeks and can't tell you what a boost mentally that is. I don't take it everyday, maybe everyother day or so. It still works.

It worked wonderful for the pain I had in my rotator cuff and neck.  The inflamaion still had not decreased that much, but I am loving not having the pain.  My problem is that now I have broke out in a severe rash!  My hands and head only, are covered in what looks like hives and they itch uncontrolably.  I will stop taking the medication and discuss with my doctor about an alternative.

At first this did not work for the stiffness. It took about 3 months for it to finally work so I could walk steps normally.  The knee was the joint that hurt the most and what I most complained about but noticed it took care of all my other arthritis.  I have been on it for almost a year now.  When on a maintenance drug blood is taken every 3 months to make sure the liver/stomach/intestines are not being effected.  Taking a 15mg tablet once a day is much better than taking the otc ibuprofen every 4-6hours and not getting continuous relief. I am happy with the drug.

Obviously it's an anti-inflammatory and I didn't have inflammation, but while I was on it, we didn't know this. So, basically it does not work for neuropathical pain. If a doctor wants tries you on it, give it a chance to see it it works, but if you know you have Fibromyalgia, it may not work.

Suffered from knee and shoulder pain due to osteoarthritis; also, heel spurs, plantar fasciitis, and bunions.  LOTS of pain, daily.  I was eating OTC ibuprofen like it was candy, with little to no relief.  Mobic has been a Godsend!  I now function with minimal discomfort.  I do notice that I bruise easier, and I had an episode of rectal bleeding that lasted about 3 days (almost a year ago), but I will not give up the Mobic.  I don't EVER want to hurt like that again. It has given me back a quality of life that I thought I'd never have again.  I take care of my two grandchildren now, and I would not be able to do that if not for this medication.  I am grateful.

My Doctor thoughtthis would be helpful. It hasn't helped me and I've noticed that I bruise very easilynow. I'll stick with my other meds.

I was overjoyed when they made it available in generic, it has helped me more than words can express here. Before it was generic, I had a hard time affording it, but when I discontinued it, I could hardly walk. So, as you can see it, it has has improved my life considerably.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/24/2007 9:32:03 AM	I was taking this for sciatica.  For the first 3 days of treatment I needed a narcotic pain reliever w/the Mobic.  After 3 days it started working.  My pain was almost completely eliminated! After a few more days, I was completely pain-free.  I stayed on the Mobic for 1 month.  Now I take it at the first sign my sciatica is coming back, and I don't need any pain medications.

I have had three knee surgeries in the past 15 years. With the combination of surgery, mobic, and lubricant injections into the knee joint, I am able to avoid a partial knee replacement for a few more years.

I work as a manager in a restaurant/coffee shop and I do alot of physical lifting. My body finally had enough and the joints in my arms became very painful nothing over the counter seemed too help,so I went to the doctor and he prescibed Mobie. I was patient enough too wait for its effect but after a couple of days it kicked in. I still have to be careful and pace myself but now I don't have too worry about finding another job.
