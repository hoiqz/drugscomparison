Doesn't satisfactorly eliminate PVCs used alone. Together they work great. I take 75mg 2x daily with 200mg amiodarone 2x daily to eliminate PVCs while resting and quick return to normal with light exercise.  Tinitis worse.  Some anxiety attacks particularly at night. Easily fatigued. BP  145/70 avg.  Heart rate 45-55. Amiodarone has potentially worse side effects.

I am presently on 4 medications including Metoprolol Succ. 200 mg. daily.  Since taking this medication I have had consistent dry eyes and dry mouth but just recently I have developed whizzing and night cough.  One week ago I developed severe itching, rash, sores and now hives.  My husband was on the same medication at a much lower dose (20mg.) and developed the same rash and hives.  Our Internist told him it was not related to the medication and sent him to a Dermatologist who performed a biopsy of one of the lesions and Voila it was an allergy to the Metoprolol.  Once he stopped taking the drug the rash, hives, sores and itching are gone.  I know my doctor won't believe me when I tell him (and show him) that I have the same symptoms.  Now what?

I had an undiagnosed problem over a year ago, and after dicovering it, my medications were changed, to different doses of each. Earlier this month I began to feel a racing in my heart, and when I would a mild workout, my heart rate would go up greatly. My medications were just teaked a bit, down on one and up on the other, and I have never felt better. It is a little scary that I was walking around for who knows how longer before this was initialling found. I had also been treated for high blood pressure, but the rest??

Dr. prescribed this med during a recent A-Fib attack in addition to what I am already taking (Multaq for A-Fib and Amlod/Benazp for HBP).  After 3days of taking Metropolol (25mg/day) I experienced chest tightness, pressure and slight heart pain, also drop in heart rate to low 40's. The idea was to lower heart rate while in A-Fib but also to continue for prevention ?.  I took myself off this med after only 5 days before my body gets saturated with it and stopping becomes dangerous. I am still taking my other meds and after stopping Metropolol, the adverse symptoms dissapeared and I feel fine.

Other	dchrgil, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	2	2	Female	55-64	9/25/2011 7:53:06 AM	Angina attack resulted in 2 angioplasties and a stent. I had no heart damage. I smoked a pack a day. Normal blood pressure - always. Quit smoking cold turkey with a 20 lb weight gain in a year - first 6 months no weight gain. I haven't slept well in a year. I wake up almost hourly. Repeatedly have told cardiologist and my osteopath. I am tired all the time. Angry and testy. Now depressed. I asked my doctor why am I on this when I've never had HBP? A protective approach to heart care. I said you need to listen to me and the cardiologist needs to listen to me. I do not sleep well at all. It is affecting every aspect of my life. I am depressed and I need to get quality sleep. I am short tempered, spacey, tired all the time. I ride my bike as frequently to work as I can 4 miles a day. I was hit by a car while riding this summer and still ride the bike - a little scarey at this point. My osteopath said she will see talk with the cardiologist and see if they can come up with a game plain. I will start on a metabolic diet in a week. Maybe with a loss of weight I will get off this medication.

Started at 100mg but was moved to 200.  At that level it controlled my BP very well with consistent readings of 120-125 over 69-72 &amp; pulse of 69.  Dr. added Benicar HCT 40/12.5 to get ride of ankle/feet swelling.  No change in diet required other than to be reasonable.However, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes about a year ago, so I started taking Metformin 500 mg.  Needed to increase that to 1000mg--taken after dinner.  Diabetes is under control but the Metformin has raised my BP dramatically so Lisinopril has also been added.  The best we've able to do is readings of 137/52 fairly consistently but at times is in the 140s with bottom # still in 50s.  Top # just won't come under control. My cholestrol went through the roof as did my triglycerides--all bec. of the Metformin &amp; diabetes.  We've now added Tricor and Pravastatin to control these two new conditions which helped.  I'm frustrated bec. all these new health problems have come about bec. of the diabetes and Metformin.  I don't know what to do.  It's very depressing.  Maybe all the medications contribute to that.  It's hard to tell.

Other	hannah, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		12/3/2010 11:19:08 AM	Have pacemaker, cardiologist said there showed a glitch in the heart rhythm on 2 occasions.  Switched from Cardura to Metoprolol.  Advised doctor that because of allergies, I cannot take generics. He insisted that I start with it, and could switch to Brand if a problem.  11 days into starting it, muscle pain, joint pain, went from driving car to walking with walker and assistance.  Could not sleep at night, had violent dreams, woke up feeling distressed.  Switched to Brand name Toprol XL, after 5 days symptoms were worse. Legs had reduced in size about 1/4. Muscle pain getting worse. Went back to doctor, he took me off by halving the tablet for several days, then started back on Cardura.  I have researched the fillers used in drugs that I have had problems with, and am convinced that the fillers are the main problems for me.  Once I get this out of my system, I might try the Brand Toprol XL again.  For right now, I'm trying to get back on my feet and be able to drive and start walking again.  Still have a lot of pain. I've been told that there is no difference in generic and Brand by doctors, nurses, pharmacists.  All one needs to do is get the ingredients in generics and Brand, and compare the two.  You may have allergies to fillers in generics.

This is an outrage.  I  contacted the pharmacutical company , received no answers to my question such as &quot;is this side effect reversible?&quot;  Will my hair ever grow back?  Who can answer this question from patients?  Don't we have the right to receive an answer? This is not life threatening...but it is pathetic.

Started with one 25mg pill a day, then a pill and a half, and now I'm up to two pills.  That seems to be controlling the irreg hb and my bp is good.  Main side effect is I sweat like a pig all day long, which I didn't do before starting on it.  I also am not sleeping as well now that I'm up to 50mg a day.  The other side effect is weird dreams.  They aren't nightmares, just weird stuff.  I'm gaining weight too.  Will talk with my dr at my appt this month, but I was wondering if anyone else had the sweating issue, and if so what did they do about it?  Although I can make it through the day at work ok, it is a little embarassing sometimes to break out into a heavy sweat for no reason.

High Blood Pressure	villagesgal, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	10/14/2010 9:27:50 AM	I took this drug for only 4 days.  I had such mental confusion from it that I couldn't even think straight.  This went away immediately upon stopping the drug.I also experienced a constant mild headache, flushing of my face and neck and loss of sexual pleasure.  I called my doctor after reading that mental confusion was a severe side effect and noticed that it was getting worse after each passing day.I am now taking Norvasc which lowers my blood pressure better than metoporal did and I seem to have no side effects.  After reading about all the other people who have had problems with this drug I don't know why doctors still prescribe it other than the fact that it's cheap.Watch yourself very carefully for side effects when taking this drug.  Be aware and be careful.  There are lots of other drugs out there that also lower your blood pressure and are much safer to take.

This medication was supposed to help prevent heart disease, but tests prior to this medication show my heart was just fine.  I prefer to take Omega 3 from Krill Oil and CoQ10.

Very evvective keeping my BP and heart rate normal. (115/70 hr70) The side effects are terrible. Blurred vision, twitching muscles,tightness in chest and tired all the time. I hate to say anything to my doctor because the meds are working and I dont want to have to go through trying to find another drug to keep my heart rate down. Weight gain is another side effect that i forgot to mention. (20lbs) I don't know what to do? I take 25mg twice daily along with 40mg of Lisinopril.
Other	RAAF, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	6/9/2010 12:14:51 PM	Prescribed after mitral valve repair surgery 3/31/10 to control BP and HR during healing. 25mg twice a day.  BP is now typically 90s/60s, HR 75-90.  Frequent (every couple of days or so) visual side effects - &quot;fireflies,&quot; wavelike distortions, flashing &quot;ferris wheel&quot;, &quot;dark curtain&quot; type effects, usually one eye at a time; have had occasional tingling/numbness in two or three fingers on either hand, occasional light-headedness - figuring these effects will go away upon discontinuing the drug after 3 months.  Have also read the effects may be related to heart-lung machine...but they fit the side-effect description for this drug.

My BP before taking this was usually around 125/85 and is now averaging 110/75.  Heart rate was around 75-80 and is now 55-65 , however, the PVC's are only slightly better.  My Dr. suggests doubling the dose but I don't like the idea as I don't want BP and heart rate too low and I am happy I don't have any side effects at all.  Can't split the pill but pharmacist suggesting switching to the non extended release version and take 2x a day.  Says it may be absorbed better instead of having to double the dose.  Any body ever take the non ER pill?

I Googled the drug manufacturer, and found that the FDA had recalled not only their generic Toprol, but ALL the generic brands on the market.  I faxed this information to my then-cardiologist, who was completely unaware of the recall.  This was back in the late summer/fall of 2008.  I switched to name brand, and feel 1,000% better.  We have to do our research ourselves, on the drug and on the drug manufacturers, since all generics are not safe or made as well as the name brands.

Been having slight diarrhea, a little tingling in my hands and sinus drainage, mood is down. Overall, my BP has been excellent, below 120/80, average 116/75. I'm taking 25mg, 1 time a day. I was diagnosed in the prehypertention stage and my goal is to drop weight, eliminate stress, and change my eating habits to focus on my salt intake. I hate taking meds and would rather change my lifestyle, meds come with too many side effects that slow me down.
High Blood Pressure	cpnlover, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/18/2010 10:30:06 AM	I went online to research the side effects and found many people taking this medication have similar side effects, and am asking my doctor to switch me off of it. About 1 week ago I started taking 50 mg time released formula everynight for high bp 160/100.  I began to notice a single slight pinch type feeling in my upper chest area about 15-30 minutes after taking it, along with a feeling of fullness in chest around bra strap thought it was my bra being to tight but when I paid attention several days times later it was shortness of breath which remined me of how I felt when I had phnuemonia (sp?) a long time ago I didnt pay either much attention, until I also noticed occassional blurred vision when eatting supper, got up next morning my leg muscle ached like I'd run a marthanon without any excercise. Since starting this medication I havent had a good nights sleep I  found myself laying awake at night unable to go to sleep although I was so sleepy I couldn't hold my eyes open, until I got into bed. I also have noticed my facial skin especially cheeks,chin, although I use lotions scalp and inside of ears are itchy dry and flakey reminds me of psorasis (sp?) I had as a child. Along with stuffy nose which seems to hit about the same time everyday. Last night when I couldnt sleep I got out my patient advisory sheet from the pharmacy and read about many of these symptoms and that to go off this medication it must be tapperedam calling doctor.

Any physical activity at all and i felt like i was going to pass out! My heart was also palpitating just every few minutes. I was SO SCARED i was gonna have a heart attack or worse. I am also an insulin dependant diabetic since I was 8. The drs put me through EVERY test in the book, holter monitors, lab work, ekg, echocardagrams, stress test and even a heart catherization in July of this year. They could not find ANYTHING wrong with my heart! My cardioligist said I had the heart of a 16 year old! I changed from a very active person to a couch potato because i was so scared something was going to happen to me! I developed severe panic attacks and depression and was afraid to be alone even for short periods of time. My blood pressure was also running high like 140 or 150 / 90's to 100's. They started me out on Diltiazem which did me absolutely NO good and caused me to feel very tired and sleepy all the time! Then they tried me on bystolic which i had an allergic reaction to and thought my throat was going to completely close up! Then they put me on Metaprolol 50mg tablets once in the morning. I have been on this pill since October. So far the ONLY side effect that I have is that my ankes are swelling pretty bad. It has dropped my blood pressure to like 117/60 or 70 and has dropped my pulse rate to like 70-80. It has also made my heart palpitations very few and far in between! I have NOTHING bad to say about this drug except that is has made my feet swell but I can deal with that verses living every day being petrified that something is gonna happen to me! I am supposed to go to my family dr. to probably get put on a low dose water pill for the swelling! This drug has REALLY helped me!

Amlodipiine, Lisinopril and this one Metoprolol.I am narrowing it down to this one right now because I have developed painful, swollon toes and feet, with some swelling of my ankles. I thought I had or have Gout. So Dr. put me on 2 other meds for Gout now. I am going back to the name brand to see if that has the same reaction on me. A close friend of mine also takes this med. and developed Gout in her ankle and couldn't walk. One day we were discusing our meds and we decided it might be the Generic side effects. So we did our own resurch and found these happenings between the both of us.

I don't like the constant tiredness and muscle aches when I do exercise. I've been on this medication for 3 months and I'm now gaining weight even though I'm continuing to exercise at the same rate. For the first 2 weeks after starting this medication I had horrible muscle spasming in my back, legs and arms, but this has stopped. After reading all of the previous comments I think it might be better to try naturopathic medicine. I can't stand being sleepy all the time, and if I keep gaining weight I'll have other problems to consider, which might require more medication use.

Lisinopril was so fantastic, and my doc is so convinced that my little cough which was already proven to be from asthma during the winter-so she won't let me have it anymore! Dumb. I'll change doctors and tell them I'm taking Lisinopril just to get what I need!  Plus, the cost of this is a $30.00 copay vs. the Lisinopril at $4.00 a month--who's kidding whom doc?  Are doctors getting big kick-backs for this drug? Hmmm?

After taking this medication I feel like I'm 1,000 times removed from myself - kind of like watching myself from miles away.  It makes it extremely difficult for me to focus &amp; concentrate at work (I have a very high-level position)and also wipes me out completely so that I'm nearly falling asleep at my desk.  It doesn't matter when I take it (morning, noon, night, whenever) I still experience the same thing.

I was put on this (25mg)in preparation for a esophogeal view of my heart valves.  I lost consciousness twice (no warning) and fainted once (warning) before a hospital stay after being on this drug for about a month.  (I had not studied the side effects or I would have gotten off of it earlier.) Two hospital specialists took me off of it as well as my cardiologist.  I am still recovering from the physical injuries that occurred in the last fainting.  I think for me this drug was dangerous!

It seemed more effective as far as being long-lasting at first, then soon lost that edge. Also after about a 2 month's use I began to have a distinct and annoying sour/metallic taste and a fuzzy-feeling tongue. I checked all other possibilities and finally reverted to the Atenolol, and the taste and feeling has gone away. I mentioned this side effect to my boss, who said that he has developed the same taste after being on Metoprelol for a while.

On my last refill, my pharmacy said there was a recall on this medication.  My doctor then prescribed Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg twice a day.  The medication gave me headaches, constant nausea, fatigue, and joint pains. Called my doctor for a new pill and I am now on Toprol XL (brand name not generic)50mg twice a day.  Still adjusting to this medication with some side effects but a tleast no nausea.  Pharmacy said sometimes it takes from two weeks to a month for your system to adjust.

I've used Metoprolol Succinate ER (25mg/1X/day) for years. Side effects:weight gain,weird dreams,and low energy level. I get my med's by mail from Express Scripts. Received a letter stating manufacture won't have med's available for many months. Told to have my MD send a script for a new drug. First, The mfg. has issued a recall on this med due to &quot;problems&quot; in quality control and mfg. standards. Google this med for full details. Sounds like this med was made in the peanut plant to me! Dr. has put me on Metoprolol Tartrate (50mg)AKA &quot;Lopressor&quot;.  I do not like what I've read about the side-effects.

High Blood Pressure	Disappointed09, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	3	3	Female	45-54	3/12/2009 2:47:08 PM	My doctor added Metoprolol Succ XL 50 MG as a second drup to my Diovan HCT 25 MG.  I was  feeling fine with the combination my blood pressure is controlled. Stress/anxiety/tiredness/lack of sleep sometimes contributes to a spike in my blood pressure. In the end of February 2009, Walgreens had a shortage of the drug.  Walgreens called my doctor that I will be getting Metoprolol Tartate 25MG which I have to take 2X a day. When my doctor's nurse called me of the change in the drug, I did not think anything about it. I picked up my Metoprolol Tartate 25MG from Walgreens and try to take 2X a day. The problem is taking the second pill. I take the first pill at 6:30AM by 3:00PM I am feeling tightness/discomfort on my left should all the way down to my arms.  I then take the second pill. The discomfort I am experiencing continues and my diastolic is way up 100. I ceased activity and rested but the discomfort continued. I called my doctor and she tells me to come in and get a stress test.  I was expecting she'll make the connection to the change of the drug - but NO. My doctor said there is nothing she can do because the drug is unavailable. I get a call from my doctor's nurse and instructed me to go to OSCO.  Sure enough only Walgreens supplier is having problems.  My problem here is this.  What is Walgreens Ethical Responsibility in telling Walgreens customers that the drug is available in other pharmacies.  What right does Walgreens have in making arrangements with the Doctor to change the drug just because Walgreens does not carry it anymore and does not know when they will have a supply available.  Could Walgreens have just said that the drug is not available at Walgreens but that the customer can check other pharmacies in the area?  My doctor is not even informed of the shortage/recall-etc. I had a bad experience with the change from Metoprolol Succ XL 50MG to Metoprolol Tartate 25MG in the 2weeks I was taking it. Physicians should be more informed of the drugs.

I in the gym 4 days/week (2 hrs per visit) and my weight seems to increase with each trip to my Dr.  Is this Beta blocker blocking my body's ability to get my heart rate into a &quot;training zone&quot; in order to allow me to lose weight?  Metoprolol may help blood pressure but increase in weight will cause other problems down the road.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	2/13/2009 12:26:02 AM	I was taking a generic form of this drug for over a year as a beta blocker for an irregular heartbeat.  The pharmacy's supplier changed generic companies, and I ended up with a different pill.  This pill caused massive side effects.  My shoulders started feeling as if there was a weight on them, and my large muscles in my body started feeling as if they were perminately cramped.  I had to stop taking it for three days, and the sysmptoms slowly subsided.  I called the pharmicists and explained what was happening. She filled my RX with the generic I'd been taking, and within two weeks my muscles are almost back to normal.  In short, if one generic causes a side effect... try another.  It may be fillers that cause the doseage to effect you differently no matter what the manufacturers say.  (A friend of mine had an allergic reaction to a generic of a medication she'd been on for three years.  They gave her the generic she'd been on, and she was FINE.  So much for there not being a difference in generics)

When the generic came out made by Par, I switched to that for 5 years. I recently moved &amp; had to get my prescription at CVS.  After picking it up, I called CVS to ask why the shape of the pill was now round instead of oval.  They said it was because it was made by a different manufacturer, Ethex.  After take the Ethex pill for 3 nights, I woke up in the middle of the 3rd night to go the bathroom, walked a few steps, got very dizzy and fainted.  I lost consciousness for maybe 2 seconds.  I hit my arm against my dresser &amp; my leg &amp; was black and blue for a couple of weeks.  I fell very softly.  I went back to sleep &amp; when I woke up in the morning, my blood pressure was 90 over 60, very low.  I then called CVS &amp; asked them about the Ethex pill.  He said it differers from the ones made by Par 'cause it has fillers.  I spoke to my pharmacist on Long Island where I had moved from &amp; he said that sometimes the fillers that are in some pills make the pills a bit more potent, &amp; if that's the case, I was taking more than 25 mgs. of the medicine.  CVS doesn't carry Par so now I had to go to another drug store &amp; since Par was on back order, I had to order the non-generic Torprol XL 25 &amp; pay a lot more.  I want to know why there isn't a warning on the Ethex drug.  I did research on line &amp; there are many Ethex drugs that are being pulled from shelves not by the FDA but by patients that have complained about them.Now I have 87 Motoprolol pills that can't bereturned.  I think something should be done about this to avoid future problems.  What would have happened if I were driving?Thank you!Laurie Shupack

Not only did this medication raise my BP to 200 over 110, but there were so many side effects that I became a different person.  I was severly depressed, cried for no reason, could not walk without being out of breath, my heart actually hurt, all I wanted to do was sleep.  However, when I woke up one day with burning in my chest like my inside was on fire, I knew it was time to get off of it.  I actually read reviews on this website and called my dr. immediately to tell her I was going off of this drug.  Do not let your physician put you on this medication!!

About 3 days out of the week I get a short, pulsing pain in the right forearm, underside of the forearm.  Lasts for a few minutes to about 10 minutes.  I called my doctor and he said to cut the pill in half and take 25 mg.  I read many reviews but no one had this symptom.  I have never, ever had a pain in my forearm before I got on this drug.  I don't like this drug.  I am supposed to call my doctor back in 4 days and give an update.  It did lower my blood pressure to the normal range but at what price?

I can only take 25mg as my blood pressure is already low so taking 50mg makes it too low. I feel like the medication may only be working a little but not working to the desire that my doctor or I want.  The doctor still wants me to stay on the medication. I also have been feeling tired but don't know if this is because of the medication.  I am only 29 and hope this condition doesn't weaken my heart or give me any other problems. :(

After my system became accustom to this med, I have had very few episodes of atrial fib.  No migranes either !!  Have had a little adema around my ankles.  No sexual side effects.  A little fatigue if I don't get a good night sleep.  Be patient, your body will adjust.As will any medication, some people cannot tolerate the side effects.  I have gained 15 pounds, and it's difficult to loose.  Being 50 years old doesn't help weight losseither, although it is still possible.  Ihave read that for some people the Toprol XLworks better for with fewer possible side effects.  Toprol XL is the brand name for the generic metoprolol.  It is more expensive and insurance companies may give resistance.  Overall, metoprolol has worked very well for me.

He also prescribed Lisinopril (had to stop due to extreme coughing) so he increased metoprolol to 2x daily.  I am tired, achy, but my BP is down to 123/84.  We will see what happens.  I'm hoping it wears off.

High Blood Pressure	jen, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	9/5/2008 3:06:59 AM	I began taking toprol xl 50mg 2yrs ago for high blood pressure and heart surgery.With toprol xl I had no problems other than being tired on occasion.then I went to pick up my prescription from Walgreens and they gave me metoprolol succinate 50mg.I am only 28 and I was so tired I couldn't wake up in the morning and would sleep through my alarm.After 7yrs at the same job with no problems I ended up quitting my job because if I didn't I was going to be fired.I was forgetting how to do things at work that I had done for the last 7years.Other times for example I would say drink a soda then go to reach for it and wonder where it was.I'd find it in the trash and I didn't even remember drinking it.I had a lot of memory problems.Not sure if this was because I was so tired or just another side effect.Then just a few days ago I went to walgreens to get my prescription and they replaced it with yet another generic a much larger pill.my pills say it is metoprolol succinate er 50mg mfg ethex.This pill is even worse.Now I also have headaches,dizzyness,light headedness,and after only 2days of taking it I have had severe diahreah and feel like i am going to throw up all the time.I also still experience the memory problems and tiredness just like the other metoprolol succinate. HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD WALGREENS GIVE THEM THIS VERSION OF THE PILL RECENTLY AND FEEL WORSE? I couldn't find any informatin about the new version anywhere on the net.

He subscriped this drug to slow the beat.  It has been successful in lowering my rate to about 82 beats per minute.  My blood pressure stays approx 135/70 as before the drug.  I have noticed a general loss of energy and just feeling bad when I take allegra for sinus with this drug.  No other side affects have been noticed. Previous to this drug, I had no side affects with taking allegra alone.

Started taking 25 mg Tabs with almost immediate results, I am currently much calmer, the anxiety/stress attacks have all but disappeared.  The only side effect is a slight dry cough which I've heard from everyone I know who takes BP meds that they all cause this.  I also experience tiredness, but the longer I take it, the better that gets.
High Blood Pressure		2	4	2			7/23/2008 2:35:21 PM	My insurance wanted me to switch to metoprolol (100 mg) from toprolol xl about 1 year ago. I am also taking Diovan HCT for HP. I lost 12 to 15 pounds on a diet in the last 4 weeks and as a result, I have experienced low HP, dizziness, and fainted twice (under stressful conditions). I saw my doctor today and he immediately reduced to dosage to 50 mg. I hope this solves my problems.

Overall, it's seems to be working well. BP still goes up &amp; down, but not nearly as high as it used to be. I'm also taking Benicar 40 mg. Worst side effect is being tired/lack of energy...plus it's made my ED problem worse.  It's just a &quot;trade-off&quot; I guess.

Since taking this drug, I have felt tired, depressed, anxious and my body ached all the time.  After 2 months, I began to lose my voice.  Went to an ENT, nothing wrong.  I asked if it could be the Toprol, he said no.  I decided to stop the pills.  Within a week, my bp 110/70 consistently and my voice is almost back.  I hated this pill and believe that he caused my pulse to go so low, that my bp went up to compensate.

BP immediately better, but ability to exercise and enjoy it severaly compromised.  Muscles ached when worked -- probably not enough oxygen to the working muscles.  We discontinued using it -- quality of life more enhanced by the exercise than by the BP improvement.

I was so tired just to walk from my car to the store.  I was so out of breath and I ached all over in my muscles in my arms, legs, shoulders.  After I stood still in store for a few minutes I was o.k.  This was happening everyday and only ok if sat still and did nothing.  Two days ago I accidently forgot to take my pill and went to work and found I was not having this symptom.  I have dry mouth at night, can not sleep, depression, sores all over body.  I feel this pill is not for me.  My Doctor ordered Toprol.  Is this Drug the same as just Toprol.  I did not have a problem when I took 25 mg of Toprol withouth the succinate.   Was this a mistake of the pharmacy to give me this drug from Walgreens on Dunlawton, in Port Orange, Florida.

Insurance switched it to Metoprolol SUCC ER.  I have gradually noticed my BP increasing and am having mild depression.  Yesterday, during an ENT appt. the nurse took my BP and it was 160/100.  I was shocked, and then I started my research.  My pharmacist said she has recently seen patients having problems with their BP increasing and had to go back to Toprol XL.  I am convinced that is my problem also.  This change occured over many months.  The pharmacist said the difference is in the &quot;binder&quot; they use for this drug. I will see my Doctor first thing Monday, to get me off this, and back on Toprol XL. It will take a letter/call from him to convince insurance the drug is failing me.

I hate this drug.  I'm going to ween off it, on 100 mg per day.  What good is it if my blood pressure is good but I can't do anything, and can't lose the weight.  All of these medications are worse than the disease.   I'm also having trouble with the generic brand.

During cardiac rehab my resting heart rate was in the low 100's. I have been taking 1/2 of 25 mg. for 1yr. hoping my heart rate would slow down as my heart healed. I have tried several times to not take it and noticed an uncomfortably high heart rate at rest. No problems with it except that I have not been able to lose 15 lbs. that I put on after surgery even though I have been watching my caloric intake and excercising with a personal trainer 3 times a week for 8 mo. I also hoped my energy level would have been a bit better by now. I am 48 and in perfect health otherwise. I will call my cardiologist and try hard to get off of it.I hope that does the trick because summer is coming.

High Blood Pressure	taaheatea, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	4	Female	45-54	4/12/2008 3:30:59 PM	I am on this medication for severe tachycardia and hypertention. My numbers read, Pulse:146, BP: 152/102. Since taking this, my hedaches are gone, my chest pain is gone and I feel calmer. I use to feel &quot;reved&quot;. I do have some nausea, but it doesn't last long. I was on it last summer and my doctor's did not tell me to decrease it slowly and in the heat of summer I had the potential of fainting. Well, that happened. When the bottle was empty, I did not know it was to be filled, my doctor was not monitoring me well enough, even though my BP's were through the roof. It caused me to go into severe tachycardia and arryrhytmia's. So BEWARE, be your own advocate. Talk to your pharmacisit, or look things up on Web MD. That was a too close of a call for me and I am only 46 years old.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	3/27/2008 1:32:17 PM	The generic versions of metoprolol are not the same as the branded Toprol XL.  The time release mechanism does not work properly, causing extreme fatigue cycling with chest palpitations, increased blood pressure, and headache.  All of these occured when I was switched from the genuine Toprol to the generic.  When I returned back to the Toprol, these severe side effects went away.  Please beware of the generic versions of metoprolol.

My husband had to rush me to the Hospital with very HBP...arritmia and very strong heartbeat...now I am back in tropol but after that my bp is out of control.

High Blood Pressure	MLW,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		1/28/2008 3:38:56 PM	Walgreens switched from Toprol XL 25 to Metroprolol succinate 25.  Within 20 minutes of taking had headaches, heart palpitations and sweating. Took the remaining 29 pills back and requested Toprol XL 25.  No problems since the switch.  This generic needs reviewed further because there are adverse side effects that are not present with Toprol XL.

High Blood Pressure	Lorena, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		1/24/2008 8:24:38 AM	2 days after my pharmacy replaced Tropol for Metoprol Succinate (reason they gave me was the insurance decition) I was at work and I starting having strong heartbeats and I was feeling and looking so bad that the rescue had to assist me at work...i continue with the medication but yesterday I took the pill at 19 am 1/2 hour after i felt terrible and my bp went up to 168/110.  This pill defenitly is not good at all. My doctor asked me to stop it inmediatly and today I have to see him.  One  of my co-workers told me that she is in tropol...when she tryed the Metoprorol Succinate started having arritmia and the doctor have to talk to her insurance to put her back in Tropol. So think about it before taking this medication...I don't want nobody to go thru this situacion.
High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	1/22/2008 10:26:09 PM	Walgreens switched my tropol for metoporol er...I don't know but it doesn't work the same. I think the ER should means eight release (hours) because the effect only last 8 hours on me. before the change i used to take half tablet of 25mg of tropol and I was doing good, now I'm taking the whole pill (25 mg) and i feel fatigue, tired...must be something wrong with this new metoporol...try not to switch....try to stay with the brand one.

Didn't realize it was this drug until I did some research...weaned myself off and told Dr I am NOT taking it anymore. I have no idea whether there were heart related benefits.  It was easy to take, but the side effects for me were unacceptable.

I was taking it for 3 months, complain of fatigue. Went back 3 months later (total of 6 months) complaining of fatigue again and he told me to cut the pills in 1/2. First three weeks and everything was fine, then this wknd. blood pressure was around 100/60 all wknd. He had told me it may be making my BP to low. Back to my old routine of feeling fatigue and just wanting to sleep on the couch after work nothing else. Going to call the Dr. in the morning to complain. That is why I went online here to check it out. Now, I see all these other people complaing of fatigue just reinfores what I felt all alone that the pills were negatively affecting me.

Angioplasty and a stint got me going again.  At this point it's been a month since I was put on metoprolol and I'm struggling with the side affects still.  Dizziness and tiredness still persist.  I'm hoping to get used this drug sooner rather than later.

Almost immediately I began having rapid heart beat and heart palpitations especialy at night.  My Dr thought I was having panic attacks, but I was positive it was the medicine.  Talked her into changing meds.  Now on Diovan which has been less syptomatic, but still have some reaction ( Diarheaa).  She tells me that all meds cause some reaction. But glad I am off Metoprolel.  Topryl XL was good but kept having to increase dose..

Other	IT hick, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	11/9/2007 9:18:37 AM	I was on ToprolXL for years, with no problems. The pharmacy changed me to this Rx and I began having depression, nightmares, heart palps at night and fatigue. I went to my doc; after several tests/screens/blood panels, my heart is within normal limits, my BP is normal, but because of the palps at night and the fatigue, he is switching me back to Toprol. He said the Met is metabolized differently than the Toprol which makes it less effective toward the end of each cycle.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/1/2007 11:43:25 AM	I was on toprol up until about a month ago when this generic brand.  I have non-stop severe itching on my shoulders only.  I couldn't figure out if it was something else I had changed, like detergent or lotions.  My eye lids also have been very irrated and red.  It finally dawned on me that ever since I changed to this generic brand that I have had these problems.  I'm calling my dr today to tell her that I want to go back to toprol and hopefully this itching and stinging will go away - it keeeps me awake at night.

I started having the same fatige problem I had several years ago with the standard Metoprolol. Also, I did not feel it was controling my BP thru a 24hr period. I went back to the Torpol XL and feel 100% better. I'm sure the ingrediants are the same but there is something different.Almost like the medication is releasing to quickly into the system.
