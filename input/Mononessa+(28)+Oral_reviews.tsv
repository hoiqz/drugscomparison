Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	Tania, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	7/20/2012 2:58:52 PM	I have changed birth control due to complications and was changed by the ER doctor to Mononessa in November. In January 2010 I received a DVT, in February 2010 I got a blood clot around the PICC line in my left arm while hospitalized again.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	13-18	7/11/2012 9:43:05 AM	I have been taking this for two months now and this is my 16th day on my period and the flow is outrageous. Also now the cramps are beginning to come back. Since i went on this for heaviness and cramping, this is NOT the pill for me.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	13-18	7/6/2012 3:15:29 PM	I have irregular periods so I went to my doctor and she prescribed me Monessa. Right now I am on the 2nd pack. During the first week of both packs, I felt really nauesous and weak. I even threw up a few times. But I called my doctor and she said it was normal and that it will take time to get use to it. Also, I feel just less outgoing and I have a lot of mood swings. Whenever I take this pill, I always have this weird taste in my mouth and my stomach just feels weird.My acne is just going out of control ever since I started taking it which was just a little more than a month ago. I also callled my doctor to ask about this and she said I will see results on my third pack. So right now I'm dealing with severe acne which is pretty much ruining my life. I hate it. It's never been this bad.Overall I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. It's just slowly ruining my life. :( I hope this helps!
Birth Control	Concerned, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/3/2012 11:31:40 PM	I have only been on this BC for two days and I already feel a difference. I have tender breats, I'm feeling depressed and irritable. I have cramps like I am on my period and not mention painful leg cramps. This BC is not for me.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Cindi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	7/2/2012 5:12:15 PM	I have only been taking this brand for about a week now and I am still bleeding. I noticed that I get upset easy now, it's just been a few days but my attitude has changed. I feel drained of energy and sleep more than normal. I'll keep taking this brand for a while to see if the benefits kick in. I have had abnormally long periods since I stopped taking a different brand over a year ago. The doctor said after a couple months things should be normal. 
Birth Control	aa2393, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	6/20/2012 2:39:27 AM	Mononessa has been great for birth control but awful for weight gain! I was on mononessa for nine months and gained twenty pounds. Within two weeks of stopping mononessa, I lost all of that weight. I've been taking mononessa again for about six months and again I've gained twenty pounds. After this last pack, I'm stopping and trying something else.
Birth Control	Marshall, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	13-18	6/11/2012 11:46:57 PM	After taking Mononessa for over a year now I'm pretty happy with the effectiveness. If you are someone searching for something to make your periods lighter I wouldn't suggest this pill because it never helped that for myself. As birth control tho it works very well and I've had no problems in that aspect. 
Acne	m999, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/11/2012 2:34:02 PM	I've been taking Mononessa for about 3 months. Having read the negative reviews this pill had, I was a little hesitant to start taking it (I switched over from Sprintec 28). The first month I did experience the more common side effects, however, once the second month rolled around those symptoms were gone. Some of the side effects I had were dizziness/lightheadedness, nausea and lack of appetite, and spotting (I've never spotted in my life). My gynecologist recommended this pill to treat my acne and the first month there were no breakouts but still some slight acne. In the following months I have had no breakouts, zits, pimples or anything. This works great, and it's very cheap so I highly recommend it.
Painful Periods	Allison, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	13-18	6/10/2012 1:37:15 AM	I switched to this birth control after Yaz failed to ease my period and cramp symptoms. I gained about ten pounds during my time on this birth control and found myself a lot angrier than usual. A lot of women complain about being more sad and depressed but on this birth control my anger went way out of hand which hurt my relationship with my boyfriend drastically. I gave it 8 months and my periods never grew lighter but my cramps did lessen to a degree. I'm a very heavy bleeder and was disappointed that the pill did nothing to ease or shorten the flow (my periods would last a little over a week). I still had cramps but only on the first day instead of 4. Everyone has different experiences and I'm happy for all the women who have had a positive experience with this birth control but unfortunately I wasn't one of them. I've recently switched to Generess Fe and love it! My relationship is back on a positive track and my period is already shorter and it's only been a month :)
Other	angie_tiffany, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	13-18	6/9/2012 7:06:37 PM	! i started to take this drug 2 months ago because of my heavy periods . at first i would take it in the Morning but it was too hard to keep up so i switched to at night . When i started this drug i felt very tired and out of everything and even depressed. I even stayed home from half of school because i felt so bad ! i didn't really understand why i was so tired because i am an active 14 year-old i should be bouncing off the walls !! i will say this BC helped my acne soooooooooo much !!!!!!!! i have practically clear skin ! even though i do get a random zit from time to time. that was i think the only positive thing about this pill even though i don't feel tired anymore, i have gained weight which is something that i would never do ..well i would but not this quickly !! and i fell bloated all the time and I'm always hungry ! and I've never craved anything in my life but starting this pill i would crave random sweets !! i didn't want to blame the pill on my weight gain which is around 5-8 pounds or so ,so i would blame it on my vegetarianism which i now find stupid i ever did because i been a vegetarian for over a year and i didn't gain weight and i started this pill and now I'm gaining a lot of weight ! even-though i exercise and watch what i eat i am going to stop this pill because it doesn't really help my period decrees and even-though I'm on a healthy/strict vegan diet my weight still is increasing 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	6/3/2012 5:06:02 PM	I have been taking Mononessa for over a year and very happy with it. I was very surprised to see so many negative reviews, but it just goes to show that everyone is different and you just have to try different pills until you find the one that is right for you. I started taking mononessa as its meant to help with acne. I have been on a lot of different pills that are meant to help but this has been the most effective. My skin is better now than it has ever been. Whether its the pill or whether i have finally grown out of acne at 31 I dont know!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	5/29/2012 1:54:56 PM	I've been on this pill for about 6 months and have not had a problem with it. I'm pretty sensitive to birth control pills but this one has been fine for me. No nausea, no weight gain, no lowered libido, no acne, etc.  
Birth Control	asdf, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/24/2012 7:43:15 PM	My nurse practitioner prescribed me Mononessa. I've been on Tri-Sprintec with no problems, but I don't know if its off the market now. After a month of using Mononessa I noticed leg swelling. It got worse after 3 months so I stopped using this bc. My legs still swell after on this medication. I've visited doctors and I don't have any blood clots, but my period became heavier and my legs still swell. I'm going to try OTCLO to see if I can regulate my heavy period. I wish I never tried Mononessa. I've been miserable with my legs ever since.
Birth Control	ak047, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	5/24/2012 4:47:29 AM	DO NOT TAKE THIS! My doctor switched me from Trinessa to Mononessa 6 months ago and it was the worst mistake of my life. I was on trinessa for almost 5 years and had absolutely no problem with it, she just wanted me to try mononessa. The first 3 months after switching I did not notice any side effects. But after those 3 months it was as if I became a monster. I felt like I wasn't me anymore. The side effects I have been experiencing are EXTREME mood swings, symptoms of depression, tightness of my chest, tiredness, night terrors, insomnia, nausea, horrendous cramps, feelings of being pregnant, irritability, headaches, and not being able to enjoy anything I use to. At first I just thought I was going crazy.. But after researching all my symptoms it led me to this sight. And from reading bad review after review everything just clicked. I would never in a million years recommend this pill to anyone. It seems to be causing more harm than good. I'm usually a happy and bubbly person but since being on this it has made the people that love me not want to be around me.
Birth Control	anonymous, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/22/2012 2:49:14 PM	My doctor switched me from TriNessa to MonoNessa after I became pregnant and miscarried while taking the Trinessa. Prior to having my child, I took Ortho TriCyclen for 10 years and never had a single problem. The MonoNessa has been nothing but bad news for me. It has caused acne on my face and body, body hair, night sweats, and migraines the day I start my period every month. I'd never had a migraine in my life until starting MonoNessa. This stuff is awful and I wish they'd take it off the market.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/20/2012 12:42:30 AM	The first few days I was nauseated, then switched to taking the pill at night instead of in the morning and that helped.  The first 2 cycles I was a little nauseated the first day on the hormone pill after the week of placebos, but now that seems to have gone away.  I guess my body adjusted. 
Other	anonymous, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/16/2012 11:18:35 PM	Works perfect, basically no problems with side effects. 1st time on any pill, i'm highly satisfied
Acne	raynerissa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	5/16/2012 2:55:13 PM	Apart from doing its job as a contraceptive this drugs has given me a more negative result than positive i have been on it for 5 months and I've experienced nausea, acne breakouts at intervals, depression, bloating and not to mention constant fatigue...I've hate this birth control...its better i continue using condoms or nothing at all..

Birth Control	hibiscushopper, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	35-44	4/30/2012 3:25:36 PM	I have PCOS and never get my cycle, but wanted to have a birth control option just to be safe once starting a sexual relationship.  I had a very heavy period that started a week before it should have and lasted until a couple days of taking the new pack!  It was horrible!  I contacted my doctor who said she assumed my next cycle would be light and that it will take a while for my body to adjust.  I have found myself more irritable with a shorter fuse as of late.  Also quick to change emotions - happy to sad in a short time span.  Also, like others noted, more tired.  I hope things do calm down as I am not feeling all that great.    
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	19-24	4/26/2012 3:14:24 PM	Never had problems with my skin until i started taking this pill. When I began taking this pill i was getting nauseous every night for about the first 2 months. No other pill i was on every did this. The worst part is the acne. I am 24 and never had problems with my skin until i began taking this pill. I broke out sooo bad. I was getting huge red blotches on my cheeks and allover my face. It has been awful.. I am definitely switching pills.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	4/21/2012 10:45:58 AM	I'm a pretty active person in general and since my switch from Yaz to MonoNessa, I've gained about 7 consistent pounds. In the month and a half I was taking it, I was working out more and eating healthier, but managed to GAIN weight. I'm switching back to Yaz. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	4/20/2012 8:49:56 PM	Switched from Sronyx because of terrible breakthrough bleeding, but like other reviewers, I had terrible breakthrough bleeding with mononessa as well- the doc said it would go away after 1-3 cycles but I'm on pack #4 and still bleeding excessively. (I bleed for about 15 days at a time)Also it has given me the worst depression / anxiety of my life. It usually happens in the 3rd and 4th week of each pack. Extreme thoughts of suicide, negative emotions, random tears, and several panic attacks. I'm generally not a depressed or anxious person so this is very out of the ordinary.I like not having to worry about whether or not I'm pregnant, but I wonder if it's worth all the negative side effects. 
Birth Control	Make it STOP, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	35-44	4/14/2012 11:44:33 PM	I haven't been on any type of BC (pill/hormone) for over 3 years now but reached a point where my husband &amp; I are tired of using condemns as a BC method. So I decided to get on the pill thinking what's the worst that could happen? I've taken them years prior &amp; dealt with mood swings, headache and break through bleeding! I started taking monoessa almost two months ago. I have had break through bleeding off &amp; on, my moods swings are all over the place I have had several headaches &amp; last but not least a HORRIBLE yeast infection almost the entire time. I completed a 7 day monostate cycle hoping this would clear it up but it didn't. I've been happily married for 12 years (as a precaution) had my doc check me out, confirmed it's just a yeast infection he prescribed fluconazole to fight it and sure I was good for a couple days but about a week later I was back to square one so I took the second dose, had the same result. I was hoping this would work but I just cant take it anymore so I'm going to stop taking Monoessa, hopefully I can get back to normal &amp; get ride of this HORRID yeast infection. I have read a couple reviews that have said the same thing in regards to my same complaints, this is the worst BC I've ever taken &amp; with all the bad reviews leaves me confused as to how it stay's on the market?

No weight gain, no acne flare ups, no spotting. I do notice i get sore breast one a month but i take evening prime rose oil and it helps a lot. This medication has also made my cycle regular so i know the exact day i will start every month. I will soon switch pills since its not controlling my ovarian cyst.  
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Schwitz528, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	4/10/2012 4:47:44 PM	I was put on this pill for irregular periods (my periods without the pill vary from every 2 months-6 months) and also for birth control. I was on it 8 months and my boyfriend noticed how bad it was on me mentally. Mononessa would make me overly sensitive ( anything slightly bad/sad would make me cry). After about 6 months it stopped regulating my periods, and I would start my period over a week early and would have bad cramping even before that. The bloating and other symptoms cause me to have a few pregnancy scares. This pill is very cheap though. I got mine at Walgreens for $12 with Medco insurance. I was just switched to Generess fe yesterday, so I hope that works out ok for me.

Birth Control	Chelle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/6/2012 8:15:10 AM	I switched to mononessa after Ortha Evra (the patch) became extremely expensive with insurance. I am on my second pack. PROS: It's very affordable and they will give me a 90 day supply at a time, I have not have any break through bleeding, no excessive weight gain (just a few pounds), no babies, and I've actually remembered every day. CONS: I have been noticeably more irratable, and I had a muted headache for most of the first month. I hope after a few months a side affects will balance out.

I HATE it!!!! I went from the mini-pill to this after I stopped breast feeding. 6 days in I started bleed and havent stopped. I am COMPLETELY exhausted I'm guess probably because I'm anemic now. I have never had problems like this with the pill. I am stopping immediately. Why have birth control when you dont have sex because you're bleeding all the time?!?!

Birth Control	lmd016, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	3/29/2012 8:13:10 PM	This is my second time taking this BC. I first started in high school for cramps and acne but stopped because I kept forgetting to take it and figured it wasn't doing me any good. I have been taking it for about 5 months this time around and have had regular periods and less painful cramps. My acne has also been reduced. Lately however, I have noticed that I am very tired all the time and get frequent headaches. I have also gained about 15lbs since I have started taking this BC. Now, I don't know if that is my diet because we have just come out of winter and me eating all those  heavy foods had an effect, but I haven't gained this much weight over the winter before. Still not ruling out that possibility though. I have never had nausea. I only had spotting the first month I started this pill and none since. Overall, I am pleased, but if the fatigue and headaches continue, I will go to my doctor and see what my other options are.

Birth Control	Angry Patient, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	13-18	3/28/2012 3:49:55 AM	I've been taking this for about 2 and a half weeks. I've had chest pain and breathing issues almost every night for the past week. I'm young, and healthy. The only reason why I'm on this is because my insurance refused to pay for another medication that I felt would be better, but the pharmacy had told us that the doctor had gotten ahold of the insurance company and approved my prescription. It's also lead to no sex drive, a ton of irregular discharge, pain, depression, and fatigue. I'm tired of feeling like I'm going to die because of some company being cheap. I didn't have issues with this pill last year, when I took    it for over 6 months. Please, please, refuse to take this pill if your doctor or pharmacy gives it to you. I'm fearing blood clots from this pill.

I makes me think I'm pregnant. but so far so good! going to wait to see if I immune to it over the next month.

I feel exhausted all the time, and I'm EXTREMELY moody. I have nausea and headaches, and not to mention, my face looks terrible ( so much acne it's insane!) I am going to the doc asap to get switched!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/11/2012 11:41:27 AM	I've been on this pill for about 9 months now, and I'm pretty satisfied with it. I barely gained any weight, it cleared my acne, and I know exactly what day my period will be arriving. Oh, no crazy mood swings!
Birth Control	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Male	19-24	3/11/2012 4:33:31 AM	I've been on this Birth Control for almost a year now. It does work for what I intended to use it for, I haven't gotten pregnant, but I am not happy with it. I have horrible mood swings, I have headaches that keep getting worse the longer I take this, and I have gained a lot of weight (but I always seem to gain weight on hormonal birth controls), I am also constantly nauseous unless I take several antacids daily (and I am more than tired of taking other medicines to counter all of the problems with this one when I have never had these problems before). One good thing is that you always know when your period is and how long it will last with the way the pills are set up. But for me that wasn't a big plus since my cycle has always been extremely consistent regardless of birth control.Least to say though, I wont be on this one much longer, I just need to find a doctor who will listen to my worries instead of only relying on his statistics and whatever they might get paid for putting me on certain drugs.
Birth Control	girl1234, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	3/5/2012 6:19:18 PM	I reviewed Mononessa few months back and thought it was a pretty good pill. Now its March and I have a whole new opinion on this pill. I went from a happy normal girl to an absolute psycho with this pill. It's gotten to the point where I feel literally overwhelmed and helpless when it comes to my emotions. I go from super happy to literally sobbing in a matter of seconds. Just a 20 minute ride home from work i go thru every emotion you can imagine.My anxiety is also thru the roof. I NEVER had a problem wit anxiety and now all of a sudden I have these attacks where anxiety just overcomes me, I get hot, and anxious, then I get irritated, which in turn pisses me off then gets me angry then I cry...you get the idea. My emotions have literally overcome me to the point where im helpless. If you can avoid Mononessa please do, because it will totally change you in a matter of months.
Acne		2	4	1			2/28/2012 3:35:24 PM	OH MY GOD I wouldn't recomend this to ANYONE. I took it for one month because Walgreens doesn't carry sprintec. I was okay, minus the headaches, dizziness, and I was easily confused, but my breasts were fuller and I felt more confident. I was nervous to continue it, so I took a week off before finally saying, &quot;well the side effects weren't THAT bad.&quot; and the pharmicist (who was a bitch) insisted that it was exactly the same ingredients and I had no cause for complaints. So i started the second month. The first day I took it I threw up (Which i expected, since I was off for a week) and had an insane headache. I decided to not take the second pill right away, and wait until the next morning, after sleeping off the headache. I took the second pill in the morning. That night, I woke up from the craziest dream, and my thoughts were psychotic and out of control, along with hyperventalation accompanying severe anxiety attacks that lasted all day. I seriously was neourotic, and terrified of the thoughts that persisted through my head. I never had this experience in my LIFE. I didn't take the pill the third day, due to suspicions that the pill was causing this. My anxiety and all lasted more than 24 hours, and last night I still woke up at 3 am with racing thoughts, and severe anxiety. I had to try to read a book to control my mind, and my heart was starting to ache from how fast it had been beating all day. Today I am still on the edge, but I am at least in control of myself and my thoughts. I will never take this pill again, and I will NEVER recommend it to anyone. I will take the pill's ingredients to a doctor today to find out if it surely caused my pshycotic episode. This was the most terrifying experience of my life. I recommend that if you are looking into taking a bc, take one that has been on the market for a LONG time and has proven itself, and that you can get it from a doctor you really trust. This is your body, your life and your mind. Don't mess with it!
Birth Control		5	4	3			2/12/2012 12:06:54 AM	I've taken Mononessa before and was happy so I asked my doctor to put me on it again. There is no weight gain, acne goes away and period do become regular or not existent depending on usage. However mood swings and anxiety are an issue. Being someone who already has an issue with anxiety I'm not sure how much longer i will continue with this pill. I would say for anyone give the pill at least a month to really judge how it will affect you. 
Birth Control	Soph_66, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	1/29/2012 4:44:33 PM	I had lost my BC (ortho) around the middle of the pack. I had lost it on a friday night(but took the pill for that day), so i went the sat. and sun. without taking my pill. So that mon. i called planned parenthood and they called me a prescription in to my local WalGreens. I got Mononessa, and ofcourse after missing those two pills for the weekend i had to double up. two when i got them and two the naxt day. So far i have been on the pill fofr nine days and on about the 6th pill i have experienced trouble bretheing, my chest hurts, my face feels sore everywhere, mainley my brows and jawline. My legs are sore and my whole back. I have cramping like im going to start my period but im not anywhere near the end of the pack. Sorry so long, but all in all, i mainley want to know if anyone has felt pain in their face, and whole body? By looking at these reviews it scares me that i might get blood clots. and coould this even be Mononessa if im only 9 days in my pack? 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	BATARGIRL, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	1/26/2012 1:13:00 AM	I've been on Mononessa for around seven months and before this I was on Sprintec for two months. I had irregular, long, painful, and heavy periods, as well as an ovarian cyst on my left ovary. Because my OB-GYN thinks breast/ovarian cancer likely runs in my family, she has ordered multiple tests, checks up every 3 months, and keeps me on birth control. I was originally prescribed Mononessa but my local Walgreen's didn't have it and they gave me Sprintec and claimed that they were the same. For two months, I didn't sleep, I was constantly sick to my stomach, my head hurt all the time, and my periods were still painful and heavy. When I returned to pick up my third month, I told Walgreen's that I wanted the Mononessa that my OB-GYN described. With Mononessa, my periods are a different story...I typically get my period on the third or fourth day of my &quot;period pills&quot; and other than an overwhelming and extremely heavy start, it's usually pretty light. I do still have a lot of pain, even though the blood is almost nothing. I am a week ahead of schedule though and I am not really a fan of that. I can't seem to lose the weight I've been trying to lose and I have been experiencing breast tenderness with this birth control. 
Birth Control	smileyvalerina, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/22/2012 8:47:51 PM	I have been on Mononessa for almost 3 years. I had trouble with nausea at first, but once I switched to taking it at bedtime that is no longer an issue. My skin cleared up considerably once I started taking this medication (I had mild face and back acne before - but not anymore!) I haven't had any problems remembering to take the pill, and I just skip the green (period week) pills instead of taking them. I like knowing exactly what days my period is going to be on! I know this medication can cause adverse side effects in some people, but for me they have been minimal and my skin clearing up definitely outweighs anything else. As far as effectiveness, I haven't gotten pregnant...so 100% so far!
Excessive Hairiness	Leslie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	1/19/2012 10:17:09 AM	This is my second time being on birth control. After going to the gyno for my 3 month follow up I found out my blood pressure was very high, not normal at all as it wasn't when I was there 3 months ago. I thought at the time it was maybe just a fluke thing so I brushed it off. A week later at the drug store I used the machine and saw it was still very high. I'm getting off this pill ASAP. I also did notice pain in my legs and about a 10 lb weight gain. 
Birth Control	Ashpashh , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	1/4/2012 4:33:13 AM	I have been on this pill from the very start and I never had any side effects or weight gain. I do have painful periods, but that isn't why I started taking it. I have yet to become pregnant and I only gave it a 4/5 for easy to use because I always forget to take the pill on time. Overall-- I love this birth control.
Birth Control	Dancer5678, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	1/3/2012 6:22:10 PM	i was on this birth control for almost 2 years. it didnt have any side effects for me. NO WEIGHT GAIN! I just stopped taking it today, so i could get on nuva ring, cause i couldnt remember to take the pill. overall, its great! if i dont like my new b control, i will definitley go back on this pill. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	12/31/2011 3:21:02 AM	I've been taking this pill for a month, after switching from Ortho Tri Cyclen, mainly because the Ortho made me a unstable horomonal mess. Seriously, worst mood swings ever. My doctor recommended Mononessa, and so far I would say I feel fine emotionally, the only problem I have is the nausea. I get daily nausea, like I have to throw up. Some days its barely noticable, others its quite bothersome. Also, I get the occasional headaches, happened often during the first week. Not so much anymore. I'm waiting to see if my body adjusts after the second months and the side effects lessen. But there is no perfect birth control. Its give and take. Overall, I prefer Monessa over the crazy, sex drive-less person Ortho Eva made me
Birth Control	momof3, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	12/26/2011 10:38:26 PM	I have been on this pill for a little over a year. It is very effective for birth control but not for acne control and mood swings. I get a lot of acne now and have terrible mood swings. But I have lighter periods and no cramping  or nausea at all. No dryness during intercourse either. I'm looking to switch to something else to help with the acne. 
Birth Control	Emikandairwaves, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/26/2011 11:45:12 AM	I have been taking mononessa for about a year and a half and it works great for me. It definitely cleared up my acne, but still go the occasional pimple around period time. My periods were always light, but they became much lighter. Will only get minor cramps on the first/second day when I used to have severe cramps headaches and a sore back. I really like it! Too bad it doesn't seem to work for everyone else. The only thing I did notice was that my drive went down a little bit. Other than that, great pill!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	germangirl, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	13-18	12/7/2011 6:46:04 PM	I'm a virgin so I can't really say if it does it's job or not. I have had no acne or mood swings BUT I've had 10-13 lbs weight gain since I've been on it. My boobs also grew. Also I found out i have high cholesterol--not sure if it's because of the pill or not? I mean I'm in great shape and eat healthy so this was sort of surprising. I never had a period, but that's because my Dr. told me I could just skip the placebo pills. In fact, I've been off the pill for 6 months and have only had one period since!!!! I'm obviously not pregnant. It wasn't easy at all to lose that extra weight and I just feel as if my body hasn't been the same since I took the pill......
Birth Control	MMG, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	12/2/2011 12:48:40 PM	I have been on Mononessa for a little more than a month now. I was on Levora before this and broke out all over my body. The new pill has cleared up my back and chest acne and seems to be slowly helping with my face acne. I did have a few headaches when I first started, but those are gone now. The only real side effect I have been having is breakthrough bleeding. I'm going to give it another month or two to see if that stops because I have liked the pill so far. 
Birth Control	Eliz, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	11/29/2011 1:38:02 AM	I used to take Loestrin FE but there was a lot of breakthrough bleeding and I couldn't remember to take it. So my gyno switched me to Mononessa and I switched my time to take it to 9/10p right before I go to bed. This has been so good for me. I've never missed a pill and other times maybe a few hours late on taking it. Absolutely NO breakthrough bleeding. Not once. It's also cheaper and gives me no nausea or queasy stomach. Now this month dumb Walgreens without telling me gave me a new kind called Sprintec, or something like that. I was so upset when I saw it- after driving all the way back home. I immediately called the pharmacy and was informed that it's &quot;exactly the same as Mononessa.&quot; Lies! I took the first pill last night and already today had a very queasy stomach. No breakthrough bleeding so far. So I called CVS to see if they carry Mononessa- they do at least for a short time. They switched my prescription over and I started took the Sun/Mon pills tonight. Because I don't have insurance I was able to get all 4 of my remaining prescriptions tonight. Once they sell the 8 packets left at CVS they will switch to Sprintec. The pharmacist was so nice and said that I should talk to the day people who actually order medicine and see if I bought a box at a time- 6 packets in a box- if they'd special order Mononessa for me. I'm going in to do that tomorrow. So, no, Mononessa and Sprintec ARE NOT the same! Try to order a box like I will if your body can't handle Sprintec.
Birth Control	meek, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	11/16/2011 10:48:14 AM	Im now at 5 months with taking this pill. I just had twins so this is what the dr prescribed. At first my periods were super heavy and the cramping was really bad. I think im pregnant all the time(going to the womens center today to take a pregnancy test just to be sure) but so far i havent become pregnant. I hope im not, everyone says this is a pretty effect BC lets pray that it is, cant handle anymore kids right now my twins are a handful. Also my last period only last 5 days and it wasnt that heavy could that have been a sign? Should i take this pill at the same time each day for it to work completely?

Birth Control	IhateBC, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	13-18	11/12/2011 5:10:23 PM	I have been on this bc for almost 2 months but Ive also been bleeding for almost 2 months, Its insane and I can't stand it, some days its really like and only pink when I wipe but others days looks like someone is trying to rip out my uterus!! serioulsy alot of blood. and I constantly want to puke, and nothing taste right and I think ive gained about 5-10 lbs. I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE!! 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	13-18	11/11/2011 2:30:19 AM	It works fine, but my breasts have been very sore and tender since taking it. 
Painful Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	1	Female	13-18	11/3/2011 8:32:08 PM	This is my first Birth Control. Ive been on it going on my third month and I have had some brown discharge; not a fan and have been very moody and not really caring type of attitude, I have not had sex so that part doesn't matter I have never had acne I've had a baby face and now have an oily acne face and have very good face wash it is not clear even when not on my period my cramps are gone though,
Birth Control	Jlo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	35-44	10/29/2011 11:46:24 PM	I've been on this pill for a little over a year now and have terrible acne. I'm 37 yrs old and I break out like a 14-yr old. It's so embarrassing. I also have terrible mood swings and seem to get depressed often and anger easily. I never used to be like this. I am going to look for a different pill. It does work for me not getting pregnant though. I even forgot to take it a few times and was scared, but my period always came. 
Birth Control	Dani!, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	13-18	10/27/2011 6:53:37 PM	This is the pill of my dreams! I am 18 and a freshman in college. I have depression, and this has actually HELPED with lifting up my moods. I also had moderate acne, and now I'm getting compliments on how clear my skin is.Another plus that I recently noticed, was that my normal (but sometimes embarrassing) vaginal discharge has vanished. No more ruined black panties!! I am extremely happy with this pill, I used to take Desogen and was scared to move to a new brand, but this was well worth it. I already have big breasts, but these pills definitely made them fuller. I've also been craving sugar less and have seen a small weight loss. My periods before were ALWAYS extremely heavy and would last a very long time, but now they're light and I'm surprised at how short they are now (1-3 days compared to 7 day periods).I WOULD TRY THIS PILL!I've seen some bad reviews, and that sucks for  the women having issues, but you will never know until you try. I think this is a great pill for women who are just now starting to take birth control.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	10/25/2011 6:47:08 AM	My acne has gotten so bad (mind you I am on ProActiv and it is STILL bad.) Mood swings are out of control. I think I am pregnant every month. Nauseous several times a week. Have NEVER had any of these symptoms with any other pill.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	10/21/2011 7:18:58 PM	Wow-SO glad I found this site!  I was on yaz for a couple years with no problems, then got switched to mononessa due to low estrogen levels.  I just finished the 3rd pack of this and recently realized that I'd started feeling very depressed. I've never had a history of depression and have no reason to feel this way and had no idea it could be due to the pills until I started reading these reviews. For the past couple weeks I've felt completely apathetic towards things I normally take an interest in and overly upset about things that don't normally upset me.  I have not been able to shake this feeling and will definitely stop taking this pill. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	mrmilano, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	19-24	10/7/2011 9:33:14 PM	While I feel that a lot of the reviews on here aren't accurate (you need to be taking the drug for more than 2 months to acclimate to it) some of the reviews have some truth. I've been taking Mononessa for a year. The first six months were great. It cleared up my acne, shortened and lightened my periods, and I even lost a couple of pounds.It's been a year since I started this medication, and I now want to change. After the 6 month mark, my acne came back and it is WORSE than the acne I had before (I never had anything major, I just wanted CLEAR skin). While my periods are still short and light, I'm not okay with having acne all over. I'll be switching as soon as my doctor okays it.
Birth Control	Melissa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	10/2/2011 12:27:05 AM	Out of many birth control methods I have tried this is one of the WORST... I have frequent headaches and have experienced nausea taking this pill..I have also had more acne while using this pill..Overall I wouldn't reccommend this pill
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/22/2011 1:07:24 PM	I have been on this product for over a year and so far it has been the best BC I've been on.  In the past I have had to switch pills about once a year because of side effect but not so far with Mononessa.  My periods have become only a couple days long and I rarely cramp.  It took atleast 6 months for my body to adjust to the new pills and for my period to shorten.  I always know when it's the week before my period due to mood changes and appetite increase but that has held true with any of the pills I've tried.  By far my best experience with a pill up til now.
Birth Control	Unim, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/21/2011 10:00:03 AM	I started this BC 6 weeks after my little boy was born. On this for 5 months now. I take a pill at the same time everyday. I can't lose weight but I am trying. I have mood swings but what woman doesn't? Menstrals havent changed either. 
Birth Control	arii94, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	13-18	9/10/2011 10:43:57 PM	lots of pain in my lower stomach rash spreads every where...and my boobs hurt makes my period pain worse and i think i might be pregnant do not recomend this
Birth Control	gusgus, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	9/8/2011 5:42:20 PM	This is the first experience I have had with birth control; I was put on it because I have irregularly early periods, &amp; I was cramping all the time! I've been taking this pill for two weeks or so now...and I'm so tired! Alll of the timeee! I feel like I am carrying 200 extra lbs with me everywhere I've been, or like I've just run a marathon even though I've slept at least 8 hours every night. Feeling kind of apathetic, &amp; my breasts are a little tender, but I am just mainly concerned with the tiredness. Can anyone else tell me if they ever felt this tired? I've also already gained 3 lbs, &amp; am having abnormal discharge. Should I be worried?
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	9/2/2011 5:41:39 PM	Ive been on Mononessa for one month and have had just about every side affect. Nausea, back pain, constant spotting/vaginal bleeding, cramping, and a yeast infection. i was previously on orthotricyclin lo and had no side affects. I'm going to try mononessa for 2 more months.

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	13-18	8/27/2011 6:38:08 AM	I have been prescribed to Mononessa about 4 months ago because my periods were very long and heavy. i would keep forgetting to take the pill after a while. This is the first month that i have been completely consistent on taking it. I have notice deep depression, mood swings, fatigue and anxiety. In 3 days i will be starting the placebo pills. Now my boobs are super tender, i'm getting cramps and getting nauseous. No food looks appealing at all! I am not myself at all. I'm not sure if i should switch off of it or not!
Birth Control	qnessad, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	8/21/2011 3:02:41 AM	Ths med. did its job. I never became preggers, i knew when my period was gonna come, my periods werent bad either. But my problem is that at 31 yrs old im breaking out like crazy, its embarrassing. I didnt break out like this in high school. its not jst one or two its in clusters and everywhere. In my eyebrows along my lip line. If u looked at my face u couldnt go very far from one pimple till u came to another one, BAD!!!!! Other then that this pill is great. But im still going to switch to something else.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	8/19/2011 7:19:22 PM	Since starting this medication I have had frequent spotting and abdominal cramps.  It has caused acne, fatigue, and depression.  I am normally a pretty happy person but about 2 weeks into starting this pill I have had terrible mood swings and have felt really depressed.  I was previously on Sprintec but the pharmacy told me there was a new manufaturer and that the bc was now Mononessa.  I never had these side effects while on Sprintec.  I know everyone's body reacts differently to medication but for me this pill has caused nothing but negative side effects.
Birth Control	Megan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/16/2011 1:56:58 PM	I have been taking this medication for about 7 months.  From day one, I've experienced very few side effects; namely, slight breast tenderness.  I have gained no weight, and my periods are always on time.  The only downside is that they are a bit heavier/longer than they used to be.  Everyone's experiences seem to be very different, so you won't know yours until you begin the medicine.  My personal experience, however, has been positive.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Ladytiffknee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/16/2011 12:31:53 PM	I did have nausea the first 2 weeks of taking it. But I just took Nauzene tablets (OTC and any drug store) to ease the symptoms. I adjusted to taking it later in the morning - around 11 - after I had enough to eat. After the 3rd week the nausea symptoms subsided. I've had moderate to bad acne all my life, incling sebacious cysts. This medication has made a world of difference in my face and an unsightly cyst I had on my forhead (for which I had seen a dermatologist and had a cortizone shot which didn't help much) has subsided! I am so happy about this and my face feels less irriated. I am 41 and was concerned. The pill has given me back some estrogen, important at this age, prevents pregnancy since I'm sexually active, and has helped my acne. So I am very satisfied.
Birth Control	momof2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	8/7/2011 9:58:55 PM	I begin taking this medicine to prevent pregnancy about 6 months after my second child. I have had horrible bouts of nausea, headaches, cramps, and acne(which I have never had!). Periods were longer and hurt worse with the pill.  It has also made my anxiety attacks more frequent and worse, plus depression. It has also caused breast tenderness, which I normally don't have. Along with these side effects were itchy eyes, no sex drive, tires all the time,chest pain, and very moody. I have just recently stopped taking due to passing out because of the hormones. In all, I haven't gotten pregnant, but have been miserable with it.My list could go on, but I won't. Just be aware of the side effects and know your body. Mine doesn't tolerate bc much and this is the worst one I have been on!

It cleared up my Acne and put my periods back on track.... I love this pill and i am glad i got on it... Very satisfied...
Birth Control	juggalosgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	7/20/2011 11:00:13 PM	I was on this pill for about three months. After experiencing almost a month of near-constant vaginal bleeding, I spoke with the health department, who told me this was normal. Six weeks later, it had slowed but not stopped ... didn't fully stop til my first missed period. I am now nine months pregnant, and wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Just my two cents.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	7/19/2011 11:05:32 PM	I took Mononessa for the past three months. I had bad stomach cramps(like menstrual cramps) all the time and got a yeast infection from this drug.  The second month I had horrible menstrual cramps-- just like as if I hadn't been taking birth control. This is the second brand I've tried. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	kittykittycat1990, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	7/6/2011 2:57:15 AM	I have been taking this pill for about 2, almost 3 months now. I started taking it as a contraception, and because I was having 2-3 periods a month. The first two weeks, I had extremely painful stomach cramps, little to no appetite, and I was nauseous every night. Since then, the cramps have gone away, but come back a week before my period starts, and are worse than I ever had before I was on this BC. My sex drive is almost non-existent, I get horrible headaches half-way throughout the day, I have noticed myself becoming moody and depressed, and am nauseous every single night. If I eat, within a half hour I either have horrible diarrhea or I am vomiting uncontrollably for at least 15-20 minutes. The only good thing I have to say about this BC is that my slight acne is clearing up, and I have not gotten pregnant yet. Thinking about quitting this BC though, too many negative side effects to handle.
Birth Control	Sarah, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	6/29/2011 1:52:46 PM	Mononessa has been great for me. I've been using it for maybe four months now and I have no complaints. No more acne, my periods havnt changed, and I don't have any trouble forgetting to take the pills. My first period I had while taking it was horrible with really bad cramps but my second month and so on has been back to normal. I am very happy with it.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	6/29/2011 11:39:11 AM	I am finishing up the 2nd month of Mononessa. This is the 1st BC pill I have ever taken and I am taking it for contraception purposes only. I have experienced random spurts of nausea, but never so bad that I threw up and it has gotten better. Back acne. Never had that before now! I'm also noticing a different form of acne popping up - in patches or groups of acne(I am no stranger to acne, I even took Accutane as a teenager, but this is different). One more thing - I always had light, virtually painless periods until now. It might be too soon in my body's adjustment to the drug, but I have started spotting and extreme cramping with awful stomach aches a week before my actual period begins and then throughout the final week of the sugar pills. And the stomach aches are getting in the way of daily activities. The second the next month of pills starts again, the pain subsides and I'm back to normal. I'm not pregnant, so it's getting the job done, but I'm really weighing the pros and cons at this point.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	2	Female	19-24	6/27/2011 10:41:59 PM	The only pro with this BC is that it cleared my acne. Other than that I would have bad stomach aches all the time, headaches all the time, and it caused me to get a yeast infection every month.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	6/18/2011 9:39:29 PM	I switched from the NuvaRing to Mononessa due to the ring being so expensive even though I prefer it because I forget to takes daily pills. The first two weeks on Mononessa I had migraines, nausea and some depression but that was due to acclimating to the drug. After being on it for 2 months, I have had no side effects since.

The only complaint I have is that every second active pill that I take makes me throw up at night. Not sure why. Does anyone know if I can skip a period by skipping the inactive pills and replacing them with a new pack of active pills? I will be on my honeymoon soon so I need to know! Thanks!
Birth Control		5	5	5			5/3/2011 9:53:31 PM	I was given bc 8 weeks postpartom . Works great no side effects no spotting in between periods . First time on birth control and so far so good .
Birth Control	fighting_angel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	4/25/2011 1:20:08 AM	This was the alternative to my ortho tricyclen that I was offered  while I was deployed; i had been taken ortho for almost a year. I don't know if it's a lighter dosage of medicine, but I began to have moderate bleeding two weeks after my cycle had already stopped. After taking the pack for two weeks and starting my cycle prematurely, I have decided to discontinue the BC until I see my doctor.
Excessive Hairiness	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	4/22/2011 11:05:11 PM	I am taking mononessa for my PCOS symptoms, and so far it's doing a decent job at clearing up my hirutism (emphasize on the word decent, I also lead a very stressful lifestyle which makes my hair grow much faster). Mono nessa has increased my libido (cool). The only negative side effect is I can no longer eat a morsel of sugar or else I get a yeast infection. This is not a major set back because sugar isn't good for you anyways, but it's a bit awkward in social situations where people are eating desserts and you don't want to overwhelm people with the details as to why you can't eat sweets. Seriously, a tiny cookie and I'm uncomfortable down there... very weird. I'm happy on this pill, no wait gain and increased breast size. I'm already very thin and active so those factors might have helped with any potential negative side effects.
Birth Control		4	5	2			4/17/2011 5:53:24 PM	I went to a new doctor and he prescribed me this instead of what I had been on previously (ortho-tri cyclen).  I have been on it for a little less than a year but it seems like every month I have break-through bleeding that lasts a few days.  Also, it seems like I have many more mood swings than I have in the past while on other pills.  I will be seeing a doctor in the next few weeks to see if he/she can prescribe me something different.

Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	4/11/2011 1:09:47 AM	I got on this birth control 8 weeks post partum after having my son in October, been on it for one month, i liked it. took away my lochia bleeding and also had no side effects. didn't have insurance for awhile then got on Sprintec because it didn't cost much, didn't like that had a lot of side effects. so i switched back to Mononessa because i liked the results i was having from it when i first took it. i started having nausea, sometimes vomiting, cramps spotting a week before period and still spotting now when i started my water pills. and i  back acne, never had it in my life. 
Painful Periods	over it, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	4/8/2011 2:05:53 PM	I have been taking this for almost a year and am going to be switching to another brand. Two of the side effects are breast tenderness (gross understatement) and increased discharge (bigger understatement). My breasts flat out hurt 2 out of 4 weeks. The increase in discharge is so ridiculous that I have to change my underwear a few times a day and that with using a panty liner.  I can't stand it!
Birth Control	Marissa, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/3/2011 9:48:44 PM	This BC is not for everyone. I have been on Mononessa for two weeks now and the first couple days I experienced very painful cramping and nausea. I've also experienced some deep depression, especially today, which is why I have decided to discontinue my intake. I started taking BC because I am 3 months away from my wedding. My wedding planning up to this point was fun and exciting but since I began this BC, I've felt depressed and I've been second guessing my decision to even get married. This isn't normal for me. Don't rule this drug out because of my experience. I recommend trying it and seeing how you feel after a couple weeks, and then make you're decision.

I started taking it the day I started my period, yet I'm still on it nearly two weeks later. I just want to know is this normal?! I wanted to take birth control because my periods were 5-7 days longs and I wanted to shorten it....but now I've been on my period for almost 2 weeks!! Also, I am breaking out still, but I understand I'm probably just getting used to the extra hormones.Please tell me someone has had this issue and that it will go away in time!!

I wanted to get on this birth control because I did not want to be on my period during the honeymoon. It has almost been a full month and I haven't had any problems. The first two nights I did experience major nausea which ended with me throwing up, but now that I am used to the product I am very pleased with the results. After the honeymoon I think I will start to use condoms because I do not like the thought of extra hormones being pumped into my body.  
Other	jjfree, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	35-44	3/16/2011 8:51:11 PM	Currently, I am taking Mononessa for my IVF wash-out.  After the first few days on this medication, I began to experience headaches and nausea.  At first, I just chalked it up to maybe lack of caffeine or allergies but then the breast tenderness/swelling.  These side effects have become so intense that I am concerned about if I can make it through 28 days of this medication.  I don't remember birth control causing this much discomfort.  After reading these reviews, I am considering calling my doctor for another type of birth control.

Then, while still taking the medication and not missing any pills, I became pregnant. It was an ectopic pregnancy and I lost one of my fallopian tubes. For 6 years I was satisfied with Mononessa and its effectiveness, however, I will never take it again.

I have not had weight gain, acne, decreased libido, or any negative side effect of hormonal birth control. My periods have been lighter, shorter, and I've had fewer cramps. I briefly switched to Nuvaring but my fiance did not like the way it felt or the fact that it decreased my lubrication. The only downside to this medicine is that the pills do not always easily come out of the blister pack, and on one occasion, I crushed a pill by mistake.

However, I have to say that I am rather pleased.  I switched to Mononessa from Yaz after suffering from severe migraines on Yaz.  I have only been on Mononessa for about a month, but it's been good!  I did experience the nausea the first couple days in taking the pill and I do get a headache probably once a week, but a headache is NOTHING compaired to a migraine.  My face has cleared up, i have actually lost a few pounds, and my breast do not hurt like other people that have reviwed this pill.  Everyone's body is different.  Don't be scared off by the reviews, and try it for yourself.  You may be be suprised :)

Now honestly i hate using other types of protection(condoms) i just dont like the feeling of rubber? and i was a virgin n so was he so i didnt have to worry about gross germs form some other chick so i got on the pill so i didnt have to use anything, noe ive used other protection only once n after 8 months of only using protection once to not be pregnant?!

However, after taking my 2nd pill, I had severe cramps, similiar to those that I get on my period, but slightly worse. They have continued into today and I am exhausted. I just wonder if anyone else has experienced this. It feels like I'm about to start my period, but I just finished it 3 days ago. I have been on Yasmin and Sprintec with zero side effects. My eyes seem dry and are burning as well. The comments about blood clots have me pretty worried. I am very active, going to the gym 4-5 days a week and playing sports 3 days a week at least. Any insight would be great.

PROS: Regulated my period, no breakthrough bleeding, cleared my acne, increased bust size. CONS: At first I experienced a lot of anxiety attacks and emotional unstability, but that reduced with time. WEIGHT GAIN, uncontrollable appetite and cravings, water retention.

I am constantly craving food (particularly carbs), and therefore constantly eating. Gained weight (not just in the boobs but overall). Decreased sex drive. This just sucks. Effective birth control because I'm getting fatter and just don't want to have sex!

It has increased my bust size by a whole cup and has completely cleared up my acne. I didn't have any bleeding what so ever after starting. I was very worried about side affects due to reading alot of bad reviews but i feel like i got the perfect birth control for me and now i am glad i didn't let others reviews scare me away. I'd recommend trying it.

Birth Control	ADDC, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	10/7/2010 5:20:52 PM	I have only been taking Mononessa for about a week now, but i like it already! I resently switched from aviane because i was having breakthrough bleeding every month (but besides that i liked it alot and would recomend it)but i originally got on the pill to help with my skin and even only being one week, my skin is looking even better! And besides a slight headache the first two days, everything else is going great! Ive also had a smaller appetite but im not complaining about that :)
Endometriosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	10/6/2010 10:31:01 AM	I had been on a different birth contol from age 16-22 for painful periods, and stopped after that.  Just found out I had endometriosis 5 months ago and was prescribed Mononessa.  My doctor recommended I take it for 3 continuous months to skip my period, well that was the opposite of what happened.  For the past 3 months I have had 3 periods which have lasted anywhere from 2-4 weeks each month, (light periods).  It did help with cramping, but I noticed I had light cramping for 5 days straight vs. the usual 1st day of my period like it should be.  Overall side effects: no weight gain (yay!), I had more severe headaches during my period, no noticed anxiety, depression or mood swings.  The worst side effect which my doctor said was from the pill was gallstones, which I had to have yet another surgery (following my endo surgery) to get my gallbladder removed, and had many complications from that surgery.  Not happy about that at all, due to the fact that I am in a fast-paced BSN nursing school program right now.  I have heard many other reviews about getting gallstones...so girls beware.  My doc is switching me to ortho novum, to try and control my excessive bleeding.  Hope this works.  OH, and the 1st 3 months I felt many sharp little pains in my lungs when breathing, and parnanoia told me it may be small blood clots...but nothing ever came of that which is good.  Every woman is different, so it's best to decide for yourself, but use caution with any medication.

In the last six months or so I have been experiencing terrible mood swings and deep depression. I began tracking my moods and acne and realized that both were extremely better the one week I wasn't taking this product. I began taking this pill in the first place to help reduce my acne but it only seems to make it worse. Today I swapped to a new pill that I hope I find better results in. Otherwise, no pregnancy, the product is effective.

I've had irregular periods since I first started. I went on Monessa because I bled for 76 days straight. I took the pill, and my irregularity stopped nearly right away. The down side is, The &quot;sugar pill&quot; gives me a headache on the left side of my head, and now my periods are over the top heavier than before. The good thing is my skin complexion looks flawless. I did experiance cramps this whole month without being on my period. I've actually lost weight, but i have no sex drive whatsoever.

I had never had panic attacks before in my life until I started taking these pills. I didn't suspect the pills at first, but after going on the internet and finding so many medical forums where women have stated that they have had panic attacks while taking Mononessa and other Ortho brand pills, and after talking to at least three friends who have had the same exact problem while on this pill, I've come to the conclusion that the Mononessa is the culprit. I will not be taking this pill anymore.

Cramping was slightly better (but still bad enough to keep me awake at night).  And almost immediately after starting Mononessa I began having sporadic migraines that were debilitating and extremely resistant to otc pain meds - unlike anything I've experienced before.  2 1/2 months in I realized I am sleeping way more than normal and am tired all the time even after 10 hrs + a night.  Cravings and eating all the time too.  My dr is switching me to a microgestin, and I'm hoping it will be better.

My boyfriend can only take so much, ya know. :)
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	6/24/2010 3:24:39 PM	I have been on bc since I was 16 (now 27) started having problems after all those years with clotting and painful periods while on ortho cept. So my doctor switched me to mononessa. I've been taking it for 3 months and my boobs are tender and swollen all of the time now. I'm tired all of the time yet have problems sleeping at night, a problem I had before which is now worse and told my doctor about before she prescribed this. I'm now very short tempered and I just don't care who I hurt. I am bi polar and have been having a lot of problems since starting this medication. My perfect complexion is gone and my full thick hair is thinning. I don't even want to know what my already high blood pressure and cholesterol are at now. I'm fed up with this medication and switching.

I use condoms and with my ovarian cyst history and family history of hysterectomy's, i decided to start taking the pill. I got my peroid six days after i started and got severe cramps and back aches. I had to go to the er because the pain was unbearable.  they gave me the choice to continue or stop so i continued to take to pill. I am not bleeding heavy like i would on my regular cycle but i am still bleeding going on my 8th day. When will it stop??  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	6/16/2010 6:43:12 PM	While it may have been effective, as are most birth control pills as long as you take them on time each day, this was not my preferred brand of birth control. I have never had acne in my life. In fact, I'm most complimented on the clarity of my skin. However two weeks after starting this I broke out like crazy. I decided to continue using it and let it runs its cycle to see if it would clear up once my body got used to it. Definitely did not. I switched back to Sprintec this afternoon. I had been taking that for years but my pharmacy no longer carried it. I now drive to an even further pharmacy to get Sprintec because it is worth it to me to keep my skin clear.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	6/11/2010 7:41:11 PM	I was previously on orthotricyclin lo, which was great but too expensive &amp; my insurance didn't cover it so my doctor switched me to Mononessa. The first month I felt very nausious and slightly moody for no reason. I have not gained any wieght that I can tell but I have extreme sugar cravings and munchies the week before my period. At the end of my first month on this pill my period was heavier than it has ever been on any pill, it was aweful but I decided to keep on it and see how the next month went. I am on my placebo pills now and still havn't started my period ( IM NOT PREGNANT THO) My breast are extremely tender and sore to the touch but have filled very nicely lol!I do get migranes which is a downfall. Overall, I will keep taking Mononessa unless things worsen, I am pretty happy with it so far.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/9/2010 1:16:16 PM	It made my periods regular and lighter.  I wasn't having sex before I went on it, so I'm not sure if it affected my sex-drive.  I did gain 10-15 pounds and got bad brown patches on my face.  Skin lighteners helped, but it has not gone away.  Overall, it was effective, but the mask and weight gain caused me to try a different kind of pill.

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	nothappy34, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	5/28/2010 1:29:41 PM	I am a 34 yr old woman that was prescribed this pill by my gyn to help with heavy periods and extremely large clots. I have been taking this pill everyday for the past 3 months and my breast were tender everyday, my skin cleared up for the first month of use only, my periods stopped completely for 2 months. Earlier this month, my period came back but it wasn't like a period I had before and it lasted for 2 weeks. On the 3rd week I started experiencing shortness of breath and pain in my chest on the right side that radiated from under the right breastplate to my underarm and to the area below my shoulder on my back. I had this pain for 2 days until I couldn't take it anymore. I went to the E.R. to find out that I had a blood clot on my right lung that was threatening to end my life if I had not went to the E.R. I had to stay in the hospital for 3 days, receive blood thinner shots in my stomach all 3 days there and also some blood thinner pills. I was discharged from the hospital with the shots and pills. I have to take the shots until my INR level comes up and I have to take the pills for 3-6 months. I was advised NOT to take this birth control anymore. I do smoke cigarettes and explained this to my gyn prior to getting Mononessa and was told that smoking with birth control increases heart disease not blood clots in the lungs. I don't drink or use street drugs. The shortness of breath I experienced with the use of Mononessa and the clots on my lung, triggered my asthma and I had to have breathing treatments every 6 hours while I was in the hospital. I am consulting a lawyer for further assistance.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	19-24	5/25/2010 6:32:51 PM	PLEASE READ. I was on the pill for 4 months and in those months i was tried all the time, cramps got worse, my PMS got way worse, became depressed. My periods were irregular, my sex drive did not exist any more. My breast were extremely sensitive especially around my period. But the worst was i had extreme chest pain went in and my doctor found large  blood clots in my lungs and neck, i was in the hospital for 3 days i got damaged lung tissue.My doctor said i was lucky i could have stroked or died.I am young healthy, don't smoke, rarely drink, i eat right;not even my doctor could believe it. I am on blood thinners for 6 months and i can no longer take estrogen. this is a HORRIBLE pill and should not be given to woman.

I have been very lucky to have no negative side effects. It has be effective against pregnancy which of course is the reason to take it but has also cleared my skin and helped with unwanted body hair. It has also improved my moods amazingly. Best prescription Ive ever taken!
Birth Control	sarah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	5/20/2010 9:47:14 PM	I've been on MonoNessa for about 4 years.  It has been very effective b/c I haven't gotten pregnant during that time - even when I missed a pill. However, if I did miss a pill during that cycle, I'd get horrible headaches that I never got before.  My Dr. said it was b/c this drug is unforgiving of mistakes like that.  That said, I just went off a month ago, and although my period came (and went) just fine (besides being a little later than my normal periods had been), my body is achy and I still feel like I'm menstrating even though I'm not... the cramps are still with me.
Birth Control	ShellyB, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	5/8/2010 1:45:15 AM	I took Orthocyclen for 6 months and things were GREAT! Headaches were gone, acne cleared up, weight was under control. I was then switched to Mononessa for 3 months, during which time I really didn't notice much of a difference, or so I thought. I was then switched back to Ortocyclen for 3 months and now back to Mononessa going on my 4th month. YIKES! My pharmacy kept switching me as the availability of brands changed. Since taking Mononessa, I've had 3 anxiety attacks in the last 2 weeks, severe depression and constant anxiety, gained about 15lbs in the last 6 months, my headaches are constant and food is never on my mind, which is rare for me x) This pill doesn't work for me at all! My body has gone through too many hormonal changes!

Was on Yaz (WORST BC EVER) for 7 months after my daughter was born and got pregnant with my son. Had a few miscarriges inbetween, was taking the medication so i didn't know i was pregnant. Lets just say i'm kinda fertile lol. anyway i have had breast tenderness since starting Mononessa. First day of my period is very heavy but other days are much lighter. Gained about 5 lbs. Was pretty emotional the first month but has leveled out. This actually has been the best birth control I've ever taken. Yaz made me crazy, the patch liked to come off. Mononessa is a pretty good one. I recommened it.

I have not had any side effects, and it has cut my acne down a lot. I hope this product can help you like it helped me.
Birth Control	dorothyatforty, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	4/24/2010 7:17:57 AM	Not pregnant, making it thus far 100% effective. I've been on this medication for over a year, and the only downfalls I've experienced are decreased sexual desire, and I can deal with that. My hair is awesome, I haven't gained weight (lost, actually) and most importantly, still not pregnant! 
Birth Control	Anonakitty, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/7/2010 12:30:28 AM	I have been taking Mononessa for about 5 months. Since switching from Depo-Provera to the pill I have had depression, anxiety, and high blood pressure. I am now taking 4 prescription medications (for high BP, anxiety, etc.) but when I was on the Depo, that was all I took.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/28/2010 1:29:43 AM	i am sure i would have been extremely satisfied with this pill, if i hadn't had allergic reactions to it.. after 5 days of taking it, alongside 4 days of a terrible case of hives, i stopped taking the pills and within 24 hours, the hives began to go away. i really want to continue with Mononessa.. but i have no idea what it is about them that i am allergic to (?) i have taken BC pills in the past, though it has been several years, i never had trouble with them, but i don't remember the brand.. -very downhearted. i was also on the Depo shot for two years, it was great in regards to periods and i lost about 15lbs in the first 6 to 8 months. zero periods the entire time, and my period did not commence until over a year after i had stopped getting the shot. not to mention: emotionally stressed, depleted breast size, and quite an increase in unwanted body hair.. :( side effects went away after about a year as well.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	3/27/2010 2:50:29 PM	Since starting this pill, I have experienced increased vaginal discharge, bleeding daily, back pain, cramps, and moodiness. I suffer from depression and this has seemed to make it worse. I am irritable all the time. I am quitting this pill. 
Birth Control	dia jane, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/18/2010 11:03:19 AM	On the pill for a little over two months now, and it has been working great (no babies... and I went up a cup size!) The first day on this product was a little rough with nausea &amp; general feelings of disorientation, but all side effects for me cleared by the 2nd day. I am 5'9&quot; and 120 lbs, and have only taken Apri before. I needed a stronger dose because my periods were really messed up (on Apri), and this pill so far has really evened me out. It hasn't lessened the intense pain though, which I was kind of let down by.I also have moderate acne, and I'm just noticing that it's beginning to clear.Side effects: Dryness. I've been having to drink much more water to keep my body hydrated. My eyes have also been chronically dry since I started taking this pill, but drops 4x a day seem to be doing the trick. I can't really wear my contacts without discomfort though... shame. But this seems minor compared to side effects I could be having; i.e. I'm not moody or depressed, nor have I lost my healthy sex drive. Hurray for generic OTC! 
Birth Control	unhappy in chicago, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/12/2010 7:33:08 PM	I've been taking Mononessa for 3 1/2 years. Before that I was taking Sprintec which I loved and had no side effects, but was told that Sprintec is no longer available and has been discontinued. I wish I had never switched. Mononessa has caused so many problems for me. It's strange how both Sprintec &amp; Mononessa are generic forms of Orthcyclen but can work in completely different ways. I have had severe sugar cravings while taking Mononessa. It has ultimately caused me to gain weight. About 15 lbs. I loose so much hair and my sex drive no longer exists. All of this has caused me to feel depressed. I want to start taking another kind of BC but am afraid to start another pill.

Birth Control	TigerLili, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/6/2010 5:57:57 AM	Comparing this to other BC it has been great for me. I have been on Levlen (tremendous weight gain), Yaz (terrible cramps and fear of the scary new side effects), and Ortho Evra (the patch, which made me INSANE and moody and irritable and emotional and just irrational). I have problems with acne so that's part of why I chose this one. I'm almost done with my 2nd pill pack and so far my acne has improved. There are only 2 negatives for me: one is slight weight gain. Nothing drastic. Part of it might be increased appetite, which may or may not be due to the pill. Second, my breasts are very tender. I have breast implants so I don't notice if they are larger (my boyfriend says they are so they probably are...I just don't notice really). But being this tender I'm sure it increases breast size. In every other BC I've been on this tenderness was associated with swelling, which I loved before my implants. But now they're just tender with no benefit cuz the implants took care of my want for larger breasts LOL. This pill also put my mind at ease because I worry about severe side effects and this one has a great track record and has been around long enough. Overall, it's the best BC I've been on and I wouldn't change to anything else.
Acne	jbird, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	3/5/2010 10:04:55 PM	This is my third month on Mononessa and overall, I'm satisfied with this product. I have noticed &quot;side effects,&quot; but I can't be 100% sure that they're from Mononessa.  I've been more tired lately and have noticed that I become agitated much more easily.  I'm more irritable.  However,  I haven't gained any weight, my skin didn't get worse, no breast tenderness, and my cramps actually got better!! Not to mention, my sex drive has gone Way up. I'd recommend Mononessa over Yasmin and NuvaRing (neither of which I liked at all!).
Birth Control	Katrina, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	2/19/2010 6:36:51 PM	I personally do not find this pill to be one of the best. From what I have noticed, i'm very very irritable and moody. I've been mildly depressed and have NO sex drive whatsoever (my poor husband).

It caused very heavy bleeding and mood swings. She walked out and said she doesn't love me. She stopped taking it abruptly and it has totally screwed her hormones up and is about to cost us out marriage. This is an awful birth control and should be taken off of the market for further research.
Birth Control	drea, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	2/24/2010 9:24:51 PM	No weight gain, cleared my acne and completely changed my skin, normalized/lightened periods.My only complaints are breast tenderness and swelling (pretty dramatic) for about 1 week per month.  It's not a horrible side effect.Biggest issue (which I'm not 100% certain is the medication) is that my previously normal cholesterol skyrocketed after taking MonoNessa for 4 months.  My cholesterol and triglycerides are now elevated.
Painful Periods	momeeoftwo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	2/23/2010 3:24:15 PM	I have been taking this for 3 days now. The first two days I thought I was having a heart attack. My heartbeat was stronger than it has ever been in my life. I have also been very tired, naseous and noticed a complete change in my mood. Today is my third day and I am in intense pain. I have thrown up everything I have eaten and can't get over the chest pains. This pill is definitely not for me. The paperwork even stated that these side effects could last for the first 3 months. I work fulltime, go to school fulltime, and raise two children. I can't afford to be doubled over in pain.
Birth Control	Tin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	2/13/2010 10:07:58 AM	I would have times when all I wanted to do was cry, and I didn't know why.  Before using birth control I rarely cried.  My sexual desire went way down, and I never had a problem before.  My pimples did clear up nicely.  I used it for 5 months
Birth Control	rk, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	2/12/2010 9:40:59 PM	Terrible Birth Control.  After two and a half weeks of taking this pill, I had SEVERE cramps and spotting.   Also realized I have had nausea and PMS mood swings since taking it.   I have never had such a bad and strong reaction to a birth control pill.
Birth Control	Elisabeth, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	2/12/2010 6:38:04 AM	I've taken this for a three months now. When I finish my blue pills, I get terrible migraines that, lately, keep me from working. I was told it was because of the hormone levels changing. Once my body gets used to the absence of the hormones, the migraine goes away. However, when I start a new pack a week later, the migraine is back. Excedrin doesn't work. In addition to the terrible migraines, my period is much heavier than it was before. I'll soak through my tampon within an hour. It only lasts about a day like this but it's always on a the weekday. Being a teacher, it's not easy to run to the bathroom every hour. If it wasn't for this, I would stay on thi medication. Off to the gyno I go...again.

After having my daughter I was on the IUD for awhile then went back to Sprintec but this past month my pharmacy gave me Mononessa and I've been losing weight and I just put two and two together that its possibly b/c of the Mononessa. Who knows...all in all I like fore products; Mononessa and Sprintec.

I'm in my 3rd week of taking Mononessa and my breasts are horribly tender and my nipples actually hurt.  I am gaining weight already and my stomach is constantly bloated.  I hate this product and need to switch back to Sprintec immediately.
Birth Control	feefee1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	1/24/2010 8:26:54 PM	It was good the first month but on my second pack first week, I had extreme nausea and couldn't function.  I was throwing up on a daily basis and even had to call off work due to dizziness and fatigue. I threw the pack away just after that first week and I'm never going to take it again after those horrible symptoms.  The only upside was my face cleared up and my breasts got fuller.

If anything, it's a comfort not having that worry in the back of my mind that I might get pregnant unplanned.I am very satisfied with this birth control.I also highly suggest you give a medication a try. People only post reviews when there is something going wrong, and don't necessarily post when things are going well. And remember that everyone has a different body. Just because it works for me does not mean it will work for you.You just have to try and see.

I have been at my wit's end trying to pinpoint why I cannot stop gaining weight. I exercise 3-4 days a week, eat healthy, and have never had any problem losing weight easily. I have gained about 10 pounds over the past 6 months on Mononessa. I LOVED sprintec. LOVED it - never had an problems whatsoever and wish they would bring it back! I called the pharmacy to switch - I start a new pack of Orthocyclen tomorrow. Keep your fingers crossed!

I am very satisfied with it. It made my periods more manageable and helped my acne. Only recently have I been having issue which I'm not sure is because of the medication,  my chemistry, or sex.

I was put on this medication because of ovarian cysts but it didnt seem to help that at all. I had a lot of blood clots during my period and horrible anxiety and moodswings that lasted the whole time I was on the pill. I also suffered from bad morning sickness every day. I was very happy to be off those pills!

I had to switch birth controls because the first one was making me irritable and extremely depressed and then my second week into the pack I started having bleeding when i shouldn't have. So I was put on Mononessa and ever since I've had light to heavy bleeding and tons of clots and every now and then painful cramps which I never had and very tender boobs. Overall though I love being on this pill because it does what I need it to do.

I will say when I started taking it, I was fine. When it came to the 2nd month, I started noticing that I started getting a lot of acne [when i have never had much my whole life at all- at the most like 2-3 zits]. My periods were really painful, constant migraine headaches that ibuprofen couldn't even get rid of. I couldn't even get comfortable and this is including laying down trying to relax. I am more tired now and struggle to get out of bed even after a 8-10 hour sleep patterns. Energy is low. For its purpose main purpose of regulating my periods and birthcontrol is effective for sure. However, I'd find that i would have 3-4 placebo pills left and I would get my period then [3-4 days earlier]. My mood swings are sometimes unbearable and sometimes I even catch myself overreacting... or i get depressed and sappy. I feel bloated most of the time, and I gained a few pounds, but less than 10 pounds.

My periods were regular and lighter, but now one month, my bleeding will be insanely heavy, and the next month, I won't have a period at all! I've been totally apathetic since I started taking this pill. As a college student, my grades have slipped, and I cannot focus or find motivation. I've been incredibly tired due to this medication.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	10/10/2009 6:14:31 AM	It was wonderful for the first 4 or 5 months. My periods became regular. My skin cleared up significantly. No PMS. I lost weight but that was partially because I lost my appetite and ate a lot less than I used to. I went from about 128 to 113. However after 5 months I started experiencing anxiety and depression. I also lost my sex drive significantly. My fiance would suggest having sex and I'd make up excuses. I also had a short temper and lost all of my patience (very few things made me angry before). So this week my doctor switched me to Yasmin. Let's see how that goes.

With Mononessa, I have felt deeply depressed, while having apathy towards everyone and everything (even my school work- I'm a straight A college student). I am depressed, I have also stopped eating because food doesn't even look appealing, and I've lost all sexual interest in my fiance. This birth control just isn't cutting it for me. Too many side effects that I really can't handle.

I have mood swings worse than when I was pregnant and extreme hair loss. I've also experienced tiredness. I also am very sensitive to any comment my husband makes and get angry often, which isn't at all normal for me. I was wondering why all of a sudden I yelled at him all the time over nothing but its definitly these pills. I've tried other birth control and never had these kinds of problems.

I have no side effects whatsoever, and am loving being on this pill.It's important to realize that each and every person will respond to this pill differently. If your doctor prescribed you this pill, that means they believe (as a trained professional!) that this medicine will benefit you.Try not to listen to the bad reviews-try it for yourself if you're curious! It's great for mood swings (as you take the same size dose every day) and I haven't experienced any side effects (although my boobs do look bigger-no complaints there).Good luck with your birth control choice! If Mononessa works for you like it does for me, you'll be very satisfied!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/16/2009 4:59:16 PM	I have used this pill for 7 years and have had zero problems.  I stopped the pill to have my daughter and within in 2 months I was pregnant.  I returned to the pill 6 weeks after giving birth and went right back to clockwork with my periods.  They even come at the same time on the same day of every cycle. 
Absence of Menstrual Periods	doedey85, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	9/10/2009 3:51:29 AM	This medicine has been horrible for me and I didn't realize it until I read other reviews. I just started my 4th month and have had every side effect imaginable, except spotting but that is due to the fact that I now have Asherman Syndrome. While on this pill, I've experienced lack of sleep, being nautious to the point of feeling pregnant but knowing i'm really not, darkness on my skin above my upper lip/under my nose, headaches, dizzyness, EXTREME depression, bloating, and cramping in my right leg. I thought back to 5 months ago (how I felt when I WASNT on Mononessa) and realized I was a very happy person until I started this medicine. I will be stopping the Mononessa and I 100% don't suggest using it!
Birth Control	futuremama, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	9/9/2009 6:40:17 PM	I have been on this since I was 16, (I'm 27 now), so I barely remember what it was like before. I am stopping now because I am afraid bc pills are just not good to use for such a long period of time, and my husband and I are ok with getting pg now. Some of the things I thought were normal for me I now think are side effects of Mononessa. Vaginal dryness, occasional yeast infections, painful intercourse, loss of sex drive, and fatigue mainly. Since I started the pill during puberty, I'm not sure if I've had abrormal weight gain, (I'm 5'2, 115 lbs and that is always the same), but I'm hoping that stopping the pill will not cause me to gain weight, but maybe lose 5lbs or so?
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	9/9/2009 2:03:56 AM	I was put on Mononessa when my old b.c started to fail. Since I have been on this b/c, I have gained a large amount of weight (30 lbs.)I haven't felt this tired in my entire life, my mood has gone from kind and gentle to down right mean! My acne has increased and my skin is now more oily than it has been since puberty!! I always feel drained and have little to no energy. I'm depressed most days, and my periods last more than a week. the sight of food makes me feel ill, and now I have bleeding before my period should even think of starting. My vision has gotten so bad that I can't even read street signs when I'm driving, I've been nearsighted my entire life, but since starting this medication it's gotten worse. On tops of all this, I have constant, severe, extremely painful diarrhea. Since the formula change, my symptoms have worsened and my mood is so foul I want nothing to do with any of my friends or family members. When I started this medication I was told that I would have shorter lighter periods, they have been everything but. My menstrual cramps are sometime unbearable, and can not be lessened with and pain reliever. I have had chronic head aches, and am no anemic. I wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE and the only reason I have stayed on it is due to the fact that I have no way of paying for a new doctors visit or other b/c's. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	8/20/2009 4:56:48 PM	I have been sick to my stomach and tired and moody every single day that I have been on this b/c.  I am not taking it anymore!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	8/18/2009 12:56:37 PM	I have been on this pill for 2 months and I hate it! When I was 16-20 I used the depo shot and had no problems. Since taking this pill I have horrible mood swings, headaches, chest pains and just tired all the time. I work 10 hr shifts and since taking these pills I have missed alot of work because of being so tired. I made an appt with my doctor to switch, but after reading these reviews im stopping this pill today!
Other	cstina, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	7/28/2009 4:09:14 PM	I have diabetes. You should not be on this pill if you have it. The cinditions area says so. I have experienced hair loss, moodiness, depression, anxiety, blurred vision extremly high blood sugar ( 300-500 very very bad) weight gain while on a weight loss pill, extreme fatique ( i have a 4 month old to take care of) and bloating and who knows what else its doing to me that i havent noticed yet. I DO NOT recomend this drug to anyone and it should be taken off the market. Ive only been on it 10 days and figured ok ill give it a month to get used to it and things have only gotten worse.
Birth Control	mamastitch, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	7/21/2009 11:00:13 PM	I started Mononessa after Sprintec28 was discontinued.  It was smooth sailing for two years or so until I received a notification from the pharmacy two months ago that there was a &quot;formula&quot; change. I really didn't think anything of the notice and went about my daily life. About 2 weeks after starting my first &quot;new formula&quot; pack, I began to have itching, burning and clear discharge.  My ob/gyn treated me for a Yeast Infection but it never got better.  After about two weeks of pain and discomfot, my Dr scheduled me for a VERY PAINFUL biopsy because he wanted to see if it was a bacterial infection.  After those results were negative, I was asked to review my daily habits (for new allergies) and the only thing that changed was the formula of the birth control pill.  I have been off of Mononessa now for a little over a week.  Most of my symptoms are minimal and a few are completely gone.  My Dr said I will need to wait another week or so for everything to be out of my system.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	7/21/2009 11:55:02 AM	I started taking this medication since the brand name became too expensive. I have had spotting for the last 7 weeks and have gained 12 pds since I started taking this medication. I am active however gaining weight and bloating. I have also expreienced being more tired than usual. My doctor told me I was just getting used to the new medication however I am not myself and this weight gain is really bothering me. I am contacting my doctor for help. 
Other	mamastitch, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	7/18/2009 5:14:57 PM	For 5 years, I had been taking Sprintec28 before the Walgreens supplier changed to Mononessa.  All was fine for about two years until I received a pamphlet from the Mononessa company about a change in the pills.  They were smaller, &quot;smoother&quot; and did not have that same minor sweet taste that they used to, but I didn't think too much about it.  During the second month of this new &quot;formula&quot;, I started having symtoms of a yeast infection: itching, burning, discharge. My doctor gave me Dyflucan but that still didn't stop the problem, it actually became worse with: weight gain, high blood pressure, and a swollen/hot vulva.  I used Vagasil creams, cortisone and other forms of YI treatment for two weeks before my Gyno could see me again. His 3 tests for the main problem bacterias were all negative.  The last step was a VERY PAINFUL vulvar biopsy that took 10 days for the results.  That was also negative for any bacteria, viruses, or STDs.  Then the Gyno started looking into something that I was allergic to.  We were at a dead end when they found that I have no known allergies. After about a month, I started my period and my green row of BCPills. I felt great! Less itching, irritation, burning, and swelling.  The following week, it started all over again when I realized the only thing &quot;new&quot; for that week was my BCP.  I immediately googled &quot;Problems mononessa&quot; and I found about 14 websites filled with ladies leaving complaints about this product. I have been off Mononessa for 2 weeks and with the exception of a couple leftover sores (that are there because of constant scratching and cortisone over-use), I feel great! 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/10/2009 11:56:31 AM	This birth control is horrible!  I swapped from Yaz to Mononessa and it was the worst mistake!  For the entire first month, spotting/light bleeding everyday.  Furthermore, breast tenderness, SEVERE anxiety, weight gain and severely swollen ankles.
Birth Control	melinda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	6/19/2009 6:07:00 PM	I switched from Tri-Nessa to Sprintec because I had spotting so my doctor recommended it. After Sprintec was discontinued, I was given Mononessa. I've been taking it for a few months now and my last doctor's visit revealed I have very high blood pressure. I'm 25 and very healthy, not overweight. I went thru a series of tests to figure out why I have high blood pressure. Everything came back normal. One day it came to me that's it's probably this new birth control pill that's causing it. My blood pressure was fine before. I have an appt next week with my Doc so I can tell her to switch me to a different pill or back to TriNessa so I can see if my blood pressure will go down. And after reading that everyone has been more tired on this pill, I realize I have been too!
Acne	 Female 	1	3	1	Female		6/14/2009 2:27:42 AM	I switched from Sprintec to Mononessa two weeks ago and have since experienced bloating, weight gain and mood wings. I am not 100% sure if these symptoms are related to the medication, however, after reading these reviews, I am considering going off the pill completely. I hope this won't cause my face to break out.
Birth Control	otonio, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	6/10/2009 3:30:15 PM	I too was given this drug by my Pharmacy instead of Sprintec. I have been on it now for about 1 1/2 months. I had an extremely heavy period that was a few days late to come and leave. I am tired all the time, have frequent headaches that do not go away even when I take pain relievers. I am bloated and don't feel like myself at all. I have been nauseous for the past three days and couldn't figure out why. I then thought about this new pill and started to do some research and found this website. Thanks goodness!! I am going to talk to my Pharmacy and doctor immediately.

Birth Control	NotWorthIt, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	13-18	5/30/2009 12:17:35 PM	I have been taking Mononessa for about 3 weeks now, ever since I switched from Loestring 24 Fe (my insuranc didn't cover the cost). I have already experienced serve depression and major mood swings. I do not feel like my normal happy, social person. Worse of all I have had major swelling in my calfs and knees. Major pain in my chest, arms, and calfs. This is sign of blood clots and I plan on getting switched off this pill immediately. I'd give you the advice to get off as soon as possible or even better never start this pill!!!! Not worth the troubles. 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	5/27/2009 8:31:42 PM	I was also given Mononessa after the drug company stopped making Sprintec. I had no problems with Sprintec, now that I have been on Mononessa for a six months(or so) I have noticed vaginal discomfort/itching/dryness, I am tired no matter how much sleep I get and my period will be on time for a month or two and then will start early or last longer than it should. I am calling my doctor to change prescriptions.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	5/27/2009 11:03:53 AM	I have not even been on this BC for a full month &amp; I absolutely hate it &amp; question each morning if I should take it again. The second week I started to experience the head aches that a lot of the reviews are stating as well. I can take medicine for that but what bothers me the most is my mental changes &amp; the nausea (taking Pepto every AM). I have not felt like myself &amp; am tired, down &amp; almost no food sounds good to me, I think that has to do with the mood change. :( I have not experienced weight gain but at the same time I'm trying to gain weight so who knows. Would not recommend this if you tend to get sick from other BC's, I've tried several as well but this one is BAD.
Birth Control	rsp, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	5/19/2009 7:26:44 PM	I'v been on this oral contraceptive for almost a year, but have really been noticing some changes in the past couple of months. I have terrible mood swings. I actually feel very depressed! My headaches are persistant and my periods have started changing. Last month my period came almost four days early. About 4 months ago my periods started getting abnormally heavy mid-way through my cycle. To say the least I think over time my body is really noticing some definite changes...and not for the better!
Birth Control	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	5/18/2009 8:25:07 PM	My daughter experienced severe nausea and vomiting and leg pains after using this medication for only 5 days. I have taken her off of it and am going to request a new rx from her doctor. 
Birth Control	Mo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/11/2009 2:45:04 AM	I was on orthocycln from age 19-23.  At 24 I transitioned to sprintec the generic version of ortho.  Then,  when sprintec stopped being made last year, I started to use mononessa (which is supposed to be the same thing).  I have not had any problems with switching to mononessa.  Infact, I'm ten pounds lighter and feel more normal than I have in years.  I don't have nearly as much PMS or monthly anxiety and depression.  Throughout the years on the pill I have had brownish spotting about 1 week before my period.  It does not always happen.  Otherwise, my period comes like CLOCKWORK and lasts 2 days.  It's so light I don't even need to use a tampon sometimes.    
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	JLB, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	5/6/2009 10:11:51 AM	In terms of having a lighter period and less cramps this has worked.  Side effect wise it has been the worst thing in the world for me.  I am moody and get upset at just about everything, my joints are in pain, i get head aches just about every day, im tired all the time going to sleep at 8:00pm and still being tired at 5:30am when waking up.  I have noticed more pimples occuring along my jaw line which never would happen before.  I just called my OBGYN to get an appointment to see her tomorrow, i need to get off of this stuff before it ruins not only my relationships, but my body.  This might not be the case for everyone, but the only thing good out of this pill is the fact that im not having a baby right now because i took it.
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	4/7/2009 3:33:14 PM	WONDERFUL!!Starting in 8th grade i constantly had horrible periods. My cramps had me doubled over in pain, i got severe headaches, and i was very moody. My periods also lasted about 7-9 days. I decided to go to the gyno and she put me on birth control. I tried 3 other typed before i got to Mononessa. I am very please with the results. I rarely have PMS, my periods have become shorter (5 or 6 days), and i have little to no cramps. I no longer despise having my period! I would deifnitely recomend this pill. Its only 10 per month(with insurance) at Walgreens.**also don't give up if you dont see results after the first 2 or 3 months. it takes your body time to adjust and get used to the medicine. Every month it has gotten better and better. =]
Endometriosis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	3/28/2009 10:30:09 PM	I had been taking femcon, and was NOT happy with it, I had horrible mood swings and it didn't seem worth it for endometriosis prevention, so I got switched to mononessa, and was told to go for 3 months without taking placebos, so going thru 4 packs and THEN taking placebos. About a month and a half in, I had a period for 3 weeks, with horrible mood swings. I am almost done with the 4th pack, and am about 4 days from the placebos. I got my period a week ago, though. And have had HORRIBLE mood swings, irritibiltiy, angry outbursts, crying for no reason at all, which the crying is why I stopped femcon. I HATE MONONESSA! I'm going to demand off of it when I see the doctor soon.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/25/2009 9:58:03 AM	While taking this medication for almost 2 months,I developed chest wall pain. In all my years I never had a problem with any other birth control pills before. I called my doctor and had it changed. I'm not taking any chances.  
Birth Control		1	3	1			3/16/2009 4:05:20 PM	I have been on this pill for four months now and last month I recieved my period one week early and now have been bleeding for a full month. I also have bad cramping, and severe headaches. I refuse to keep taking this pill and am scheduled to see my doc to change pills.

Painful Periods	Sabrina , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	3/9/2009 1:22:41 AM	I started out taking these pills three months ago and so far everything has been going great. I had really bad cramps i would pass out from the pain or vomit and high fevers and barely move from such pain and now i can barely feel any cramps. Also after starting on these pills i have no headaches maybe once or twice since i started which is very very good because i would get headaches about four times a week. Thankfully i'm doing a lot better than i though i'd be since its my first time taking any kind of bcp for bad cramps but nothing else worked so my gynocologist recomended i start taking them. although since taking mononessa i've experienced a lot of itchiness around my breasts i have no idea if it is because of the pills but it started around that time i started taking the pills.
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female		2/5/2009 4:55:03 PM	I was off birth control for 9 months when I started to have some problems around the time I got my period. So the Dr. put me on Mononessa. I have been on it for 2 months. I don't feel like myself. I have horrible muscle tension in my whole body, headaches, and my right leg has ached for the last 6 weeks. I am making an appointment to see the doc and getting off this stuff. I hate it! My husband and I don't want to have a family yet....but this stuff is NOT for me. It makes me feel horrible and tired all the time. 
Birth Control	ouch, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	35-44	1/29/2009 10:08:08 AM	I was prescribed Mononessa because I had continual breakthrough bleeding with Yaz and Yasmin and Ortho-tri-cyclen.  I gained approximately 10 lbs, and began having extremely heavy cycles with clots.  I called my doctor to change prescriptions, and she recommended that I take the pills continuously, skipping the placebos. So, I will try that for a month or two before totally changing pills.  
Painful Periods	Miss.Melissa, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	1/25/2009 10:24:34 PM	I have been on Mononessa for almost a year now. I got on it after having my son. I love it. I have a backwords uterus and periods hurt me so this has helped with that. And my period last from 3-5 days. 
Birth Control	jenrose, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/22/2009 4:23:51 PM	I, like others, had been on Sprintec and was switched to Mononessa with the promise that it was virtually the same pill.  Over the 6 months or so I was taking it, I developed extreme headaches that were nearly unbearable and unable to treat with any pain medication.  I was also so tired that I could hardly force myself out of bed with 10 hours of sleep, only to find I had to take a nap later.  I also noticed I had signs of depression and was overly sensitive and reactive, causing my relationship to suffer.  I did not recognize the correlation between this pill and my symptoms, so went to the doctor, had blood work done, and was referred to a neurologist.  Upon advice from my family and friends, I decided to look up Mononessa and found this website.  THANK GOD!!!  Finding information regarding the extreme side effects of this pill and reading others' reviews completely saved me from this hell!  I am so releived to have finally diagnosed the problem and to learn that I am not crazy.  I am now off and feeling 100% better.  I hope this review helps others the way that they helped me. :)
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	1/17/2009 4:22:34 AM	My college health center switched me to Mononessa from Pervifem (because it was cheaper for them.)  While taking these pills I was always tired, moody, had horrible migraines and gained 10 pounds (which my previous birth control didn't make me do.) Not to mention, after I stopped taking it in November, my December period was 2 weeks late and my January one has yet to come.  I took two pregnancy tests and both were negative.  I would advise anyone considering Mononessa, or going on Mononessa, to STOP before you even start.  Save yourself the inconvenience!
Painful Periods	BCdolfin, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1		25-34	1/12/2009 4:51:18 PM	I have been using Mononessa for two months. The first month all seemed fine. A week before my period started I had a brownish discharge but I figured it had to be old blood and nothing to worry about. My period started with the second green pill and ended with the second blue pill from the new pack. I has unbelieve cramps and vomiting. On the second week of the pack I missed four pills. I took two but not the others since I didn't want to overdose. The Third day of missing the pills my body started a period. A strange period. It was deep red and lasted about three days. The following week I had the brown spotting/discharge again. This time it is NOT ending. I should have started my period today but the discharge is still happening. It is not like the last month, this time is it thicker. I know I do not have any STD's or any conditions that would cause this. Tomorrow if my period does not start I am calling my dr. My advice...Ask your dr. questions regarding this pill and let him know anything that is strange or usual with your body. 
Birth Control	mdiekhuis25, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	12/1/2008 11:58:09 PM	I was on Sprintec for about eight years when my mail order pharmacy switched me to Mononessa.  On the third week of taking this pill, my right leg started to throb with pain constantly and I could barely walk.  A day later, I noticed that my right leg was swollen compared to my left leg and I had tingling in it.  I went to the hospital and they discovered a huge blood clot that started in my mid-thigh and went all the way up to my pelvis. I spent two days in the hospital, one of them being thanksgiving day.  I now have to be on coumadin for the next 6 months and hoping my body will get rid of the blood clot naturally.  My leg is still hurting for now and I'm hoping I don't have to take more medication or surgery to get rid of this clot entirely.  DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL.  I have not read any good reviews on it and I can tell you from personal experience that it is not good for your health.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/24/2008 10:45:52 PM	I was switched by my pharmacy from Sprintec last month after having taken Sprintec for 2 1/2 years since my son was born.  I have felt moody, dizzy, sooo tired and have had some wicked migraines (much worse than usual) - looking for something else!

Bad. I am going to see a Neurologist to make sure it's the birth control. Overall I like the pill, just hate having to remember to take it every day! I was on the ring in the past and loved it but got my period every other week. Doc. said it didn't have enough hormones or something. I was very happy with the ring!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	5	1	Female	19-24	11/23/2008 12:57:36 AM	I actually had been taking this pill for almost three months when out of nowhere, I began my menstrual cycle. The cycle lasted for almost a month, with lots of abdominal pains and lack of sleep. My doctor actually told me I was just &quot;getting used to&quot; the pill. I would not recommend anyone else try to &quot;get used to&quot; this pill--it seems more painful than successful.

Other	Tatagirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	11/3/2008 3:15:29 PM	Since I've been taking Mononessa (28), I've been feeling tired all the time, loss of energy(sometimes it's hard to get out of bed) even if I've had my 8 hours of sleep. I have blurred vision, frequent headaches, nausea all the time, and sometimes chest pains.  Never had these symptoms before I started this pill.  I wouldn't recommend this pill to my worst enemy.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Ashes, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	5	3	Female	19-24	9/2/2008 1:04:44 PM	I started taking this 3 months ago. I was switched to Mononessa from Orthcyclin because it is $30 cheaper. However, last month I was 2 weeks late on my period, and this month I have not received it at all.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	8/21/2008 11:51:58 PM	I was given Mononessa instead of my normal Sprintec since the drug company stopped making it. I have expierenced spotting inbetween periods, have become physically more tired, and incressed headaches. I also don't feel myself and my energy has disapeared. I am thinking of talking with my doctor and having my medication changed. As a side note, I have read the other reviews on Mononessa and i agree with the majority in that they need to bring Sprintec back.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	8/14/2008 6:06:20 PM	I've been taking Mononessa for 4 months now and I haven't had any problems what-so-ever.  When I first started it I was hoping my face would clear up, however, it stayed the same.  I don't have acne, but my face does break out just like everyone elses.  Other than that it's worked fine for me!
Birth Control	No BC, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	8/4/2008 9:20:47 AM	My Pharmacy had switch my birth control to Mononessa from Sprintec. I had passed out and had blurr vision. Do not take this medication!! I would get headaches very often and made acne worse. FDA needs to take this pill off the market.
Other		5	5	5			7/10/2008 5:23:15 PM	I switched to Mononessa to Yaz! I love it so far. Yaz made me constantly PMS and this is just wonderful. I transitioned from pack to pack as I normally would and I only blead one extra day. I have been upbeat and happy and my mood has been stable this entire month! I love this pill!
Other	MAO, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	6/25/2008 12:49:23 AM	For 2 weeks my legs have been falling asleep very easily.  I also felt 2 sharp pains on either side of my body.   I am guessing the pain was my ovarian cycts bursting.  I have been on Sprintec for years with no such issue and is the main reason reasons I am on the pill.    After being off for 5 days I started a new pack 3 days ago and my symptoms are getting worse as I type this.   My legs are constantly aching, I have to actively think about how to walk and I just noticed discoloration (whitness of my shins) .  I was thinking it could be a blood clot and after reading the above reviews I am on my way to the hospital!   What happen to Sprintec!  This is crazy!

Birth Control	nursemich, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	6/20/2008 2:37:50 PM	I have been taking Mononessa for 3 mos, after being switched over from my usual Sprintec by my mail-order pharmacy.  I was assured that it was the same as Sprintec.  I have since experienced darkening of the skin above my upper lip, and severe acne.  I have never had acne like this before.  I was on Sprintec for over a year without these side-effects.  I am very dissatisfied with Mononessa, and will not take this anymore.
Birth Control	 Female 	4	5	1	Female		6/14/2008 4:05:38 PM	I just got switched to mononessa because I was unhappy with Trivora.

However, I have experienced weight gain, bloating, acne, and moodiness.  I didn't have these symptoms while taking Sprintec.  I have decided to stop taking the medication.
Birth Control	Unhappy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	4/22/2008 11:29:12 AM	I have been on Sprintec for 2 years and the pharmacy gave me Monessa last month.  I have not missed any pills and started my period one week early.  I have been on my new pack for three days now and I am still bleeding.  I have NEVER had this problem and have decided to stop taking Mononessa and try something else.
Birth Control	alluringdiction, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	4/21/2008 8:12:53 AM	I started this brand of birth control three weeks ago.I had not taken birth control in almost fifteen years.I started on the first day of my period as indicated, and have not stopped having a period in THREE weeks!It was light at first, but got progressivly heavier, to the point that.... in the past  week I have been getting blog clots every time I use the rest room (which I've never had before during my period)I've also had constant headaches, and have felt 'yucky' and overall just weak and NOT myself!I thought, it was just an adjustment period , and that it would take my body a while to adjust.But I know myself well enough to know that this is NOT normal and not healthy.I was on this site to see other peoples reaction to this brand and to try to see what constitutes 'normal' side effects.My decesion is that I will NOT take another one of these pills and go to see the doctor to find a more suitable, worthy and effective brand.As a side note, I was perscribef a different brand in the beginning but my insurance did not cover it and this is what I ended up with!!Good luck with whatever your dealing with ladies. Wishing you good health!
Birth Control		2	5	1			4/8/2008 12:46:06 PM	I've been getting my period 2 weeks early for 2 mos, in addition to the regular cycle. Increased acne, and weight gain. I did NOT react this way with Sprintec, which they told me was the same as Mononessa.
