Cold Symptoms	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male	35-44	3/12/2012 8:12:10 PM	I took Capmist for 3 days and had trouble sleeping.  I experienced mood swings, not able to sleep, hallucinations and anxiety.  Not a good drug for me.  12 hours I stopped taking Capmist, I started to feel better and was able to sleep.
Other	nomorecoughplease!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	1/12/2012 5:31:32 PM	This drug makes me dizzy so I can not take it during the day when it was prescribed.  It made my throat and mouth dry, which made me cough more.  It did however break up the mucus in my lungs.

It does have a nasty after taste. I also only take it at bedtime as it &quot;knocks me out&quot;.

Cough	MISSwint, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	5/31/2010 12:17:13 AM	I have been prescribed this because of a persistent cough, and sinus congestion...and yes, this medication does do what its supposed to, but I have had trouble with excessive drowsiness, trouble focusing, and hallucinations the first two nights i took this. It makes it hard to do tasks at work and do my schoolwork.
Cold Symptoms	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	4/24/2010 10:05:24 AM	while taking this medication i notice its breaking the cough up very well, but making my nose and eyes run like crazy, its a very good drug but it works way to well, it will break all the up in your lungs and you will cough, it has also helped with the double ear infection i had from the sinuse infection i had 
Cold Symptoms	StillCoughing, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2		19-24	2/21/2010 8:14:04 PM	I was not completely happy with this treatment. Not only does the medicine lack in what it's supposed to help fight against, but it has a terrible odor to it that makes it hard to swallow if you smell it at all before popping it into your mouth. It did not help me against my head or chest congestion, but it helped my cough a bit. I would not reccomend taking this for a severe cold or flu, something like Tylenol or Advil Cold and Flu would work much better for you. It did for me.
Other	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	2/19/2010 9:23:23 AM	Had a sinus infection with a real nasty cough and congestion. The doc gave me an Rx for Capmist DM and it just works. I don't cough as much as what I did when I wasn't using it and it clears up the nasal airways great!

Cough	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	7/11/2009 10:25:40 PM	When I took this medicine, it did relive my cough, but the side effects were awful! I was dizzy, began yelling for no reason, crying for no reason, and quit taking the medicine after just one dose. I do not reccommend this to ANYONE!
