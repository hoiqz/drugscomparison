I using Flolan since February 2001. I had jaw pain when I started eating, then it goes away when I continue eating. Rarely, I have been flushing or hot flashes up to 5 times per year. Yet, Flolan is very worth life-saver drug.

We started out with just oral medication that was giving us no improvement, we moved to remodulion sub q pump and she couldn't do that either so we switched to Flolan and now 5 years later we finally received our 1st good report from Echo Test and Clinical Test. I am looking forward to the new Flolan that does not require to be on ice.

This is our last hope and so far it seems to be working the worst part is being responsible for the administration of the Flolan and ensuring there are no air bubbles.  Family support is essential to get a family through this type of commitment.

It seemed to help initially, but then an RN was told to administer a sleeping drug.  He did so by interrupting the Flolan for about 5-6 minutes.  This is unacceptable.  Flolan must be given on a continuous basis.  My husband may not have lived because of Flolan, but we know that he died because of disruption of the continuous flow of the medication.  Don't let this happen to you or someone you love.  Insist that they do not disrupt the continuous flow of Flolan!

She had the jaw pain, but it was tolerable for her. She later had an organ transplant, and her PAH numbers had gone lower in result. They then weaned her off of Flolan, that is when things got worse. Heart valve disease, still PH, and Atrial Fibrillation. All of which can be caused by Flolan. She recently had heart valve replacement surgery and 1 month later is still on the ventillator because of her pulmonary hypertension. Moral of the story is if its working, keep it going....it's worth it! But also be aware of dangerous side effects.

As a PH patient (secondary to scleroderma), I couldn't walk over about 20 yards without getting out of breath.  I NEVER took the stairs and had trouble doing small tasks like dressing and showering.  Now, with my Flolan, I live a really normal life.  I work 50 plus hours as a high school teacher. I truly believe I have my life back thanks to this medication.  Although it's a total drag, mixing, dressing, etc., IT IS SO WORTH IT!

To this day, he is a symptomatic and lives a perfectly normal life with the exception of the pump.  He even surprises his doctors

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension	TN Girl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	10/16/2008 5:29:31 PM	Flolan saved my life.  When I was diagnosed, I was a class 3-4.  My oxygen at rest was 82 percent and I could not walk up a flight of stairs without passing out.  My oxygen now, without O2, is 98 percent and I can do light exercise.The side effects can be bad, but I have learned to live with them.  I have jaw pain when I first start to eat, diharrea, and leg pain if I stand in one place too long (I use a wheelchair to go shopping).  I am on 11 of the 1.5 vials of Flolan.  While having to mix medication and wear a pump 24/7 was a major life change, it has all been worth it.  It is my new normal, and everyone around me has been very supportive.
