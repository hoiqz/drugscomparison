Only in last 2yrs. my low sodium levels have become an issue causing equilibrium problems. Been taking 20yrs or more I am in my early 50's.  The Dr. was upset at the sodium issue, however I was never informed this can ever be an issue.  Have seen 3 or more Dr's over the years and not one has said this can be an issue due to this med.

Epileptic Seizure	Jay'sMommy, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Male	7-12	7/5/2011 7:45:48 PM	This medication has stabilized my son, he hasn't had a seizure in 7 years. But recently had a second opinion because I wanted to find out if he needed to be medicated further since he only had seizures between the ages of 3-4.  The 24hr EEG performed showed some abnormalities but not the abnormalities that Carbatrol would address.   So now his new neurologist has prescribed Lamictal which she feels would improve his overall brain activity.  I am a bit nervous but I am optimistic. I would recommend this medication, just make sure to get blood work done as the doctor suggests and don't be afraid to ask questions or for a second opinion if you feel you need more answers.

Epileptic Seizure	CarbatrolSideEffects, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	2/21/2011 1:14:50 PM	Since switching to timed-release Carbatrol: Experiencing uncontrolled body movements ranging from big toe kinking up; spasm in stomach, hip/s, throat and difficulty breathing during the spasming, eyeballs spasming, inside head spasming, one or both legs raising up and down to exercise without wanting to exercise, left or right arm or both going up and down at the same time, one or both hands shaking fast.  There isn't a lot of time in between before the next bout of shaking beings.  Over five years time I have been hospitalized many times and told these symptoms are non-epileptic per EEG.  Other symptoms:  I also get stiff as a board either one part of all and I am paralyzed for up to 20 minutes at a time.  Sometimes the symptoms freeze up my eyes or my mouth and I cannot see or speak, etc.  I intned to go off the timed-release version IMMEDIATELY as I have had a full realm of &quot;normal&quot; testings and eliminated other causes of my symptoms.  The &quot;timed release&quot; version of Carbatrol has brought torture and torment to me.  I am in agony and exhausted from all the side effects of ongoing, uncontrolled body movements, paralysis and freezing up, then passing out.  One the body movements start they go on for about four hours at a time.

Facial Nerve Pain	candy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	12/4/2010 11:55:04 PM	This med is very effective in soothing my trigeminal neuralgia. Opiates do not work for this pain. I have had zombie like side effects the first round of treatment. Not as bed on this, my second round, except at the higher doses. I will be sleepy and minor motor problems. On a high dose or  when changing doses be careful driving!  The other largest side effects are esp. vivid dreams. VERY VIVID. Both good pleasant dreams and nightmares. Incredibly detailed and real. I have PTSD though and the nightmares, some of them have left me in tears they were so intense. Definitely noticed difference before and after and then again when starting it 2nd time. Surprised this is not more of a controlled substance, I could see potential for abuse among those who like to get a mellow high. It is a potent drug though and I would not mess around w it. I think it is important to keep your blood level stable to avoid breakthroughs. I am a chronic pain patient who has been on morphine for 6.5 years and the TN pain makes me cry like almost no other. It is a miracle to be able to get such effective relief.I also have some bipolar issues but am not sure how much the drug helps w that. I am still very labile in my moods.
Facial Nerve Pain	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	10/4/2010 6:05:13 PM	This medicine has stopped the pain from trigeminal neuralgia.  I do get side effects that vary, but I just take them as they happen, nothing severe compared to the pain!  The surgerys scare me and I hope to be able to use this medicine indefinately.

Since taking Carbatrol my modd swings have been less frequent and less severe. When i get mood swings they are no where near as violent and quick and are shorter. Currently trying a different antipsychotic to help control my symptoms 100% But without my carbatrol id probably be in a mental home right now.

As long as I remember to take it, I remain seizure free.  The 2 times that I forgot to take it for more than 2 days in a row, I had a seizure.  Otherwise, if I do take it, it works perfectly.

I have 6-8 seizures per year, as apposed to the 2-3 monthly seizures I once was expirencing! Ths medication is very effective in regards to seizure control  but it may be strippng me of the vitamin biotin - hair and scalp appear to be dry.

Mostly because it remanins within your blood levels unlike the generic version. However I am fortunate to be on a program because I could not afford this medication retail and my insurance does not cover, not even under a &quot;medically necessary&quot; or via an appeals process. I do need two other medications to control my seizures. Presetnly taking 1600 mg a day.

A screw from one of the plates is hitting a nerve. When I get a sinus infection the pain is so bad I can just scream. I have been on Lyrica and I have taken every kind of pain pill from davacet, Lortab, vicadon ect.... And I have been to all kind of doctors.  Finally last year a neurologist put me on Carbatrol.  This medicatio has helped me so much. I think I would not have made it another year with out some relief.  Carbatrol has saved my life. I take 400mg in the morning and 4oomg at night and this seems to be woking well. I have had no serious side effects so far. Praise the Lord something has finally helped.

It does stop the seizures even if you miss one dose.  The only problem that I have is the mood swings, irregular monthly cycles, some what drowsy and the water weight gain.  The other major side effects like liver problems haven't really affected me.  Over all this medication does the job for 11 years.

It is extended release, so it works evenly in my system throughout the whole day.  It has controlled my simple partial seizures for the last seven years now.  I have participated in two separate studies so far and would do more if asked.  The drug maker is trying to make a liquid form to give to people not able to take on their own.  This is really a great drug.  It seems to do better than the phenobarbitol I was on as a child.

When I first tried this drug in higher dosages it worked very well, but the side effects of body pain was more than I could take.  The spasms cause me no pain so the trade-off was not worth it.  Now I am using a lower dose in combination with Botox shots with mixed results.  The spasms have decreased somewhat, but will never go away.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	12/11/2008 11:16:40 AM	I have been prescribed this drug for cluster headaches.  I only take the drug when I am having the headaches.  I have found that taking this prescription before flying prevents cluster headache occurrances.  Keeping a headache diary pinpointed when a cluster headache cycle began;that is how I was able to determine one of the triggers.  My neurologist was the one who suggested taking Carbitrol two weeks before flying.  
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/14/2008 4:34:13 PM	I've only been on Carbatrol for 2 mo's now &amp; it seems to be working. I had brain surgery 15 yrs ago to remove a blood clot, was put on Dilantin to control seizures, but after 5 years it quit working for me. Now I take Lamictal and 'average'1 grandmal a year with a few 'petite's' here &amp; there. I started having really bad anxiety attacks and was prescribed Xanax but I ended up taking that more than I wanted just to feel 'normal'. So I was just prescribed Carbatrol and I'm already taking less than half of the amount of Xanax I had been. I don't get the attacks I was having so I'm weaning myself of the Xanax.  Plus it can't hurt taking an additional anti-seizure med...BUT be carefull when you first start taking this! I take 2 a day (am &amp; pm) but when I first started-the 1st 2 days, I was crashing into walls, dizzy turning my head when I was sitting! Felt like my heart rate was about 12 and felt like I HAD TO MAKE myself breathe! Scary, so I took 1 a day at night for a week, so my body could get used to it then started taking them 2x a day and I feel perfectly normal now.

But, I'm having to increase the dosage to 4,5 or 6 times a day depending on the severity of the pain.  I don't know what causes the nerve to act up but I have bouts of pain every so often.  I usually find that 3 pills a day work for me but when the nerve decides to act up I use up to 6 a day with my doctor's permission of course.  I hope this drug works for others with Trigeminal Neuralgia which is a very very painful condition.  Good luck.
