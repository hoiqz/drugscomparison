I've been taking this med only to fill sick to my stomach and my Doc keeps telling me how odd this is. I guess he never read the sideffects. Know I'm on this pill for the rest of my life. Isn't there any kind of natural pill out there???

Deep Vein Thrombosis Prevention	lgiven, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/18/2012 5:23:42 PM	The thing that was most bothersome was the regular trips to the lab for blood draws.  I now have a meter that allows me to self-test at home.  I do it once a week and call in my results.  I stay within my theraputic range much more by testing once a week instead of the once a month I was doing before.  Now my dosage remains the same.  Prior to home testing once a week, my level was either too low or too high and my dosage would have to be changed.  The meter and testing supplies are covered under Medicare.  If you are taking warfarin and have not heard about or checked into self-testing, maybe this info will help.  It is relatively painless..just a little prick.  Much less painful than having blood drawn from my arm since sometimes the technician just couldn't find the vein.

Abnormal Increase in Ability of Blood to Clot	jenn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	10/2/2011 12:44:24 PM	I have been on warfarin since I was 17. I am now 28. I have a rare hyper-coagulating blood disorder and if my blood is not therapeutic I clot right away. This drug has kept me alive. The ability for it to stay in my system keeps it more manageable. Yes I do have blood draws every month to make sure I'm at the right level but it's a small price to pay. The only side effects I have had is when levels were too high and they included bruising, fever, fatigue, muscle pain, and abnormal bowel habits. But as long as I'm at the right level, which is 95% of the time, all is well. I recommend contacting your doctor if you get ill, have an infection or get pregnant. The only qualms I have is that not many medications can be taken with warfarin. This pill sure beats having to take any other anti-coagulant which can only be taken by injection or I.V. All in all, I'm extremely happy with my outcome.

Previous to that I was taking Coumadin. When I was 45, in 2001 I had a TIA and then a stroke in 2002. Have been taking 10 mg a day since the stroke. The coumadin/warafin has worked great for the past 8 1/2 years. In the past 6 months, my blood keeps thickening. My doctor asks, are you taking your dose? Of course I am, I say. So now I have to go and get my blood tested weekly. I think perhaps I need to go back to coumadin, the real stuff. Has anyone else experienced the warafin not working?

Mine consistently stay below the therapeutic levels.  This required me to come in &amp; be tested every time they wanted, 3-5 days.  All for a finger stick I was very capable to do myself.   I did get in the high range once &amp; I requested a small decrease in the dosage, the worker said NO.  But every other health care professional let me know the dose they kept putting me on &amp; increasing it was TOO high.  My diet stayed strictly consistent, yet the Warafin clinic didn't believe in anyone being Warfarin resistant.  As the dosage continued to increase, up to 20 mg a day I started noticing side effects new to me.  When I alerted them (as they directed me to do so) I was experiencing a side effect new to me, Tinnitus, I was told &quot;Why are you telling us this, did you go see a specialist?  Warfarin can't cause Tinnitus.  I also have developed a 8o% increase in eye floaters.  The small amount I was having was already diagnosed and was considered normal for me.  The sight  impairment now causes sever restrictions with my ADLs.  I have been sent to a second appointment with an eye specialist for possible treatment.  I was lucky to be put in touch with a wonderful Hematologist Dr. J. Friedman fro University Hospitals Cleveland.  He did a very thorough exam, drew blood reviewed my case with many of his team members and as quick as possible had me stop the warfarin and got approval to start Pradaxa!!!!!!!   No new side effects no testing needed and even though the side effects might be permanent, no new ones have come up.  I finally am getting my energy back.

Make sure you call your doc after your lab if he or she doesn't call you to tell you if you should stay on the same dose.  I even keep track of my numbers myself!

It works very well. Long story short I had a family emergency and missed my INR appointment I called to get a new one and only had 2 days of medicine left but they set it for a week later so I asked if they could call me some medicine in and they said no. The day before my appt. I was in pain. I went to the er and they admitted me telling me I was clotted from my knees to my kidneys. This was in 08 and I am lucky to be alive. I was in ICU for a month and ended up with a bleed on the brain. If I would have had these meds all that may not have happened. SO when they tell me I will be on this the rest of my life, I look at my children and say &quot;GLADLY&quot;.I read one that said she had been off it for 2 months I would be careful especially if you need it. I do have 2 concerns that I can't seem to find answers to so if anyone can help please let me know.1. My memory seems to be very bad now, not sure if it could be the medicine or the bleed on the brain/stroke.2. I can't afford to go to the dentist like I should because of all the other bills, but it seems to me as if since I have been on the medicine that my teeth are getting more damaged.

Warfarin is a very dangerous drug and patients are not being informed of this.  It is possible that the doctors are ignorant of this also.  Kaiser has decided to put as many old people as possible on warfarin because bleeding incidents are cheaper for them to treat than are stroke incidents.  This is very bad medicine.  Patients are made to suffer and have their lives shortened.

Other	Greg, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	5/31/2010 4:25:11 PM	This is a very dangerous drug. It caused my blood to get so thin that I ended up in the hospital for 3 days, since my kindeys were bleeding and I was urinating blood. I had followed the correct dosage (5 mg/day) and took a PT test at the doctor's office each week. For the first 2 weeks everything was fine, then in the thrid week I was in the hospital with the bleeding. It took 3 days in the hospital and another 3 at home for the blood to wash out of my kidneys. They also had to give me 2 units of plasma in the hospital. The problems caused by this drug were much worse than the potential benefits. I had been given it as a preventitive medicine only, after an AF episode. I would urge anyone taking this to discuss the risks with their doctor. I am off this drug and will never take it again.

After numerous tests (and a misdiagnosis for 2 months of a torn ACL), I was advised that I had a generic abnormality and would be required to take this medication forever. I was told that I could not have children (not true, but very difficult), not to eat leafy greens or most veggies (not true, in moderation and almost every day). After 5 years on this medication and poor pre-op testing (for Gall Bladder surgery) on my doctor's part, I switched doctors. My levels are more consistent, I take less medication each day (from 15 mg/day to 10mg/day), I eat veggies and leafy greens. No one really explained my options when I was told I had to take this drug forever.  My doctor initially told me I could never have children (devastating) to my OB/GYN telling me that it IS possible but difficult.  No one ever told me that any surgeries would be a much bigger ordeal because of the drug therapy. And monitoring can sometimes be inconvenient when levels are abnormal. No one ever mentioned decreased energy levels, feeling tired all the time, and mild depression as a result.  Most of the information I gathered was through my own research. My best advice is to empower yourself, research and always get a second opinion - it can save your life.

Keep your inr appointments.

At the hospital they found a very small blood clot in her lung. After release ,and at home, she began to have numbness around her mouth, and in her arms and legs, and the anxiety that comes with such symptoms. Upon examining her medicines, the decision was made to take her off two of her meds, omeprazole and zetia. On night two, the symptoms returned and the anxiety, and again in the morning. Working through the anxiety, the numbness soon followed

I take between 12.5 and 15mg per day, and that dosage has consistently kept me within therapeutic range.  I used to worry that it was a lot, but now I realize that it's just how my body metabolizes the med.  So anyone who worries about high doses.....if that's what it takes to keep you therapeutic, then so be it.  As long as you are showing up for your regular PT/INR and are consistently within range, don't worry. Most importantly, don't ever be afraid to ask your Doc questions regarding your treatment.  My hematologist is fabulous....I can talk to him about anything.  I've learned a lot and although I have had some scary times with these clots, I feel okay about my health and my future.

Blood Clot in a Deep Vein	Groucho, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	55-64	3/8/2010 9:06:11 PM	Diagnosed with DVT in one calf while hospitalized, I was put on heprin, and warfarin while other CT scan results were pending.   They called it a minor clot, and took me off all blood thinners when I left the hospital. The follow up Doppler scan showed another clot in the other calf, I was put on Lovonox immediately, and 10mg of warfarin.  My INR was over 5 after 10 days, so I stopped for 3 days, started again on 7.5, and the INR was 4.7 after another 10 days.  I stopped for another 3 days, then restarted at 7.5mg again as per the Dr.  Sounds a little crazy to me, why not 5mg?  But I'm not the Dr. so I do as I'm told for now.

I had been on amiodarone for over 8 years and done the aspirin therapy route during that time.   Prior to the ablation I was put on Warfarin.   Thus far I don't think I have any ill effects from the drug.  Hopefully the ablation will do its job soon and I will not have to use any type of medication.  Looking forward to that day.   Until the A-Fib is gone it looks like Warfarin is a part of my nightly routine.

What upsets me is all the doctors I have talked to never really want to go into deeper discussions as to how to better control the constant blood testing and adjustment of the med along with dietary changes or lifestyle changes to better able control the overall &quot;harrasment&quot; in your life having to take this med. Why, I ask has this not been researched further like diabetes has. It seems to me it's like BP meds the longer your on them the more your body is accustomed to them and as time goes on the more dangerous to get off them. I despise having to take this med. It is effective.It's easy to use, swallowing a pill put a pain to constantly monitor. How about a home based kit. Prick your finger like DB do?Satisfaction??? Who would be overwhelmly happy to be &quot;addicted&quot; to this med? They don't have a rating low enough. [Like I am sooo happy to have to take rat poison every day] WITH NO ALTERNATIVES.

I have had very few side effects, but I do have to watch my diet (as far as the Vitamin K intake) and get those regular INR blood checks for the rest of my life (not a pleasant thought). Today I came back from a week's vacation at the beach and discovered HUGE and numerous purple bruises up and down the backs of my legs and I'm wondering if the med is related to this huge spell of unknown bruising. I know I'm an easy bruiser but this is the worst it's ever been. I go get my INR tested tomorrow so I guess I'll consult with them.I'm also wondering if a high dosage of the painkiller hydrocodone can cause this kind of symptom. My arthritis has been very bad this past month so I've taken more of that painkiller than usual.

An emergency faciotomy was done. I now have severe scars and neuropathic pain that was once unbearable. Warfarin has kept my blood flowing well. I take 6mg now, a monthly pt/inr check. It makes me drowsy so I take at night. However the generic change the manufactures so I hope the new one works as well.

I tried Aggrenox (got migraines) and Plavix (vomiting every day after 90 days of taking it), so I can easily say I've tried the rest and Coumadin has been the best.

I was on Heparin (IV) and Coumadin in the hospital and was sent home on 7mg of Coumadin. I am taking the generic Warfarin but was told it is just the same. Unfortunately I do not have insurance and have not been able to go get my blood tested daily like requested by my doctor. Does anyone have any suggestions or experiences as to what might happen if I can't monitor my INR/PTT results and I keep taking the 7mg per day that I am taking? I really need some advice to make sure things don't get worse.

I get retested for my clots in my leg in July. I am still experiencing some moderate pain in my leg and burning in my foot. I am tested about every two weeks for INR. I have had a real problem with keeping my level between 2 and 3. I can't figure out what I have ate or drank that makes it flucuate so much.  My diet is usually the same with no changes. I don't drink alcohol or eat cranberries anymore. I am fatigued most of the time and have dizziness off an on. I am unsure of what I should report to the doctor. I know it takes time to recover and I am not sure whether what I am experiencing is part of that process.

Blood Clot in Lung	PaulaVL,  Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female		5/9/2009 2:58:22 PM	I had back surgery with a greenfield filter implant. This was used to prevent blood clots; of which I never had. Then I had a blood clot to go through my lung. The teck found eight blood clots in my left leg. My blood now is very thick and I have small veins; if the nurse can find any at all to check my warfarin level. Then she has a hard time getting my blood out When I go to the hospital the doctor has to use a pick line for IV's and to withdraw blood. On top of that it makes me sick. I get hot, sweat, nauseated to the point I have to lay down. I also take Lovenox when I have to have a pain injection because I have to be off the warafin for seven to fourteen day so my blood clots timely. Then I start on the warfarin again until the next injection. This happens once a month for three months straight.

To other users, it may take a few weeks to get the levels right..HANG IN THERE..Their was nothing worse than the thought I was having a Heart Attack and would never see my family again.Easy to use...Take it at the same time everyday...Just let your DR. know of any other meds (even over the counter stuff) you may be taking, you would be shocked at what other simple things (even foods) will interact with the effectiveness of this medicane.

I monitor my INR weekly and still enjoy most of the foods I did before taking this medication.  It is not about not eating things you like, just eating them in moderation.

Extensive test revealed Protein C deficiency. Knowing why i get clots is critical for me. I therefore welcome my warfarin which i will have to be on for life. I now no longer fear blood test as i monitor my INR regularly.

One month ago, my left leg began to swell severly and was very warm and sore to the touch. Red rash also appeared. They tell me that the clot in my left thigh did not go away and is obstructing my vein by 2/3rd's. Now, my right leg is swelling, painful, warm and has the rash. Pretty scary. They tell me that there isn't anything, other than wrapping my legs, that can be done because the clot is so old. I am afraid that I am just a time bomb waiting to go off. Any advice is very welcome.

So far I have been quite happy with it, but now, as I have been prescribed some months ago with Lovaza (which is cod liver oil), the level of Warfarin changed dramatically. The thing is that my cardiologist told me that Coumadin is a much better form for the Warfarin and really I don&#180;t understand that. May be someone can help me with that.Thanks.

I'm currently 52 years old so started very young. My INR has always been all over the map and I can't tell you how thrilled I am with my at home testing machine.  It is a life saver for sure.  It's called 'coaguchek XS' and is about the size of a diabetic testing machine.  I used to have the older model which I purchased when it first came out 10 years ago, but it was much larger and more complicated to use.  This new one is a piece of cake.  Not cheap though and I couldn't get it covered by insurance.  The company often has promotions - I paid $1000 and the test strips are about $10 each although once you've been trained on the machine there is a company in California that sells the strips for less.  A little time spent online could save you a ton of money, but make sure you get the proper thing. I've been lucky and have had no real side effects in all my years of taking this drug although my INR jumps from 1.1 - 6.2 for no reason. My specialist just shakes his head and says thank goodness I have the at home machine or I'd be living at the blood lab!

I have been on warfarin for about 3 weeks (currently on 5mg daily). I lead a very active lifestyle and I am anxious to get back to my &quot;normal&quot; routine.  The side effects I have had the most of are fatigue (I feel like I need a nap at 2pm everyday), some anxiety, and diarrhea.  At this time they do not know if the ELVT was successful due to the blood clot.  This part is very frustrating.  I found this website helpful in explaining warfarin - its benefits/side effects.  http://www.heartpoint.com/coumadin.html

The most distressing problem, which seems to be getting worse, is blurry vision. I have to have my eyes checked every 6 months because of a med I have to take for Lupus. This drug does not cause blurriness, it has a different affect on the eye so I'm certain it's not that med. I had my eyes checked 12/07 &amp; got new glasses (which I knew I needed). I had my next 6 month appt very recently &amp; my vision acquity was exactly as it was in December. However, the later in the day, or the more I've used them, the blurrier my closeup world gets. I'm very near-sighted, so for the most part it's easier for me to take my glasses off to read vs. using bifocals. Since this problem started getting much worse, I have to enlarge the characters at most websites by 125-150%. Thank you WebMD for the option of enlarging the characters at your site--it is most appreciated! I wish all sites had that option!When typing in website addresses, I have to get within a few inches of my monitor in order to read whats been typed or to read any website address.I'm still trying to research warfarin to see if I can find additional info about this increasingly problematic condition. It's very likely I'm on so many medications that it is attributable to the combination of the warfarin with something else I'm taking--I don't have enough information to rule anything out yet. I just know it started after I started warfarin after pulmonary embolisms hit me the end of Nov. 2007. I was sent home 5 days later having to add warfarin to my medication list.The list is quite long because I have to take meds for: lupus, fibromyalgia &amp; neuropathies(hard to seperate),mild high blood pressure,antidepressant &amp; tricyclics,supplemental B12 &amp; Vit D, urological meds,asthma,pain meds, &amp; a med to reduce risk of diabetes. Hard to know where to look because of so many.

So I will take it for the rest of my life. I too have trouble with PTT/INR. Some months the doesage dosen't change but then there are several times when I have to go back and re-check in 10 days and sometimes I must test again in 10 days. I would love to know if anyone knows about a machine to test at home. My doctor wants me to go see a hematogolist to see what other drugs would be possible.

It was discovered after a TIA.  I had 2 stents put into my carotid,  I took warifin for a year.  It was easy to take but hard to regulate.  I am a 44 year old female so periods were the culprit.  They lasted nine day and were extremely heavy.  My biggest concern is what brought me to Web MD.  I stopped taking the meds a month ago but noticed that my hair seemes to be falling out.  I wanted to see if it was from the warafin. Apparently it is.  I was hoping to know how long this would linger.

The most serious side effect I have had is that after walking 100 yards or so I develop numbing pain in my entire left foot. Also pain develops just below both calfs in the rear of the ankle area. I have Peripheral artery diseaese and have a femoral bypass in my right leg. I am checked regularly for blood flow in my legs and I have excellent flow in my left leg and the bypass has increased my blood pressure readings in my left. The onset of my numbing foot condition was coincidental with my beginning using Warfarin in April 2007. Has anyone else had this side effect and is there a treatment/exercise or other relief for this problem as I need to walk for my coronary problem.

Just out of hospital after a full week at a 2.1 INR.  Back to Dr. tomorrow and have been started on Warfarin 5 dosage.  Have felt tired and a bit week.Fantastic physical shape from treadmill.  Today was first day back on treadmill.  Within 5 minutes my legs were itching like crazy all over thigh areas front and back.  Didn't go away so I stopped and rode the stationary bike.  Itching went away but felt exhausted after 15 minutes on bike at a 3 an 4 level.  I can do a treadmill for 2 hours with an incline between 10 and 15.  Not being able to work out today after just walking was irritating to say the least and then the itching.Does anyone know whether Warfarin can cause blood vessels to react in a way to cause this itching??  I was in a cool low humidity desert environment with temperature outside around 88 degrees.

At the end of this month we're taking me off of it so we'll keep our fingers crossed.

Fortunately it was found, and removed without any serious implications.   This was very uncommon for my age bracket, and the doctors diagnosis was that it was due to being on birth control pills, combined with getting sick with severe dehydration.  I have found that since being on the medication I feel lethargic, and tire easily.  I also feel a pounding / racing pulse when doing minor physical activity like walking up the stairs.  In addition, I have also fluctuaged with maintaining the INR levels, which is quite frustrating.  Intermittently I have dizzy spells and blurred vision.  Overall, it has been beneficial and served its purpose.  Considering the alternative, the sideaffects are minor.

Not sure if that is due to the warfarin or to the stress of all the stuff that has been going on since the surgery and subsequent clots.  I hope to be off this stuff soon.

Blood Clot	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	4/4/2008 3:40:17 PM	I was started on this after having an amniotic fluid embolism during labor with my 4th child.  I don't remember any of the event, so I'm not sure exactly why they started this, other than to prevent another clot.  They placed a filter in one of my veins, and was on this drug for a total of about two months.  The only problems I had with it were being EXTREMELY cold, and bruising like crazy (both are common side effects of the drug).  Overall, I'm very glad that this drug is available; otherwise, I might not be here today.

Upon discharge was told I would be on Wafrin for about 3 weeks. That was 5 years ago . Have taken 5mg. every day since with no problems. Get tested every month faithfully. Lucky not to change a lot..Only cheaged dose once.. When a better way comes along, I would consider for safety.

Even having a salad the day before testing will lower the count. Stoptaking a multivitamin pill one day will REALLY cause the INR to jump. Having to testfrom 3 days to 7 days to keep the level right is a real pain. I would rather take Plavix and not have to test so often...

I'm 41yrs old and I had a Pulmonary Embolism in my left lung and sm clots in my left upper thigh. I now have a permenant vena cave implant filter in my right upper thigh. The medication has prevented me from forming any clots that I'm aware of. But, I do experience rapid heatbeat from time to time and pulsating sensations in my legs and they feel heavy. I also experience some loss of memory or confusion more often. My PT/INR results have been usually below normal- around 1.20 on the average. Physically, I don't feel the same since my experience. I could use some advise if any is available?

I had already had a clot after my first hip replacment surgury. The medicine worked great but again had a very hard time keeping INR levels stable. I also just had a friend had a brain hemmorage and died dur to this medicine and not having his INR monitored often enough. This is a good drug but can also be very dangerous. If you take it, insist on having regular (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly at the longest) bloodwork done to monitor your INR levels. Levels to High OR to low can have severe consequences.

At first I had it tested once a week for about 2 months and then it was once a month. I do well on this med. I had Deep vein blood clots and was put on Heprin to start with but have been taking Warfin for years now. At Wal-Mart you can get it for $4.00 for a months worth. I take 5mg every A.M. about the same time each day. Talk with your Doctor before taking any other meds. with this medication as you can get really messed up if you don't.

The second night I woke up and my urine was like blood and had clots. this went on gor 3 days before the reduction in amount took effect. I started again with 4mg and within two days the same thing. Went to hospital and they gave me vitamine K and after 1 day the condition improved. I am now on 3mg and everything is going ok. If your doc. gives you this be sure to take the proton test every day for the first week. I was only taking the proton test each week to start.Be very careful this is a dangerious drug.

Myocardial Reinfarction Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/29/2007 12:46:37 PM	My mother was given this drug and she bleed in her brain and intestines within hours of her first dose and died.  She was 60 years old, and the doctors gave her warafin and asparin within 24 hours of each other.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER BLOOD THINNERS IN YOUR SYSTEM!  It has a 4-8% chance of sever bleeding in first time users.  That means 4-8 people out of 100 WILL BLEED SEVERLY the very first time they take warafin.  USE CAUTION BEFORE TAKING.  SEEK ALTERNATIVES!

I experienced very few fluctuations in my inr the 1st time I took the meds, had no major side effects. This time, the doctor I was given at the hospital prescribed way too much and I experienced many adverse reactions (dizziness, memory loss, heavy bleeding) and after 2 months of dealing with him I've moved onto another specialist who is working to get me at a safe and problem free level. Please let your dr know if you are experiencing any side effects on this drug.
