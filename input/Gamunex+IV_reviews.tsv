I got 30gr over 6hrs x 2. This time I didn't get any headaches, but like some one else I got diarrhea. I don't see much or any releif from my pain at this dosage.

The highest rate I can tolerate and its still questionable is 200ml.  Taing about 4.5 hours.  My reactions are severe headache, nausea, fatigue, and achiness all over.  But after the first wee I am good to go for 2-3 wees and I am sic again.  I wonder if we dropped the rate again if I wouldnt get the severe headache.

A home health nurse comes to my home.  I am wondering, though, if anyone is having diahhrea from it; I suspect this as a side effect for me.
