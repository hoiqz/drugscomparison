Prevention of Abnormal Growth in Cells of Uterine Lining	do I need a screen name?, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	55-64	5/16/2012 7:37:14 PM	I was prescribed Vivelle dot and Prometrium 100 mg at night. I wanted to see if HRT would help with anxiety and depression. At the same time, I have begun some other medications for anxiety and now I don't know what is causing which side effects.  I am exhausted and I rarely sleep more than a few hours before waking up. I thought the problem was a  mecication called Kapvay however after reading here, it could be the prometrium. I am going off this drug tonight.  Although the risk was fairly low, I fear the risk of dementia.  I read a 2003 study which showed that when taken with estrogen for HRT participants taking EPT had approximately twice as many cases of probable dementia as the placebo group.  The other risk is breast cancer and blood clots. I hate hot flashes and anxiety but the risks  are scaring me too much. I am so exhausted that I can barely work and i am worried I will need to quit my retail job.

I was having &quot;sludge-like&quot; staining throughout the month and usually one very heavy day of menstruation with a couple of scant days following.  This medication has resolved the &quot;sludge&quot; and I'm waiting to see if my periods will be a little more balanced.  I'm only on it now for my second cycle.  The first cycle menstruation was still irregular.  Will see if the next one is any better.  No side effects from med. as of yet.

I was taking Birth Control since the age of 14 to regulate my menstrual cycle. I would have maybe 1 or 2 periods in a year if I didn't take birth control.  This is day 7 of me taking it. At first, I was very nervous due to some of the reviews. I have an anxiety disorder so I was unsure whether this would cause increased anxiety. It hasn't. In fact, I can definitely tell that my moods have improved. I felt groggy and silly (almost drunk-like) and fell asleep faster after the first few nights of taking it and woke up feeling great. Now, the only side-effect I feel is just a little tired within 1 hour after taking it. I guess I'm getting used to it. I do have more vivid dreams, but that doesn't wake me up. I think it's actually helping my anxiety! I only take it for the 1st 10 days of every month so I haven't gotten my period yet. I did start taking my first dose at the end of the month on the weekend since I was so nervous and unsure of how it would make me feel while working. So far, so good. My moods have improved and it hasn't effected my anxiety negatively...and I even think it's helping my anxiety. It's too early to tell if I will have weight gain or when my period will start, but I was just wanted to report my side-effects as I read a dozens before I started taking it. I have no increase in appetite or anything. Hope it works for you! So far, so good! : )

Other	gricha, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	8/14/2011 10:56:11 AM	I was prescribed this drug 2 years ago at age 51.  I went to a doctor who specialized in my age group.  I have always had extremely painful menopause except when i was young and on birth control.   It seemed like going into menopause I was in pain constantly and VERY GROUCHY and moody.  This drug worked like a miracle (Great mood/No Pain/Kicked me into menopause) I felt better than I had in the past 30 years.  UNTIL my opthamologist discovered I had an eye stroke. No one could tell me why, then I read the warning on the prometrium.  My gyno doctor did more research on the drug and found it did cause thrombosis in the eye.  She had never seen anyone else have this.  Now that I am not on the drug I am spotting and in constant pain.  My husband had also thought the drug had done wonders for my mood and made me Nice. He was hoping I did not have to stop taking this drug.  I wish I could have continued, but cannot risk losing my vision.

I was bleeding heavily for 3/4s of every month, for about 6 months  My gyne  put me on 200mg Prometrium days 16-25. Through testing she discovered that I had uterine polyps and did a D&amp;C to remove them.  I have had some itching and minimal weight gain, fatigue, dizziness and vaginal discharge.  Periods also became well regulated, sleep was awesome, 7 hours straight the days I was taking it. The worst side effect was mind boggling depression. I am prone to depression and did not realize that my latest and most severe episode, with strong suicidal thoughts, which I never had before, occurred shortly after beginning this med. My psych. discovered the coincidence. My gyne had never talked to me about depression and the likelihood that Prometrium could cause or intensify it. Some people have the opposite effect and are much happier and calmer on it, wish that were me. I like the sleep and regulated periods but have to discontinue it because the severe depression and suicidal thoughts are too strong and scary. Calling her tomorrow to see what my other options are.

Within the last 3-6 months I have experienced moderate to severe foot pain muscle aches,upset stomach and vision problems along with dizziness and fatique during the day even after taking it at night. After renewing my prescription and reading the insert on the side effects realized this drug could be the culprit to all my problems.  I decided 10 days ago to go off of it and it's incredible how much better I feel off of it.  My foot pain went away I'm more alert and my vision is improving! This drug took away my hot flashes and night sweats but overall I would say it's not worth taking-- the side effects for me were too great, now I'm ready to try something more natural and my sympthoms are not as great as they were at the start of taking it.  I'm done.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/3/2011 8:20:27 AM	I started taking prometrium two months ago to help with chronic daily headaches.  I had been having headaches for two years with frequency increasing to become almost daily.  My original neurologist tried to treat these headaches (which seemed to initially be menstrually-related) with birth control pills and an estrogen pill in the &quot;off week&quot;.  This only made things worse.  I luckily found a new neurologist who recognized that progesterone may be beneficial to me- to balance out the estrogen.  It turns out that estrogen was somewhat toxic to me, and that if I take a daily dose of progesterone I feel almost completely better.  This effect was absolutely unbelievable.  I literally felt like a new person within two days of taking 100mg of prometrium nightly.  I am currently taking it for 3-weeks and then taking a 1 week break for my period.  I cannot say enough about this approach for treating headaches.  I was repeatedly frustrated by my previous neurologist's inability to look beyond the &quot;estrogen replacement&quot; theory of treating menstrual migraines.  Granted, this is pretty much the only thing that is in the literature (I'm in the medical field, so I have looked into this extensively).  However, I wonder if this progesterone option couldn't help more women suffering from menstrual migraines.  I hope that more providers begin to recognize the usefulness of progesterone as an alternative to estrogen for treating women's headaches.

I never heard of needing HRT to fix the thyroid issue. I feel HORRIBLE on this medication. The dizziness and fatigue symptoms are and severe. The only thing I can equate the feeling to is being anesthetized for surgery. It is that powerful. Hot flashes have returned and the bloating is uncomfortable. I am not going to continue on this long enough to see if the weight gain occurs. (Ironically the whole reason the doctor put me on this medication was to help with thyroid issues and reverse weight gain.) Be VERY CAREFUL on this medication.

Other	icethistle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/24/2010 1:49:09 PM	I took this medication for several months to regulate my period. My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant so we needed to be able to track my cycle, and this definitely worked. I didn't notice any side effects, although I only took one 100mg dosage per day for 15 days of my cycle, so it was basically two weeks on, two weeks off. Maybe some of the bad effects that others are experiencing are due to higher doses and/or taking the medicine more often. I am finally pregnant and, because my last one was a miscarriage, my doctor has decided to keep me on Prometrium for the first 12 weeks in order to prevent another miscarriage. He has also recommended baby aspirin for that same reason. So far, so good!

When I first went on this medicine it was to controll my irregular mestrual cycles and to help with breast tenderness. Even though it has helped a great deal with the breast pain. I have also noticed significant weight gain, and constant headaches and lower back pain. My periods are not regular from time to time. But this medication has not helped with that. I was also not warned about the potential for serious side affects from this medication nor was I checked every 3 to 6 months as advised. but that is my doctors negligence. Also my hormones according to my regular doctor are normal.My Gyno should have never prescribed this medication to me. I am taking myself off of this med to try and get somewhat of a normal life back.
Other	julielynn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	5/30/2010 11:24:58 AM	My doctor put me on 200mg intravaginally twice a day 3 days after insemination (my 4th).  I used a 14 day Lupron kit and menopur injections (&quot;super ovulation&quot;) prior to insemination.  The side effects of the progesterone I've experienced are tiredness (going to bed a lot earlier than ususal) and scattered thinking.  I also noticed abdominal pain with increased activity (a lot of walking).  I'm not sure if this medication is working yet because it's too early for a pregnancy test.  My husband and I have been trying to conceive for the last 3+ years.  I was on clomid several months with 2 IUIs without success.  My new doctor told me clomid isn't recommended for women who are ovulating regularly.  My periods were regular and I was ovulating regularly.  I did have mild endometriosis and had surgery.  This is my 2nd IUI after the surgery and hopefully my last.  I am going to be 40 this year and time is running out.  Now that I'm reading all the reviews I'm concerned about taking this medication if I am pregnant.  Wish me Luck!!!

This was to stop my period ( bleeding 4 days a week, EVERY WEEK ).  I'm due for a partial hysterectomy in Aug.  Since taking this medicine, I have become VERY irritable, saying things I normally wouldn't to people.  My whole body aches from my toes to my head.  I feel like I have a bad case of the flu.  It hurts to lift my arms, walk,..etc.. my husband said he's throwing them out.  I would rather bleed then feel like this.  My job is very physical and this is not the drug for me, and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone.

I requested this type of progesterone after much reading.  I've started the vivelle patch a week ago, and have aching around the ovaries - I guess after not having a perior for about 5 yrs.  I was prescribed to use it the 2nd half of the month.  I'm anxious to see how it works out.  I know that after the 4th or 5th day of the vivelle, I have not been sweating - what a relief.  - And I have energy and excitement to do the things I haven't wanted to do in years.  HRT really makes a difference.

I was put on this after 6 months with no period- my progesterone levels were VERY low. My doctor and I decided on Prometrium rather than Provera b/c I don't tolerate synthetic hormones well..such as in birth control. I had no side effects while taking this, and like magic, within 3 days I got my period! And I'm happy to report it was really nothing different than periods I've had in the past. Normal cramping etc. I never thought I would be so happy to get my period. I'm trying to regulate to prepare for a baby in the future. I would encourage those who sensitivities to b.c. etc to give Prometrium a shot because it is a Bio-identical hormone- just progesterone without all the added stuff in other hormone drugs.  I made sure to take it right before bed, and the next day I would feel fine!

But at least they start around the same time every month. It is important to take it as prescribed and when. I usually take my dose 2 hours after dinner (eat nothing in those 2 hours)otherwise it tends to increase the dizziness and wooziness somehow.

I am now 44.  My doctor did agree to let me take the prometrium every other month after I complained about how tired, dizzy, cranky, bloated, etc. it made me feel.  I have had some of the worst periods in the last four years and it's really upsetting because I'm &quot;postmenopausal&quot;.  That word to me means &quot;no more periods&quot;.  Since I had some spotting over the last month my doctor has said I must go back to taking the prometrium every month for 14 days again.  I think I will seek advice from an endocrinologist because this is better than how I felt while going through menopause but not great!

I am on 200 mg 3x a day. I have noticed more tiredness and dizziness..When I have to go somewhere I skip that dose and continue on my schedule! So far after taking this med I have not spotted at all, so I don't mind the side effects b/c I am high risk with diabetes and PCOS so this may be the only pregnancy I get to finish!

Blood test showed low progesterone levels. Taking 100mg at bedtime. Its given me very active dreams and I wake up not feeling rested. I wake with a jolt instead of gently. My night sweats have increased with trips to the bathroom. Instead of once or twice its 3 or 4 times. No notice of any other changes positive or negative.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/6/2009 7:23:16 AM	I started taking this drug - 100mg after hormone saliva testing showed I had VERY LOW progesterone.  I was experiencing horrible anxiety to the point that I was unable to function.  It truly was the worst time of my life.  I feel like this drug saved me.  Prometrium works better for me than compounded oral progesterone.  I do take at bedtime and have had no bothersome side effects.  Works so well for my anxiety.

I had a miscarriage a few months back and have been irregular since, so my doctor prescribed this to regulate me since my husband and I are trying to conceive. I take it on days 16-30 or my cycle and last month was the first time I used it. I felt much more balanced... no mood swings, no out-of-control appetite, just drowsiness, so I take it at bedtime. I did feel a little nausea here and there, but for the most part I really noticed no annoying side effects so far.

I have been taking them orally, 200 mg a day. I have been really tired, but don't know if that's from the drug or just from being pregnant. The only thing is that my progesterone level is not going up like it should. I am thinking of taking it vaginally instead of orally to see if that would help.

It works. You take it for 10-14 days. The 1st time I didn't start right away, but I started after a month or so. Then after 6 weeks or longer if no periods, just take again and the second time I started before the 14 days were up. So I am always pleased when I have a period because I never had them but 3-4 times a year.
Other	TTC with PCOS,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		6/24/2009 7:03:29 PM	I've been trying to conceive for several years now and have taken this drug just after ovulation every single time.  While I do get very dizzy and drowsy, it does seem to push my progesterone levels threw the roof (usually 80-125 with high considered to be anything over 15). I know I'm not the only one who has experienced the other unpleasant side effect if taken vaginally...over abudance of yeast.  The important piece to remember if using this just after ovulation and during pregnancy...this medication doesn't work with just one dose.  It has to build up in your system over a few days.  You need to catch the low progesterone levels very early in order for this medication to be most effective.  Many infertility specialists choose to be proactive and start the drug immediately after ovulation, without any progesterone level checks to ensure the progesterone levels remain high.  Even with side effects, I'd take this medicine in a heart beat to prevent miscarriage.  
Other	TJP, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	6/24/2009 5:40:35 PM	I had a hysterectomy 7 years ago and have been on Premarin ever since.  I wanted to try something else and was put on the Vivelle Dot and this drug, starting at 100 mg. It definitely helped my sleep, but some mornings, I just didn't want to get out of bed.  The severe mood swings have left me nearly ready to divorce my husband, I told my mother I didn't want to talk to her anymore and I hate the world, including myself right now.  I have NO energy and am VERY depressed.  I thought this was supposed to create a &quot;sense of well-being&quot;.  Yes, I am very calm,...too calm...to the point I do not care about anything!!  When I am not &quot;calm&quot;, I am having raging fits and verbally abusing others.  I am getting things off of my mind, that have been inside me for years, but definitely hurting everyone around me.  I don't think before I speak and then am bawling because of what a mess I have made with my words.  This is no way to live.  Certainly a disappointment for what is supposed to be the &quot;closest thing to bioidentical hormones&quot;.

Well the medication made me very sleepy and would be right out after 20 minutes of taking it but could never sleep more than 5 hours on it. I have never been one to get acne but it made my face break out after a few days of it and I got irritability/mood swings  so bad,that my husband left and wanted a divorce, that is how bad it made me! Plus, I got the sorest breasts,hot flashes,difficulty concentrating, it altered my mood so much and caused severe lower back pain and I have a very high pain tolerance but my breasts and back still hurt so badly after 2 days of being off of this but I am so glad the beyond severe irritability is gone. Other than the acne on my face it caused, it did however make my face nice and smooth but that was the only good side effect it caused. I was lethargic all day with no energy while being on it.My advice, if you've got bad pms symptoms, this may be a drug you may not want to take because it is literally 15 times worse than pms. Good luck

Initially, I thought it helped and I slept better and felt better than I had in awhile due to the regulation of my periods (I have barely started menopause).  Due to a family emergency in April, I stopped taking the medication for a week and then realized how awful I had begun to feel on the medication, including irritability, bloating, breast pain, sleeplessness and exhaustion all the time.

The constant fatigue was too much for me to handle. My energy level has dropped significantly and I have become depressed as well.  The fluid rentention is also a problem so I weaned myself off the meds until I see my GYN. The one good thing is that my heavy days decreased from three down to one and a half.  I think the cons outweight the pros in this case.

I contacted my Doctor and then Pharmasist who both said 'take it vaginally'.  Since taking it vaginally, no more dizziness!

They had put me on Prometrium at first and I had a period every time after 10 days of taking the medication. After taking it for a couple months I wanted to see if maybe I'd start on my own so I got off. I never would start. So I got put back on the meds. I am 21 and still currently taking it. It works great for me. I only take it at night due to the drowsiness it causes. But that is fine with me. I wonder though if this medication will ever put my cycle on the right track or am I going to be taking this forever?

It does seem to lighten them, at least the duration.  I had lots of side effects; dizziness, acne, bloating, etc.  My provider said to take them at night if I was feeling dizzy.  I've taken Ambien before, and I swear, Prometrium might even work better as a sleeping pill.  I've never been slipped the &quot;date-rape&quot; drug, but I'm thinking it must be a lot like having taken a Prometrium!  He had also said to insert the capsle vaginally instead of taking orally, and I think that helps, if you don't mind the yellow goo discharge you'd get.  I also had zits all over my body, mostly on my chest and unlike any acne I've had before.  All the side effects aside, it's better than sitting at home for 2 days wearing a diaper once a month.  Until I get pregnant again, anyway!

My doctor did some blood work and said I have started menopause. I was feeling horrible. I had hot flashes, anxiety, heart pounding, couldn't sleep, and was miserable. He put me on prometrium, 200 mg. daily to be taken before bed. This medication has changed my life. I feel normal again.

Once in a while I will have a cycle of over 45 days which is when I will be prescribed prometrium. It causes me to have a menstral period and get back on my regular cycle. I have not experienced any side effects.
Other	Golden brown, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/8/2008 7:57:19 PM	I was prescribed Prometrium 200mg capsule to take intravaginally 1x at night for the duration of my pregnancy, because of I am high risk. My cervex is at 2.2cm, 6 months into my pregnancy. I had a leep proceedure 5 years ago where my cervex was shortend because of that. With my Obgyn knowing that went the extra mile by (playing it safe) felt it would help my conditon so that I wouldn't thin out anymore. I have regular appointments every 2 weeks to follow up with my condition.(Red flag) when after taking the drug for 2 weeks, I asked my doctor was there any side affects to this drug and does it harm my baby. Her response was mixed and made me feel very uncomfortable. She wasn't sure of the affects and couldn't tell me much about the drugs history. She told me any drug I take affects the baby but it's very little and I don't have to worry about birth deffects. I stop taking the drug immediately anyway and looked on this site to find answers. After doing research I found that there was nothing stating this drug would be beneficial to my condition. I also read that it wasn't wise to take during pregnancy. I'm upset because I've took this drug for over 3 weeks and there's nothing stating it safe or would help me with my condition. Should I be worried?

I am on my first dose. It was prescribed like you for menopausal symptoms. I am supposed to take 200 mg at night for 7 days every two (2) months.  I also thought this was strange but apparantly thats the way they do it now.  Others around where I live are taking it this way also.

However, she only has me take it for 10 days every THREE months.  I asked her about this because it seemed unusual based on the dosage I've heard other women prescribed.  She said taking it every month is 'old school' and taking it for 10 days every three months is the 'new way'.  I am just curious if anyone else has been prescribed this med. in this way. I am on my third dosage (in 9 mos.). and when I do take the med. I don't have any spotting but I don't feel all that great either.  The dr. said to keep an eye on things and if I start to spot to let her know!

In July of 08 I bleed almost the entire month and could not figure out why. I went to my doctor and had several test and an ultrasound. The ultrasound came back that I had a very thick uterine lining, whick even my doctor was surprised at the thickness. She then ordered a biospy of the lining. It came back as a hormonal issue. So she decided to put me on this medication to see if it would help me with my monthly cycle. I had no cycle in Ausgust or September. I started the medication at the end of September. I am happy to say that I am final having a normal cycle this week. I have had no side effects with this medication other than feeling bloating. I was so excited to get me cycle, and my 14 year daughter thinks I am out of my mind, but someday she will understand. My cycle is heavier than normal, but I hope it is only due to not having a real cycle for 3 months.

I am dizzy, nauseated, fatigued, my breasts hurt, and i am over due for my period (which never happens), and feeling homicidal. I have already gained some weight back that i had lost because i am ravenously hungry and can't stay on my diet. I even smoke more on this med. 100mg only, can't imagine what 200 would do!!! I would rather deal with the pain and gushing blood than this, but i really want to have a baby someday.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	6/7/2008 12:31:25 PM	I started using Prometrium about 5 years ago to help with abnormal menstrual bleeding.  I would have periods lasting for more than a week - sometimes on and off for a month at a time.  When I was first given Prometrium I took 200mg once a day (night time) for 10 days and it worked great.  My gynecologist suggested after about 4 years of success for me to stop taking the medication to see it my old symptoms would return.  After 4 months of light/no period it started again.  In order for me to get back onto Prometrium I had to have a cervical ultra sound, series of blood tests and a biopsy.  All the while I had my period - constant - for almost 5 months! After all results came back &quot;normal&quot; I was reissued a prescription for 100 mg (1/2 the amount) for 7 days (less time than original).  This did not work, so I had to take 200 mg for 7 more days.  The bleeding finally stopped.  After discussing the problem with my Dr's office, my prescription is almost back to my original doseage - 200mg for 7 days.. so far so good.  Yes, when I take Prometrium I am very tired, wake up tired and the pill sometimes gives me acid reflux.  Yes, I've gained weight - but to me, not having wacky periods is worth it.

My Dr said this medication would help, First the directions are take 12th day of your period to the 26 day of your period. I think I screwed that up the second month in. The first month I did it correctly and yes dizziness occurred. I also slept extremly well. My first period came and oh my God the cramps the cramps were very intense and the flow was very heavy. I had forgotten about those kind of cramps, I think I last had them when I was a teenager. After 2 kids my periods did ease up, so why am I doing this to myself? My mood swings are also a problem especially for my husband. He says I was irrational and mean spirited about 12 days before the actual period started. Since we are in that time frame right now, I thought I would analyze myself and look up info. I don't feel mean I feel obsessive, mad, sad and confused. I feel everyone dislikes me, I feel alone. This is all strange because my husband adores me and I know I am liked. Anyway I am going to stop cold turkey and get a second opinion this week.

I did experience side effects when i first started taking it for the first 3 months... but then got used to it. It works well for me.

I had severe mood swings/depression during the 10 days of taking this per month and stopped the medication and started another that I'm experimenting now.

Makes me sleepy at times and on the other hand a couple of nights were sleep was seriously delayed. Those late evenings were due to over analyzing of issues on my mind.  Experiencing extreme mood swings, emotional and mental, at the drop of a dime. Patients have worn very thin while on this medication could be due to the harmonal inbalance of the medication.  I'll keep you posted if it changes in any way but for now my husband gets the worst of it. Not enjoying this nor is he.

I have just started Prometrium today 3-14-08. I am a bit skeptical&amp;scared as I am almost 47 &amp; had to have a complete hysterec.(ovaries are gone)at age 30 so, I have been going bonkers/crazy for almost 17 yrs.on the up &amp;down rollercoaster ride of hormonal imbalances. I am already on Estradiol 1mg, Testim 1% testosterone gel/applied on wrist e/night/pea sz.amt.only(this stuff kinda new on the mkt.)my testosterone levels were in the negatives &amp;now this Prometrium because I am still having so many problems w/not being able to sleep, moodiness,EXTREME FATIGUE &amp; yes, ye ol' HOT FLASHES:)&amp; a big &quot;zero&quot; on the Libido thingy! Anyway, anybody out there got any suggestions, I feel so alone in this so many times &amp; the docs just can't seem to get it right &amp; I am now seeing an Endocrinologist w/hopes he can help me so,feel free to email me at suzyq61961@msn.com if there are others out there like me or if you have been there.I have been tried on just about everything out there at one time or another over the last 17 years &amp; I would just like to feel &quot;almost&quot; human :) some of the time atleast:) Lots of Prayers &amp; Lots of Faith, My Day Will Come..too bad there is no such thing as an Ovary Implant:)?? They can replace a heart but not an ovary but, would that work either?? Just Hangin' In There in Alabama, I'll let you all know more later, one thing I do hope, I hate to be sick at my stomach..nausea..we just don't get along so Prayers are welcomed:)Thanks and to All Be Blessed!

Other	dsm, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	3/10/2008 7:34:26 AM	I too was very dizzy &amp; very tired... Due to high risk m/c rate my doc has me taking this for the first 14 weeks of pregnancy to ensure enough hormones are there for the baby to go full term.  That is our hope at least!  Although, reading the label &quot;do not take if pregnant or trying to become pregnant&quot; make me really nervous, the Dr. assured me it was ok... I sure hope. haha!

My period was to stop however I have continued spotting for the entire time and my normal frequent period symptoms have already started again before completing the 14 day RX.  Before taking the drug I underwent a D&amp;C and uterine ablation.  I had a normal period within two weeks of the procedure and am taking the drug until I can undergo a hysterectomy.I am 45 years old and have three children so am fortunate not to have psychological angst about the procedure however I have felt like a slug the entire 13 days I have taken the RX - If I am not on my feet I am asleep.  Whenever I am home all I want to do is sleep and I do so having exceptional dreams.
Other	Sonya, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	2/19/2008 10:51:41 AM	I have only taken one dose of this medicine (to end a pro-longed menstrual cycle) so I'm not sure of the overall outcome just yet.  But, I did want to warn people about why they say to take it AT BEDTIME.  I was in bed when I took it but stayed awake for an hour or so watching TV.  I started to feel sleepy so I got up to take out my contacts.  Um, this is when the fun began.  I was stumbling around the house as if I had downed a fifth of vodka.  I had severly slurred speech, was running into walls, it was NOT FUN.  I was basically a sleepwalking drunk.  My husband had to babysit me until I fell asleep.  If he had not been there, who knows what injuries I might have ended up with.  Just thought I would share this.  The pharmacist should REALLY, REALLY emphasize the dizziness side-effect and the fact that you should not plan on getting back up EVEN FOR A SECOND after you take the pills.

As my doctor said, after 10 days at 200mg it should start anytime after final dose.  It started on day 4. No freaky side effects, but did make me sleepy so I was advised to take before bedtime.
Other	Nancy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	2/7/2008 8:35:41 AM	I was prescribed this med to control heavy periods, and irregular, short (every 2 wks)cycles in peri-menopause. Some months it worked, most months it didn't seem to help so I have stopped using it. I had no other side effects. I am taking Provera now for the same reasons and will review it in few months. I am also considering ablation or hysterectomy.

I've lost weight as well. I do not know if this drug is working for me.  I need another ultrasound very soon.

The medication 100 mg for days 14-28 is keeping the bleeding in check.  I do get a period each month, but not bleeding all month long.  The problem with the medication is bloating, slows your body down, and makes me cranky and nervous.  I wish I didn't have to take it, but hopefully it will prevent uterine cancer in my case.
