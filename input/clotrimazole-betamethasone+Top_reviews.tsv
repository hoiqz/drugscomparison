Skin Infection due to a Candida Yeast	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/18/2012 7:05:39 AM	Yeast infectiona reoccuring under both breasts but this clears up only after a couple uses.  Believe it or not even 1 use really helps alot. Does anyone know what  i could get that is closley related to this drug that I could get over the counter, have to use it often and it would be less expensive? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Applied this cream to the infected area before I went to bed and the next morning the ringworm seemed to be gone. I paid for this cream out of pocket and it is costly but worth every penny.

Few respondents in the area of anti-fungal/groan. Have administered the topical creme medicine which seens counter-intuitive. Fungus prefer moist environs. Seemed to do better with Tolfanate dry powder which alleviated the itch, but slight smell persists. Clotrimazole isn't killing it 100%, beause the smell linguors.

She said that its common and not to worry that it was cased from mosture and that all I needed was this topical solution. I have been using it for about 3weeks and it is working pretty good. The only thing is I am not found of the smell and when I first put it on it burns. Good thing is it doesn't stain my clothes, but its annoying to have it in the spot I do and I'd like it better if I coul put it on at night before I go to bed and take a shower in the morning to get the smell away, but you have to use it two times a day. So its still easy just annoying, exspecaillay depending on the spot that you put it in. *sorry about my grammar I haven't slep and I am on my way to be I just wanted to look up this med*
