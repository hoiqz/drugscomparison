Sedation with Ability to Respond to Stimulation or Speech	granny, 75 or over Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		8/19/2012 9:38:05 PM	First time I was not able to wake up after outpatient procedure and was transferred to mail hospital until I finally woke up more than 12 hours after injection.More than 5 years later I was given the same drug and do not remember talking to doctor or leaving the hospital or anything else for more than 24 hours after injection. Thankful to my husband for taking care of me and trying to keep me awake.I am making sure that I have a card with all my reactions listed, with me at all times. There was no record at the hospital and I did not remember the name of the drug.

Was given these 2 drugs again for the most recent colonscopsy,but something went horribly wrong. Going into the recovery room, I flatlined &amp; they had a hard time getting me back. I was not aware of my surroundings &amp; have no memory of that day or the following 3 days. Apparently I was able to function &amp; communicate but remember NOTHING! Went back to the hospital a week later to find out what went wrong &amp; all they would say is that I had a bad reaction to the drugs &amp; they had to administer drugs that were supposed to counteract the effects but they didn't work (these additional drugs are what they give people on a drug overdose). I believe that I was given an overdose which would suppress breathing, etc. &amp; wanted to sue but couldn't get a lawyer that wanted to take the case. Since then, I've had problems with memory &amp; have seen a neurologist who did an EEG &amp; he says that I have small seizures which results in temporary memory losses. I will never have these drugs again or use that hospital. Beware!! Talk with the doctor &amp; make sure that they are using a dose appropriate with your weight, etc.

I know that every person reacts to a drug differently, and also that the experience and skill of administering doctor seems to be very important.Having said that, my experience was excellent.  I had it for a bone marrow biopsy.  The doctor had done many, many of these procedures (he was a hemotoligist).  My experience that time, was that I was so relaxed and euphoric, that I would gladly have any procedure with this drug (and this doctor).  I was able to communicate, and semi-aware of what was happening, but had no pain, no anxiety. Frankly, for me, with this doctor and dose, what so good, that it is good that it is not available except in controlled environments.  I commented after the procedure that the doctor could have told that he was going to cut off my head, and I would be happy about it. I did not have any bad reaction, no nausea, etc, and woke up feeling great. I remember getting somewhat philosophical and commenting on my ability to think clearly  after the procedure and when recovering and standing up.Of course I can't speak for other people, but for me, this sis THE drug of choice for procedures of this type. I don't know if I also had fentenyl (sp?) with it as others have noted.

I was told it would put me temporarily asleep, but I was awake the whole time, but feeling absolutely no pain from the injections.  I've broken out in a rash with itching, but not sure if the Versed is the reason or one of the other medications given; i.e., fentenyl or marcaine.  Hopefully it'll go away soon.  Had no problems afterwards, stopped and got something to eat afterwards, went home and relaxed rest of day and went back to work next day.   Except for the rash and itching...everything is fine.

Just had the second for RNC(killing the nerve in spine for the facets. and I felt the first shot of Versed(little dizzy) then I felt the whole procedure. I talked the whole time of the procedure. Would not want this used again.
Induce Temporary Amnesia	melme, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	7/28/2011 2:49:55 PM	I was given versed through IV for injections in my spine.  I was placed face down on table and versed line was attached.  I was given a dose of versed.  I complained of hand pain.  Then complained that my iv site was leaking.  It was checked and I was told it wasn't.  I complained again that my hand hurt.  I heard a nurse say release her pressure cuff.  I remember little about my experience after that!  I am on day 2 now still wondering what the heck happened other than, my guess:  Given several does of versed before them noticing my pressure cuff was blocking the medication in my hand.  Just posting this so no one else has the iv and cuff on the same arm!  My aunt who was there said they kept me for a very long time becuase every time I fell asleep my blood ox level went down to 90 and I would quit breathing.  I'm so glad my aunt was with me who had prior medical training as a nurse for over 30 years.  She got me home safe and my daughter sat with me the whole day into the night!  What I don't understand is how this happened?  I'm sure they do hundreds of these if not thousands a week....why did they not figure it out prior to giving me the versed.

It was excruciatingly painful.  First, the area on my left back near the spine was deadened with Lidocaine, then I was literally STABBED five times.  First when a tube was inserted then four additional times through the tube with a needle with grips or something on the ends to collect specimens.  As I begged and pleaded for something for the pain I was assured that I had been given three hits of Versed in my IV.  Finally, screaming and crying, I was just going to get off the table ( lying on my stomach) and was forcibly held down.  Furious when they finally let me up, I went back to the recovery room and immediately dressed myself but they would not let me leave for one hour.  Too bad.  I was leaving but I had to sign a paper.  NEVER!!! again with this drug.  I have an appointment again very soon at the Mayo and fully expect a lung biopsy be suggested.  I will take two or three milligrams of Xanax before I go and tell them so when I meet my oncologist, radiologist and endocrinologist consultations before hand.  I would very much like to be on the clinical trial with the drug that will shrink the thyroid cancer tumors in my lungs, adrenal glands and liver but not at the expense of all that horrible pain.  This drug was worthless and I would have fared better with Ibuprofen.  Then they had the audacity to offer me a turkey sandwich, I hate turkey.  My husband ate it.  Now I know to take my own sandwich in my purse along with a Diet Coke.

It worked great!  I still felt the epidural, but I wasn't stressed over it.  No side effects - a little sleepy a few hours later.

This month I had to have a colonoscopy &amp; upper GI scope. I told them over &amp; over that Versed did NOT work. They gave me 250mg to do the colonoscopy &amp; another 50mg for the upper GI &amp; I was awake and felt everything. Doctors need to listen to their patients &amp; take the time to read their medical records if there are any questions.

I've been administered it many times for many liver biopsies and a cholangiogram. If you're being administered this for a surgery, make sure your doctor has given you an post-surgery nausea medication (mine recommended Ondanestron for a liver biopsy, but I'm no pharmacist). Either way, make sure you get the nausea medication before they give you this and the surgery, otherwise don't eat afterwords. It'll give you a cold feeling as the drug travels through your system, and then the effects will hit. Pain won't register, pressures will, and yes, you will have a hard time remembering what happened. However as far as an anesthesia medication that doesn't completely knock you out, it works well, it's also easy succumb to the sedative effects post surgery and get some good rest after the surgery!

Spoke with physician, positioned myself on my side and remember/aware of nothing until half way home after procedure. No nausea, no pain, no gas pains or cramping from procedure. Spouse reported I talked normally inmediately after, but was a little unsteady on feet, probably due to demeral. I had no headache. I would definitely use it again.

Sedation with Ability to Respond to Stimulation or Speech	55-64 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	4/24/2010 5:12:34 PM	I was given this drug just prior to two epidurals to help pain in my lower back.  The first time was a very good experience.  No pain, and absolutely no memory of the procedure or the next 1/2 hour after the procedure.  The temporary amnesia is a little unsettling, but a small price to pay.  The second time I felt some pain during the procedure and remember just a few seconds of it, other than that the drug did it's work.  I'm guessing the amount the second time was less since the amnesia was much less after the procedure.

It left me with a 10-15 year permanant memory loss and Post Trumatic Stress Disorder. I recieved this drug for an endoscopy back in 1991 and it was ineffective so they kept giveing me more and more until I stopped breathing. When I was revived, I became combative and had a paradoxical reaction to this drug. I woke up covered in bruises and was unable to turn my head. I wouldn't wish what happened to me to happen to anyone.I wouldn't even let my Vet use this drug on my dog when I took him to be fixed. The FDA needs to take this off the market, it's dangerous, cruel and causes permanent brain damage.My friend had a colonoscopy with Versed after I warned her repeatedly to refuse the drug. She was paralyzed, in severe pain (she has IBS) and was crying, but was unable to screamn out that she was in pain. She said it was like midevil torture. I warn everyone about to undergo any operation, dental work or procedure that may require sedation to state that they are allergic to this drug and refuse it.What is the purpose of an &quot;Amnesiac?&quot;  None as far as I'm concerned. I mean you KNOW you're going to have surgery or a dental procedure or test done, what is the purpose of causing amnesia other than to make the Dr.'s job easier by making the patient a compliant zombie. If they're in pain, who cares? They won't remember a thing.....well I have news for the medical profession...some of us DO remember what you did to us and are suffering permanant damage from what you did to us!!!

(got this information from report to Internist) Awake and in extreme pain during procedure.  Watched both camera and bp monitor when not screaming or kicking or grabbing side of bed.  nurse told me to take deep breaths.  Extreme pain.  Discharge instructions stated procedure &quot;well tolerated&quot;!  Do believe I was given 50 mg of demoral as nurse told me she was giving it to me.  I had told her I had high tolerance to pain medication and sedatives.  Called clinic records administrator and she related that papers signed by physician noted 50 mg demoral only.  Shge said unusual not to give versed too. Pre-op instructions indicated that I would be given a IV sedation.  Will NEVER use this physician again.

The amnesia/sedative effects were strongly in evidence and I experienced no negative side effects or after effects.

Induce Temporary Amnesia	Jim, 65-74 Male  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	65-74	9/20/2009 12:34:19 PM	I have been administered this drug many times by IV prior to surgery.  The last time was on June 4,2009.  I was having rotator Cuff surgery and they were going to do a nerve block prior to surgery.  They told me I would be in twilight sleep during this proceedure or at least I would not remember it.  The drug was injected and the proceedure was started.  They have to hunt for the nurve and sometimes it takes some time.  The doctor told them to give me some more Versed.  In about another 30 seconds he told them to give me all of it. He finally found the nerve and injected it.  I was never sedated and of course I remember the complete proceedure.  As I usually do I crawled from the gurney onto the operating table myself.  I'm sure this must be a good drug for many but it does not work well for me. I have had the same experience with many of these drugs including pain killers. I am going to make sure my Doctor knows that drugs don't work well for me prior to my next scheduled surgery at MD Anderson on 10/21.
Additional Local Anesthesia	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/28/2009 6:58:43 PM	I had Versed on four different occasions: 2 bunionectomies, 1 TEE, and, most recently, a knee arthroscopy.  I love Versed.  I have had no adverse reactions to it.  I didn't know about the amnesia effect.  Just as well. I may have worried about it unnecessarily, because it never happened.  Anyone I have spoken to who has had Versed say the same thing.  They love it.

The precautions on this drug PLAINLY state that older patients need to be monitored very carefully on the dosage given - I firmly believe that this drug added to the beginning effects of Alzheimers.  That became her prognosis  only 3yrs later.Now my husband has had back surgery and developed an infection - they gave him Versed Inj on Wed. today is Saturday and he is still experiencing the amnesia, head aches, muscles aches and GRUMPYNESS.  I want my HUSBAND BACK!  I Declined this drug in 2001 for my surgery - certainly GLAD I did!!!! I WOULD NOT recommend this drug for any one unless you have done your homework on it!  I should have declined it for my husband - with diabetes and back surgeries we certainly didn't need what it seems to keep giving.  Disoriented, amnesia, violent chills, headache, and it should be noted that when its used as an additional agent to induce anesthesia for a surgical procedure - if you take pain meds (especially percocette) it compounds the effects of the Versed.  So if you need pain med - the versed will keep on giving!  I only hope that it will clear out of his system.  I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE USE IT as it induces Alzheimer like reaction, agitation, ....DATE RAPE???  someone might not know they'd been raped but with the lasting side effects they'd know that something unpleasant happened.

I was told in advance of the two drugs I would be given, but knew nothing of either.  I was told I would be awake during the procedure, and if I was, I can't remember a thing.  This is great for a colonoscoppy and trust me, you will think you were asleep and won't remember a thing.  There are a few side effects I wish they would have mentioned.  Tired the same day, they told me about.  The next day I had a hangover type of headache, flu like nausea and a lower back ache to beat the band.  Still, better than having to listen to the procedure!!!  Would take it again and not plan anything the next day.

It worked great for me and would love to have it again. The only problem was the nausea for a few days after and my head was foggy for a day after.

I'd love to tell you how well it worked, but I don't remember a thing.  :-) I recommend it highly for conscious sedation purposes.

Sedation with Ability to Respond to Stimulation or Speech	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	8/3/2008 3:08:03 PM	Very effective for colonscopy, BUT two days after I'm still dizzy, light headed and staggering.  How can you speed up the bpdy's excretion of this drug???

I was given Versed + Fentanyl IV for an upper GI endoscopy, the idea of which terrified me. Well, I knew absolutely *nothing* from the time the tube was placed into my mouth until it was removed. It was as though it never happened at all.  I would now recommend anyone who needs an upper GI to have one without fear or worry. I did feel a bit odd the rest of the day, but they advised me not to drive for the rest of the day, so I wasn't surprised. No residual aftereffects the following day.  
Sedation with Ability to Respond to Stimulation or Speech	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/22/2008 3:31:26 PM	This was given to me before an Upper GI type of test.  It was given through an IV in small doses at a time until I was out.  I was out the entire time the test was being done and had no discomfort at all.  I would recommend this medication as it worked very well for me but understand it doesn't work as well on some.
Sedation with Ability to Respond to Stimulation or Speech	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/16/2008 7:35:10 AM	This drug was administered to my 23 month old toddler so that an infected nail could be removed from her hand while she was awake. Though my husband and I pushed for another route we were assured that there were no side effects to the drug and that our daughter was at low risk. WRONG!!!! She had severe reactions to the drug including but not limited to abnormal heart rhythm, delirium, anxiety (that lasted for at least a week following the administering of the drug),easily angered or annoyed (also for about a week following), and over excitement. This was an aweful experience to go through with a small child. Talk frankly with your Dr and look up the drug before you let them use it!!!!
Sedation with Ability to Respond to Stimulation or Speech		5	5	1			6/24/2008 6:47:27 PM	The drug worked exactly like it was supposed to work.  My dissastifaction comes from not being told by my doctor about the amnesia effect. I found that extremely disturbing, and I've suffered anxiety and depression since being given this drug two months ago for a routine colonoscopy.
Additional Agent to Induce General Anesthesia	25-34 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	5/30/2008 5:02:07 PM	Had a urethral cystoscopy and they injected me with 2 mg while in pre-op.  It worked very fast and was very effective.  I was out of it, did not care about upcoming surgical procedure anymore.  No post surgical side effects besides minor drowsiness.  Highly recommended.
Additional Local Anesthesia		1	1	1			5/20/2008 1:55:13 PM	This medication made me sick for 5 days after it was injected through my IV. I had nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and could not stomach nothing for 5 days. Will not take this medication again. First time I had it I also had the same effect, as the second time..

Im still having the feeling of dizziness and foggy mind 2 days after the surgery. Anyone else have this? Email me at angeliz8385@yahoo.com
Sedation with Ability to Respond to Stimulation or Speech	Haywood Jablomi, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Male	25-34	4/10/2008 8:34:31 AM	Worked decent for me before/during a SI Joint Denervation procedure.  Helped calm me down some I guess since it was my very 1st time being sedated in my life.  If this was supposed to help pain...it failed in that regard because I could feel every move that the Dr made and every move hurt but was tolerable and short lived.  For anxiousness I would say this works.  For pain none at all that I could tell because I have had similar procedure without any sedation or pain relief this actually hurt worse!  Atleast it takes some anxiety away of getting naked in front of a bunch of people.  Humm....maybe it's pretty good stuff afterall!

The nurse came from behind and put it in my IV as I was having my throat numbed by another nurse, after throat was numbed nurse behind me said &quot;ok lay on your left side&quot; dont even remember my head hitting the pillow. no pain, no discomfort at all but very &quot;out of it&quot; for the rest of the day and night. would highly recommend.

I did not feel a thing except a very slight pinch when the numbing medication was injected. Also have had this medication before two surgeries for pre-surgery anxiety. Worked well then too.
Induce Temporary Amnesia	cakelady, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/29/2008 3:19:40 PM	Used w/demerol for colonoscopy and used alone for endoscopy. Both times were fine, had no problems whatsoever. 
Induce Temporary Amnesia	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	2/28/2008 5:57:13 PM	I was given this, without consent, during my colonoscopy. This was the ONLY drug they used. No pain killers or anything. If people say that this drug worked for them it is only because they were given that in addition to pain medications through an IV. This drug only has a calming effect as well as an amnesic effect, it is not a pain killer. If you are only given this drug you will be in massive pain. Believe me I was. This drug is given to erase the memory of a traumatic medical procedure. Do this not sound unethical to anyone else? 
Additional Local Anesthesia	Snowden, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/15/2008 6:56:17 AM	I have steroid injections in my spinal cord every three months. This medicine has made me able to go through with this painful procedure.Great results,I was tired most of the day but felt fine altogether.

This drug does not work for everyone and if it doesn't, the experience can be horrendous.

It worked well, but for 48 hours I was lightheaded, restless, cold and clammy, nauseous, muscle aches and pains. 4 days after the procedure, I'm still foggy and out of it.

Stay away from this stuff.....far away if you're smart!!!!!!
