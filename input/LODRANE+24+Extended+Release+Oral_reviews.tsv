It does dry up the fluid, but I am so lethargic and sleepy when taking Lodrane that I don't feel human.    The Dr. wants to continue, but after mailing in my last refill, Medco wrote and informed me that this is being taken off the market. I'm very glad that it is. I was planning on stopping it. Recently it has made me feel much worse than usual, and seem to be having more vision problems.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	4/1/2011 7:49:10 PM	was put on this with an acute exacerbation of asthma/sinusitis/bronchitis- Definitely dried up secretions, so much so that I thought I was going to die because I could not move air in and out! Have history of asthma, headaches,and ulcers. Doctor did not warn me about any of these side effects- I experienced them all! Will NEVER take this again. Glad it helps someone with simple allergies.. but if you have asthma... BEWARE!

Other	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	2/5/2010 1:04:28 AM	I have a very sever allergy to some types of grass, weeds and dust. I have tried everything out there. Zyrtec, claritin, benadryl, allegra, eye drops, nasal sprays and a whole list of others both perscription and over the counter. Lodrane 24er is the absolute best thing ever. I take it once a day and I am totally comfortable and free from any allergy symptom. I do security work and have been standing in the middle of grain silos, dusty rundown buildings and other like places and have been just fine with no allergy reactions while taking this medicine. I have had no side effects at all and am extremely pleased with Lodrane.

Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	45-54	12/18/2009 5:37:40 PM	i have recently decided that lodrain makes me have tachycardia or a racing pulse. It also makes me hyperactive to the point that others have noticed. Most disturbing of all is that i am quite sure now that it directly effects my memory in an adverse way for up to 48 hours after i take a pill. When i take it i have difficulty naming common objects and remembering the names of people places and things that i would commonly know. i will not take this stuff again.

Stuffy Nose	crack1111, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	45-54	6/12/2009 9:28:24 PM	Diagnosis: Common cold, 7 days. Can't work a full day - exhausted by noon. Congestion cleared, but have constant headache; symptoms appear to be due to the medication, not sinus, because the congestion is gone. My colds are usually almost gone after 4 days; stopping this medication.

Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	10/17/2008 9:01:00 PM	I had no issue with this. I have taken a 10 day treatment and went to Disney with my kids for 7 of those days.It did clear up my congestion and made my trip much better.

Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	5	1	Female	13-18	6/19/2008 7:26:53 PM	Lodrane has helped my daughter (14) with the inflammation in her sinus and ears, however, it has caused severe side effects.  She's been walking around in a daze for three days and is having hallucinations and hearing things that aren't there.  I only figured out this morning that it had to be that medicine because she hasn't taken anything new.  I am very disappointed that my dr. didn't warn me of these side effects and give us more information on the drug itself.  I pray no one else gives this drug to their child.  I have read research done on it and found that it's never been tested on children before!
Stuffy Nose		1	4	1			6/18/2008 9:07:43 PM	My doctor has prescribed Lodrane 24 ER for me twice and both times I was not satisfied.  Perhaps, it is the wrong medication for my allergies but it didn't make any impact at all.  I have congestion, coughing, watery eyes -- it helped for none of the issues I have.I see it has helped others, so maybe it is worth a try for you but it did NOT help me.

Only difficulty is that it completely wipes me out. It leaves you exhausted and very spaced-out. Make sure you know how you will react to this before you drive anywhere!

I went throug 3 antibiotics, and 2 dose packs. Lodrane made the difference! Finally. I love it!
