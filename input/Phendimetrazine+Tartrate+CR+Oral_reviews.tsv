Overweight	Satisfied, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/17/2011 4:35:07 AM	If you are overweight and in good health this is the medicine you need! The appetite suppressing effects that this medicine has is unbelievable and that was my main problem with losing weight. I always always overate at meals and then snacked constantly on junk food throughout the day. The amount of calories I consumed in a day was probably twice the &quot;suggested&quot; amount. When I take phendimetrazine it completely stifles that hungry feeling that made me graze all day long and the boost of energy really keeps you moving. You won't be able to sit still, which is great! 
Other	Phen for Me?, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	5/24/2011 4:28:44 PM	Started taking phendimetrazine last Tuesday...opted to be part of a study that a friend of mine told me about. I'm 5'9, 144lbs - by no means overweight. Yet, I was trying to shed just 10-15lbs to get back down to the weight I once loved and felt my best at. 2 a day/hour before meals. First day it surpressed my appetite and I was more than a little surprised - thought I hit the jackpot, as I am the queen of snacking throughout the day. 2nd and 3rd day didn't work as well as the first, 4th and 5th day worked good again. Now I'm on my 7th day and today it hardly worked. Not sure what all the back and forth is about because I haven't done anything different. I will say that I've dropped 4lbs in the past week, but I'm also taking water pills :/
Overweight	ValsGal77, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/28/2011 10:16:16 PM	I started out at 289 pounds! Have been on this medicine for 9 days and have lost 13 pounds. Increased energy is GREAT! Haven't felt this good in years.  Maintaining my usual moderate excercise but now have no more increased appetite. I am maintaing a 1200 or less calorie diet. This is a lifesaver for me! 
Overweight	dana1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/21/2011 11:29:00 AM	I started this drug March 17 with a starting weight of 227.  I take the 35mg tablets....2 tablets... 3 times a day.  I also am trying to stay around 1200 calories and day and do at least 30 minutes of cardio at least 4-5 days a week.  In 5 weeks I have lost 17 pounds.  I have tried other diet pills in the past but I feel this one works best for me.  Have not really had any side effects.  If you are ready to limit your calorie intake and commit to exercising this pill should work great for you.....it has for me!!!!

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	7/3/2009 10:03:27 AM	I started my diet on April 1st of 2009 and it is now july 1st and I have lost 47 pounds, only 3 months! At first the pills did make me jittery and hyper, they still make me a bit hyper but it could be energy from dropping all the weight. After the first week on the pills the side effects went away and I am perfectly fine. Sometime's I forget to take the pill, but in the long run, it helps with my cravings and how much food I do eat. My stomach has shrank and my portions are a lot smaller, but this is also in good aid of my weight lose programm, I am under supervision and I beleive not only is it the pills but the low carb, fat and exercise as well. This is most improtant otherwise like any diet or diet aid once you get off and you eat like you used to, it will come back. Anyone taking this pill must know that if given it, it is because they are basically considered morbid obese, the pills is a miracle drug but YOU HAVE TO know that your diet is going to be changed forever, otherwise once off it, the weight will come back. It is the best jump start I have ever had, since I have tried my whole life just to loose some weight, in three months I have lost half of my dream weight goal! Drink A LOT of water, A LOT!And best used under supervision, most clinics or places that provide this medication give you a blood test and EKG before administering the pill to its patients. Other than that, I love them and am glad I was introduced to them! They are a miracle for me!

I take 1 pill at 10:00 am 105mg amd then another at 3:00 pm 35mg.  The only thing that I've noticed is I get headaches occassionally and my best friend said she has noticed that I am not myself.  I'm usually an upbeat person, but she says I'm kind ho hum lately.  Anybody else have these symptoms and what kind of success rate are you guys getting from this diet pill? 
Overweight	MiRi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	4/3/2009 11:11:46 PM	The first time i used it i did lose weight, about 20 lbs in 2 months. I tried using it again after 3 months and the first few days it worked great but then it seemed to lose its effectiveness after a month or so on it. Side effects were thirst, anxiety (made me want to smoke!)and insomnia. Overall it worked but only short term and can be sort of addicting because when i would miss a day i would feel something was missing in my body...this is my last month. I weigh 177. 
Overweight	HAPPY CAMPER, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/27/2009 5:29:04 PM	I had went on Weight watchers and lost 70 pounds with diet alone. I started slipping around October 08 and over the holidays, gained back 25 pounds. I was sick with myself. I weighed 245 in the beginning and lost down to 175. I tried so hard to get back on track but, I just could not control my hunger cravings at all. I was so disgusted with myself that I ate even more. So, I went to a docter and got these pills and so far I have been hunger free. I can't believe how easy it is to say no to ice cream and cakes. Do not even want it. I do have dry mouth but, I am willing to live with that. I have only been on them 1 week and have lost 10 pounds so far. I am in love with the results and am looking forward to seeing 175 again. Hopefully I will get to see 150 one day, which is my ideal weight that I haven't been since high school. I would definately recommend this drug to anyone that needs to lose weight.

I actually have to force myself to eat because I forget. My mouth is dry most of the time, so a bottle of water is always insight. It stopped all my cravings, including SMOKING! i used to smoke cigarrettes alot until I started taking the medication &amp; it stopped it all together. Couldnt be more satisfied.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/26/2008 6:45:26 AM	I had taken Adipex as a diet aid and found it to make me jittery.  I like this option much better, by allowing me up to three pills a day I am more in control than with an extended release pill.  I have not felt jittery or edgy.  I typically do not take but 2 a day.  It definitely takes away hunger issues and boosts energy.

All I can tell everyone is make sure you exercise everyday and you will see results fast.  Good luck to all of you I will post another comment in a week or so.

Overweight	nobody, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/7/2008 12:57:29 AM	I feel no hunger at all and no side effects for now. I do not know how I will feel later as I have just started taking this drug. But because I do not feel any hunger I find it difficult to eat anything and that is just amazing since I have been severly obese (nearly 300 pounds) for the biggest part of my life. This drug may just save my life.
Other	believer, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/8/2007 11:09:26 AM	I was in a car wreck and had back and knee injuries. I was overweight and my doctor prescribed this drug along with a low-carb diet and lots of green vegetables. I lost 35 pounds in 6 weeks---- (went from 210 lbs to 175 lbs) without exercise, as my doctor was monitoring my back condition and hoping to avoid performing back surgery. Along with a supplemental b-12 vitamin I could not believe how quickly the weight dropped off me. It took a little will power to stay away from the carbs, but with this drug I did not feel hungry---but thirsty most of the time. I was drinking a gallon of water a day and not having to force myself to do it.
