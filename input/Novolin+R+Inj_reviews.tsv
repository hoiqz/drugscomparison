Diabetes	possumlips, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	45-54	7/10/2011 11:26:07 PM	I have to take massive doses to get my sugar below 250. I'm talking 100 units of Novolin &quot;N&quot; at night with some Novolin &quot;R&quot; mixed in (40-80 units) and 100 units &quot;N&quot; in the morning with &quot;R&quot; along with a miday injection of &quot;R&quot; anywhere of 30-100 units.The doctor has me on a sliding scale but the puny 3-18 units didn't cut it.What else can i do to get it blood sugar lower but by using more?A1C was 140 last visit.When i used what the doctor told be it stayed in the 400-500 range!I've gained weight since on insulin about 3 years ago up from 280 to 304.I can't exercise because of lower back pain.

I first thought it was the alcohol swabs but then I started not using the swabs and I got the same reaction. It doesn't seem to help my numbers any also. I have tried injections in my belly and my thighs and get the same unimpressive results. I do not care for this insulin at all. It is the first insulin Ihave tried.
