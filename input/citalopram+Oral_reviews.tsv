Depression	delightful texan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/4/2012 5:14:58 PM	I have suffered from PTSD for many years. After so long of suffering, I decided to go ahead and give the medicine a try.  Citalopram has definitely made a difference in my life. I felt like a whole new person. Starting off I had a tad bit of a headache, tight jaw, and dry mouth. It lasted about 3 days, that was it. I was moved up slowly therefore I did not experience any bad side effects as starting at a high dose will cause.  I would really recommend citalopram. Everyone around me says how much of a happier person I am, and I am not as afraid of being in crowds as I was before. Very life changing. It feels great not to feel angry, depressed, scared anymore like before.  I am now at 40mg and have been on it for 4 years.

However I had to switch to Bupropion due to the sexual side effects. I also felt somewhat lethargic at times. Lets see how the bupropion compares. Its only been a couple of days though. Despite all this citalopram definately fixed the depression.

Depression	bumblebee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	19-24	9/2/2012 2:40:01 PM	I have had major depression for quite some time and have been on citalopram since 09. At first, it was effective since I didnt feel edgy but much more calm. Just recently I have had major side effects like not being able to sleep at night and constantly tired and fatigued, yawning, absolutely no energy to do basic chores. My complete down fall is zero sex drive without being able to reach the big O. It is straining my relationship of 6 years that I hope I can manage until I go see my PCP in a few days. I am not sure what she will switch me to but I hope its a smooth transition and effective. I do not recommend this product
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	9/2/2012 11:27:05 AM	When I first took this medication 2 years ago, I had a great ammount of fatigue throughout the day. After about two weeks, that side effect decresed. After two years, I can not go to sleep at night. I often have to take sleeping pills and those rarely work. I have experienced dry mouth, grinding of the teeth, clenched jaw, weight gain (20 lbs), and a severe decrease in sex drive. As for my anxiety goes, it works perfectly. I have little to no anxiety with this drug but I am now deciding to not take this medication anymore for the side effects outweigh the results.

I noticed the changes in my behavior immediately; like within the first 2 and a half weeks. I no longer cried as much. The first week, I did cry like a baby &amp; I slept like 2Hr naps. But now, I WILL say that it makes me very tired throughout the day, even though I've had somewhat of enough sleep. I've tried energy drinks and I eat very healthy foods, but it doesn't last very long. Its weird, but I STILL would recommend Celexa to anyone suffering from any form of Depression!

It gave me worse depression symptoms; I could/would not go to school, antisocial, barely ate. When I got off of it, I went through a severe withdrawal consisting of cold sweats and rage for 2 weeks.
Depression	dysthymic84, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	8/24/2012 7:07:34 PM	I took Citalopram on and off (admittedly, mostly off) for a few years.  I did believe it did help me at one point.  I resumed taking it because my depression worsened.  I didn't see any affect from the Citalopram but had to stop taking it due to bouts of weakness/dizziness that started hitting me every afternoon.  They stopped when I stopped taking the Citalopram but then I had to deal with the horrible withdrawal symptoms (brain zaps) for weeks afterwards.  Also had very aggravating sexual side effects

Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Male	45-54	8/15/2012 6:49:19 PM	Although this drug help with depression, the effects were short-lived. From the beginning I was unable to sleep. If I did get sleep, it was never more than 3 hours. I'd be awake until complete exhaustion set in and then I'd sleep for 12 hours, when I'd awake feeling more fatigued and run-down than ever. The beneficial anti-depressive aspects of this drug lasted about 10 days, then I started feeling depressed again. I also experienced a lack of appetite, diarrhea, and slight memory loss. The drug did, however, lessen my urge to smoke cigarettes. I do not recommend this medication.

This new and great feeling only lasted a couple of months. I started to notice that I was extremely tired throughout the day even if I had a good nights rest. I was napping 2 or 3 times a day if I could. I was also going back to feeling irritated. The doctor raised my dosage to over a month ago and I have not seen a change. Still tired and starting to feel slightly depressed again.

Since I started it 3 years ago, I'm a different person.  I feel in control of my life and emotions.  The only problem I have with this medication is that it affects my sex drive.  I have much less of an interest in sex than I did before.  I haven't decided if it's worth trying a new medicine for that reason yet, since I'm so happy with it otherwise.

Is everything coming up roses, no, but I can handle everyday life.  I can see the joy of being here and appreciate life.  It was hard going to the doctor to ask for help, but this drug was defintely worth it. Thats what you have to do when your depressed reach out and ask for help. I am so glad I did.

I do not notice any side effects yet, maybe dry nose and mouth. I am very worried that this drug will affect my interest in sex. I have a normal happy sex life even though I am sad and anxious at times. I do not like taking medication. I felt I must be depressed because I have the usual financial, relationship type problems that face a lot of people at this time. I just felt that for the last 2 years I can't seem to feel vibrant or cheerful for very long at a time. Maybe a half a day. I have been turning to food when I feel anxious. I have no motivation to go running or dress up to go out. I have been a good friend and daughter, sister. I can't seem to do this without a little help that I hope drug will give me. I will review Citalopram again as I go along in my treatment.

Depression	DV, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	2/26/2012 12:10:29 AM	This drug in conjunction with &quot;Tramadol&quot; &amp; &quot;Cymbalta&quot;, caused severe side effects. I fainted twice in a 8 hr period. After the second episode, I was taken to E.R. via ambulance. I was treated (?) and released.My P.C.P., the following day, sent me to E.R. at one of our illustrious hospitals here at the Medical Center, Houston. This was the same hospital that put me on this &quot;Coctail&quot; to begin with while I was being treated there for 6 1/2 days.I was given Rx's upon release. 7 days later, while at home, I fainted twice in a 8 hour period. Upon release, the second time, I was told to stop taking the &quot;Tramadol&quot;. In my own opinion, after extensive research on web sites as this one, WebMD, I stopped taking, not only Tramadol, but also Cymbalta and Citalpram - the drug, that in my opinion, caused these serious side effects and could have killed me !
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Seacurrents , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/23/2012 10:33:38 AM	100% experience still few months out yet from the last month and a half it seems to be helping my anxiety/moods relatively well. In college I began taking Xanax with tons of side effects and seizures when it ran out from taking more and more to achieve results. Terrible addiction, lost too much weight and essentially became a freak.... Accordingly, for close to 10 years after I wouldn't take anything at all and lived with it. Several attempts for the right medication failed over this last year making me feel sick to my stomach or mental racing. Finally kaiser recommended this particular pill. For me at 106 I cut the pill in 3parts and only take 1/3 a day until more tolerant. For women it helps greatly with PMS.

It takes a month to get through them and get stable. I do not like the sexual side effect of being unable to ejaculate with my partner.

I also have minor OCD symptoms.  The drug, at the 20 mg dose, has improved my level of energy and reduced my anxiety, improving my ability to deal with the transition into a new life situation.

I have been having depression for 8 years and I had tooken fluoxetine before which made me feel real better, but if i skipped a day or two, it made my depression worsen. With this pill, just starting out, it made me feel so good and all of the sudden, I began to see blurry, began to feel like passing out, loosen in my bowels and I don't know. I prefer to go back to my fluoxetine.

Bipolar Depression	Cozmo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/7/2012 7:38:02 PM	Very effective in the treatment of Bipolar II depression. I was taking Depakote also, and that was producing the very undesirable side effect of passing out in the middle of the day at my desk at work. When taking only the Citalopram, this for over a year and a half of the last 4+ years of being on a treatment, I have no side effects at all, and no depression. This works for me, and it's ridiculously cheap at Walgreens.
Depression	Thari, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	2/3/2012 6:37:20 PM	I started taking Citalopram 40mg daily for depression. I took it for 4 months. The side effects were tough the first 2 weeks but my Dr advised me to give the medication time to work. I was not able to get to sleep, felt tired and drained all day and had bad headaches,didn't want to get out of bed, I was clinching my teeth really bad. I did not feel any change in my depression. In fact I had people telling my I looked depressed.  I was also placed on Lorizapam for anxiety which works great. I continued to take the Citalopram at my doctors advise but I still experienced the same level of depression. After four months on the medication I still have trouble sleeping at night. If I miss a dose i have the worse headache. The biggest issue for me is that it is VERY hard to orgasm if at all. I advised my Dr that the medication was doing nothing for me plus it was interfering with my sex life so she switch me to Venlafaxine 150mg a day. I hope this works better for me.

Finally I tried this for my anxiety, being scared of everything OCD depression and overwhelmed by every thing. I couldn't do much during a day at all. I have to say I think this drug has saved my life and I am so grateful to have my life back. I am on a relatively low dose of 20mg but it has definitely changed things.

I was on 60mg's and took an EKG it showed heart prolongation which I have never had before.  I was told it was from the high doseage of the medication.  Please check with yor doctor and make your own decisions regarding usage.  I still take 40mg's because the peace of mind is worth the risks.

Bipolar Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	19-24	1/5/2012 12:50:32 PM	Doctor perscribed me to take one twice a day after meals. I was 18 at the time and forced to take them otherwise being kicked out of the homestead. Sorry to say but the pills didn't work at all and honestly made the depression bad enough to the point of not caring if i was alive or dead. Well that additude got me put in county jail over the forth of july weekend three weeks after starting the meds. Proud to say im no longer taking them but i do have problems being steady now.

It started to work well immediately, and I feel 100% better!  It also seems to act as an appetite suppressant and I am losing weight while on it.  I am sleeping better, too!  I feel 100% better!  I intend on staying on it as long as I need it.  I have not had any negative side effects, so far.

I like the card it comes in as it makes it easier to remember to take the medication. The only side effect I have experienced is yawning tho it is not too excessive. I would recommend this product.

My mental health doc wanted to increase it to 40mg...I said no and stopped it!

I have been noticing recently, however, that some of my symptoms are returning--especially sleeplessness related to worry, fixating on my to-do list, and difficulty relaxing. It is still way better than when I wasn't on the drug, though. One concern that I have is going off of the drug. My doctor is prescribing it for one year only, and when I go off of it I am a little afraid that my severe anxiety will return.

Depression	Jessica, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	11/12/2011 5:45:58 PM	I started taking 20 mg while I was pregnant, to help with the SEVERE moods. I had never been on medication before but suffered with depression for about 10 years. also- anxiety, social anxiety, and possibly pmdd. Everything was great in the beginning but slowly wasn't  as effective. After I had the baby and quit breastfeeding, I decided to go up to 40 mg. I wasn't sure if it was just hormones. Now i'm irritable and agitated frequently (let me note that my son is a Happy baby!), I have no concentration, I can never get enough sleep whether its 6 or 10 hours, and my sexual desire is long gone. And once again, I'm back to my emotional breakdowns. I can't even hold my composure at work anymore :(  I'm gonna try going back down to 20 mg. If that doesn't work, i'm gonna have to switch..

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	big_H, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	11/8/2011 8:41:04 PM	Doc prescribed due to difficulty coping with divorce. Helped my anxiety immensely. Did get the shakes in my hands for about the first month. Sleep has been a slight issue. Infrequently have issues going to sleep at night and frequently have difficulty staying awake in the mornings. I've been taking for about 4 months, and the longer I take the more diminished my sex drive has become. Some minor difficulty with erections but that's probably due to my lake of desire.

Pretty significant actually.
Depression	peter29, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	11/2/2011 4:16:43 PM	Started taking 10mg due to sadness from grieving and alcohol abuse (3-7 drinks/day). On the plus side, the meds have definitely eased the urge to drink. The down side is I have headaches every single day. Hard to say whether they are due to alcohol withdrawal or citalopram, but taking Tylenol eases the pain. It has made me slightly constipated, I was hoping to lose weight since I cut out the alcohol, but I've stayed the same. The worst side effect is that I'm tired all the time! I feel like I'm walking around in a fog and am totally un-motivated to do anything above the bare minimum.

I was perscribed this medication for my mood swings due to PMDD. It has greatly improved the way I feel in the morning and my interactions with others. I still have my normal mood changes, but they are not severe as they used to be. I have noticed a change in my sleep, I tend to feel exhausted more often and have very vivid dreams, but those are things I can work with in order to have my normal life back. I take a 20mg dose at night just before bed.
Depression	mspinkfrog, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	10/19/2011 1:36:53 PM	Originally prescribed 20mg/day I found I could get nothing done on that high a dosage.  Since my mother was chronically depressed her whole life and so was her mother I decided to stay on the drug and lower the dose to 10mg/day.  Eureka!  Smoothed out my emotions and lets me feel normal. I have a low tolerance for drugs so this seems to be a more than adequate dosage to alleviate my symptons.  Less can be more. I have been taking this for over 5 years and I am just starting to have sweating and insomnia issues that are not menopausal. I shower more and read alot to get sleepy.  I have had problems with rashes when I don't hydrate effectively and wear poyester clothing. Easy fix, drink more, wear cotton and stay cool. Overall this drug does the job that Zoloft couldn't.

High-anxiety, racing heartbeat, agitation, restlessness and dizzyness. I spent the day alone thinking that maybe it would get better. The next morning I had all the same symptoms plus random muscle contractions across my scalp and face. I went to the ER and they gave me Ativan and I felt better. One dose of citalopram is enough for me. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	10/14/2011 5:20:21 PM	I was put on 10 mg of this drug, meaning to increase to 20 after a week (it was to be taken right before bedtime because of drowsiness).  I stopped taking it after 5 days.  I was prescribed this medication in order to combat grief symptoms and anxiety after the death of both of my parents.  I had high hopes, as I had never been on an anti-depressant and was hoping this might make me feel like &quot;me&quot; again so that I could do everyday activities without getting stressed and exhausted.  It did improve my quality of sleep and I woke up refreshed and energized, but I would &quot;crash&quot; later in the day, a few hours before I was to take my next dose.  It was how I imagine a drug user's &quot;highs&quot; and &quot;lows&quot; to be, on a milder level.  I had compulsive suicidal thoughts on this medication, and because of this I probably should have told someone I was taking it (I meant for my use of this drug to be private).  Nothing I would act on, but the compulsive thoughts were there.  After having one, I remember thinking to myself, &quot;woah, I can't believe I just thought that.&quot;  I was almost more anxious on this med and the boomerang effect on my mood was just too much.  May work for some, but not for my particular case.

I am currently taking 80mg which has been very helpful with my depressive symptoms. This dose also helps with my anxiety. Feel very calm and am able to experience a wide range of emotions. However, I am now concerned about the FDA warnings about the side effects of taking over 40 mgs-thinking of switching to prozac for this reason only.

Almost immediatly I noticed bad side effect's.  No sex drive (not able to reach the big &quot;O&quot;), tired all the time, no ambition to clean the house.  I finally hit rock bottom and stayed in bed for days, not taking any medication at all, until my husband had me commited.  The doctor in the psych ward perscibed wellbutrin (bupropian) and I have so much energy and want to do things and the big &quot;o&quot; is back (multiple times!)

For 4 1/2 yrs. I was never put on an anti-depressant so was not producing any serotonin in my brain. I DEMANDED to be put on Celexa and have noticed a significant change. Why would a Dr. allow someone suffering such a traumatic experience, not put me on anything but downers. I have gone to him for 15 yrs. now and they even have articles of my son being kiled staped in my file. All I can say is thank you Celexa. I almost attempted suicide on several occasions prior to being put on this medicine. Thank you!!!

I have been taking this for about 3 years, and I can really tell a difference when I'm taking when I'm supposed to or haven't been for a period of time. The first couple of doses were the worst, causing extreme vertigo and dizziness and also caused drowsiness but it has significantly changed me back in to who I &quot;used&quot; to be, the old me that I wanted back.

I've increased my dosage to 30mg and found my &quot;red&quot; anger poking through.  I've since reduced to 20mg and found it just as effective for depression (as 30mg).  Even keel.  Sadness is apparant at times, but no face-down on the floor depression.  Considering tapering off to check weight gain (18 lbs).  Could be meds, could be age.

Panic Disorder	AMS1010, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	8/28/2011 4:35:41 PM	I started taking Celexa for major panic attacks that flipped my life upside-down. I took the medication and it helped me for the first few months, but after about 2 months on Celexa it started to effect other parts of my life. Sex was not an option, it took away any desire I had, and when I did my mind wasn't there. I began to find myself zoning off for long periods of time, feeling like a droid. I decided I didn't want to be on it and told my doctor, she asked if I still battled with my anxiety and panic disorder and I told her it was still present but not as bad. She decided it was time to up my dose to 40 milligrams. I took the 40 MG for about 2 months and the zoning out and zombied out feeling was still there, I couldn't be intimate, and I decided to go off the medication without notifying my doctor. I stopped taking it cold turkey and experienced major brain spaces, periods of time where I couldn't think, almost like my brain was having a seizure. I would get light headed and felt sick, and had emotional break downs and vivid horrible dreams for a while. I decided I should taper off the medication, took my 20 MG instead of 40 and slowly stopped taking it. I am doing well, am not battling with myself anymore and I can think straight for the first time in almost a year. I believe the medication played a role in my recovery, but doesn't come without other battles.

Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	8/23/2011 4:41:40 PM	I have been taking Citalopram for over a year now.My doctor had switched me because for about 10 years I had been taking Fluoxetine (Prozac) and didn't feel it was effective anymore.One bad side effect of this medication has to do with sex.Males might want to take note.You can achieve an erection and have sex for very long periods of time.BUT you might not climax all the time or very rarely.This occured with my girlfriend and myself.I saw my doctor yesterday and he said it was definately the Citalopram causing me not to climax.He also told me that this drug is also used for men who have pre mature ejaculation problems.So that solved my mystery. So if any men out there are having this problem.It's not you it's the medication.I had always climaxed everytime I had sex before I started taking this medication.With me I have to consider changing my medication.My girlfriend is getting pissed and doesn't understand the side effects.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	19-24	8/22/2011 2:11:36 PM	The first week was horrible (10mg), by the second day I had heighted extreme anxiety upon waking up, dizziness, wandering thoughts throughout the day, shakes, loss of concentration and constant diaherra. Sleeping during the night was impossible but eventually started sleeping like a &quot;brick&quot; at night; a lot of nightmares as well.  I have been on it for 3 weeks and my morning anxiety has become minimal, diaherra daily, brief periods of wandering thoughts/loss on concentration; no weight gain (yet). Side effects became 10x worse after having only one drink with dinner.

I used to feel nervous, jittery, depressed and couldn't drive when the anxiety would hit.  However during the past 2 years, I noticed a feeling of calmness, no worries, no irritability, no anxieties and no side effects, feeling normal and just enjoying my life the way I used to. I love my life now and make everyone around me smile!

Depression	jspz, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	8/13/2011 5:47:27 PM	My dr put me on citalopram to help with my depression.  At first, it worked ok and didn't have any side effects.  Yet, after a year of being on this medication, I have noticed that I don't enjoy anything in my life and all of my relationships are slowly deteriorating.  This medication has also made me extremely tired, lose focus at work, and gain over 40 lbs in the past year-this is very uncharcteristic since I only gained about 1 to 2 lbs a year before taking Citalopram.  After a major spell of depression while being on citalopram, I decided to ask my doctor to change my medication. I am now taking Wellbutrin for only 2 days so far and already feel better and more hopeful about life(dr. said Wellbutrin is an NDRI which affects the brain differently than SSRI meds like Citalopram).  I hope the Wellbutrin works.

By end of dose (end of 24) hour period, some shakyness turns, but diminishes after a couple hours after next dose. Overall helpful.

I am not as short tempered, nor do I get sad as easily. This has helped me return to my normal self. So far it is the only medication that has worked for me. I have had a decline in sex drive, but that is a small set back compared to how I was before the medication.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Sunshine, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/21/2011 5:35:11 PM	I have had severe anxiety for over two years and have suffered with depression and PMDD. I decided after a severe anxiety attack 3 months ago to take the pills prescribed I started at 10mg for a month and saw marked improvement in my mood and a decrease in anxiety. The side effects were tolerable (dry moth and tiredness) then I went to 20mg when I saw a plateau and again it worked even better than 10mg and i saw an overall improvment but now again Im increasing to 30mg so I hope that it will be efffective to take it. I know it is scary to take that jump to take something but it has made a HUGE improvement to my life and my kids and family are happy to be around me now. I totally suggest it :)
Other	islandboy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	55-64	7/21/2011 8:00:27 AM	Started this med to take the &quot;edge off&quot; of my temper, not depression. Worked well for that and social anxiety. This drug is a definite killer of one's sex life. After 12 years or so of taking, I decided to try and get off this drug. My 1st attempt was a disaster thanks to my doctor at the time telling me &quot;just quit taking&quot;, not gradually decrease. Never, ever try it this way. I have since then been fired him. My main advice for those attempting withdrawal is to do so in a gradual, well-managed way. Keep a record as to when you start, how you feel day by day, any unusual occurrences. I started with a 1/2 tab decrease for a week, then 1/4 for another week, and finally 1/4 every other day for the final week. I still can hardly believe I am free of this drug, but I am and my life is much better for it. The key is to slowly step it down.

Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	6/20/2011 7:53:45 PM	Dr. prescribed this drug for anxiety and depression, and it works great. I started with the usual 10 mg. Seemed to have good result in first couple of days. Then the usual increase to 20 mg (minimum therapeutic dose) after a week. 10 days after upping the dose I had been doing well but had 3 very 'down' days. Called the Dr., he upped the dose to 40 mg.Had myriad of side effects at this point, including blurry vision, yawns, increased sexual desire, daytime sleepiness, night time insomnia, among others. Most were fairly mild (I can live on 4-5 hours of sleep if the trade off is feeling this OK) and passed after 2 to 4 weeks at 40 mg. Increased sexual desire is a good thing, I had NONE before. Girlfriend is much happier now.I have had depression and anxiety my whole life. I had never sought treatment as I felt that I was 'dealing with it' effectively on my own. Boy was I ever wrong. I should have done this 40 years ago. Can't remember EVER feeling this good!I just hope it lasts because it sounds like getting off of this drug can be very difficult.

So I would suggest coming down slowly. Other then that it helped alot for me.

It also put me in a better mood and helped give me more of an appetite since I wasn't eating as much.  I got a little nausea after taking it the first week then it went away.  The only negative thing was that it decreased my sex drive.

Depression	Terri57, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/29/2011 2:09:14 PM	citalopram Oral 40mgI began taking 20mg once per day and it helped but not completely. My doctor upped my dose to 40 mg once per day and it has definitely taken care of my depression and stress issues. When I began taking it I got the shakes a little bit, but that ended after 3 days and I have had no problem since. It is definitely a miracle drug for my problems. On a second note, my daughter (26) began taking this for anxiety - 20 mg twice per day. It caused the shakes to start out with which went away, but then her hands, wrists, ankles and lips swelled up. It was the citalopram which caused these problems. So, two different results within our same family. She would probably tell you to stay away from it. I say it works perfectly, but please be careful. First sign of a side effect, call the doctor.
Depression	Harmonee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	5/25/2011 11:29:08 PM	I have been taking 20mgs of citalopram once a day, everyday since January. I developed a itchy rash on my arms and legs. Ive gone to my doctor several times about the rash and they dont know what the rash is. I came home and looked up &quot;allergic skin reations to Citalopram&quot;. Well thanks to the web and people's testimony about this drug, I now know where the rash came from.... CITALOPRAM!!! Other than the rash though, I feel great!!! I am a lot happier and more focused at work. My sex drive hasnt increased or decreased. Tomorrow morning Ive got to make a call to my doctor and let them know I've found the source of my rash. All those years in med school and they couldnt figure out the source of my rash!!! That really ticks me off that I had to research my symptoms to get the answer. Even though this rash is rare when it comes to taking citalopram, I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone.

That is over 15 years now. But i have also taken my self off this medacine to try to take control of my life with out meds. And all i can say is it is easy but it messes with your head(it makes you dizzy also hard to stay aware with your eyes hurting to move).

Depression	walker1, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	5/10/2011 8:44:55 AM	I started this med 4 wks. ago @ 10 MG/day. After a few days I felt a calming effect. However, after 1 week I could no longer reach an orgasim &amp; my sleep was horrible. In additon, I was tired much of the time. I have decided to not take anymore anti depressants as most all of them have sexual side effects. I am not that depressed &amp; have managed for 60 yrs. I probably should not have started these meds. I have not met anyone who had anything good to say about these drugs. I do not know anyone who was severely depressed. Can I stop taking my 10 MG all at once or do I have to cut down to 5 MG 1st?

Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	13-18	5/9/2011 12:44:02 AM	I started taking 20mg Citalopram a few months into my freshman year of college because the stress from the new environment and new everything caused me to fall into a deep depression. I started feeling much better within a couple of weeks, but it does make it hard to sleep. I was then given another medication for insomnia, but that just made me tired all the time, so now I just try to get along with a little tossing and turning before I can fall asleep most nights.I've been wanting to get off of my meds for a while now, but it's been a struggle because I've become so dependent on them (as happens a lot with SSRIs like Citalopram, or at least so I've read). I halved my dosage to 10mg about 2 months ago and tried stopping them once, but I just started slipping back into a deep depression.Citalopram definitely helped me get back the ability to get up in the morning and get things done, but it's a bitch to try to get completely off of it and to feel 100% normal again.
Other	Maggie, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4		25-34	5/6/2011 6:34:14 PM	I went to the Dr. because I was struggling with weight.  We determined that I did not have much motivation.  I was sleeping all day and could not sleep at night.  I have a child so this was not ok.  The Dr put me on this becuase of the motivation.  I was worried that taking and Ati Depression drug was not what I needed but she told me to give it a fair shot.  I am more motivated.  Sleeping habits we back in place in about a week or two.  I am very happy with this medication though I do forget to take it a bit.  This hasnt seemed to effect me though.  I am happy with the result:)

Depression	dncates, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	5/1/2011 1:17:48 PM	I started taking this medication at 20mg with 75mg of amitriptyline at night to combat depression and anxiety. After 3 weeks on the medications I overdosed on both, trying to kill myself. I had to be taken off amitriptyline due to the effects that tricyclic antidepressants will have on my body after my overdose, i was put on 25-75mg trazodone as needed at night, and my citalopram dosage was increased to 60mg daily. So far I have been pretty content on this medication, however I am not sure if that is due to my life changes I have made since the episode. Trazodone is also wonderful for helping me get to sleep. If you are on this medication, DO NOT forget a dose. I forgot a dose one day, met with my therapist later that day and when I got home I was so distraught and upset and couldn't really understand why I was bawling. I also recently started hitting myself when I get upset and I had never done that before I took this medication.

I started at 10 mg and just recently after two years I now take 20 mg. Lately I feel very tired and thirsty all the time. The side effects the first two week were dry mouth, nausea, and tiredness. Easy to take, and easy to tolerate then without the medicine.

Citalopram (celexa) was first prescribed to me in 20mg, but later proved to be too much and I dropped down to 10mg/once a day. This medicine has worked wonders. At first, the side effects outweighed the benefits but I stuck through it. I gained about 10 lbs. But I'm happy, and hopeful. Took about 4-6 weeks to fully see benefits. I've been on it over a year now and continue to take it, no side effects anymore.- about 6 months after being on celexa (citalopram) my doc also prescribed Bupropion (generic wellbutrin) 150mg/once a day. I feel amazing! And i've lost the weight I put on from celexa!

Was doing fine for about a month and then starting feeling anxious, increased heartrate and dizzy/not steady.  I can't tell if I need to go back to 20 mg or if I'm going through some withdrawal symptoms because I reduced the dosage.

He was taken to ER where they suctioned his stomach and found he had developed gall stones.  One punctured his gall bladder and lodged in the duodenum.  This caused the contents of his stomach to back up.  Once all this was cleared, many lesions were found on the wall of the stomach and esophagus. He also had a herpes virus.  Due to his age (88) he could not survive the loss of so much blood.  His COD was listed as Severe Upper GI Bleed. Prior to taking this medication, there was no indication of bleeding or any other illness.

I really like Celexa so far. I have started out on 10mg and am changing to 20mg. At first, I had some side effects of sleepiness and my mind would race. Overall, I have not had any panic attacks in the last 2 months, although I feel like I come close to the verge of one. I believe that when I increase my dosage that will help. Also, I would avoid alcoholic beverages the first month or so of taking celexa while your body is getting use to the medicine. When I drank the first month of taking the medication my side effects greatly increased.

An explaination would have been nice on what I might experience.  I am happier than I was.  I still get sad. I still cry.  But that is what a normal human being would do.  It is supposed to make you function as a normal human with emotions. I am a better person on this drug.  Started on 20mg then increased it to 30mg.  much better for me.

Depression	MaryW78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	2/14/2011 11:26:56 AM	Switched from Cymbalta to this (because of cost), but it did not control my depression the way Cymbalta did.  It took a while to figure out, because the symptoms did not manifest in the way I was used to (was more angry and irritable than sad and weepy).  Also allowed my fibromyalgia pain to get way out of control too.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/12/2011 2:52:54 PM	I was on Effexor/Cymbalta for a number of years but they made me so sick to my stomach I couldn't take it anymore! My doctor switched me to this and I haven't had any problems with that part of it. I started at 40mg a day but recently upped it to 60 and I'm not sure that was a good idea. I have suddenly become very irritable and will lash out at basically anything. It worked great for me at 40mg, though, no noticable side effects and made the anxiety virtually disappear! I will probably call my doctor and have him lower the dose again.

Worked great for a while.  Went to 40 mg and it was horrible. Moody as all get out.  Now due to a list of side affects( night sweats, loss of sex drive, numbing in hands and arms) that I am worried about, I am taking myself off of it.

Other	Diane, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/7/2011 11:25:50 AM	This medication helped with all the anxiety, depression that comes from being bipolar and I wish I would have discovered it years ago.  I take it at night with my high blood pressure med and I sleep like a baby and feel very rested the next day.  This also improves my mood. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	19-24	2/7/2011 12:53:57 AM	I just started taking 10mg for anxiety this past week. I haven't felt any effects on anxiety yet, and I don't expect to for a few weeks, but I have experienced the stomachaches, indigestion, and loss of appetite everyone talks about. I'm hopeful about it's effects, though, as my roommate has a similar condition and medication and she says it helps her a lot.

I thought this over for about 2 weeks then agreed to both.  It has helped tremendously.  Circumstances haven't changed but this medication has helped tremendously to deal with life more level-headed.

Starting up again was tough the first few days but taking in the morning and working through the side effects have worked for me.  I am thinking more rationally, positive, and renewed interest in life.

I don't have to face those dreadful early morning wake-up periods, when I could neither get up nor stay in bed.  For me, a wonder drug.  Almost never experience the morbid state any more.

My mind would just wonder on and on and couldn't fall asleep.  I think it has helped that issue but I have noticed I have very vivid and detailed dreams now.  I noticed that I have a very difficult time keeping weight off too.  I just don't know if I should continue with this med, will be talking to MD on how to stop taking it.  I really don't want to rely on med for the rest of my life.
Depression	Wife , 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	1/24/2011 10:22:34 PM	Depression has eased, I don't cry as easily. I have been able to cope with the problems we are dealing with a little better. I take it at night and sleep very well, though have had some weird dreams and woke up yelling. When I took it in the mornings, I couldn't function, I was in a fog. I don't have as much jaw tightening taking it at night.  Still feel down though not as much, but am dealing with problems that are downers, can't change the problems. Everyone sees an improvement in my moods and are glad that I finally went to the doctor. Actually the doctor picked up on the depression and is helping me get along with life in an easier manner.

What a difference the addition of the Citalopram made!  I feel like myself again!  I have a tendency to have migraines but this medication has not made me have headaches.  I take it at night and sleep very well.  With prayer and Citalopram, my home is a happy place now!

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	1/15/2011 11:42:39 PM	I struggle with depression and anxiety.  I started on 10mg about four years ago and within the first couple of weeks felt much better.  It worked great for about 8 months, but have had to regularly increase dosage over the last 4 years.  I didn't notice any side-effects until I was up to 40mg.  Then I started experiencing decreased libido and slight weight gain.  I've now been on 60mg (the maximum dosage) for four months and during this time have gained nearly 25 pounds, have no libido, and have horrible acne on my back.  And, the increased dosage hasn't helped my depression or anxiety.  I also was camping in the jungle in Central America and forgot to bring enough Celexa with me.  I was without it for about 4 days and the withdrawal was HORRIBLE.  I was dizzy and confused and my face went numb!  Overall, it worked wonders at first, but now am exploring other options and can't wait to get off of it!  I would not recommend taking more than 40mgs - it had no positive impact on me, and numerous studies I've read have indicated that this is usually the case.  If you're on 40mg and feel like you need to increase your dosage, talk to your doctor about switching meds!

I noticed a change the first week! I was feeling mellow and nothing bothered me. Of course the effect lessened after some time; I am much more patient, however things still bother me. I mean it's not a magic pill, so let's not expect it to solve our EVERY issue.

Been on it now for over 2 months and am thinking about going back to something else. Didn't really help with anxiety, or my depression. It is cheaper than Lexapro but not as effective for me.

It has been a life saver. All the same stress and problems are present in life, I am just able to step back and breathe, make a decision on how to productively handle it and move on. Doesnt make me &quot;high&quot; or change who I am....just takes away the overwhelming anxiety and allows me to function.

Depression	ls1freak, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	1/9/2011 3:33:37 PM	I've been taking this medication for about 7 months now. I love it! I was depressed, angry and withdrawn from everyone around me and would bite someones head off without any provocation. I also worried about every little thing. After taking it for a month I started to feel better and mellowed. It's hard to get me angry now and the depression is gone and I don't worry about much of anything. Have gained 10 lbs recently but started working out and lost most of it and feel better too! Weight gain is only an issue if you let it be and choose to sit around and not work out and eat healthy. Can't reach a climax very easily, but solved my pme problem and that's a good side effect for me! There is no shame in taking it, I put it off for too long and regret it now. Life is so much better and everyone can stand to be around me again and I them. I've found I'm actually a fun person since taking this. Just take it! Wake up in the morning, take the pill and forget about it. Only warning I have is, take it everyday! If you don't you and everyone around you will know that your not on it! After a couple days without due to forgetting to take with me on vacation, I was back to my old self in full force. Don't let all the discouraging comments on this site sway you. Try it for a couple months and see what happens, if  you like it keep it, if not then try something else. But you have to give it time, it will not work over night! A month and a week was how long it took for me. Yeah I could feel something after two weeks but really noticed and started getting comments on my attitude after a month. 
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	1/7/2011 4:20:13 PM	This drug makes me feel great mentally!!!  My major side effect is clenching my teeth. When I was upped to 1 and 1/2 pills I broke my tooth and have TMJ syndrome.  Dr. switched me to Lexapro........made me feel horrible mentally.  I'm back on Citalopram but 1 pill now and clenching isn't too bad and feel mentally great again.  I take it around 8pm, sleep like a log and am refreshed upon waking.   Have lost 4 pounds which I didn't need to lose.  I took Zoloft years ago and it made me a zombie and gained 15 pounds on it.  I highly recommend Citalopram but most drugs work differently on each person.  Report your symptoms to your Dr.  Dosage can make the difference.
Depression	MinnesotaDadof2, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	1/6/2011 10:07:25 PM	Been on Celexa for about a month now.  The first week of taking this medication was very hard for me.  I would take it in the morning, like 7am...And it made me very lethargic and tired.  My mouth became extremely dry and every time I would yawn, it felt like i could faint or like a weird floating feeling...Very strange....But the sexual side effects are great...Increased sexual stamina.  I cant seem to climax very easily.  The side effects are not as extreme anymore.  My temper is much better, and I tell my wife and kids &quot;I love you every day now....Going to stick with it....THUMBS UP!!!
Panic Disorder	twatsi1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	1/6/2011 8:01:23 PM	I have been on this medicine for 18 months.  At first it worked well, except for the weight gain.  Now, I am suffering mood swings, which is not the reason I went on this medication.  I spoke with my doctor about the weight gain, because after 16 months on this drug, I had gained 30 pounds.  My doctor said this drug caused weight gain and caused problems with losing it.  With my doctor's approval, I am weaning myself off of this medicine.  He said that withdrawl symptoms can be severe coming off.  I hope it won't be too bad and that I can lose all the weight I have put on.  I also suffered from the headaches and nightsweats.   The drug did work for my anxiety, but the weight gain got to be too much for me.

Panic Disorder	Snow, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	12/28/2010 4:56:26 PM	I had panic attacks so badly I was not able to ride in the back seat of any vehicle.  It began affecting my everyday life.  I was not able to wear jewelry or even go through a car wash.  I began using Lexapro but my insurance company requested to change my prescription to citalopram because it is cheaper.  My physician agreed.  I take 40mg a day.  Without this medicine I would not be able to function normally.  I had hoped to not have to take this medicine all my life.  I tried to stop it on my own but I couldn't take the withdrawls.  If I miss a dose, I feel the affects.  My head feels like it is in the &quot;twlight zone&quot; or something.  It is not a good feeling.  I realize a person should not try to stop the medication without the help of a physician.  Taking this medicine has improved my life a great deal.  I was afraid that I would reach a point of not being able to function in society.  I am thankful and continue to take the medicine.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/21/2010 10:45:26 PM	I have always been socially akward and avoided driving or dealing with people. I had real bad mood swings. I went through lots of prescriptions and drug trials for depression and anxiety. This was one of the last I  tried. It took about a month and a half to work. Once it kicked in I became a different person. I don't mind talking to people. I have much more self confidence and I insist on driving everywhere. I have more control over my emotions. I realize it won't turn out that way for everyone but I  recommend at least trying it.

Depression	s12,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		12/15/2010 8:57:00 PM	Sweating side effects at the beginning (1st 2-3 months). I played around with dosing: taking 1/2 a dose 2xs a day, full dose in AM ; full dose pm. Now I take a full dose in the AM after eating ( never on an empty stomach. My depression is gone. I have had no side effects except for the sweating at the beginning. my teen age son notices when I forget to take it, so I think it is extremely effective. I no longer yell out of frustration  and am generally calmer and more tolerant.

It worked wonderfully so, when my son redeployed to Afghanistan, I asked my doctor to put me back on it. It has worked just as well this time. I can sleep without waking up in a panic. It does make me tired so I take it right before bed. I haven't had any bad side effects. My husband takes it too and it's made him much easier to live with by cutting down on his mood swings. We actually enjoy each other's company now. We're facing foreclosure on our home and I find myself able to handle it without panicking or excessive worry. I can cope with the daily stresses without becoming paralyzed with panic.

The first 2 weeks i was very irritable, that's tapering off now.  I've been severely/dangerously depressed since i was 16.  I've been on so many anti-depressants that didn't help me, that i lost count.  This drug has made me &quot;feel&quot; HAPPY, which i can't remember the last time I did..  I was suicidal and gave up hope of ever feeling/feeling happy again before this drug. I STRONGLY recommend it! being irritable and short-tempered for 2 weeks is a small price to pay for feeling hopeful and excited to start living my life with smiles, laughter, ambition, and a future.

I would lay watching him sleep wondering if this would be the night he would die.  I talked to my doctor and he recommended that I try this medication.  I have noticed a major difference in how I am able to deal with difficult situations.  My husband had a heart attack last Saturday and had quadruple bypass and aortic valve replacement.  I was able to remain calm and didn't let myself go back to the way I was just 3 months ago.  I am glad that my doctor recommended this medication for me.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	12/9/2010 5:45:48 PM	I began this medication to treat OCD and prevent post pardum symptoms.  It works well for me but I am very upset that I can not reduce my dose or discontinue the medication.  It is a double edged sword.  You may feel better while taking it but end up severely depressed and anxious if you miss a dose.  If I could do it all over again, I would try anything I could to avoid antidepressents.  It has been two years since my son was born and I am still taking the medication because I can't bare the withdrawl (fever, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, crippling depression, panic, suicidal thoughts, hopelessness.) You have to really weigh if it is worth it or not.

I was always worried and nervous about things in my life. He started me on 10mg and I noticed a difference in 3 days.

Other	SCstacey, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/15/2010 6:00:20 PM	I suffered from severe depression since I was 12 years old and was finally free from it after chemo due to hormonal changes. I took medications to control the symptoms. Recently I began to be extremely angry. I began to want to hurt myself, noone else. My dr. put me on this medication to stop it. It has worked great! I have to take it before bed but I have no other side effects that I have noticed. I will be reluctant to stop taking it absoltely no longer works for me.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Bob, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	11/10/2010 4:51:22 PM	My anxiety symptoms were brought on by having to place my mother into a nursing home. Along with selling her house and pretty much liquidating all of her possessions. During that process, I more or less woke up every 2 hours in a panic with my heart racing. After I started with the meds, I noticed a complete turn around in less than 2 weeks. I'm now weening myself off and feel so much better after 6 months of being on it. Plus, my mother's affairs have all been taken care of and I am very happy with the overall results of the home she was placed into and the care that they provide.If you're over stressed, talk to your doctor about possibly going on this drug. It's short term, I believe, but at least it let me sleep, so I could  deal with all of the issues and relieve the stress.
Depression	LKA, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	11/10/2010 10:47:11 AM	This treatment has enabled me to &quot;calm down&quot;...I generally am a typical Type A personality...constantly worrying about others, giving myself and time to others and not taking any time to reflect on myself. Noticed that I was becoming obsessive and letting even minor things such as &quot;spilled milk&quot; send me over the edge.  Described all to my doctor and after beginning this in July, I feel calmed, without feeling sluggish.  I just take things more &quot;with a grain of salt&quot;.

Depression	Bill, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	10/29/2010 11:18:01 AM	gave me headaches so bad I needed to be hospitalized, even being on it about 2 weeks gave me memory loss, loss of appetite and sexually useless, as well as mood swingsthis drug was a very bad experience and I dont recomend it to anyone. the risks far out balance the benifits, as it even began to affect my liver funtion and vision. there are many more drugs out there that do a better job than this with far less serious risks, after being hospilized due to this drug, I was shocked to read the list of side effects, and even 2 weeks in, I was experiencing common and uncommon side effects, who knows what would have happened if I were to remain on it. I can not recomend this drug for anyone taking Concerta while on this drug or trying to replace Paxil WITH this drug.

Often felt that I would wake up ill even with no symptoms.  I've been taking for just under seven months and it has been an amazing change for the better.  I'm on 40mg (upped after 20mg 'sort of' helped).  I rarely think of getting ill and my physical manifestations (diarrhea, belching, and nausea) have ceased.

I have found out that if I miss a dose. I get really angry at the drop of a hat. I can't think straight and I also get bad headaches. As long as I am on this pill at 40mg a day, I am calm and cool and wouldn't hurt a fly unless I had to. Off the pill is a completely different person. I was not like this before taking these pills but I guess my body seems to think that it can't go without it.

I wanted to see what I was really feeling with out the drug. (I did this with my doctors okay). I can't belive what a differnce it was with out it, and not in a good way! All the bad feelings came back, teeth ginding, social fears, and the depression sliding back fast,and  bad dreams again. I'm back on it again, at 20mg, and can't wait for the dose to be upped again, next month. I was so surprised what the meds were doing, and they were helping, I just didn't know how much.

I use to take lexapro but it was so expensive to keep up so the doctor prescribed me citalopram.  Although cheaper, I still have yet to feel anything better.  They say its the same, but it isn't.  I felt Lexapro kicked in quicker.  My brain cannot shut off.  I can't sleep at all.  I feel awful

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Lori, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	9/20/2010 2:17:14 PM	I have only been taking this medication for 6 days, and the side affects are horrible.  Increased Anxiety, tired the first few hours after taking it, yawning, increased sexual interest, loss of appetite, wake up after only 4-5 hours of sleep and cant go back to sleep, clenching jaw, nausea, loose bowels, headaches, dry mouth, increased sweating.  After reading the other reviews, I'm very hopeful that these symtoms will go away after a few weeks.  At the very least, hope the increased anxiety vanishes... it's why I'm taking it in the first place!!

My work life and personal life was suffering from my uncontrollable anxiety and my social anxiety was so bad it interfered with my daily life.  After only 2 weeks on this medicine I am a completely different person! One that I and my husband like! I feel like my old self again and have had no side affects at all! It has changed my life and I LOVE IT! Before this I was on Paxil, and it was terrible! It made me sick and zombie-like and horrible other side affects! I'm now taking 10 mg of this along with colozapram which has been a great combination. No more anxiety, panic attacks, or social awkwardness! This has been my lifesaver!!

I no longer suffer from &quot;social anxiety&quot; at work and can confront the issues that arise without bursting into tears.  BUT I don't have the desire to cope with much else or resume the things that used to bring me great joy.  Obligations and maintaining friendships do not intrest me...in fact nothing much intrests me anymore.  This helps me function and be a useful member of society but does not restore my joy.  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	8/21/2010 11:29:10 AM	I have had many side effects with this medication. Troubles sleeping, tiredness during the day even after a nap, weight gain, diarreha, nausea, very noticeable increase in menstrual cramps, definate increase in sweating, change in appetite. When I first started taking citalopram after that first inital month my anxiety seemed to disappear. That part of the pills is very nice but being a single mother I can not handle being unable to sleep and being so darn tired ALL the time. Then after taking these for several months I have started to feel anxiety again. I take these every day and have not skipped a day. The other day I even had a panic attack. This medication is just not worth it to me. Be aware of ALL side effects when taking something. Also check out if you can take something like ibuprophren or asprin while on the medication trust me you won't want to deal with why. It is NOT fun and can be scary.

My daughter was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, and it really interfered with family life.  My husband and I couldn't go out for a night without getting a call from our anxious daughter. We went to a psychiatrist who prescribed 20 mg citalopram at night before she went to bed. Now, she's much more relaxed and easy going, and our whole family can function better.  I'm so glad we found this drug!

Depression	d, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	8/4/2010 10:03:56 AM	I had been taking Paxil for 13 years and it just wasn't helping me anymore. I had anger issues,major depression, crying for no reason and horrible thoughts. I did not want to be around my loved ones, sometimes not even myself. Since taking this medicine I have not been as depressed, and the anger has subsided. I know it is going to take a little bit of time for it to completely start working but so far I am happy with the results will be happier once the tiredness goes away. If you are taking and anti-depressant or think you need one ask your Dr. about this medication.  
Depression	Happy Mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/3/2010 3:30:43 PM	This drug has made me feel a lot better.  Have problems with depression and also agitation/anger issues.  Since I have been taking this medication I don't fly off the handle like I use to and I don't just sit around in a blah state of mind. I take it at night because it does make me sleepy but I had rather deal with being sleepy than snapping at my loved ones in anger and being depressed.  Also before I started this medication I constantly woke up every 2 or 3 hours and I could never remember my dreams but now I sleep through the night and I can remember my dreams. My dreams are really random and vivid.  Overall I feel much better especially when I go to bed at a reasonable hour and get plenty of sleep.  I have tried several different medications but this one is the best so far.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	7/31/2010 3:36:51 AM	Been taken this medication for depression. Depression has gotten somewhat better, but the side effects are causing me great difficulty.  Always tired, weak and unable to sleep.  Doctotr says side effects should start to go away in a couple of weeks.  I hope so.  I want to get better, but I will have to stop taking this medicine if the side effects do not go away, for I am unable to function with no sleep.  Other side effects nausea, headaches, and food cravings.  Good outcomes, more emotionally even, not crying as much, not so much despair.
Depression	pennyflynn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	4	3	Female	35-44	7/29/2010 11:33:08 PM	I noticed the awful thoughts disappeared but I'm always tired during the day! I now drink caffeine and I never used to before. I also have trouble sleeping at night, which seems odd. My dreams are really weird - feels like I'm watching a movie someone else turned on. Doesn't feel like me. I've been waking up after about 4 or 5 hours of sleep which is not enough. Thinking of asking doctor for an alternative. This is my first experiment with drug therapy. Been taking it for 3 months.

I have also gained 10 pounds since being on the medication possibly due to my lack of interest in physical activity.

I have no listed side effects with it, however I have been having dreams at night that aren't like me. They are terrible dreams in which people are dying and its a matter of survival. Most of them have been zombie like dreams where people are coming to get you and you have to kill them and/or run away from them and find a safe spot. This has just started since being put on this medication.

Depression	Happy Girl not really, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/23/2010 7:28:40 AM	I have been taking this generic form of Celexa for ten years, next month. I was hesitant about getting on any mood med, but it has helped me tremendously. I am here writing this review... that's the point, I'm here. Diagnosed with major depression at 19, I was prescribed this pill by my family physician after several doctors visits relating to depression and its toll on my mind and body. It took me a while to loose some of the edge of being depressed all the time, but the fact is, I did loose the edge. Not perfection, but hey, no one is perfect. But I know that when I stopped taking this med, I relapsed into another major depressive episode. Went back to the med after 6 months of being utterly miserable all the time, and started improving within months. It takes months, realize, for this particular medicine to show its benefits to the user. Others see results sooner than you will; remember, when you're truly depressed everything is gray. If the roof fell on you you wouldn't care. That's depression. By the time you've realized that you need to see your doctor, make the appointment, actually GO and discuss what you're going through... you have already put your body and mind through so much stress OF COURSE the med won't be an instant cure-all. To the reviewers who've been on this pill for only five days or not long at all, WAIT before submitting your reviews. I am here to testify that without this medicine (the ONLY medicine or supplement I take), I wouldn't have been here today writing this really, really long post. Seek help. If this pill doesn't work after six months I would advise you to actively find alternatives with the help of your physician and your physician alone. Not a friend. Not a TV commercial or magazine ad. A real doctor. Believe me, you will go crazy (crazier?) trying to piece together all the med jargon you googled online. Hope this helps some one out there in internet land.

Erection is fine but results are extremely frustrating for myself and my wife.  I'll be talking with my doctor early next week about finding another drug.  I started taking this drug because of work related stress and depression.  The one great thing about my life and what helps hold me together is my marrige.  For me this drug isn't worth the side effects.  If you weren't depressed before you sure would be after taking this drug.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	5/6/2010 1:30:50 PM	I was put on this to control anxiety, ie heart flutters, feeling jittery all the time.  I am having some hormonal/coritsol imbalances.  I stuck with this drug a week.  The more I took it, the worse I felt.  I felt like I was in a tunnel and couldn't get out.  the jitters went away, but I developed insomnia, night sweat, nausea, dissiness, blurred vision and it increased my anxiety.  I wish it had worked for me, but I am back to square one.

Depression	twgray108, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	5/4/2010 9:17:57 PM	Tried Effexor (heart palpitations)and then Zoloft (made black days worse). This med at 10mg, had an overnight impact on the &quot;black days&quot;! They are basically gone. However, the sleep impact (hard to wake up) is definitely there also. I have been on this med for only 8 days but the initial result is Thank God the black days are gone. The jury is still out on sexual function. The a/c is set at 72 degrees and I'm sweating down my neck as I type this. Will do another review in a few weeks.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	MVB, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	19-24	4/29/2010 10:18:54 PM	I took this medication for a year to treat anxiety/depression issues. The drug seemed to work for the first few months I was on it, but eventually the drawbacks began to outweigh the posities. The drug significantly lowered my libido. It also led to a somewhat unreal feeling of constant happiness and satisfaction.I eventually felt that the drug wasn't really helping me with my problems. It was covering them up, ineffectively at that.I found that talking to a therapist was the most effective way to treat my disorder, and I strongly discourage potential users from simply taking a drug to try and cope.Many doctors are eager to overprescribe drugs and just hope that the problem will go away. It won't. Upping the dosage will not force you to treat the source of these problems.Personally, while I think that the drug helped me get through a difficult time in my life, I don't think that it's worth losing yourself in the process.Mental pain, like physical, is indicative that something is wrong. When we treat a physical ailment we don't just treat the symptom; we treat the cause. I feel that anxiety, depression and other emotional illnesses should be looked at in the same manner.

Depression	Whittier, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	4/13/2010 12:04:10 AM	I recently was taking Lexapro, but due to the monthly expense and frequent sweat spells, I decided to switch to Citalopram and have noticed a great difference. I feel better and my spirits are always up. I deal with no more mood swings, depression and helps control my compulsive disorder. The only negative part I think is I'm experiencing with weight gain. I'm very active, eat healthy and gained 7 pounds since I've started 2 months ago. No sure if this is common? But well worth the switch!

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	4/6/2010 8:15:51 PM	I have never thought I needed medication, but when the anxiety began to negatively affect close relationships, my dr recommended this.  I have noticed such a change, not an absence of anxiety but a lessening of its physical and mental control over me, I highly recommend it to anyone overcome by repeated, anxious worries and thoughts that feel out of control.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	4/2/2010 8:46:56 PM	I used to take Lexapro, but because of loss of medical insurance was swithched to Citalopram. Which I was told was as close to Lexapro as you could get.  I didn't read any of the side effects until recenctly when I started displaying impulsive sexual behaviour.  This is the only side effect that I have noticed. But is a concerning one.

Depression	crowe27, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	4/1/2010 1:19:38 AM	I have been taking this medicine since March 2008. It is the most effective one I have ever taken for overall depression, mood swings, bad anxiety, and bipolar disorder. It keeps me chilled out so I can relax and be myself, and not panicky and irrational like I can be when it gets bad. Different medicines work for different people, but after Zoloft, Paxil, and Effexor not doing it for me, this was a godsend. I am not advertising for this medicine, this is just what works for me. I recommend to anyone who has any or all of these symptoms to not lose hope and keep an open mind to medicine when therapy isn't enough. If the first or the next rx doesn't work, be patient and keep trying-everyone has a formula that will help make their lives liveable again.

There was a time where I would think I was going crazy and be in a really bad mood for no reason at all and now I don't feel like that at all!! I would recommend this medication to anyone and the only side effects that I have noticed was seeing something run across the floor when there is nothing there. I can deal with that rather than my husband wanting to smack me(lol) for being so moody!

While taking it I notice no weight difference but I ran out about a week ago and have been starving every since. My sex drive has decreased slightly but not probematic. Biggest problem I have with this drug is I sometimes forget to take it.

It has continued to be very effective for me, without even having to increase my dosage. Before I began taking Celexa, I'd been on several other medications for my bi-polar disorder. Other medications would stop working and my doctor would have to figure out the next one to try. I know everyone reacts to medications differently, but I'm so thankful this one has continued to work for me.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	personintx, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/2/2010 11:29:20 AM	Over the past year I was under a tremendous amount of stress that ultimately manifested itself in panic attacks and insomnia. The insomnia I could handle, but the panic attacks were becoming unmanagable.  I  started on 10 mg of this drug and bumped up to 20 mg after 6 weeks.  This drug helped me greatly.  No more panic attacks or constant anxiety.  My insomnia also has eased up.This drug has helped me handle my stress and address my life problems with a clear head, not muddled with acute anxiety.There are side effects such as vivid dreams and loss of appetite, but nothing that I find hard to handle.This drug has helped me.

So switched to Lexapro which seemed to help. But because of it being expensive, my doctor recommended Citalopram which has worked wonders. Not only has depression (almost) disappeared, so has anxiety. (Which was still present w/Lexapro)I read a previous comment about seeing things running across the floor but nothing there. I have a similiar problem (although very infrequenly) where I see something move from the corner of my eye. Nothing there either.But hey .... If due to the medication, I sure can live with that.

Other than that this works great for me except for now when I am without it.  The worst side effects I experienced were lots of yawning (I switched to taking it at night and it solved this) and loss of sex drive, which sucks but can be dealt with.

Depression	budeena, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	2/17/2010 8:41:57 PM	I have been taking this drug for nearly a year and it puts a thin veneer of civilization between other people and myself.  I have fatigue, mood swings, excessive weight gain, brittle nails and cannot stand to be around people more than an hour at a time.  I am depressed and wish people would just disappear off the face of the planet so I do not have to deal with them.  When will there ever be a real drug to treat depression??

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	19-24	2/13/2010 12:42:47 AM	This make me extremely tired. I sleep a lot more while taking this medicine.  Severe withdrawal symptoms.  I get very anxious when I haven't taken it. I currently am taking 20 mg but take 30 when I feel more anxious.  Decreased sexual drive. Does help with my anxiety a lot though. Side effects are a bummer.

I was on Lexapro, but that never made me feel normal, and made me gain too much weight. The weight gain itself would freak me out. Now I can really feel good without the weight gain. I have had no side effects.  It has opened me up and taken away the dark cloud that always seemed to be hanging over my head.  I feel like a new person.

Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	19-24	2/4/2010 10:11:25 PM	I really like this medication for a couple of reasons: it's milder than a 10 mg Lexapro, it's not expensive, it decreases any unnecessary feeling of guilt, and I haven't had an anxiety attack while on it. Overall, Citalopram is pretty good. I take 20 milligrams each morning but sometimes I feel like I need 30 milligrams in a situation where I feel the onset of an anxiety attack. I've tried to not take it for a day and I find myself feeling extremely nervous, anxious, having feelings of guilt for trivial reasons, and somewhat &quot;twitchy.&quot; There is a possibility that these are a mixture of withdrawal symptoms and feelings of vulnerability to depression because I know I hadn't taken my medication.  Another problem I have with Citalopram are the sexual side effects. I feel less sexually driven and an inability to climax on a consistent basis. My last discrepancy with this medication is a mild inattentiveness during conversation and daily tasks. Though these drawbacks are problematic, I will continue to take this medication because I feel like it has given me my life back.

Dizziness, agression, electrical zaps (systemic).  Take this drug with EXTREME caution.  I stopped the drug by reducing the dose (40 mg/20mg/10mg).....this did NOT help.

Panic Disorder	ephamby, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	13-18	1/27/2010 10:25:54 AM	I started using Citalopram about a year and a half ago.  I started immediately seeing the results.  Everyone around me noticed that something was different about me.  It helped my social life tremendously.  I was an exceptionally happy person.  Although, now it seems like I have grown immune to it or something.  I'm overall a happy person, but I no longer feel the need to be social anymore.  The only person I really spend my time with anymore is my boyfriend.  Really, I don't even mind not social, its the weight gain that I don't like. I have gained over 50 pounds since I started taking the medication.  I have diabetes in my family history and it really scares me that I will soon get the disease myself.  I am really starting to think of quiting it, but I do not know for certain yet.  Another thing, that I am not going to go into detail about is my sex life.  This medication has tremendously affected my sex life, in a bad way.  I hope this helps.

Depression	Ivonne, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/18/2010 10:45:38 PM	I was on this medicine for 6 to 7 months, in the beginning I needed this medicine for depression at 40mg for the first 2 weeks, changes on my mood have been occuring negativly, no sleep, trouble concentrating, etc. I contacted my doctor, and he said to &quot;give it more time&quot;, so I did. A month later I went from a 137ibs to 152ibs so I contacted my doctor he said this medication does not make you gain weight, he said it was my diet. With total weight gain I went from 137ibs to 175ibs. After reading some of the comments at WebMD I found out that this medication DOES make you gain weight. I stopped taking the medicine cold turkey, I am back on my old medication and my weight is starting to come down. After leaving this medication, I had no more bad ideas but sometimes, I cannot control my eyes, they twitch from one side to the other for a second and it happens when im driving. I dont know if it is some kind of withdraw side effect from the medicine and if this is happened to someone else, PLEASE post a comment, I will be checking regularly.

My doctor decided to try Citalopram and I am so glad. I still feel like me but my emotions do not get out of control. My depression seems under control. I have had no side effects and do not feel numb like I did on other AD's.

This drug puts a &quot;floor&quot; in my emotions where there had previously been none.  I can still feel  I still get sad and cry, which I'm happy about.  But it's just regular sadness now.  It doesn't plummet me.  I'm more interested in sex than I used to be, and it feels better too.  But my ability to focus has been slightly impaired, and I yawn a whole lot now.

It has really been effective for the anxiety, bringing me from about a &quot;9&quot; on a 1-10 scale to about a &quot;3&quot;. However, it never helped with the depression, so my dr. added Wellbutrin. In the beginning with Celexa I had some headaches and nausea but fortunately they went away within a week.

I haven't gained weight and I haven't had any real side effects.  I will say, however, that it's not a magic bullet.

For that i give this drug an A++++++ rating. However i have no labido and am experiencing memmory loss. Now i know the labido is a side affect but not sure about the memory loss. Oh and im more tired then usual but dont sleep well. I have continued to take this mostly because of the mood swings. I am 43 years old and have 2 children in high school and dont want them to remember me as a witch going through my change. It has also helped tremendesly with my husbands and my relationship.I think he was just about at his end with my picking all the time. Lets just say i dont sweat the small stuff any more.

My anxiety subsided, my panic attacks had almost disappeared and I became pregnant and have had two healthy babies and I feel great!  Still on Celexa daily 20 mg. per day.  Doing just fine!!!

Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	12/5/2009 12:17:44 AM	After a few weeks on 20MG I was still very depressed so doctor doubled the dose and now having nightmares and sleeping 10 hours a night. Still have depression but a little milder. Doctor says could increase to 60 but afraid I will want to sleep even more.No interest in sex.
Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	25-34	12/3/2009 10:15:24 AM	Been on this for a month now.  It is helping me out with my depression.  Im on 20mg once daily tablets.  I've been having some drowsiness with this and having problems getting more than a few hours sleep. This could be a side effect or could be something else. Not sure can't see the dr for another couple weeks.  It has mellowed me out, but the emotions I used to have seem like they try to come out but they just can't, like crying.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	MacUser, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	19-24	12/2/2009 4:27:07 PM	Started taking 20mg for anxiety and stress symptoms mainly, but i also have a horrible temper and noticed my irritability quickly vanish. I also suffer with depression due to anxiety. I've only been on it for a little over a week. People say it takes 4 weeks to kick in.. I cant wait to see even more improvement. Wish i would have discovered this pill sooner, I might have actually enjoyed high school.

If anything it will inhibit your sexual satisfaction.  Had major 'skin burning' extreme reactions going on and off this drug.  Autonomic effects were positive, but not worth it.  I found Zoloft much better for me I'm a small framed male, and also Buspar has some good results as well.  Not pleasant going on or off Citalopram, lots of dry heaving/throwing up and weird skin sensations not in a good way.

Depression	wdmgirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/30/2009 9:35:46 PM	I took Effexor XR in high school for depression, but unfortunately dealt with an emotional numbness, nightmares, and migraines on that medication and gave up on anti-depressants to pursue hobbies, etc...  About two years ago, the depression came back full force and I asked my doctor to try something new, so she prescribed Citalopram, a generic for Celexa.  It has kept me balanced out without making me feel numb or having any other unpleasant side effects.  Everybody's body chemistry is different, and although effexor didn't do it for me,  this medication keeps me in check beautifully.

Depression	Jewel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	11/30/2009 2:37:00 PM	I have been on this for 2 weeks half 20mg pill and have no energy, strange dreams at night, more depressed. It does make my mood swings better but I find that I don't really care about anything when I'm on it. The stomach aches are really bad on it. I will try it for 2 months and see what happens. So far nothing is happening on it.

The bad news, I can't stay awake.  I sleep ten hours at a time, then when I sit down to watch TV I fall asleep.  I have no energy.  I have dark circles under my eyes and feel like I'm in a fog.  Have not taken med for about a week.  Anxiety has come back.  Still so tired and sleepy.  I'm going to call MD to try something else.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	11/28/2009 2:32:09 PM	This drug took a bit more than two weeks for me to respond to it, but all in all it has been good.  I have had very few side effects-mostly I'm more tired, but that could have been other health issues that are ongoing.  I used lexapro before citalopram.  I like lexapro better but because lexapro stopped working I needed a new antidepressant and citalopram is just fine.

I can cope with that.

I had little control of either situation.  Citalophram really improved my symptoms as it helped me cope with the stresses and eliminate anxiety.  No side effects and its generic ... affordable for anyone.  I will probably be on it for some time as I do not see my stress producers attenuating ... but that's okay.  I feel normal again !!

It only took 20 mgs. to raise my B/P.  It usually stays around 110/58 or 112/62.  Now it hovers at 124/76 too high for me.  I have been on it for one day and and twelve hours later, I am trying to get it out of my system.  I cannot take it no more, I left word to the Dr. on his voice mail to go back to Xanax in the morning - .25 mg.  The worst part is that I am not depress - just anxious in my job.  Other effects are Rapid Heartbeat - Headaches - Dizziness - Not able to focus.  Thank goodness I took it one time only!
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	10/29/2009 4:43:12 PM	I have been on this for a year and a half now along with one other med, (which the doc has changed many times). I have had no side effects with this drug. Regaurdless of the other pill. I still have depresstion but not as bad as i did before getting onto ANY meds. My panic attacks are uneffected by this med. My aniety is maybe 20-30% better, regardless of what the other pill is at time in compare to before i took any meds. My father was Bipolar and my doc knowing that says I'm depressed with anxiety. I know we all differ do to bio, so in all i would recomend giving this pill a try. I have had better results with it then many others I was on before it. And so far I'm still on it todate.

I have gained 30 pounds in the first 4months so that has made me more depressed than anything.  I have no energy.  I stay tired. I really didnt think these were side effects to the medicine until reading up on it.  I have minimal sex drive.  I guess I dont like it, as much now that I realize my lack of energy and desire to go outside on a daily basis may be more of a side effect to the drug.  But, I will say no more crying all day, so I guess you have to take the good with the bad.

I was then switched to the citalopram, a very lose dose, it has been a God-send!  I feel so much better, and no heart issues, slight night sweats still, but dealable...dry mouth is very slight and water with lemon works for that.  I could go up in dose, but this is working for me and leaves room to change if needed in the future.

This drug works very subtle, one a day in the morning does it.  I tried to come off it twice over the years but noticed the difference within a few days.It keeps me at an even keel throughout the day.

Depression	SunnyD, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	9/17/2009 1:31:55 PM	Today is my second day taking this.I am very much into holistic health and not pills so I am very concerned about the issue when you all say you cannot come off them.  I am usually a very optimistic, VERY energetic person with a sunny disposition but I am losing my company and having to do bkrpt and very, very depressed about the whole deal, so depressed I cannot even make myself go the attorney to file.  So I asked for a &quot;helper&quot; from my doctor.  Today I am so lethargic I cannot stay up for more than an hour, dry mouth, bowel problems, dizzy, unenthused about accomplishing anything but when I try to sleep I feel like all my muscles are tense, have a headache in the back of my mind and generally feel very YUCCKY.  I am hoping that all you people out there saying &quot;stick with it&quot; are right, but still I think I will try 1/2, or 10mg tonight and quit taking them in the a.m.  I'm hoping I will be one of you chipper &quot;these are great&quot; people.  I had expected something a little less powerful I guess, like after drinking a couple of beers, that smoothness, not all this static.

I'm trying to stick it out because I've heard good things and hopefully it can help me from going off the deep end.

Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	35-44	9/13/2009 10:19:28 PM	Doctor prescribed after going to the hospital 3 times for chest tightness and pain in the sternum area...after ruling out all serious conditions the only thing they could find was a Hiatel hernia with acid refux which I constantly worried about so he started me on Xanax .5mg 4 times a day and 20mg of citalopram once a day. I stopped worrying but did have side effects once I stopped the xanax that included dry mouth, heavy sweating in arm pits, blurred vision in left eye, tingle sensations in hands and feet, pounding heart beat which would pulse in head as I slept at night, dizziness, lightheaded, and decreased sexual sensation. (could climax just take longer..too long) also felt tired throughout the day even after stopping the xanax so I switched to taking at night which helped. side effects improved or I got used to them and continued taking for 5 months but never really felt like I needed it as I was still having my original problem and once convinced it was not something serious I felt like I could handle things without drugs so I tapered off too 10mg for two weeks then stopped. (doctor wanted me to stay on it until December) On about day 4 of stopping I started feeling severe lightheadedness almost feel kinda drunk and it has not stopped yet (7th day) I have considered taking xanax again until this stops but have not yet (been toughing it out) very scaring feeling wish I never took this drug and just want to feel normal again. I would rather have worry and pain than this. seeing a surgeon next week to hopefully fix hernia and put all my worries behind.
Depression	mountaingirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	9/13/2009 2:17:21 PM	I've been on this for two weeks at 10 mg and it has helped me feel calm and think clearly, but I do feel flat, zombie-ish and disconnected. I have also fainted. The most dramatic change has been my sex drive. It went from 100 to zero. I am not interested in sex and I can't climax. I have never had a single problem with this, and this is a very dramatic change. I hope this will go away. I was on wellbutrin a few years ago and it made me anxious and forgetful but I had great sex drive, lots of energy, no weight gain.

That morning felt very sick. had to leave work early. I decided that i should take with food and that seems to help. But a week in I'm still feeling a little tired. The yawning i can relate to that because I constantly can't stop yawning.
Other	Whatever, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2		25-34	9/7/2009 10:59:48 PM	I've just been prescribed the medication.I was advised to take it at night, in case I had any nausea as a side effect.I slept fine, and woke up o.k., and felt like the rest of the day I was walking on a cloud.It sort of reminded me of when I used to take xanax.I noticed that my Adderrall XR did not seem to take effect, I was very A.D.D. that day.My stomach bubbled with gas, and I had dirreah.The next night, I went camping, and forgot to take it.I noticed a slight headache, but by the next morning, OUCH! I took it when I got home in the late afternoon.I felt a bit nauseaus, but it was o.k. I also felt shaky and sort of weak.My stomach bubbled with gas, and again, bathroom time.I'm not sure that my symptoms are as bad as the cure, so I'm not sure if I will hang in there to see if it stops. I plan to split my 20 mg pill in half, and just take 10 mg to see if the side effects are lessened. If it's the same, I think I will stop taking this pill.I also don't like getting headaches if I don't take it.

It was my first experience taking an antidepressant and I ended up in the ER!  Nothing major - my throat felt tight (but was not closing up) and my chest felt a little tight too.  The ER gave me benadryll and let me sleep off the symptoms, and I was fine.  The doctors were very surprised I had a reaction to that; they cannot figure out why.  I have eczema, which they said may have somehow contributed but I have no other medication or food allergies.
Depression	uneverstoplearning, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/7/2009 9:00:06 AM	Some women between ages 35-45 start to go through a chemical imbalance! For 4 yrs I put my family and myself through hell. Was informed by a close friend of this natural change and how to get help. CELEXA an/or the generic (those of us with no insurance - generic brand - 3 months rx cost me $12 @ Walmart) This med. stopped my out of control crying, the angry mood swing and thoughts of ending my life. After about 3-5 wks, myself, family and friends noticed a complete change! Happy again, brain was clear and no bad thoughts.MY EXPERIENCE: My anti-depression prescription ran out and I lost my insurance. I call my previous dr and/or ;oca; free clinic // inform them of my situation (and I didnt take NO as an answer) and demand a RX from previous Dr and/or emergency appt at clinic (they charge per your income = I didn't have any money at the time and just had the bill for $20 mailed to me - paid them $2 a month until bill was paid) My doctor informed me that to stop most and/or any  anti-depression meds cold turkey can be and/or is life-threatening  Its been over 3yrs on the meds and so far so good. Don't get me wrong life's not always a bowl of cherries. Remember that's normal :)

First of all I have gained weight being this so far. I am up to 40mg and thinking about going to 30mg(doc suppervision ofcourse) and I am really almost too relaxed to the point where I have to push myself to excercise and get motivated to do things. I have this &quot;oh well attitude, not a bad one just &quot;whatever happens happens&quot;. I almost feel too lazy but my panic attacks and my hypathetical thoughts are gone. I dont have the anxiety that I did have so not sure what to about the weight gain and the too relaxed feeling. Am praying about it and asking the Lord what I should do.

Depression	Teck, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	7/27/2009 7:35:34 PM	I went from Lexapro to Citalopram because of the price difference.  I feel to some degree this medicine isn't as effective, but I can't be sure because of the nature of the depression and grieving..being a previous care giver, and death of my mate.

Depression	kcush379, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5		19-24	7/19/2009 11:43:39 AM	I've been on Citalopram for 2 weeks and I've been feeling great at work!! I'm able to get out of bed in the morning and start my day normally, I don't argue with anyone at work and I don't feel like chopping off someone's head!! This medicine has worked great so far. The only side affects I've notice are increased daily headaches, but my daily migraines have gotten a little better, just more frequent.
Panic Disorder	mapmaker, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	45-54	7/19/2009 2:53:06 AM	I've taken citalopram for 3 days so far.and the side effects are worse than the anxiety.  insomnia 3 days in a row..upset stomach, tingling uneasiness in my muscles and skin.. feeling of heat.  Almost like a mild anxiety episode.  I thought medication is supposed to help a person, not make them feel worse.  Geeze... When is science going to learn how to tailor drugs to individual's biochemistry to avoid these awful side effects..

So, I'm not exactly sure if it is working for me just yet / helping me with my &quot;Manic Depression&quot; that I have been diagnosed with, is helping / working for me just yet. My doctor said, and so did the pharmacist, that it may take,  &quot;UP TO&quot;  one month for the medication to start working properly before I will see any difference with my &quot;Manic Depression&quot;.
Panic Disorder	kittenmiss, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	7/17/2009 4:05:44 AM	I was perscribed this medicine for my panic attacks and anxeity, i put off taking it for like 3 weeks cause i was scared of what it would do to me(after being on other types of anti-depressants and they didnt work), took it for the first time last night and i was sick as a dog, up all night feeling sick to my stomach. After i finnaly fell asleep i slept for 12 hours straight and woke up still just as sick and my head felt really funny, felt so sick i couldn't even eat for over 24 hours... it was horrific. then after i finnaly ate some thing i got really bad diareha and still was feeling sick.. my dr. told me to take at night because it will make you feel sick. but i don't think i am ever going to take this again. that was an awful experience and can't go through that every day. i am also on xanax and that seems to be the only thing that really works. I am definately going to again have to try another med. I have been on paxil,prozac and now this and none of them work. hopefully when i go back i can find the one that is right for me. hope this helped.

I have had anxiety for year and finally talked to my doc about it. He put me on Citalopram 10mg once a day. I took my first pill this morning and I am clenching my jaw and all the muscles of my body constantly. I fell more anxious than I ever have. I have dry mouth and really don't feel like eating. I hear that you feel tired. I don't at all. Can anyone tell me if these side effects go away? My doctor said I won't feel anything for a week and full effect by 4 weeks, should I stick with this? I can't stand feeling this way!

However, the med bottle says &quot;do not drink alcohol with this med&quot;. I'm not a big drinker but we are going on a family vacation next week (18 of us) and of course there will be some drinking. Three of the nephews are bartenders and so they always like to treat their elders to new drinks etc. Will I be OK with 1 or 2 drinks every day? What kind of limits should I take?
Depression	txlady, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/10/2009 2:54:15 AM	I started out on 10mg a day for the first week then up to 20mg the second week. The first three days I had a headache, dry mouth, and my jaw was clenching. It was tolerable. I now feel WONDERFUL! Better than I have in YEARS! I was a complete skeptic plus after reading some of the reviews I was a bit nervous to even start on meds. Well, I'm more energetic. I feel way better about myself no longer just wanting to be alone and cry. No longer feeling like a nervous wreck or having really bad anger. My sex drive has INCREASED! I do have a loss of appetite not too badly though. I still do have a bit of anxiety but citalopram has worked wonders on my depression. I'm still seeing a counselor so I'm sure in time with that it will go work out as well.

Had problems with insomnia, crying spells, mood and anger issues, recovering from 2 neck surgeries,1 back surgery and fibro (chronic pain). Taking Citalopram with Clonazepram, helped a great deal with depression and anxiety.

Does anyone have ringing or humming in the ears w/ this?  I increased to 40mg in May and noticed ringing in ears constantly and headaches with a pulse in my head.  It was awful.  I switched over today and hope it helps.  Cital. helped the depression but for my sister it lessened her appetite and increased mine.  I ate all the time.
Depression	nebula7693, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	7/8/2009 12:58:38 PM	I have been prescribed various drugs for my depression symptoms all of which worked to some degree. However, none were effective toward eliminating all of my depression symptoms.  I have been on citalopram for two months now and have never felt better.  I am more energetic and that foggy, muddled feeling has gone.  My thoughts are now clear and I can focus on problems and plans without all the effort it used to take.  I don't know whether or not this drug will have the same effect on you as it does me, but if you are having depression symptoms I have two pieces of advice for you:  1) don't stop trying different medications until you have found the one or ones that works best for you; 2) try citalopram.

Ive taken citolopram for 30 days now. Im getting a strange side effect that makes me panic. The side effect id a feeling of losing grip on my sanity/reality. I didnt get this on paroxetine. I dont know what to do as itspretty horrible feeling Ive never had any problem like this. I took paroxetine for over 10 years at 40 mg dose. I wish this was more than a review site but I could ask an expert about this. Im trying to keep busy so I dont feel this bad feeling.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	stressed out, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	6/29/2009 11:04:40 AM	I have been taking this medication (20 MG) for almost two weeks and have noticed some relief from anxiety and depression.  However, I am also taking .50 mill of Xanax twice per day which I am hoping to drop as soon as this medicine kicks in 100%.  No real side effects except drowsiness, so I take it at night.  I tried Lexipro but had many side effects.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	4	4	Female	25-34	6/29/2009 6:52:30 AM	I have used this for a few years.  I don't feel as stressed out, and I can focus more.  No sexual side effects.  Tried to get off it a couple of times and experienced extreme side effects.  When you take a pill you feel better within a couple hours. That's my only concern.

It worked wonderfully, but I experienced high withdrawl symptoms if I missed a dose or two. Overall it's a great drug. I had sexual side-effects but they went away in time. However, after 6 months the double the dose because it stopped having as much effect on my symptoms. Not sure i it's going to happen again after another 6 mo. or a year... I'll have to wait and see.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/23/2009 3:18:15 AM	Works great.  Dizzy spells, blurry vision and tiredness happened during the first 2 weeks but after getting through those 2 weeks everything is great.  It helps me with my depression and keeps me calm during stressful situations.  Normally when I would be stressing out this drug keeps me calm, cool and collected.  The only side effect I have now is a decreased sex drive.  
Depression	Tina, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/23/2009 1:47:13 AM	The citalopram worked perfectly for me. You didn't have any &quot;lingering&quot; effects during the day to cause you to feel drugged or detached. The only side effect for me was a sexual side effect. Very frustrating! Would recommend use (even with side effect) for treatment of depression/anxiety.

Before that I was taking paxil (6 yrs).  My dr changed my meds because my anxiety/depression was getting worse.  I'm going thru the side effects right now (or I had the flu).  I take it in the morning because it seems to keep me awake at night.  I've lost weight which makes me happy.  I'm hoping the dizziness, increased sweating end soon.  I also don't seem to have the energy I usually have.  I'm sure it will all get better.

I've noticed that I am much more tired during the day, BUT I still keep trucking and get things done (before I would have given in and taken a nap).  I do have a few dizzy spells during the day also.  And I'm experiencing sexual side effects, but it seems to be the opposite of what everyone else is experiencing. I have an INCREASED sexual drive.  I am seriously waiting to be driving down the street and hit a bump in the road and go off.  And I feel this way all day long.  It's really kind of odd. I've also noticed a bit of dry mouth and I tend to daydream more often.  Overall I like how I'm feeling and I'm willing to put up with the few side effects I'm experiencing. =)

The first few weeks were challenging as I was thirsty and VERY tired.  This went away after approximately 2 weeks and I felt a greater sense of calm and more like myself.  I am currently tapering my dose as I would like to become pregnant again but am experiencing a kind of dizziness or &quot;trails&quot; to my vision.  I am waiting for this to end -hopefully soon!
Depression	Lizbit, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	6/9/2009 9:18:52 AM	I started this drug because of my depression, anxiety and night terrors. This drug took effect pretty quickly. I now sleep through the night. The only complaint is that this drug makes me thirsty. I am never without my nalgene now because I feel thirsty all of the time.  The thirst is a small price to pay for my mental sanity though. Overall the experience has been a good one. Family and friends have really noticed a difference in my life.

The panic disorder went away, so did some of the agoraphobia (though sometimes I still feel a little of this), but then I started hearing voices. So I gradually took myself off of it after being on it for a year, and even though the psychotic symptoms got better, they haven't completely quit. This pill makes me feel absolutely horrible. It does almost the exact same thing to me the Prozac did (see my other review), I get horrible jitters, massive confusion, and very sleepy (almost drunk) for days on end. When I'm off it, I feel much better. As far as helping with the Panic Disorder--I'm cured, so it worked rather well for that. Not a good med for schizophrenics (there's a lot of truth to that distasteful joke).

AFTER 6 MONTHS OF TAKING THIS MY musles started to TWITCH. FOOT JERK, LEGS WOULD JERK.. SO GOING TO STOP TAKING this drug AND CONTACT MY DOCTOR.  I REPORTED THIS Jerking TO My DOCTOR AND HE SAID I HAD RLS.. NOT.. IT'S THE MEDICATION. I was satified with this medication until the movement(like twitching) in my leg/foot. This happens mostly when I am relaxed, watching TV or in bed. Never when walking or standing. This jerking goes on for hours. Would be in one leg/foot one night and the next night the other or the same leg/foot.. When the jerking started it was only once a week, now it's almost daily. Just wanted to let people know of this side effect.. thanks....

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/12/2009 6:00:54 PM	I was having insomnia and heart palpitations constantly.  I tried naturally reducing my stress and it didn't help.  I started on citalopram in January.  I was nauseous in the beginning and I couldn't take a whole pill or even half a pill without feeling terrible.  I ended up starting with a quarter of a pill and moving up from there.  Once I got to the full dose, my heart palpitations stopped and my insomnia went away.  It worked really well and I've had no side effects after my body got used to it.
Other	mo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	5/11/2009 4:33:19 PM	Just wondering if there is anyone who has had a rash due to this drug. I started taking it 4 days ago and I feel great, but I took it in the afternoon (4 days ago) and that night I had a little rash but now it just seems to be spreading. Just wondering if anyone has had this happen and if it's normal side effect when beginning. Otherwise I feel much better than when I was on effexor.
Depression	Amy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	5/8/2009 10:59:19 PM	Give the meds time to work and trust your psychiatrist! It took a few weeks and adjusting the meds (I'm on 30 mg), but I am completely back to normal. I was scared to death to try this med, but now I am perfectly fine.  I can sleep, eat, and be happy again!! DO NOT listen to the comments from patients who have been on citalopram under two weeks. It is medically proven to TAKE TIME. It doesn't work in one to two days!
Depression	Astro, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	25-34	5/8/2009 12:49:34 AM	First day taking citalopram. Really helped to calm my anxiety.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Juanita, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/7/2009 8:13:03 AM	Celexa is GREAT! a few years ago i was on prozac for depression for 6 months. prozac made me more depressed and drowsy for a month (which frightened me), after that it was ok, but i hated taking a huge pill. I didnt have a good doctor though to follow up with me. Celexa is a tiny pill and within 1-2 days, i felt the anxiety just melt away,  i could breathe again!!!! its also helping my depression, im more motivated to do things because im less anxious. it made me realize how serious my problem was, a huge contrast. no other side effects except i gained 10lbs but that has stabilized. im more regular, which is good. this is a fantastic drug i highly recommend it.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	5/4/2009 2:52:45 PM	I've only been on it for two weeks, and it says it won't reach effectiveness until four weeks, so I still have time. However, it seems to work well for the anxiety attacks, but leaves me almost emotionless.  It's hard to be genuinely happy about things.
Depression	popcorn, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	55-64	5/3/2009 11:18:26 AM	I've been dealing with anxiety for several years. My doctor put me on a 20mg daily dose about two weeks ago after I mentioned the positive results a common patients and friend was having with this drug. Too early to really comment. I do notice I seem to have less energy. I'm willing to continue to give the Rx some time to prove itself.

Depression		3	5	3			4/29/2009 4:55:52 PM	Been on this drug for over a year now.  I definitely  feel better than before, however I also changed a lot of things in my life sense.  So, I don't know if it's the medicine or the positive life changes.  I take 20 mg before bed and sleep like a rock but  I feel hungover in the morning &amp; if i get out of bed to quickly I get a major headache... I get a 3-4 day headache at least 1 a month.  Also, very LOW sex drive  I don't mind it but my husband does.  I think it has helped me but I may ask to lower my dosage and eventually stop.

I'm very tired, low energy, and have had some weight gain, not due to my eating habits. It may have helped with anxiety in the beginning,but now I'm going to taper off. It sounds like its pretty additive, and I don't need anymore negatives in my life.

Depression	Lance, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	4/20/2009 10:58:43 AM	I was on Celexa (before generics) for several years during a bad marriage. I don't think I would've survived had a compassionate Dr not suggested I start taking an A-D and doing some other things to manage the stress and depression.I lost my health insurance not long after the marriage ended (unrelated, long story) and tapered myself off (the non-generic Celexa was very expensive.)Big mistake. Half a decade later and after a number of setbacks and involuntary life changes and financial problems, I was a mess but because things had been happening slowly, I really didn't see it.Recently and after a case of the shingles, several rounds of cold and flu, and an inner ear infection that took away my equilibrium...Some family members sat me down and told me they were very concerned that stress and depression were ruining my health and for what might happen to me...I went to my Dr and got a prescription for the new generic form.What a difference! Less than a week back onto a 20mg dose and already things are changing for the better!A-D's are serious drugs and can have serious side effects, if a prescription does not help or generates overtly negative effects, run back to your Dr and change something. I have a family member who had to go through 4 different drugs before the 5th one did the trick

So far no releif. Although I know someone on it that says its a life saver. I just recently added Buspirone(Busbar) a few days ago and no change yet either. I was previously on Paxil for almost 5 years. Paxil worked a little bit, maybe 50%. I am determined to find one that works and am going to try a SNRI next. I am having a hard time finding any good info online about SSRI's vs. SNRI's.

I have noticed that I am also constantly tired and have gained 15 lbs.(my eating is at least the same if not improved because of fear of gaining more weight).  I don't really feel like this is helping my depression but I do think it is helping my OCD.  My husband is the one that noticed that.  I have a doctors appt in 2 weeks and I am telling her that I am ready to be done with this med, hopefully it won't be too hard to come off of it.

My doc prescribed 20mg 1x/day for mild depression/anxiety. I started this med on a Sat night, and although was exhausted couldn't sleep at all Sun night. Mon morning I had nausea (expected short-term side effect) and was sick, then very anxious and jittery all day. Tues nausea was better, but anxiety still there, I was shaking all over. Called doc who said to reduce to 1/2 dose. Did that for two days with some reduction in symptoms but still not great...Wed ok, Thurs very anxious. Doc has now taken me off this med and I'm back to xanax. Said it's not a common reaction, but does happen. I hated the way this made me feel and am now scared to try anything different because of the reaction I had.

I have experienced a slight decrease in my sex drive but when I do have sex maybe 1 time out of 10 I cannot acheive an orgasm.  My wife don't care, however, because my sexual stamina(longevity) is amazing.  But back to the anxiety, it has worked great for me.  But at first the sexual side effects bothered me and I tried to ween myself off of the drug but started feeling these electrical impulses in my feet and hands so I went back to 20 mg and the impulses went away almost immediately.  But overall, the good does outway the bad.

Other	jn316, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/8/2009 9:19:14 PM	I was prescribed this after a tilt table test was positive and had vasovagal syncope.  Felt lightheaded all the time. Felt like every deep breath I was going to pass out.  Also was sore in many places but didn't think it was related.  I've been suffering like this for around 7 years.  I was on a beta blocker before that but didn't feel any better. Within one week of taking this, ALL of my previous symptoms are gone. I can take deep breaths and no longer feel lightheaded at all.  All my soreness everywent just went away. i was amazed!  No more chest pains either which I just learned to deal with.  I couldn't be happier with this. I don't like taking medication but I'm going to enjoy this for a long while. It's been way to long of not feeling normal. I am way happy with what this has done in my life. I now can focus on life and not with my health concerns.
Depression	Amy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	3/7/2009 11:32:59 AM	I started at 10 mg for a week, increased to 20 mg. Got a little better, but not back to normal. Two weeks ago, my psychiatrist upped my doasage to 30 mg and I feel like myself again! It was an uphill battle and took adjusting the medicine and about 6 very long weeks, but it was worth it. Trust your psychiatrist!!! If I had just listened to myself I would have stopped taking it and never felt better. Listen to them and give the medicine TIME to work! Side effects I have noticed are: slight fatigue, increased sweatiness on palms, feet, &amp; underarms, memory loss. But I can laugh again, sing, sleep, and handle life much more effectively! Give it time! You will make it!
Depression	james from Vermont, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	3/4/2009 3:45:20 PM	THis is an Update to an earlier post: I posted about 2-3 weeks ago. The drug has helped me out a lot. I have been able to read and understand the self help and self improvement books. The side effects are minimal from what I experienced in the beginning. I am tired and I do have more head aches, but they are not bad ones. I have keept to 10mg and have not increased my dose to the full amount of 20. Though I do notice that I get a bit shakey and my eyesight seems a little fuzzy at times. I have started to feel down or cry, but now I am able to think why I am feeling the way I do. I am able to turn my mood around before it gets worse. When I do find my mood is getting worse, I can now reason with myself and look at the brighter side of every situation. It has helped me be more understanding, helped me stop yelling and helped me be more calm. I don't experience the Road Rage and am able to be more in control. Once I feel that my situation is changing or better than it was before. I will consult my doctor on how to get myself off of this, as I don't want it to become  a perminanat crutch for my mental health.I do have a lower sex drive, but it hasn't gone away.

The Dr has tried to get me off of it but when I quit taking it I get terrible headaches, faintness, nausea and disorentation. When I start taking again I feel better almost instantly. Anyone else have this happen. It is very concerning.

I liked Lexapro, and it did not make me feel as tired as citalopram.  I started taking citalopram for hot flashes and mood swings, and it alleviated most of it, but not all.  I felt tired and drug out, had dry mouth and no sex drive.  I went off the drug for 4 months because of that and started feeling much better; however, the hot flashes and mood swings returned, so I had to begin the medication again.  It is effective, but you should weigh the side effects against the severity of your symptoms before taking it.

Ok Depression. My doctor put me on Citalopram at 20mg and asked that I start at 10mg first. I took my first 1/2 pill last night and about 2 hours later, felt like my old self again. I felt &quot;normal&quot;??? Like I haven't felt in a year or two.  I have already noticed that I am more focused and a lot more level in my mood. I'm not sure if I will stay with the 10mg dose or reduce it to 1/4 of a tablet. Or just keep at the 10mg. I was told that it miht take as much as a month to feel the effects but I noticed them right away. I can actually function and think about things. I noticed the following.no crying.no rageno loss of hope. I actually have more hope now. I was laughing this morning.I slept well last night. Hope this post helps you.

Within a week of taking these meds I was back to myself.  Much more at ease and able to &quot;deal&quot; with the pressures/expectations/duties of everyday life.  I'm pretty sure my husband and 2 kids agree - it's just what I needed to take the edge off.  The only downer - when I DO drink, I get tired VERY quickly.  I can usually skip a dose if I want to party!

After that, I am okay, or okay enough to deal.  I see my practitioner in a week to find out if there really is a correlation, or if something else is going on, totally unrelated to the drug.

I haven't felt this great in a long time. My husband was the first to notice, but after about a month, the difference was amazing. I feel like a conpletely different person. My one and only problem with the drug is the fact that when I miss a pill, my depression and anxiety come back two fold. And this is the day after I miss just ONE. But other than that, this pill has made my life so much better!

I love it.  I'm not afraid of when the next attack is going to happen and I can live my life again.  I've noticed I can usually skip a day or two before the anxiety starts slowly coming back so I think it would be hard for me to stop taking this drug...I'm just glad I found something that helps!  Give it time to work....

Also, i have experienced vivid dreams which can best be described as bad drug &quot;trips&quot;. I am however, less depressed/moody. Another side effect i am beginning to notice is a plummet in sex-drive as well as ability to climax. i am taking 20 MG daily and have been taking it for a month...hopefully these side effects will not persist.
Depression	jbaby, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	2/9/2009 8:23:09 AM	I was prescribed this medication, for the second time, for depression. The first doctor to prescribe it didn't listen when I told him it wasn't working. My new doctor prescribed me Lexapro which worked wonders but my insurance would not cover it so he gave me Citalopram. He had to increase it from 20 to 40 because it was not working. I have unfortunately gained 30-40 lbs which isn't helping with the whole depression thing. If I miss a dose, my mood swings are worse and I end up crying because I yelled at my little girl. :(
Panic Disorder	55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	3	3		55-64	2/9/2009 12:36:29 AM	I believe the root cause of my problems is really hormonal in nature.  I feel like I haven't found the cure to my real problem.  I cannot physically tolerate any stressful situation.  Citalopram helps treat my symptoms.  When I stopped taking it for a couple of days and I had an animated phone conversation, I felt a lot of chest pressure and pain.  I then took some Lorazepam, as the doctor advised, should this happen.  It was scary, but I am OK.  I am continuing to take the Citalopram.

I kept having anxiety/panic attack.  I've never had one of those before and though I was having a heart attack.  My heart felt like it was doing flip flops in my chest.  It was very scary.  Within hours of taking a tablet after being out for 3 weeks, I felt my body start to feel normal.  I definately will not let myself run out again, and dread the day I may have to be weaned off of it.

I have found, though, that different life events moderate the effects of the drug rendering it less effective.  During more stressful times in life, you may find the medications effectiveness drop, but I saw this to be expected.I did find that the medication made me far less moody and less agitated by &quot;the little things.&quot;  I am a self-diagnosed obsessive-compulsive and I find it difficult to concentrate in disorganized environments or a room that is in disarray.One last thing: After being out of country and suddenly running out of the medication (under highly stressful conditions), I experience what I could only describe as a persistent anxiety attack.  I would highly advise patients to ensure they have ample supply when traveling abroad!

My doctor tried several medications and could not lower my BP.  Because my BP was so high, I was a nervous wreck.  It was suggested I try this drug along with my BP medication.  FINALLY, my bp dropped to normal after a year of trying to lower it.  This medication has been a life saver!  It takes a few weeks to work but stick with it because it's worth it.  I never have anxiety anymore and nothing upsets me!  Best of all...my BP is NORMAL!!!  Highly recommend it!

Even with my Ambien I have experienced sleep problems. I experienced most all the side effects and have been extremely sick since first I started this medication and my illnesses got worse.  Have been in ER a couple of times with all the symptoms this medicaiton has, but, since I didnt really read the serious side effects I had no clue I personally should not take this medication with other medications I have. A friend suggested today I look at not only serious side effects but drug interactions and after2 1/2 months of ER doctors running all kinds of tests and coming up negative and my doctor treating me for bronchitis but not paying attention to my other complaints I have had the following serious drug interactions as noted under the tab of interactions with other drugs Tell your doctor immediately if any of these rare but very serious side effects occur: stomach pain, fainting, bloody/black/tarry stools, vomit that looks like coffee grounds, easy bruising/bleeding, muscle weakness/cramps, seizures, fast/irregular/pounding heartbeat, difficulty urinating, change in the amount of urine.  I have fainted once in my life years ago...but 2 weeks ago when she increased my dosage a few nights later I fainted...I thought for no reason at all!  I take Lorazepam and Ambien for over 5 years and evidently this drug does NOT interact well for me.  I also have had Vicodin due to the pain from the coughing from the bronchitis along with OTC cough syrups and Theraflu type medications. I HIGHLY suggest you pay much attention to side effects and drug interractions PRIOR to agreeing to take this antidepressant!

Extreme sadness and irritability. Constant anxiety over what the future holds. I have been taking a 20mg dose for approx 6 months. Beginning side effects where nausea, teeth grinding, vivid dreams (good &amp; bad) and just a hollow feeling. Nothing mattered. These all subsided within 3 months. Lingering side effects are sleepiness, weight gain and sex drive. I have tried morning and night,I now take my dose at dinner time and that has helped with some of the sleepiness. My sex drive is low but the actual act has actually been enhanced. The anxiety, grief and irritability are at a much more manageable level. I don't know where I would be without this medication. With it I am a much easier person to live with.

Depression	busymom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/14/2009 12:04:08 AM	Been on this for four years and it was a life saver.  Started taking it before bed shortly after I began treatment as I got so sleepy during the day and that worked well. Started at 20 mg, then 30, last 40.  Tapered off right after Christmas 2008 and have some withdrawal symptoms but getting better each day.  Wanted to get off of this to see if I could cope (I hate taking drugs) and will see if natural supplements will work as well if I need them.  Sex drive seems to be coming back which my husband will be pleased with!  Also sleeping better now than when on this drug.

Depression	silversmith, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female		1/11/2009 7:56:09 PM	I have insomnia. My scalp is severely itching until I want to dig it. I have a tingling in my neck. My mind does not shut down. I feel that my doctor did not advice me concerning this drug. I have never been depressed until the death of my husband. I only needed a short boost. This drug should not have been given to me because it takes too long to feel any effects to help one.
Depression	Happy Camper, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	1/10/2009 2:08:52 PM	I have used this med for over nearly two years (20 mg/once a day).  It has been the best so far in stabilizing my mood.  I've previously used prozac, serzone, and wellbutrin.  However, I want to stop using meds altogether this year.  Any suggestions in getting off of them?

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	frustrated, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	35-44	1/8/2009 8:50:39 PM	Attempting to taper off this drug has been a nightmare for me.  Lots of withdrawal. (Dizziness, lightheaded, &quot;Zaps&quot;)  No matter how slow I taper (and I've been doing MORE than what is normally done according to drs) within a few days of being off the drug, I'm having withdrawal symptoms.  Almost 3 weeks ago, I took my last pill.  I've been having withdrawal symptoms for almost 2 weeks.  I never would have taken it if I had known the problems of stopping it.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	try it once , 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	1/8/2009 7:54:27 PM	I have never taken any meds for my problems. I didn't even know I had a problem until my wife told me that I seemed to stay in the I don't care mood or rip your head off mood. Been taken the 40mg dose for 1 month and a few days, but the anger has calmed some when I do get upset seems to be more intense but is less often. I do experience the constant sleepiness in the mornings and for a few hours around lunch and the dreams &quot; never really had dreams until I started taking the pills&quot; but they are not bad just sleep right through them, and sometimes get the dry mouth, but no effect on the sex drive. so I think I will try it a bit longer and I will let you know if it is working any better.

I stop taking it because I had no sex drive.  After saying that I now have no appetite.  Its back to the basics again.

Depression	Natalie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	12/30/2008 11:28:39 PM	It works great for depression and suicidal thoughts. The downside is that I never want sex...I'm 30 with no kids...and I'm always tired and CAN NOT sleep. I'm up every hour or two. I have serious dry mouth too. I really think the lack of sleep (prescription sleep aids/pills aren't helping) is the thing that is the worst.

I started with 10mg a day and just a month ago increased to 20mg.  The drug is amazing and has been a soul saver for me.  However, I've noticed in the last few months a rapid increase in my weight. I see that weight gain is listed as a side effect.  Need to talk to the Dr. about it in more detail.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	12/25/2008 6:44:57 PM	I have had no side effects from this drug in the two and a half years I've been on it. Stress overload does overpower it and I will get the occasional anxiety attack. I take 20mg dose, so a stronger dose might fix that.
Depression	 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female		12/24/2008 9:48:18 AM	&quot;Coming off&quot; of this medication is hell.  I feel dizzy, light headed and my whole body feels tingly all over when I walked.  The medication worked while I was using it though!

Overall it's a good drug,but sometimes the side effects are hard to deal with. The shakiness is embarassing and the lack of sex drive is affecting my marriage.

Sickness, headaches and feeling very tired, however, they did wear off after about a week, so try to last it out.

My doctors just said wonderful things about it so I just kept taking it thinking the fatigue would go away with time. It never did.  It was a really calm feeling and eased any anxiety but wasn't worth the tired feeling I had all day.

Depression	zoomzoom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/16/2008 5:46:06 PM	Love this medicine.  Didn't know I was depressed for years, just thought I was a bitch.  Had rage and cried alot.  Gets worse that time of the month.  I've taken 20mgs for a week.  Could tell a big difference 2nd day.  I don't feel like I'm obsessed with eating or sex.  If it lowers my sex drive then maybe I'll be even with my boyfriend.  No rage at all.  I don't like taking medicine, but I would never stop taking this.  I feel wonderful!
Depression	Anonymous, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/16/2008 4:07:37 PM	After suffering from chronic depression for more than 15 years, my doctor put me on 20mg of Lexapro.  After about two months on the Lexapro with incredible results she switched me over to 60mg citalopram generic for cost reasons.  I can truly say that this drug has worked a miracle.  People have said how much better I look and what a huge change there has been in my character.  It has been a life-saver.
Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/15/2008 7:12:11 PM	It has been a miracle drug for me relieving not only my depression, but also panic disorder, OCD symptoms as well.  My sex life actually has improved tremendously, have not lost drive and can last much longer.  I have gained weight though but am more than happy to accept that for all of the benefits of my new life.

The only side effect I had was significant and resulted in my discontinueing the drug.  I'm embarassed to say that sexually, it prevented me from &quot;completing the transaction&quot; - if you get my drift!  Real deal breaker in my book!

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Anthony, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/9/2008 10:17:41 PM	I appreciate &amp; respect everyone's comments about Citalopram.  I too have had vivid, pleasant dreams, no nightmares.  I have had a significant decrease in libido, but I've actually been able to last longer now with my wife.  I have a great life, wife, kids but always worried about the the 'other shoe dropping' mainly with work.  This drug has taken the edge off, and I feel so much more peaceful, happy now &amp; more comfortable with myself in social situations, more confident. I have not experienced more anger, actually the opposite.  I am only taking 10mg/day in morning (cutting pills in half).  I actually felt WORSE, more jittery, anxious when I was on 20mg (or 10mg of Celexa). I do not feel like I am on a medication. It took alot of courage for me to accept the fact that maybe I needed medical help for my anxiety.  I am not one to normaly take any medical drugs. I tried to work through it, talk with social workers. This drug helps me to take life one day at a time &amp; enjoy it. This medication works for me.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	12/8/2008 1:36:24 PM	I went from 20mg one year ago, to 30mg about 4 months later, and I've been on 40mg for 1 week.  Although it's worked, and I've had very few symptoms...some fatigue, some night sweats (which I hadn't realized were symptoms until now).  I'll by seeing a psychiatrist soon, and am curious to see if he/she will leave me on citalopram (which my doctor always refers to as celexa...confusing!).
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	12/8/2008 12:04:50 AM	I suffer from depression, with intermittent anxiety episodes. I had been on Lexapro for almost 3 years, but I got kicked off my parent's insurance and I couldn't afford it, so I requested generics. I've noticed the same mild side effects I had before: mild tremors, yawning, as well as new ones: difficulty concentrating and vivid dreams (and I take it in the morning). As the weeks pass, I know these will subside. Overall, I'm very happy with Citalopram. It works just as well at helping me through each day, I sleep better and I have an appetite again.

Panic Disorder	35-44 (Patient) 	1	1	1		35-44	11/24/2008 8:29:09 AM	 This drug was horrific for me . The doctor prescribed me 20mg a day for depression. I took  one the Thursday morning and felt really ill but thought I would stick with it and took another Friday morning come Friday night I was a complete mess has really bad shivers, sickness, muscle aches but worse of all I was halluciating was rushed to hospital and given antisickness tablets as thats all they could do for me, this carried on all saturday and sunday with me not really knowing where I was. Went to the doctor today feeling really sick,shaking,pins and needles down my arm and I feel really dizzy he wanted to drop me down to 10mg. You must be joking I will never touch these again I could deal with the sickness ect, but hallucinating and really vivid dreams no way. I am going for hypnotherapy instead

I would have terrible anger occur suddenly and out of the blue, I was sad all the time, I would cut myself and consistently had negative thoughts about myself. After taking this drug for about two weeks all of my prior symptoms are gone, I feel happy and incredible. I have my desire back to do things that I have not wanted to do for some time. I am very grateful for this drug. The only side effects I have experienced are a bit of tiredness and only small warm flashes. I can totally deal with those side effects over the way I was.

I could always feel my heart beating in my chest so depending on my moods I could feel it pounding or skipping a beat every now and then. I also was very aggrivated by sounds in the evening. If my husband rolled over in bed I would get a shock through my body and get startled and I would be very angry about it. Last night was the first night I took citalopram, I didn't feel my pounding all night and I wasn't startled at all by small sounds throughout the night. I will review again in a month. I hope I don't get all the bad side effects. If this medication helps me after 16 years of extreme anxiety I will put up with any side effects.

Has anyone else noticed very severe side effects when forgetting a dose? Mine are bad enough to keep me out of school and include trembling, dizziness, headaches, and nausea. Overall, however, it is quite effective in treating my panic attacks and depression, which were genetic and brought on by the death of a very close friend almost three years ago.

I started to take it during the day and just couldn't handle it so I changed to about 8PM every night now and have no problems sleeping for the most part. I do occasionally have very interesting dreams but generally wake up feeling fine. Get a good nights rest is important I believe while taking this stuff.....Good Luck to you.

Depression	Sharie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	11/7/2008 3:54:22 PM	I was put on this medication almost 2 months ago for depression. A 20mg dose per day. The first 2 weeks I was foggy and tired all the time, but that went away.  The next 2-3 weeks were heaven.  I could concentrate, there wasn't a black cloud feeling, I was able to sit and enjoy reading again.  I haven't felt that good in ages.The following couple of weeks things started to get muddled again.  So I am moving up to 40mg per day as per my doctor.The other side affects I have had have been stomach aches and sweating especially at night.  But nothing I haven't been able to deal with so far.I wish I would have been prescribed this medication a long time ago.

I usually was prescribed Dexidrine, with no other coctail added to equalize out the seratonin and dopamine levels.  This med is good, however, I did and still do have the blurred vision, so much so that it has doubled in vision difficulties almost 50%.  Instead of the 1.75 reading glases it is now 2.50.  Be careful to speak to your physician about this medication if you are worried about school, such as I.   I am finishing up on a Paralegal degree and it is still a little difficult to concentrate sometimes.   Stomach upset most of the time... I will be recommending it though, because it is better than nothing.

When I got out I asked my own doc about it.  He explained some little nuances between them but said we could try switching.  I've been on citalopram now for seven weeks.  I see no difference between it and Lexapro, except citalopram saves me $110/ 3 months!!
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/28/2008 5:46:33 PM	I did not realise how difficult I was to live with until I started with tis medication. I went to the Dr about what I thought where hormonal issues but after blood tests telling all was normal, I was asked if I was depressed.  After breaking down and crying over how awful my life was, I had to agree I could be.  The first few days I did experience a fogginess where it was hard to get words out when people where speaking to me, but now that I have been taking it for a month, I am not so agressive, do not feel so low, my confidence has come back and I can actually go to dinner parties and not feel so exhausted afterwards by having to speak to people.  I do not feel overly tired but I do take it right before I go to bed.

I thought I had developed asthma..he thought it was COPD,,after tests, all negative for these illnesses, he put me on Citalpram..4omg  once a day..at first I was kind og &quot;slow' and then by week 3 all the breathing concerns I had were gone. I could jog. exercise and laugh witnout wheezing. This docter had had figured out that my symptoms were GAD...not seperate issues.I thank him everyday ...my life is quite &quot;happy&quot; and I have never..ever...felt this good...

I started on 20mg and GP increased my dose to 40mg daily. I am feeling better than I have felt for sometime even thou it did take about 8weeks to start to feel the effects.

Hang with it for awhile. Everything gets a little better with every day you take it. MOST of the side effects diminished greatly for me after a couple weeks. Seemed like I had 'em all. Nausea, dizziness, forgetfulness, blurred vision, drowsiness, felt spacey, hard time concentrating. Most are pretty much gone, tiredness seems to be the worst but still better than when first started. Also for the guys, Dr. said it could cause impotence which it did but only for about a week and went away. Now, it's just a little harder to have an orgasm, but thats ok. Hope this helps you out.

Side effects first couple weeks were horrible but stuck with it. Still suffer tiredness so went off for a few days. Quickly went back to my anxiety, depressed moody old ways by the fourth day (had lots of energy though). Quickly went back on. I take 20mg. per day and have to say I like it but not the tiredness. My mood is superior to what it was so I won't be going off for now. I now sing to myself all day, I haven't done that for years. I feel good and happy.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/14/2008 1:50:41 PM	I LOVE this medication.  It works so well for me.  For about 10 years I've been dealing with depression and panic/anxiety order.  For years I tried everything to not have to take meds - stress management class, relaxation therapy, exercise, meditation, you name it.  Finally, I &quot;gave in&quot; and decided I couldn't fight on my own anymore.  The first week was pretty awful.  I felt drunk all the time.  Couldn't drive and had a tough time at work.  Then one day, my mind was clear!!!  Seriously clear!  Like I could actually focus.  The sense of being overwhlemed was gone.  It's been about 4 years.  Sometimes I come off it for 2-3 months just to give my boday a break (no one ever told me to do that, I just do.  Each time, the withdrawal is the same as when I first started taking it.  The dizzy drunkness.  It usually takes me just 2 months to remember why I went on it in the first place.  It's an awesome drug.  Doesn't interfere with my life at all.  I still get happy, sad, scared, excited.  I'm just able to focus so much better and take one thing at a time.  I've been married for 5 years now and will be starting a family soon.  I really don't want to have to come off while pregnant or breastfeeding.....

I was put on it because of a bad childhood and its effecting me now and also because of the death of a friend. The dr says i should take 10 mg for 6 days and 20 mg thereafter. I just took my first 10 mg and I feel very awake. Its 10:30 pm and I don't think I'll be going to bed for a few more hours. I just hope it clears my mind and helps me get over at least some of this depression.

I had become quite angry and also sad at situations I previously could easily navigate thru. Knowing I was going thru perry menopause I asked my doctor for something and she prescribed it. It was such help from day one, after a few weeks I felt like my old self. I didn't realize how my personality had became different until I was thinking clearly again without all the emotions crowding how I looked at every situation. It was not a happy pill..it just cleared the fog. The side effects for me was clenching my teeth without realizing it, at night it became much worse and I bought a night guard to wear, which helped that problem and I have always been unsually &quot; wired&quot; last one to bed first one up, insomnia...now I was so relaxed I didn't want to get out of bed, and If I took the medicine early I would eventually would have to take a nap in the late afternoon or early evening..which was a rare occurrence before this. But still very small prices to pay for becoming my old self and not being influenced by about 80% emotion.

I've been on a low dose (10 mg) for 3 weeks and feel better already. I've been in a good mood all week and my load at work no longer feels like a boulder on my shoulders! I had a little nausea the first couple of days, but I started taking it with a meal and that helped.

About 8 mos after he died I became more depressed than the normal depression one goes through after going through this type of loss.  I wasn't sleeping and I cried all the time.  I even had a suicidal thought.  It was more of an analagy, but it scared me. The doctor was more concerned about my not sleeping and my depression since I had no intention of committing suicide.  He put me on Citalpram and it has worked wonders.  I sleep at night, and can handle my life better.

I will to to my Doctor. It has only been so-so in helping me. I have no side effects from the drug. But, I often plan out killing myself. But, that has nothing to do with the drug.I have done that before medication. I take a drug to sleep, and one for anxiety, too. The drugs only work moderately well. But, no side effects.I find sitting in the corner of a dark room helps me, too.

Ive been on it for three months, at 20mg i had very few side effects . I feel so much better.

It has made all my symptoms worse. I either can't sleep or sleep too much, my weight is like a yo-yo, my moods are all over the placer and so is my mind; my thoughts are incredibly scattered and disorganised, and my paranoia has not shifted. Unfortunetely I was allergic to Fluxotine.

I know my family is much happier and so am I! I do have really wierd dreams and they seem so real and like another mans comment I had to stop for the first time during sex because I couldn't go any longer(can't climax but had best time ever), My wife thought I was on viagra, thats funny, I mean great!

Depression	adam, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	19-24	7/26/2008 11:57:24 AM	This was the first medication I was put on.  It helped my depression and anxiety immensely yet their were two side effects I experienced while taking citalopram.  I was tired all of the time and at night had trouble falling asleep.  Then there were the sexual side effects which were more frustrating considering i'm relatively young.  Overall the bad outweighed the good so I was taken off it, with no luck so far on other drugs (prozac).    
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/23/2008 12:16:37 AM	This medication has been very helpful for me.  I am very happy and content with my life at times.  Your life is what you make of it.  I have been on this medication for about 2-3 years.  I have been on different doses and I have finally found the dosage that works. (20 mg @ night).  My life is not perfect and no ones is, but this medication really helps.

Depression	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		7/10/2008 7:33:44 PM	I have taken this for 2 years and feel like it has helped greatly.  My doctor said that it would also help with the &quot;change of life&quot; issues and it sure has.  No more night sweats.  It was interesting to read others reviews about the dreaming.  I didn't realized that it could be the reason I have been having very vivid dreams every night.  Sometimes those dreams stick in my head all day and I have to think really hard if it was something that really happened or something I dreamed.   Overall though I am very please with the results.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/5/2008 11:15:42 PM	I have only been taking this medication for the past two days, and prior to this I was taking xanax. Doc told me it would take about three weeks to get into my system but I have been feeling a difference just in two days. Hope it gets better from all the good reviews I have read about this medication. I didn't take the xanax other then when I ONLY felt like I needed one. They were very addicting when I was taking them as prescribed. I was happy to hear that citalopram isn't addicting.  I use to get upset easily and cry when things really got to me, now I have been more relaxed and feel better overall. Im not on edge about things the last couple days and I hope I have the same luck as the other users at dropping a few pounds! Side effects with me has been a little dry mouth and maybe a little tired, but so far so good! Will report later with further comments.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	friend, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	4	4	Female	45-54	6/28/2008 8:48:23 PM	I have been taken just a small dose (10mg) for the first three weeks.  I definitely have seen results for my anxiety and repetitive negative thoughts.  After three weeks I graduated to 15 mg (doctor agreed it was okay to cut pill in half).  The goal is 20mg. I am super sensitive to drugs and wanted to start slow to make sure I could tolerate it.  Side effects included loss of appetite and tight stomach for about 5 days after starting and again as I increased the dose.  I feel like this drug might be just the ticket to control my overactive anxious thoughts.  I am very hopeful.

I know it says that it takes awhile to get into your system and work but it seems to be helping me already! I feel very motivated to get up and get on with life whereas before I didn't want to do anything, especially exercise. I felt like crying all the time and that seems to be alleviated as well. My appetite has decreased which is wonderful and the only side effect that seems to bother me is slight stomach upset. I am very hopeful that this will continue to help me !!

Quite often, I would work myself into a panic over small things and sometimes over nothing, and my heart would pound rapidly causing my anxiety level to go even higher.  I feel that citalopram has had the effect of keeping my anxiety below the level that would trigger a rapid heartbeat.  The only side effect of any significance I have noticed is that I am often unable to climax during sex.  Other than that it has been incredible helpful.

Depression	GPV, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/19/2008 12:24:15 PM	It was prescribed to me for severe depression after my divorce.  My wife of 14 years divorced me for a 24 year old kid who worked for us, she was 38.  A friend recommended a psychologist but after the session she said &quot;you need to see a psychiatrist&quot;.  She recommended one who said &quot;you're in pretty bad shape, let's see how you do with this drug&quot;.  Well, after less than a week, I was alive again.  I slept well, no dreams, no anxiety attacks, overall happiness (before I felt like wanting to cry all the time) and best of all, sexually I performed like a million.  No ED or premature ejaculation.  I dated a lot of girls in their 20s (I'm 40) and many said they couldn't believe a guy my age could outperform kids their age.  When I told the Doctor I had ED he said the pill could help, but I didn't mention the PE.  It was after a couple of weeks that I noticed how long I was lasting that I looked it up and learned that Citalopram could help eliminate this condition and believe me it did.  This pill truly saved my life.

I have been on it for almost a year. I have experienced a few side effects though: heat rash when exposed to sunlight for long periods, sleepiness and yawning, strange dreams, and most of all, weight gain. I have gained about 10 pounds since being on it. Oh well, I'd much rather be fat and happy!!!

The first few weeks I had some side effects of nausea and excessive yawning and sleepiness, but that has subsided.

No more crying and anger outbursts and only a few minor panic attacks.  I feel I am finally enjoying life and my new son.  Definately wait out the side effects, it worth it!

I am on Citalopram 40mg at bedtime, and have CRAZY dreams, and its every single night, it is the weirdest side effect I think Iv ever had on any drug. They aren't nightmares, just dreams, lots and lots. I don't mind it since I don't have too many other side effects, and it has really helped me. I am much more confident in myself, and can speak up for myself, and talk with a clear mind. Before the medication I could barely hold a conversation without having an anxiety attack. I started to do more things that I enjoy, and do them without needing a friend by my side. I could barely go to the bodega by myself, I was so panicky. I love the way I am now, and feel that things will only get better!

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	25-34	5/23/2008 8:51:43 PM	I was on Lexapro for over 2 yrs and then lost my insurance.  My doctor put me on Celexa instead.  I'm having a really hard time with the side effects.  I didn't experience any with the Lexapro.  Celexa really upsets my stomach and I can't sleep very well.  I'm on the lowest dosage and I'm afraid to up it.

He said I was less moody and angry all the time. I'm not sure what kind of feeling or feelings I have. I do notice that I don't cry as much as I used to, but more often than not, I feel like there's no emotions.  Like this medication is holding me back from being who I am, good and bad.  After not taking this for almost 2 months, I started to feel very tense, jittery, and angry over the slightest thing. Annoyed at everything. I took two tablets, thinking that that would calm me down, and I had a very scary reaction of rapid heartbeat, excessive shaking and the feeling of loosing consciousness.  I also had fleeting thoughts of hurting myself.  My husband took me to the emergency room as a percaution. I don't want to depend on this medication, but I guess I'll have to.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/19/2008 10:22:34 PM	It has only been 10 days since I started this medicine after trying prozac and paxil. Citalopram 20mg has helped alot. I feel great so far. My husband has even noticed a diffence for the good. I also have been taking it night the only thing neg. effect I have noticed is night sweats. I will report back at a later date.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/16/2008 7:54:54 PM	Take at night only. I've been taking it for about 3 months now. This drug works great, took a couple of weeks to start, so give it time. Stopped the crying, wild thoughts and over eating.

Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	5/6/2008 4:30:33 AM	On Celexa, then later generic citalopram, 20 mg,  for over 7 years now. No major depressive episodes or panic attacks (other than a few caused by other drugs) during this time. If I remember correctly, blurred vision the first week, but virtually no side effects since. Probably decreased libido but hasn't adversely affected that area of my life too much. It says not to drink alcohol, but I've never seen any real interaction while drinking. In all, a great choice, having had bad experiences with Zoloft (flat, 'zombie' mood) then Prozac (fine for a while but then truly horrible side effects when restarting it after a few months off). I question whether I still need it sometimes, but for now its still with me.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/30/2008 4:50:45 PM	Best thing I've ever taken. I found myself turning into this scared of everything person that just wanted to sleep all the time and it has turned everything around for me. It has even helped me to not crave food half as much! It allowed me to be more confident at work, with myself, and even in my classes in college! I would recommend it to anyone.

I was being treated for both depression and anger and this has helped immensely with both.  I find myself calm, happy, rolling with the punches, and making rational decisions.  I did have sexual side effects (decreased libido, prolonged &quot;O&quot;) for a while but they went away and that has returned to normal. This is a person I like being, I hope I can feel this way without the drug.

I am finally starting to feel a little normal.  I am less stressed and I don't worry as much. I have lost my appetite which is worrying me, but I could lose a couple pounds.  I have a little blurred vision (problems focusing)  but I think this will work great.  I am taking 10mg.
Depression	georgia08, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/17/2008 2:02:31 AM	my dr. put me on 20mg at first.  i experienced loss of appetite, nausea, and just felt drained.  i don't think they kicked the depression, they just kind of kicked me, which made me not so irritable and sad.  after 3 weeks i was put on 40mg.  i did not experience any side effects after increasing the dose, and i can tell now that they are working.  i don't feel amazingly happy, but i don't feel like a zombie either.  i'm just kind of existing and feeling what i feel, which is much better than the sadness, anger, and hopelessness that i felt before taking this medicine.
Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	4/16/2008 1:47:56 PM	Citalopram has given me my life back.  I suffered from depression, OCD, and anxiety since being a teenager.  After the birth of my daughter a year ago, I suffered from an extreme case of postpartum depression which pushed my current case of mild depression, OCD, and anxiety off the charts.  I finally sought treament last summer and started seeing major changes after 2-3 weeks taking 20mg.  My current dosage is now 60mg daily.  I suffered initally from all the major symtoms including headaches, drowiness, and loss of sex drive.  After 8+ months of using this drug, I only suffer from the loss of sex drive which seems to be getting better as time goes along.  Life is good now and I'm enjoying every moment with my family and friends.  My only regret was not to seek treatment earlier for my problems.

I did not even realize this and I am concerned about how he viewed me. He cares about me as a friend and said I went from one topic to the next. Please let me know if citalopram is for me.

He got up to 60mg and it seemed to help. No real side effects except he needs to take it in the morning. Doctor is now decreasing dosage to wean him off in preference of a new drug. This change, 2 weeks in, seems to be doing the trick. Still has some bad days but not NEAR as often and no where near as bad.

I am much more calm and relaxed.  I currently take it in the morning, but am sleepy for a few hours.  Will check into taking it before bed.  Sex drive gone.  It does make me sweat alot more.  Weight has stayed the same.  Awful headaches the first 3 weeks.  Nothing 800mg of ibuprofen cant help.  Headaches now gone.  It has been a good drug for me.

Depression	thankful gal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/28/2008 11:05:00 AM	I started taking 20mg about 3 months ago. I noticed a difference after a couple of weeks, but after a couple of months I didn't feel I was as happy as I wanted to be. I tried adding Wellbutrin so that I could also quit smoking. The side affects were bad for me and I hadn't cut down on the smoking. I switched to 40mg of Citalopram two weeks ago and it's working amazingly for me. After being depressed for 10 years, I never thought I could actually be this happy. If this drug doesn't work for you, don't give up, there is something that will work for you. It might take a long time to find the right drug and dosage, but it's well worth it in the end. I'm glad I finally got help.
Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	3/25/2008 10:57:00 AM	I started taking Celexa about a month ago for severe depression and anxiety. Although it hasn't taken the depression and anxiety totally away (it's not a happy pill) I feel motivated and can actually push the down feelings away and focus on something else. My depression isn't absorbing my life anymore, and I can function like I used to. I only wish that I would feel totally normal with no down thoughts, but I think therapy will help that go away. I have had no side effects except for yawning and tiredness a few hours after I take it, which helps me go to sleep, and this way I don't need a sleep drug for insomnia. I feel a little of the decreased sex drive, but that is a small price to pay for leading a normal life.

T rying to commet suicide twice! My female partner was a huge cause of going on Citalopram in the first place. I was trying to stabelize my family. It's her way or the highway. Also, I thought it would help me with the mind games she always played! She always has to have her way.

I have now been on it for over a month.  My anxiety has really turned around.  I have been able to go to the grocery store, parties with my kids, speak to people without panicking, and lots of other things.  I still sometimes get a little antsy about going some places, but I have been fine.  I am so thankful that I feel better.  I have also begun seeing a therapist for my anxiety.  My headaches and nauseau have gone away.  I think it just took some time for my body to get used to the medicine.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	calgig, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/18/2008 11:53:52 AM	I was taking Citalopram for anxiety.  I was on it for about 4 weeks. It finally took its effects about 3 weeks into treatment however I began noticing that I was always tired. I would get 7, 8, and sometimes 9 hours of sleep and I could still sleep. I would eventually pull myself out of bed. However, other than that I had a good experience with it. Other than a bit of nausea and stomach upset for the first 3 days on it. But everyone's different
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	3/18/2008 10:24:13 AM	I was put on citalopram to help control migraines. I'm not sure if it helped or not, I'm still getting them just not as often. I do know it has killed my sex drive. I went off them about 4 weeks ago and after 3 days sex was back to great. However yesterday I had a major migraine. Today I'm going back to the doctor and asking for something different. It sucks having to choose between satisfying sex with my husband or migraines.

It makes me dizzy, always sleepy and extremely irritable. I don't feel like myself. It's an off and on feeling. So after 3 months of this drug, I'm going to seek something new.

Depression	sadie78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	2/24/2008 2:31:56 PM	I was useing Lexipro till I couldn't afford it anymore. Needed to go to a generic. Went from 10mg to 40mg overnight. Been on it sence the first of the month. Lost my appetite totally (lost 12 pounds), things that used to bother me dosen't bother me much anymore, and I am more at ease to talking to people that I had a problem with before. When I take it at bedtime I have to also take a sleeping pill so I can sleep. Really don't know the sexual side effects are. I am sick with the flu right now so that dosen't help, but it makes getting up in the morning a little easier. I have noticed I am alot quieter, I stay in the background and I have alot more patience for my kids. Great drug but gotta get used to the side effects.
Panic Disorder	lynnik32, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	2/20/2008 7:57:36 PM	I have been on this medicine for about a week now for anxiety and panic attacks.  I took it before bed the first night, then I was up all night.  So I started taking it in the morning, and it keeps me awake.  It seems like it has helped me emotionally, and I am not worried as much, but have still had a few small panic episodes.  I have been extremely nauseous, had very little appetite(which isn't like me at all) and have had terrible headaches.  I started at 10mg, now at 20.  Seeing the doctor in 2 days to dicuss how the medication is working.  I don't know if I should give it some time or not b/c the headaches are really bad...if anyone out there is experiencing the same thing, please let me know.

The only side effect is dry mouth about an hour after I take the medicine and it makes me sleepy, so I take it before bed and I wake up refreshed.

I was diagnosed with depression in May of 2007 and this medication has helped wonders. I love it. I do hope that someday soon I can slowly take myself off of it.

I tried: zoloft, wellbutrin, paxil, and so many others. Most made me gain weight because they made me so lazy. I was started on Celexa one month ago..WOW   what a difference!!! I feel well, my mood is well balanced. No crying spells, no depression!  I feel like a dark cloud has been lifter off!! I have had NO side effects. I am not hungry all the time. I am hoping that to loose these extra pounds now that i feel &quot;well&quot;. I have energy to want to exercise and not be lazy.I recomend this 100%

My mood has levelled out, with very few highs or lows.  But my weight has gone up, I fall asleep when sitting on a chair and I have short-term memory loss.  One thing that I have learnt is that you need to match the dosage with any weight gain - I had put on quite a bit of weight and a small rise in the dosage did wonders.

Depression	Ohiogal , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	1/25/2008 12:06:10 PM	Was prescribed this after my insurance would not cover Lexapro, which I preferred.  Was given this for minor depression, irritability, tendency to cry and inability to sleep well.  I've been on it a month.  Pros:  Much less irritable, no crying and fall asleep within a short amount of time at night.  Cons: No appetite (however no weight loss either darn!), night sweats and increased sleepiness. 
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/24/2008 11:50:02 PM	My husband had esophagal and tongue cancer. Lots of awful treatment &amp; lots of pain.  After my husband died, I couldn't stop crying at very inappropriate times, making work and social life very difficult.  It didn't help that I was going thru menopause at the same time.  This has been a Godsend.  I had very few side effects and they were gone in a short time.

I would take it, then stop, i dont recomend this because it made me extreamlly nausious, I would vomit about twice a day.  Now I take it everynight, and have seen a great improvement.  I used to get very depressed when I would get my period, crying and everything, This last time, I didnt even know I was getting my period, I'm a much nicer, calmer person now.  Love it
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	3	Female	25-34	1/16/2008 3:09:40 PM	I have been on Citalopram for almost a year. I have noticed weight gain and i have been yawning a lot. On the Plus side I am much happier (well not about the weight) with everything. 
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/14/2008 11:45:43 PM	I changed from Lexapro to Citalopram (chemically much the same) due to the lesser expense of the generic. I have also taken Paxil and Prozac, and on this drug, I have the least amount of sexual side effects (no reduced libido). I have side effects of some sleepiness and yawning, but not much else. I have not gained any weight while on this drug. I sleep well. Overall, I am less edgy and not as easily &quot;upset&quot; as I was without it.

Did not help and made me feel worse. Not the first one to do that though, I have used Lexapro, Prozac, and this all of them made me feel worse than I originally did but it seems as though doctors want to keep trying a different drug combo everytime...stopped taking it for one day and ever since I have felt &quot;normal&quot; again.

Depression	35-44 (Patient) 	4	5	5		35-44	1/11/2008 12:36:27 PM	I was switched to this med, because my weight gain was out of control on Flouoxitine, this is a much better alternative. My overall happiness has greatly improved. I have decided that the yawning, and sometimes tiredness is just part of the depression package, sure beats sadness!!!!
Depression	19-24	4	5	4		19-24	1/10/2008 2:44:24 PM	I have been on this for 5 years, I yawn a lot, I sleep great(i always did before), my appetite is the same as it has always been, the best thing in did for me was that I am not so irritable and easily annoyed as I was before. Everyone responds differently to it.

Depression	Heather, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	19-24	1/2/2008 11:24:17 AM	I reviewed this drug after 2 days of taking it on 12/7. The 3rd day was fabulous - no headaches or nausea... I was in the best mood of my life. The 4th day was pretty good too, but every day after has been fairly blah. I suppose my disposition has improved a bit, but I'm still dealing with the non-hunger and I have lost 7 pounds because I can only manage to eat an orange or a yogurt every day. My hair has been falling out like it did after I gave birth. It definitely increased suicidal thoughts when dealing with a terrible break up two days before Xmas (though I had the presence of mind to have friends stay with me and not be alone), but it has helped me deal with everything better thus far. I'm going to take it for another month and see how things go. I'll let you know if anything changes.

Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	12/29/2007 1:44:49 AM	Citalopram has been as effective as any antidepressant I've taken.  (and I've taken most of them [SSRI's])  However, the sexual side effects have been difficult to deal with. Erection problems and anorgasmia seem to be more pronounced than with some of the other drugs.  My doctor and I have been trying to work around these problems with the ED drugs (expensive!) and several others to deal with the anorgasmia.  Typical.  Other drugs are needed to counter the side-effects of another!  Has anyone had success dealing with this.  If so, please post your experiences.

Citalopram, is very, very effective. No issues at all.  Other drugs caused me to be very &quot;high strung&quot;, others left me appethetic.  This drug is really effective, back to normal.  What more can you ask for.

Depression	Heather, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	12/7/2007 3:33:17 PM	I have been on this for 2 days and I can already tell a difference. I have less bad thoughts and anxiety attacks, though this could also be from the ridiculous headache that I have had since I started taking it. I have been sick to my stomach and hardly able to eat also. I slept GREAT the first night, but only managed to get 1 hour of sleep last night - will try taking it in the morning to see if that helps. The other strange thing is that I am a very busy, rapid thinking person and if you picture all the trains of thought you have at once (which is typically 7) as lanes on a highway, I feel like 5 lanes have been blocked off and traffic is trickling through. Does anyone know how long the headache and nausea are supposed to last? I will post again as progress continues and side effects taper off.

Yawning feels odd, its unexplainable, but weird.  Having trouble sleeping, but my mood is better.  If I had my way, I'd be on Lexapro, but insurance won't cover it anymore.  A good alternative though.

Depression	rihannanevada, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	11/24/2007 3:32:45 AM	I got on this because I experienced too many side effects with another antidepressant.  On this one, I have relatively few.  I have gained about 5 pounds, but that is okay because I do not weigh very much.  It has helped with my depression, but I still feel anxious a lot, but that is probably mostly a logical reaction to life changes.  The problem is that I get very moody if I forget to take this medication, which I often do.  I then usually remember a few hours later and take it and start feeling fine soon after.  I have even experienced a panic attack because I forgot to take my dose of citalopram one day.  Also, I have been having worse nightmares than normal since getting on this, that bother me more than they used to.  Otherwise, this seems to be a good drug for me with few side effects, and hardly any physical side effects (no sexual problems unlike with Paxil :D )

Took 20mg one night to help me sleep and it kept me awake for two nights.  Took 10mg this morning with my Adderall XR 20 and my heart rate and blood pressure have raised considerably.  Have the fidgets, my hands have to constantly be moving or doing something, can't stop pacing, when I sit I start rocking back and forth, rapid speech, feel like I am about to crawl out of my skin, throat is getting sore.  Not a good drug to treat the panic and anxiety that can accompany adult ADHD, nor to help with sleep.
Depression	dritz, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	11/13/2007 11:05:25 PM	After suffering for 6 years with depression and anxiety issues this has been a god send. Within the first 2 weeks I began to feel like myself again. I take it before bed every night and I sleep 100x better (I have been on and off prescription sleep meds for my insomnia for 2 years) the only side effect that really bugs me is increased sweating. It seems when I am dealing with a situation that used to send me into an anxiety attack I can handle it mentally but not physically. I have experienced a loss in appetite opposite to most of the reviews I read but with all the left over baby weight plus my late night stress/depression bingeing it doesnt feel that bad. I also finally feel enough like my self to go back to swimming and the gym. So I am sure that I can get my appetite back under control. 
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	11/13/2007 6:07:17 AM	Took my first dose last night, 20mg, to help  me sleep and to ease stress and panicky feelings.  Only slept 3 hours, was wide awake at 4am and too hot to stay under the covers.....and I usually am freezing.  Got out of bed at 5:30 because I was unusually hungry and had a splitting headache.  Dr had tried Klonopin, but I had allergic reaction to that.  Will these side effects go away or do I need to stop now and try something else?

Depression		5	5	5			11/8/2007 3:08:50 PM	The only side effect I get from taking this medication is I find myself yawning quite a bit.  It isn't that I am tired, but it is a common side effect that can be a little annoying at times.  Otherwise the small amount I take (10mg) daily in the morning helps keep my mind balanced without feeling as though I don't have control of my own thoughts and feelings.

But reading reviews I see some are not sleeping because of this med.. Can I get some feed back as this will determine if I even want to try this .. This is the second type of meds the doc is trying and the first was a waste of one month..
Depression	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	11/6/2007 8:57:24 AM	This is the first anti-depressant that had no side effects for me and it changed my life.  For years I didn't laugh much and I was unhappy.  About 2 weeks after starting this medicine, I realized that I felt like &quot;myself&quot; again.  I recommend Celexa to everyone who can take it! ( I take it at night because it DOES make me sleepy.)

Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/31/2007 9:15:16 AM	This medication has been deemed a miracle drug in my household. Within 3 weeks of taking this med I feel 95% better than I have in years.  My only complaint is that I yawn a lot, but I would prefer yawning to depression!

I had no nausea and after a week or so at this dose my symptoms improved dramitically.  No more panic, crying or feeling terribly sad.  My sleep pattern improved too.  I used to take ages getting to sleep and wake up in the very early hours.  I had tried several other SSRIs but none of them worked long-term.  Citalopram is different!  I can get on with my life and no side-effects! I am a pharmacist as well as a patient and am so glad to have been prescribed this medecation.
