Other	Secretary, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	7/20/2012 6:18:58 PM	I have been on this drug for Bipolar 1 condition for over twenty years.  I take a very low dose, 25mg-50mg per day, to make me sleep. At first it made me groggy and gave me nasal congestion, but after I got used to it, I would not trade it for any of the newer drugs.  It always puts me to sleep and I wake up rested.  It was also the only drug other than Zyprexa to control my mania, but Zyprexa literally made me gain a pound a week, until I had to discontinue it to lose weight.  Now I take Abilify instead of the Zyprexa and have found a perfect balance.  I would recommend this drug to anyone with mania that is difficult to control, or anyone with severe sleep disorders.  Make sure you realize that it will take you about six weeks to get used to the drug...it's very strong and is literally made to knock you out cold, which is why it works great when I take it only at night before I go to bed.  I have never had any sort of heart problems, even with hard exercise, whereas Seroquel made my heart skip beats when I exercised and scared the hell out of me.
Other	Alan, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male	45-54	7/30/2011 9:28:08 AM	I am now 51 years old.  At age 7, I was diagnosed with behaviour problems.  I was put on Mellaril, which did slow me down and allowed me to focus better and be less disruptive in class and at home.  I was on this medication for a period of 7 years.  At age 22, I was diagnosed as having &quot;Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis&quot; or PSC which is a degenerative liver disease which leads to liver failure.  The only cure is a liver transplant. Curiously, one of the side affects of taking the drug Mellaril is liver damage.  At age 30, my liver had degenerated to the point where it was necessary for me to have a liver transplant.  The alternative was death.  I was fortunate to have been able to have received a liver that was compatible and available when I needed it.  There is no history of liver disease in my family. If the medication you take to help 1 problem, almost kills or does kill the patient, is it worth it?  I have heard people say that it angers them when people don't medicate their children.  Maybe the parents are not wanting to give their children a death sentence just to appease other people.  I have heard of people taking the manufacturer of Mellaril to court with a class action suit.  Where do I join up because I am now having trouble supporting myself because of my transplant and the side affects of the anti-rejection medication.  Note: If someone recommends that you or your children take Mellaril, run, because you will save yourself many years of heartache and/or pain and suffering as I have had to endure. If you can help me with more information about a law suit or want to know more about my complications of taking Mellaril, contact me at jefferyhaven@gmail.com .

It definately helped me to sleep, sort of helped my mood swings, not really any adverse side effects other than occassional heart palipitations, but were short lived and not severe.  But I didn't think I needed such a powerful medication for my condition, (sleeplessness, mild mood swings, anxiety, panic attacks).

Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	7/25/2010 10:09:04 AM	in 1973 i was forced to take 15-75 mg of melarril daily.The &quot;doctor was BARASI SILA in Baltimore,MD. while some friends were perscribed ritalin I knew noone else on mellarill. shortly after beginningh treatment I began experiencing facial grimacing that continues occasionally to this day. I also have what I term a mild form of tourettes syndrome (these symptoms ususlly occurr when I am alone) I now know this drug is now only used in extreme cases of schitsophrenia (excuse spelling) This treatment was part of an overall childhood of physical and emotional abuse. I wish I had never been subjected tothis form of chemical lobotomy. I would like to someday find out how many perscriptions for mellaril were written in 1973

It caused me to be extremely hyper. I could not sit still. It caused sleep problems,eg:dreams,doing odd things in my sleep. I gained twenty pounds in one month. I was given Cogentin to counter the side affects. I had to get glasses so I could read. To this day I still wonder how I kept from commiting suicide while on this drug. It was horrible.

Other	michele, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	3/26/2009 2:27:02 PM	doctor treated me for anxiety. First tried seraquel and I threw up. This is what he perscribed next. It seems a little heavy handed. Even though I am only taking 24ms, I can see this is a strong drug.I feel dizzy, head feels heavy and my movements are jerky.
Other	Dawn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	12/6/2008 7:00:31 PM	My doctor tends to put me on major antipsychotic meds although I have 90% depression and 10% hypo-mania - no real mania or psychosis. Not Schizophrenic.He gave it to me for sleep @ it's too strong. I have major sleep problems. My heart has always tended to skip a beat so after I read about this med I stopped it &amp; told the doctor why. It knocks me out into the next day. He always gives me scary drugs at a high dose. I'm changing doctors. As for the person who's heart was damaged - I'm a lawyer and you have a good suit against your Dr. if the statute to sue hasn't run.
Schizophrenia	Stevee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/9/2008 7:16:53 PM	I was misdiagnosed with Schizophrenia over 14 years ago.  I had been on Mellaril for all that time.  I have not taken it for over a year.  Unfortunately, now, I have a heart condition.  I have had it for quite sometime.  I never had a serious mental illness.  But now I have to live with this condition.  What do I do?
Schizophrenia	lacy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/24/2007 8:22:05 PM	Millaril worked in helping my anxiety and nervous habits, pulling hair etc, when Seroquel didn't. Bonus:: Seroquel costs USD$500+ for me and WalMart charges USD$4.00 for the Millaril.
