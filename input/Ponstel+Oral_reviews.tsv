Other	mamabear, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/23/2011 9:47:15 AM	About 16 years ago I began having severe vomiting and some abdominal pain with my period.  My syptoms were debilitating monthly for 3-5 days and greatly limited my daily activites.  I tried OTC remedies such as Advil, Tylenol, Naproxen, and Pamprin none of which did anything to aleviate my symptoms.  Then I tried Ponstel.  My mother had been taking Ponstel for years for the same problems so we thought it was worth a try.  What a difference it made!  It took the edge off the pain and totally relieved the vomiting.  To be the most effective, it does have to be taken at the onset or just before the onset of syptoms.  The only down side to it is that insurance companies don't want to cover it, and it isn't cheap.
Painful Periods	Sufferin'Sue, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	5/27/2011 10:03:52 PM	I have struggled with heavy menstrual bleeding and a laundry list of severe period symptoms for about 10 years (I am 43 now).  I had an ablation about 5 years which reduced the heavy bleeding, it did not get rid of it completely, but it is manageable now.  Over the last 5 years I have tried everything my OB/GYN has recommended for the pain/cramps etc. - vitamins, advil, naproxen, the pill, ponstel(mefenamic acid).  Short of getting a partial hysterectomy (which has soooo many negative side effects) I don't know what else to do but suffer through it every month (twice a month - when i menstruate and when i ovulate) any other suggestions????
Painful Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	35-44	4/4/2011 4:49:42 PM	I gave this medicine a year to try to help me. The gas and side effects were so bad I had to discontinue use. While it did help the pain, it caused more gastro problems and nauseau than pregnancy. I am having an ablation to try to help. 
Painful Periods	Sheila, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/16/2011 5:57:40 PM	My menstrual camps have always been bad and now they are intensifying due to the endometriosis.  The cramps have gotten so bad, I'm awakened out of a sound sleep in pain. My OB/GYN prescribed 1 tablet of ponstel 250 mg and 1/2 tablet of Hydrocodone for the severe camps.  Now, the pain is goine and I sleep like a baby.  Thank you Dr. Henry!
Painful Periods	13-18 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	2/14/2011 7:43:35 AM	I absolutely hate this drug more than anything. I am 17 and have had bad cramps since I was 11. Ponstel did nothing for me except cause extreme nausea and loss of sleep. It costs like 120 each time I get my subscription refilled and that's not counting the 200 extra my insurance pays. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone...stick with advil or try birth control.
Painful Periods	TLS, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/30/2011 8:56:12 AM	After having kids, my periods became very heavy to the point that I was passing clots and the cramps were making me disfunctional.  I would have stomach upset and was so fatigued it was difficult for me to work and/or take care of my kids.  I went to see my dr and discussed options (not interested in the pill) and he prescribed this.  I noticed a major difference the first cycle while taking this medication.  Significantly less cramping and a much lighter blood flow. My energy level did not take such a severe hit during my menstrual cycle.  It is expensive- about $1 per pill after insurance but I only take it the firest 3 days of my cycle.  I am forever greatful.

It caused me to not be able to focus in school and it hurt my social life. Now that I take this medicine, I do not feel sick at all. It has been a life saver and I would recommend it to anyone who has painful periods. I have never had a side effect to it either. I no longer have to fear &quot;that time of the month.&quot;

Painful Periods	Debbi ~, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/13/2010 2:27:20 PM	In the early 70s, heard a female doctor from Long Island on TV (Stanely Segal Show) about Ponstel (yes, I remember her name!).  She explained, each month prosta glanda (spg?) produces pain, etc. ~ Ponstel is a MEDICATION (not a narcotic) and when taken at the OnSet (not before) relieves pain and suprisingly works month-to-month!  Took Ponstel for at least 20+ years!  I got a LIFE, didn't miss work and could function (even planned a European trip)!  In the beginning, would need for 2 or 3 days each month, by the end of my 40s, only needed 1 or 2 pills the first day!  Never any side effects!  Recommended it highly to other sufferers and they sought me out to thank me ~ it helped them too!  
Painful Periods	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	11/9/2010 8:21:24 PM	Still had painful periods after using Ponstel for two months. Doctor switched me to Tylenol 3 w/codiene that works much better.

By the age of 15 my cramps were so bad before and during my period that it was hard for me to move, use the bathroom or eat. I went to the doctor and was soon diagnosed with endometrioses. For the last couple of years I have been on ponstel and I cant tell you how much it has changed my quality of life. My pain is now bearable and for a woman who has a menstrual cycle that lasts 7-9 days its great to have my life back.

But since I paid $25 for it, I tried again.  The second time I used it I experienced and shorter less painful period.  The third time, I barely had cramps and my period was reduced.  I have had severe cramps since I was 11 and am now 34.  This works and I may stop taking the pill if it can completely reduce the pain.  Where was this 23 years ago?
Painful Periods	mackenzie62006, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	1/28/2010 2:05:41 PM	I have been having painful periods for years now, it happens to run in my family. A few months ago my cramps were so bad one day that I threw up 3 times over a period of 3 hours, I was in the shower for over an hour- just letting the water run on my back- till it got cold, and the pain was so severe I was bawling. I've just been taking this medicine for about 2 months when I am cramping. Yesterday, I was cramping really bad so I took the pill on pain onset at 4:00 and it didn't kick in till about 7:15. That is that biggest disappointment to me. I also had a little stomach ache. Once it kicks in, it gets rid of the pain.. it's just the pain in waiting is still so horrible. I still wish I could find something better, but I'm satisfied for now.
Painful Periods	happy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	1/16/2010 10:10:29 PM	I have been taking this medication since I had my 3rd child 3 years ago, after my first cycle      after giving birth, the bleeding was so heavy I had to leave work after making a huge mess (while wearing a pad AND tampon nonetheless) and was very embarassed upon arriving to emerg. The Dr there prescribed this medicine and has helped me regain control of my life.  As long as I take it 2-3 days before my cycle begins (moods giving me the heads up) the bleeding is bearable and even at times now pain free.   Very impressed.
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/4/2010 2:12:38 PM	I have always wondered why I had such PAINFUL periods.  I have gone through 3 cycles of IVF and find out that I have endometriosis.  I guess that explains the pain with periods!!!  The past few months (during and inbetween IVF cycles) I have had the most painful periods I have ever had.  This month I actually had to go to the doctor (not wanting to go to ER for cramps) and he put me on Ponstel.  Within 20-30 minutes I WAS PAIN FREE!!!!

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/3/2009 2:58:08 PM	After being treated for endometriosis (moderate - severe) this drug was prescribed because I didn't want to use the Lupron.  I took the samples and noticed a slight difference in my pain, nothing substantial yet.  I started taking the prescribed dose and it did nothing, not to mention that I found out after one full day of dosing that I was allergic to them go figure!  They were making me sicker than before I started taking them, and not the regular side effects, the stop immediately and tell your doctor side effects.....won't be recommending this!
Other	lillie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/2/2009 2:17:44 PM	i have heavy bleeding at my young age of 48. i have used it 2 times aready and it was wonderful not getting up to change my pad every 2 hours at nite for 2nd and 3rd day. it was a relief not to bleed so much.
Painful Periods	tamiaira, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/2/2009 12:54:50 PM	Occasionally, the onset of my period brings cramping so bad I'm completely unable to move: hot and cold, drenching in sweat, with waves of nausea and cramping that can go on for hours and hours.  Ponstel is the only thing that has worked for me, and I've been using it - occasionally - for almost twenty years.  For me, it delivers complete relief quickly (less than an hour), and like other reviewers, I do consider this my 'miracle' drug.I note that some reviewers are using it routinely which I have chosen not to do - first, the risks are quite real when you read the small print and - most importantly for me - I don't ever want to 'get used' to Ponstel as it is my drug of last resort for kill-me-now period pain.  
Painful Periods	plm25, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	7/16/2009 6:28:53 PM	On Day 3 and so far no relief from this medication, I don't think it works that well.

Before Ponste, many times the cramping was so bad my legs would giveout on me and I'd be stranded on the floor where I stood. After years of this, one of my doctors finally prescribed me Ponstel and it has been life-saver. The medication completely rids me of pains during less intense months, or at least causes the pain to not be anywhere as bad as it used to be. I couldn't ask for anything more.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	25-34	6/12/2009 1:26:22 PM	I am using this medication as a buffer between now and when I have my surgery in a couple of weeks for endometriosis. I had to pay $419 for it. It doesn't really work that well. Still experiencing pain.

Been the best thing ever, take first day and make sure you take before the pain comes back to keep at bay..I take 3-4 hours between for 2-3 days !!! Love Ponstell !!!!
Painful Periods	kwblack, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/6/2009 12:51:54 AM	I have had painful periods since I was 11.  I am now 32.  I have been diagnosed with mild-moderate endometriosis via surgery.  Every month I was missing at least 1 day of school/work.  I asked my ob/gyn to prescribe something effective w/out making me sleepy.  I still needed to function.  Ponstel has been a MIRACLE DRUG for me.  A true answer to my prayer.  Completely takes away the pain and maybe some bloating without any droziness.  I have recommended this to several friends . . they all love it too.
Painful Periods	E, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/21/2009 3:19:18 AM	Since I started menstruating at 14 I've had to deal with irregular periods -- they got more regular after I turned 30 -- and cramps that ranged from mild discomfort to curled-up-in-a-ball, moaning-in-pain horrible. Ponstel is about the only thing that really works when I feel the cramps starting to come on bad. I use it occasionally when it feels in advance like my period is going to be awful or when the cramps are already starting. Definitely works for me; no bad side effects except mild drowsiness when I take it after the cramps start (and that's a good thing as far as I'm concerned because I doze off and the cramps are gone). I haven't noticed any drowsiness if I take it before the cramps start. Only other symptom I've noticed is a little mild dry-mouth.

No other meds worked until my gyno suggested Ponstel. I highly reccommend it to anyone and everyone!
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/3/2009 2:55:20 PM	 I have had horrendous cramps my whole life, as well as ovarian cysts.  Think: curled up in a ball at the bottom of the bed, face as white as a ghost, seriously unable to even walk.  One time I had to go to the ER, they were so bad and they gave me some Delodin or some other type of heroin or morphine derivative.  Once I had my daughter, they got slightly better but now I am often plagued with migraines during that time as well. My doctor has helped me over the years by trying different types of birth control (mostly for the migraines  hormone regulation) and taking something like Ponstel when you first start feeling pain and continuing it for about 3 days can really help.  I used to have to take narcotics to cope and now I just do occasionally.  This was important because I was working on getting my pilots license and you cant take any stuff like that.  Anyhow, if youre interested, your doctor can tell you more.

I Started taking this drug when I was 27 and it is the best drug ever for me. I only had to take it for 3days during my first time on it. It has really made my cramps less painful and the bleeding lighter. Past 3 years have been great.i would recommend anyone to try it that has painful periods.

Painful Periods	USS333, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/8/2008 9:48:36 PM	I have had severe menstrual cramps ever since I was 12 years old. During my period, I would take up to 12 ibuprofen a day to relieve cramping. I started taking Ponstel, and it has made some difference, especially at the onset of my period.  However, if I wait too long to take the next pill, the cramps come back in full-force.  Also, sometimes I feel a little loopy and dizzy, so definitely have something in your stomach before taking this prescription.  Overall, very satisfied!

Been on Darveset for 2 years and am tired of being druged out and still feel pain. I mean about a 5 after taking my meds plus getting headaches from the Darvest. Finally tried PONTSEL on my last cycle and it seemed to be very effective for pain relief...one of the better NASIDs i've tried since Toradol which they will not continually presribe...too strong

Sure, if I take like, three times the recommended dose and couple it with six ibuprofen, it helps a little. But I wouldnt recommend it at all.
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	7/16/2008 5:37:22 AM	ponstel had absolutely no effect whatsoever on my pain and I would not recommend it to anyone else with endometriosis. 
Painful Periods	finally, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	4/12/2008 11:12:56 AM	I went to 5 OB/GYNs before one of them finally came up with this drug, and he did so on my first meeting with him. I have had extremely painful periods most of my life and, as long as I take it at the first hint of a cramp, this stuff is like a miracle. I was taking 4000 mg of ibuprofen a day and still not getting this level of relief. Useless if you wait untill you really start cramping up, but if you take the ponstel early, it's great. I just wish I had known about it before age 39.
Painful Periods	mzblue, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/11/2008 9:04:04 AM	I have severe cramps where i have pain in the front and back, throw up lots of times when my period starts and have dirrhea at the same time so between lying in bed curled up, i'm in the bathroom trying to vomit or get my behind on the seat right after vomitting. I've tried ibuprofen, and those other OTC drugs like pamprim and the other ones but they didn't work. Someone told me about this medicine 2years ago and i wish i'd know earlier. After 7years of serious cramps, i finally became cramp free at the age of 20. I didn't have to miss classes again or exams because i couldn't get to school.It's my third year using this medication on a regular basis. I used to take it when my period starts and it worked well but now i take it a day or 2 before it starts. That's cuz after sometime, i did have little pain, like a 1 on a scale of 0 to 10 and i wanted to be completely pain free.  My periods are much lighter although they last a day day longer which is four days now instead of bleeding heavily in the past for 2-3days. I never experienced any side effects. I may experience some discomforts at times with my period but i don't have the pain anymore.FYI, this medication can cause bleeding. I've taken it for 4days this month and i'm bleed when i blow my nose. So i haven't taken it today and i don't have any pain. If you're the type who doesn't weigh much like me, i mean borderline bmi, it might make you dizzy the very first time you take it but aferwards, you shouldn't experience it. If aftersometime, taking it after your period starts doesn't work, try taking it a day before.

I am now 25, and I wish I have heard about this medication years ago. I know when my cycle starts, so I start taking it on the day my cycle should start. I can head off pain that way. It is at a minimum if at all now. It has a generic now, with my insurance I can get 60 tables for $25.00. Can't be that. THANK YOU PONSTEL !!
