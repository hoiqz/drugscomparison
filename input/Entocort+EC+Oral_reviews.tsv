Crohn's Disease	The Golden Girl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	35-44	8/21/2012 12:19:39 AM	I have been battling Crohn's disease since 1999 &amp; I've only had 2 short times of remission. I have tried every drug available on the market &amp; nothing seems to work for me? Prednisone made me feel like I was 18 again but the side effects were aweful &amp; not worth taking, I took steroids for 10 yrs. Since I started taking Entocort I have lost 20 pounds &amp; both of my arms hurt really bad-muscle weakness &amp; severe pain, fatigue &amp; heart racing. If my Dr would have informed me that this medicine was a steriod I probably would have discussed with him on not wanting to take it. The side effect of this med isn't worth taking it for me. I go to Mayo's 1st week of September &amp; hope this is the 1st medicine they want to take me off of. Hope this helps someone thats taking or is getting ready to take Entocort.

Steroids caused lots of weight gain. I was put on entocort and I have lost some weight, i have energy now and the trips to the bathroom have slowed to maybe 6 times a day instead of 10 to 15. I take 3 tabs a day 0 mgs. It is very expensive but it is worth it! i have been in remission for a year now and I have the entocort to thank.. And Dr t young. My hero!! Every case is different. I also have diabetes so what I can eat for the crohns, I xane because of the diabetes. And the insulin causes my crohns to act up. Its like I can deal with the crohns but the diabetes scare the crap out of me. So I have to go off the entocort cause it raises my blood sugar. So Im in between a rock and a hard place!!

I am not afraid to leave my house for fear that my diareha will flare up.  I have been on Entocort for about 3 weeks.  So far so good.

Now 63 years old. Dr has given me Entocort and wants it taken 9 mg at once daily. Immediately was so tired it was life threatening. I can tell Dr thinks it is just me. These specialist need to have this disease one week so they have more empathy for patient. Tried Cimzia and ended up in hospital 3 times in 3 months with bacterial infection. After all these years -- lost as what to do.

There is a trade off for me as I now make 5-7 trips to the restroom but constipation is causing me to spend from 30 minutes up to 2 hours per visit. I am now experiencing frequent urination. I'm not sure if the Entocort is related to this problem. I've been on Entocort for 2.5 months.

Crohn's Disease	Blessing , 7-12 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	7-12	3/15/2012 6:13:39 PM	My 7 year old daughter has been taking this med for 2 months now. It has been a COMPLETE blessing!! Before she missed so much school and was hopitalized 4 times. Finally after the Gastro docs at Childrens hospital done blood tests, stool samples, x-rays, the scope in both ends, byopsies and a barrium test ruled out IBD and crohns diease. Before this med my baby girl was throwing up every other week, has horrible belches and gas, stomach cramps, couldnt sleep, lost 14 pounds in 3 weeks, and we were both a complete mess. I took her out of public school and home school her know because the stress of her being bullied made her symptoms worse. Now shes down to 9 medications a day, has improved her grades and is social butterfly.

After being on Asocol for 10 days which nearly killed me; Entrocort has saved my life at the moment. Have been on it for 7 days and I am getting my life back - finally. Just started to experience ankle/foot swelling today. I do have back discomfort, but also have a back problem, so not sure if Entocort is causing this.  I'm also feeling very edgy; not sure of wt. gain as had lost so much before this med.  I'll take the relief I've gotten any day as opposed to what I've expeienced the past year. I am taking 3/day for 1 mo., then 2/day 1 mo. and 1/day last mo. I so hope I don't have a relapse.  Good Luck from misery my cohorts.  ;-)

Before I start any medications, I read reviews just to know what to possibly expect. I have to admit that after reading a few people's thoughts on this, I was a little hesitant to take it. But I haven't experienced AY of the side effects others have and it took care of all my symptoms within a week of starting it. I still have another 3 weeks to go, but I feel like myself again!

Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	45-54	7/6/2011 12:38:56 AM	I was prescribed to take Entocort 3mg at 3x a day. Taking it along with Asacol and a 30 day enema for ulcerative colitis/ulcerative proctitis was an interesting experience. After taking this regiment for one day the symptoms stopped. I was pleased with how it worked....but....a 6 week supply of Entocort Oral cost me $2300. Now that is INSANE. The enema was $1100 and the Asacol that I have to take for probably the rest of my life costs $800 for a 30 day supply. Now That Is Really INSANE. If left  untreated, complications will arise. Needless to say, I know what I may die of. Normally conditions such as this are serious and debilitating. Having to go the bathroom every 35 to 40 minutes all day long. You can't work and pay for these meds if you spend most of  your time in the bathroom because you will still have to use the bathroom time to time during flareups even with taking the medication. The cost needs to go down.
Crohn's Disease	GenGrace, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	4/18/2011 8:39:22 PM	It has worked okish for me I've been on it for 6 months. Now I'm having horrible water retention. In 4 days I've gained 27 lbs.  The only logical thing that can cause this is Entocort. Drs put me on lasix and is trying to wein me off slowly which didn't help anything. So I've stopped altogether. So far the lasix is working better and I've lost 20 lbs of the 27 I've gained since this started. Please talk to your doctor about length of time they want you on it and coming off. It's riduculisly expense. At 3 a day retail price is $1500.00 yes that's in American dollars.

Obviously systemic stroids work like a dream but have horrible side effects that made me resemble the hunchback of Notre Dame. Have been taking Budeson once a year for about 7 years and it works realy well for me, not as good as the regular steriods but with almost no side effects , a slight headache the first week or so, no buffulo hump, moon face or excess facial hair (yuck), usually feel much better after 1-2 weeks , very impotant to carry out the full treatment as doctor ordered otherwise relapse comes very quicly and sometimes worse than before when on steriods. 
Other	Diana, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	35-44	8/10/2010 10:38:27 PM	I am a 40 year old female and was put on Entocort for microscopic colitis.  It began to work almost immediately, but I also had some increasingly bad side effects.  I am writing this to tell others to listen to their bodies-if something feels off, see your doctor immediately.  I got the tiredness and bloating first, then the bruising.  I had bloodwork done, and my sugar levels had gone up and I got mild hypothyroidism.  I told my doctor, who said to start taking 2 rather than 3 pills, and maybe go down to 1.  In the meantime, I started bruising easily.  Finally, I ended up in the ER with DVT and a PE (blood clots in my leg and lungs).  I cannot say for sure that these are all related, but I do know I did not have these problems before beginning Entocort.  I have heard it works wonders for some, but if you are one of the unlucky ones, you could have serious side effects.   I say this again, listen to you body.  I do not want any others to go through what I did.
Other	Kezmo, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	8/9/2010 6:17:07 PM	I have had a lot of success with Entocort.  I have Ulcerative Colitis rather than Crohn's Disease, so my experience could be completely different. In the Spring of 2009, I became very ill and was in a very bad flare up.  The Doctor put me on 3 pills of Entocort a day for 30 days, 2 a day for 30 days, and then 1 a day for 30 days.  This worked extremely well.  For those of you struggling with results from this medication, I have a few comments to make about my time on Entocort and how I think it is more effective.  I did not drink ANY alcohol.  I have found that any alcohol (even just a single drink) makes symptoms MUCH worse and made it difficult for the medication to work to its full potential.  I also stopped taking any kind of oral mesalamine, but continued using the suppository, Canasa.  This obviously is not professional medical advice and I encourage you to speak with your Doctor about this.  Lastly, I started supplementing with Cod Liver Oil.  The Vitamin D in the Cod Liver Oil did wonders for my colon/large intestine.  I was symptom free for about 14 months until just recently I've had to go back onto Entocort due to recent stress.  I am not, by any means, a Cod Liver Oil sales/spokesperson, however; I do feel that supplementing with the gel caps have greatly contributed to my success of staying in remission.  Check with your Doctor to see what he/she thinks of this supplementation as it REALLY has worked well for me.

I 1st took it about 8-9 years ago and it didn't work very well. But as my crohn's has gone from mild to severe, I was asked by my Dr. to try it again. The 2nd time around it has worked very well. I also am on Remicade infusions every 2 months. Without the 2 drugs, I would probably be stuck in a nursing home.
Crohn's Disease	not a fan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	7/14/2010 3:56:45 PM	Began with one capsule every other day, this was tolerable. Per doctor's instructions I increased to 3 capsules a day. Within a few days I began experiencing adverse side effects. Fatigue that's almost depilatating, headache that generates nausea, back pain and overall body pain. Felt like I had been beaten with a baseball bat. Kept taking hoping to adjust, took for 2 weeks, finally quit. It's been 4 days off of meds, beginning to experience colitis symptoms again. Fatigue, headache are slow to go away. In my case, the treatment is worse because I am asymptomatic unless I experience a flair. Not eating is preferred treatment at this point. Sounds extreme, liquid diet helps me.

It wasn't until it got completely out of control that I had a second colonosocpy and a new Dr.  He found the same diagnosis after several tests had been done.  He simply put me on Entocort.  Started 3 pills a day for a month, then 2 for the 2nd month, then 1 for the third month.  It worked FABULOUS!  This drug has definately given me my life back.  I tried going off completely and the problems came back.  So I am still on one per day and it may be forever but I have experienced NO side effects at all!  Thank you to the makers of Entocort - It has truly saved my life!!!!

Recently after another bad flare my doctor prescribed Entocort, 9mg a day. Well I must admit that it worked, no more running to the bathroom every 20 mins. But a week into my treatment I noticed swelling in my ankles, a week later I called my doctor and was told to go to the ER. I had developed moon face and had peripheral edema a severe side effect. I was retaining an extra 15 lbs. of fluid from my hips down and had strech marks throughout my torso. I was told to stop the medicine and immediately lost the water weight in a couple of days. Entocort is a two edged sword, I definitely the somewhat normal life it helped me lead, but could definitely live without the elephant legs and stretch marks.

The doctor estimated that I have had for about 15 years based upon the inflammation. I was put on Pentasa which worked well until now and I just started with Endocort 9mg per day.  Side effects so far are insignificant but I almost immediatley noticed that it was helping.  I see my doctor on Monday the 21st and since it is a steroid I am hoping 3 months or less of using.

After many attempts on every drug and shot out there, I tried Entocort at 18. I used it for almost a year and realized that the drug had no effect on me. I felt so sick, STILL. I was put on Prednisone and found that was the only drug that actually worked! Now at 21, I am feeling very sick again, losing weight, pale/flushed looking, a lot of bathroom trips, so my doctor put me back on Entocort 3MG capsules 4x a day. Just started today and I hope it works this time. I can't take pills without gagging anymore, about a month ago I've been getting really bad times where I gag all day and the pills don't help with that.

I begin with 3 tabs the first month, then begin the weaning off process.  I go to 2 tabs the 2nd month and then 1 tab the last month and then I am off.I am a stong believer in natural healing and I will be fasting after taking this drug and will live on my vegan diet.  I have to be careful of the junk and sugar foods that trigger relapses in crohns.The one thing I have noticed is I get very depressed and lazy when on this drug and I have no desire to do anything.  I get depressed and it goes away when I get off of it.  Right now I am going off of it and hope never to have to use it again.  All drugs do have mental responses and this one effects in a way that if you can get depressed you will.

I have been struggling to find a medication that would enable me to lead a &quot;normal&quot; life. I have mised several days of work over the years because I was locked away in my bathroom for hours....often as many as 5-6hrs. I have been taking Lomotil, Bentyl &amp; Asacol for years now. And due to some recent issues my doctor prescribed Entocort. I've read nearly all of the postings and am quite....nervous to be on this drug. The only side effect I have experienced so far is SEVERE INSOMNIA. I will definitely stay in touch should additional side effects come about.
Other	Snakes, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	3/20/2010 6:13:31 AM	I am happy this drug worked for others. Unfortunately it took me from one extreme to the other. I began taking Entocort the first of March, for microscopic coloitis. I went from chronic diarrhea to constipation nearly overnight. The abdominal pain was unbareable. My doctor reduced the dose from three, 3mg caps daily to one, 3mg cap daily. Still I had problems with constipation. Finally 4 days after the dosage change I had a &quot;normal&quot; BM. During this time, I also experienced shedding in my mouth, loss of appetite, and 5 alarm heartburn. I take 40mg omeprazole daily, and to it I had to add pepcid and a GI cocktail to achieve relief. During the last week of taking the Enotcort, my rheumatologist started me on Sulfasalazine for RA. This created several other problems. My gastroenterologist discontinued the Entocort, as sulfasalazine has been used for decades to treat IBD. Obviously this drug was not the solution to my condition.

I am depressed and can barely get though a normal day.  I just want to sleep.  I don't care if I wake up. I feel as though I need to see a shrink to get on antidepressants. It is a nightmare.

Moon face, severe weight gain, muscle pain, but it has diminished my digestive problems, an almost equitable trade-off.

Crohn's Disease	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Male	45-54	1/18/2010 7:22:00 PM	Entocort was prescribed for me after a particularly nasty flare, and it only made matters worse: lots of blood loss and lots of pain. I took myself off it after only a week, and am now feeling better. Now, I am slowly feeling better. So, I went from a nasty flare to borderline hospitalization, to feeling better. Did Entocort help? If it did, they need to find a dosage that won't kill me!

Other	Shelly30, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	11/30/2009 1:15:10 AM	I have UC and have had a hard time finding the right medication for my condition. I had 80% of my intestine removed about 2 years ago. I felt great after wards, until about 8 months after the operation. For the past five months I have tried, prednisone (which works but can't stay on long term, thank god!)Colozal, 6-mp,Imuran, Asacol, and Apriso. After not seeing results, bloody stools and after my intestine not digesting any meds my dr. prescribed Entocort. Yesterday I was going to the bathroom more than 20 times, today I started the meds and after I took them have only gone 3 times. Im usually going to the bathroom like every 30 minutes or so, even when I dont eat. I hope this medicine  works. Looks like it is.

I tried to wean off a couple months after I started taking it and fell so awful that we decided to keep me on it.  I am also on Lialda.  I have had Crohns for 17 years and so have been on most of the medications out there (short of the humera, remicade bunch) this medication has truly been the best, low if any side effects- which to me are worth it to have good health.  I have a two and a half year old and want to add to our family, but my periods have been really messed up since I began this drug.  I'm also really fatigued all of the time, and starting to have a little bit of mood swings, so I think it is a good thing for me to start getting off of this drug.  Good luck to you all and I hope you are all blessed to find the treatment that works for you!

Also take Azazan daily. Seems to be working well. My IBD associated with my Chrons seems much mor under control. Gas, cramping seem better. Having some mild headaches and depression.

After much testing in the hospital I was told that I have Chron's (IBD).  I was told 3 years before this time that I have fribromylgia, which is very painful. My Doctor treated me with Remicade infusisons, Asacol 400mg. 4 tablets three times a day, Entocort Ec 3mg 2 capsules one time a day for my Chron's along with several other medications and I steadly improved. I felt better than I had in many years, probably, because I may have had Chron's for the last 30 years and it was miss diginosed by many Doctors for years. In February my Doctor decided that he had not hear enough good things about this drug (Entocort Ec 3mg.) and since it was in the Steroid family he was taking me off this medicine. From last February until September my life went downhill. He told me that he could not put me back on it even though for several months I begged him. I could really tell after I tapered off the mecidine that it was not going good at all. My Rumatoligst I went through so many other types of drugs to relieve the problems that Entocort Ec had helped to relieve including my pain with the fibromylga. Medicines that were prescribed made me sick at my stomach and others causing swelling in my hands and lower extremites (feet), which resulted in me getting Fleabitious.  Last month after all the different things I had been through by being off the Entocort, my family Doctor finally put me back on the Entocort Ec 3mg. 1 daily and I am much happier as I feel better. Even just 1 a day helps me feel good again. Why not leave well enough alone and if it works don't change it.  I was willing to take my chances, as it worked that well for me.    
Crohn's Disease	Davis, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	10/12/2009 6:19:36 PM	I have Crohn's and have been ill for many years. I wish I had found out earlier in life that Crohns was my issue. Once I found out and was but on Entocort and Asacol (sp?) I am also on a low fiber low residue diet. I have not had one issue in several months. So I'm not sure if its the meds or the diet either way I'm doing better! I do get tired and I worry about getting the flu or colds because of the weaken immune system the drugs can cause. Besides that I will stay on the meds and see what happens.

Pentasa and Entocort have been the treatment path for almost the last six.  I have had bone loss which we counter with standard Calcium and Vitamin D therapy.  I'm unsure of all of the side effects which might be attributable to Entocort because of other medical treatments for Heart disease, blood presure issues, Prostate cancer as well as normal aging concerns.  I feel Entocort has helped provide me with somewhat normal lifestyle.  I do have significant fatigue, fluctuating blood presure, dizzyness and a reduced resistance to things such a colds and flu.  I can't truthfully attribute these issues to Entocort, because I take 12 prescription meds each day in addition to Entocort.  I hope reading this hasn't moved anyone considering treatments with Entocort away from giving it a try.  If I had it to do over again, knowing what I know now, I jump at giving Entocort a chance to help.

I have no answers.  I can't stop going to the bathroom.  I am so tired of this.  I think I am going to try the entocort again.

I had tried several drugs like Asacol etc. None of them worked. I was so relieved that this worked because my next treatment would have been remicade. I still get cramps for a couple of hours first thing in the morning but compared to the constant urge and pain to go to the br among other symptoms I would take this any day.

Within 48 hours of startign Entocort my stools firmed up and became regular. No side effects. My regimen was: 9mg/day for 3 weeks, 6mg/day for 3 weeks, 3mg/day still at this level after 5 weeks. Dr advises not to remain on Entocort for long term. Now looking into Imuran as possible long term solution, but advertised side effects of Imuran are scary!!!

I also take Pentasa, which I tend to think does next to nothing for me.  The Entocort seems to really help slow my diarrhea down, but adds a few more undesirable things to my list such as; insomnia, headaches that last all day long and acne (at 46 I hate that!), however I never seem to get bloated with it or gain weight.  I started it again four days ago and have been having some blood pressure issues this time.....have never had high blood pressure issues before. My doctor has started mentioning Remicade, but I would rather not start that unless I absolutely have to....it scares me.

Original dose was 3 per day for the first 7-8 weeks. I am down to 2 per day as my &quot;maintenance&quot; dose indefinitely. I have never taken it in the morning (did not follow instructions...oops!) as I was concerned about the potential side effects and my ability to think clearly at work during the day. Instead, I take my dose before I go to bed and have had few side effects. My only complaints: I have put on a few pounds but that is normal for me in winter. Maybe it's the Entocort, maybe it's not. I do get very mild constipation once in awhile, but I'll take that any day over the other! I've had good luck so far. I'm pleased.

I thought I could not take this drug and did not want to stop pentasa. After 3 years on it, I really feel it made a big difference in bowel attacks.  I do not feel the need to stop the drug for something else at this time.
Crohn's Disease	jackieef8, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2		19-24	10/8/2008 7:13:05 PM	The first time i took entocort it was great no side effects and was the only thing that helped? i stopped taking it for a year b/c i didn't have any flare ups (Crohns). however, i have been on for this for the past 4 months and UGH! i am down to 3 mg a day (if i remember) and i feel nausea, dizzy and really irregular heart beats. and of course i am work while this happens. but knock on wood, i am gonna try some alternative ways, wish me luck..

Crohn's Disease	Katz2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	9/26/2008 6:59:30 PM	Just started treatment for a very severe Crohn's flare-up, so far the side effects are rather nasty, pounding heart, dizziness, head in a fog, fatigue, and tingling all over. Everything else has not worked so hopefully this will.
Crohn's Disease	 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Male		9/1/2008 8:39:09 PM	I have been on this medicine for 2 weeks and I have noticed severe fatigue.  I actually thought I might have mono b/c of how tired I have been.  My head feels like I am in a fog.  I have had tightness in my chest, sore throat and blurred vision.  It has taken me several days to realize that all of this is most likely due to the medicine.  I take 3 in the morning for Crohn's/Colitis maintenance.  Hope there is something else out there to try.

After going off prednisone, I always crashed and always relapsed.  New doctor put me on entocort;  have been on about a year (one per day).  Drug has worked--I need to know if anyone has had experience with this drug--what the long-term side effects of using this drug are???
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/11/2008 3:34:44 PM	I have collagenous colitis as well. All the running to the bathroom for well over a year, several times a day was horrible. Getting off the bus on my commute to work, I hated living that way. After being diagnosed, my doc had me try Entocort. At first it was 3 a day, then I wouldn't go for days on end, so I did one every other day. That ended up being too much. Now it's one every week or 2 and I'm doing great! No more having to stop at gas stations every 10 minutes or missing important events in my life, upsetting co-workers that need to cover because I'm having another &quot;spell&quot;! I love this medication!!!

Other	flower, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	5/14/2008 10:52:46 AM	I get extremely tired and fatigued using this med, and at times my head feels like it is in a fog. I don't feel that I can continue feeling like this. At this point I'm not sure what is worse diarrhea, or feeling fatigued and in a fog all day.
Crohn's Disease	Jayme, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	5/4/2008 4:33:24 PM	This worked great for me, with very little side effects. The pain and diarrhea went away quickly. I just didn't like having to take the three big pills (9mg total) each morning.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/24/2008 4:51:39 PM	I used the 3 mg tablet once a day for Ulcerative Colitis for a month and then went on a every other day and then to two days a week and was in remission and did not have to use any other drugs for UC except one Loperamide a day for a year and 3 months and when I had a relapse, I did the same treatment and was in remission again.  This drug works and allows me to be medication free for long periods of time.  Thankfully , my GI DR. gave it to me for UC!

My doctor prescribed me Pentasa and I took it for 1 week with no appreciable effects.  He then added Entocort and within 3 days, my symptoms and problems were reduced by 90%!!  This has been an excellent medication for me and has helped tremendously.
