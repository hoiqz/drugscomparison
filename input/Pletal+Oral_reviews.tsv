NO MORE AT REST PAIN IN 2 DAYS. PAIN DECREASED DRAMATICALLY WHEN WALKING. 2ND RX (PRESC. INS. REQUIREMENT) FROM EXPRESS SCRIPTS, IMPROVEMENTS REVERSED).  FIRST RX REFILL FROM WAL-MART (ALLOWED) IMPROVEMENTS RETURNED IN 2 DAYS AND I KNOW WHY!!!THE GENERIC FROM BOTH PROVIDERS WERE MADE BY TEVA.  WAL-MART USED A DIFFERENT TEVA SOURCE THAN EXPRESS SCRIPTS WHICH PROBABLY USED A TEVA SOURCE IN &quot;TIMBUKTU&quot; TO GET A CHEAPER PRICE.  TEVA HAS OVER 40 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES WORLD WIDE.I HAVE TO CHANGE TO &quot;NAME BRAND ONLY-MEDICAL NECESSITY&quot; TO ASSURE THE &quot;GOOD STUFF&quot;.

Other	orangychris, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	9/3/2009 4:45:40 PM	I am taking this medication for a complete blockage of my right fem-pop artery with collateral circulation almost complete; stenting was not an option during my CT angio procedure so not to injury the new arteries growth.  So far, my leg feels better but I initially had cramps while walking and resting.  More so at night while sleeping; it would wake me up. I have been on the medication almost two months.  The cramping only involves the foot and arch of the foot now.  I have more frequent looser and lighter in color bowel movements.  It happens about 2hrs after eating a meal. I take the morning pill 30 minutes prior to breakfast and the evening pill 30-60 minutes prior to eating dinner. Sometimes, I feel my heart beating harder but my pulse is normal.  Generally, I am doing much better than prior to the medication.  The cramping at night has ceased and the leg cramps are gone completely.  The doctor stated it would take approx 3 months before all the red blood cells would be slicked up and coated and relief would be felt.  But it has been much sooner.
