Arthritis	clittle14, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	9/20/2012 7:17:10 PM	I've taken many meds for my arthritis and I have to say that this one works best for me even though I have to have it in my system for several days before I could tell it was working.
Chronic Pain	Sue M, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	55-64	8/23/2011 12:26:14 PM	Basically it was working great, and I was walking like a normal person. It took me a few days, however, to figure out that the worst outbreak that I ever had of canker sores was a side effect. Same thing happened with the replacement pain killer! I'm hoping to someday be able to take this again.
Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	4/23/2011 10:33:15 PM	I have been taking this medication for about a year and it has worked like magic.  I have absolutely no discomfort or side effects.  I recently happened to read the dire warnings given in the drug literature for NSAID and stopped using the medicine.  Within 2 weeks, I found that my joints were full of pain and found it difficult to live a normal life.  At age just below 69, I am still busy with full-time work and enjoy life comparable to that of young people.  I am afraid to think what kind of life it would be if I did not have this drug available.
Arthritis	denise22555, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	1/29/2011 8:03:23 PM	I've been using this for 6 days. I feel horrible, nauseaus, vomitted twice, headache neverending, weak, tired and my arthritis is still hurting. I am hoping that the side effects will ease and ultimately lessen the pain of arthritis. If not, this is not for me.

The list of &quot;possible side effects&quot; is pages long!

Rheumatoid Arthritis	jo, 65-74 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5		65-74	11/22/2008 6:42:56 PM	I have fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia, chronic mylemonocytic leukemia, incontinence and pain all over.  I can take diflunisal along with Robaxin (a muscle relaxer) and my pain is relieved within 30 minutes.  I have severe muscle spasms in my lower back and this combination seems to work very well.  It does not upset my stomach.
Pain	pj, 45-54 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	11/22/2008 6:35:23 PM	I use diflunisal for tendonitus and inflammation in my hip.  It works very well and I don't get stomach upset because I take it after I eat.  
Other	Isabel, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	10/13/2008 12:11:46 PM	This drug was prescribed a week ago for an abcessed tooth and associated swelling. It worked very quickly to eliminate the pain overnight. The script was for 20 pills, but I'll stop taking it today.The associated benefits were relief from arthritis and fibromyalgia pain.
Other	hatgirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/25/2008 7:50:46 PM	I was given this for swelling &amp; pain with a dental abscess. It upset my stomach badly and did very little for the pain, nothing for the swelling. A couple of ibuprofren (at a lower dosage) did a much better job relieving pain and inflammation. So I stopped taking the diflunisal.
Chronic Pain	houston1369, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	6/8/2008 12:47:38 PM	I've been taking this for relief from a shoulder calcification problem that is painful pretty much 24/7. I prefer a couple of Advil or Aleve for the pain but my wife keeps telling me I need to take it to reduce the swelling.
