I am in remission so Arimidex has worked for me.I cant wait for treatment to end as I have had a great deal of weight gain acid reflux and lots of aches and pains all over my body, but at least I am still alive.

I have tiredness, heavy legs but none of this keeps me from doing most of what I want to do.  My tumor is growing slowly now but for several years (2-3 years) I was stable.  I get the medication in bottles so don't have the bubble wrap problem.  My legs also have neuropathy from previous chemo and so I don't know what's from the Arimidex and what is from previous chemos.  
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	7/14/2010 9:01:05 AM	Thank you everyone for writing, I'm glad I'm not alone. I have virtually the same symptoms: I have been on Arimidex for almost 2 years- Fatigue. Joint stiffness and pain, Excruciating leg cramps almost nightly, Getting depressed, although I am usually a very positive person, Having a great deal of trouble with my memory- I am at the point where I worry about alzheimers. Hot flashes continue, although they are not quite as bad as a year ago. Am post-menopausal, and look like I aged 10 years in the last 2...Weight gain: just a few pounds.Does anyone have any suggestions?I am trying to stay hydrated- drink tonic for the quinine and bananas for the potassium, because I think the leg cramps are from dehydration, lack of sleep causes fatigue and depression. Very slight improvement. Any other ideas out there?Thanks

I just wondered if this drug could be causing some of this.

The pain it has caused has been horrible, especially the bone and joint pain. I have had shortness of breath, depression, confussion, memory loss, insomnia, extreme fatigue anxiety, tingling and numbness in hands and feet, and now arthritis in both knees and need surgery for damage in knees as well. I can't imagine taking this for 4 more years. Quality of life is more important than longevity to me. I am going to quit taking this as soon as I consult my doctor. The package is rediculous!Who came up with this anyway? Longevity at what cost?

I have been on this drug for 10 months. I have had very little pain until the last few weeks, and It gets worse every day !! Ache from my waist to my feet,extream pain !! I just hope I can stay on it, to keep the cancer from feeding off my overies.I do not for the life of me know who in the world came up with that package. Don't they know we have problems with our poor arms? Way to much hard work to try and get one darn pill. This package has to be a flop. 
Breast Cancer	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	55-64	2/28/2009 11:05:38 AM	The Arimidex is doing its job in keeping the breast cancer from coming back but the joint pain is horrendous. I am 55 years old. My doctor started me on Lyrica, which has almost totally blocked the pain thank God, but when I forgot to take it for three days, extreme joint pain came back. Started Lyrica again and the pain is now gone. I despise the bubble pack. I don't have any arthritis, etc., but it is impossible to get that tiny tablet out of that bubble. I have to use a pen to poke the tablet out and it is really aggrivating to have to do this. Why can't the tablets just come in a bottle like other meds do.God bless you all Sisters, and I hope that you remain in recovery and live life to its fullest.

I had a very hard time sleeping and had hot flashes. I kept trying to fight depression but because of my extreme lack of sleep I decided to stop taking arimidex. I'm sleeping better and my depression has gone. I thank God!

I have had all kinds of blood tests and x-rays of my joints. I have osteoarthritis now.  I also detest the new bubble packaging. I have to use a knife to get the pills out.  I also remove 7 pills at a time and put them in a weekly pill reminder.  I can't imagine another 4years on this medication.  I can't move now.

Plus the night sweats and the constantly being thirsty from being dehydrated from sweating so much. The memory loss is severe I feel like I'm an old lady

Due to my age, I don't know if the joint pain is age related (63) or a result of the med.  The new packaging is a problem.  I simply tore it totally apart to get to the foil.  I punch  a week's supply out and put them in a daily med container.  The foil is very thin!  Put the remainder (in foil blister  pack) back between the trifold package.  I would like to be able to continue Arimidex after 5 years...

Only side affects has been the hot flashes. I detest the new bubble pack, if it wasn't for my husband using his tin snips to cut open the package, I would have to switch to another medication.

I have a 4 yr old to keep up with so, debating whether to switch to Tamoxifen and risk uterine cancer and blood clots. Hate the package, wrist and finger tips hurt from the very hard bubbble to push pill through. Didn't know about the mood swings, that would explain my sudden outbursts.

The hot flashes I have now are worse than they ever were during menopause.  I was unaware that joint pain was a side effect.  That sure explains alot.  I just wonder what happens after the '5' year time is up?

I do experience stiffness so I do not appreciate the new packaging although it is nice to have each pill marked consecutively with the name of a day.  I have some moody days but they seem to be occurring less &amp; less.  I have been on this drug for about a year now.  I actually was able to lose 5lbs. with some dieting. Strenuous exercising helps me clear my mind and helps me to have a feel-good day.

It is a real struggle to remove the pills from the package.  
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	1	1	Female	55-64	7/2/2008 3:10:35 PM	My problem is not with the medication itself, but with the new package.  For those of us who have stiff joints, it is almost impossible to get to the pills.  If I cannot go back to the bottles, I will have to ask my doctor to prescribe another medication.

Have only been taking it for 4 months and have none of this so far ,except for a few hot flashes.
