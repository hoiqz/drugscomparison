My ENT asked me to try it and I use it 3 times a day to keep huge encrustations from blocking off my breathing and causing me distress.  Now they come out easily with less bleeding.  I use a Q-Tip rather than the eye dropper which works best for me and doesn't seem to use up the medicine any quicker.  It's a gift from God Himself and thanks.

I would continue daily application, but $12 for a tiny 1/4 oz bottle?

After two or three days of using this product I got headaches each time. Now, I have drymouth every night and it is not going away. Use with caution as I believe it can cause damage.

I've had my nose packed too many times to mentioned. A ENT told me to give Ponaris a try and it was a gift from God.If you have trouble with your nose you HAVE to try this stuff. It's helped me live a normal life for the last 20 years!!!!!
Other	Marly Harris, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		9/11/2010 4:10:54 PM	I was on my way to bleeding to death with 18-hour nose bleeds that landed me in the ER. After weeks of out-patient testing, my usually brilliant physician said that my nose bleeds were due to my inability to handle stress. He's now my former physician. I finally found an ENT who recommended Ponaris. I did have to have two cauterizations because of the fragility of my nasal blood vessels, but with a twice-daily NeilMed douching and twice-daily Ponaris applications, I no longer have bleeding. That's an enormous blessing for me. Yes, I do have daily scabs that the nasal cleansing removes. No one said that life would be perfect. But now I can workout daily and make plans without fear of horrible nose clots. I love Ponaris.
