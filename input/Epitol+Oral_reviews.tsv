No side effects and its the only one that works. I only take one a day and the doctors keep telling me that's not enough but apparently its working fine for me. I don't seem to have any problems driving, staying in the sun, or having the occasional margarita. It is worth a try, it was my wonder drug.

Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	10/14/2010 12:26:31 PM	I was on this for about two weeks with no side effects, I felt fantastic and really felt like it was starting to work, then out of the blue got a severe head to toe rash accompanied by a nagging headache. I quit immediatly and the symptoms went away after a few days.  I will say its worth trying but pay CLOSE attention to your body and take any abnormal signs seriously!

I think it's horrible. It will put you to sleep, but feeling like Charles Manson to go to sleep doesn't work for me. The side effects are worse then the problem ( as usual ). God help you if you drink grapefruit juice with this, you'll wake up thinking your'e in a drive-in horror movie.No thanks, I'd rather be &quot;depressed&quot;.
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	MissDiagnosed, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	5/21/2010 12:23:02 PM	I was misdiagnosed with Bipolar disorder over 10 years ago. The doctor even admitted that &quot;it's hard to tell if it's depression or the 'husband'&quot;. Was given this med with various other depression meds including Abilify over time. The 'husband' is gone and so is the depression. One doc admitted that I had been mis-diagnosed. So ten years later here I am trying to wean my self from this drug. I feel better than I've felt in many years. Please get a second or even third opinion when being diagnosed. Bi-polar is totally over-used. 
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	35-44	3/15/2010 9:34:54 PM	Taking this drug for anger management. Somewhat effective, but the side effects have become increasingly too much for me to handle. Will be planning a trip to the doctor to request a change. 
Epileptic Seizure	7-12 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	2	Male	7-12	3/5/2010 8:53:53 AM	Although their have been no seizures while on the medication, the side effects have done more harm.  My son is 10 years old and he has increased forgetfulness,lethargic and his equilibrium is off.  His teachers comment that he is not focused and he forgets and it is a great concern for them.  I don't like a medication where the side effects do more harm than the condition.

All I could do was sleep in taken twice a day as prescribed.  I still can only take it once a day or I can't stay awake. I haven't found it to be that helpful in treating my condition and an considering finding another doctor to treat me.  Doesn't work near as well as the Lithium did but was told I couldn't stay on that any longer. I still have alot of trouble with my mood swings!

Convulsive Seizures	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	6/3/2009 3:54:22 AM	I was started on this drug with a very small dose but still had another seizure so the tripled the dose. I became very ill including fever, chills, massive headache, vomiting and the next day started a thick red raised rash. The rash spread even to the palms of my hands and between my toes, inside my mouth and tongue. I would be very very careful. This rash did not stop when I stopped taking the medication. It continued to spread for days. It took heavy steroids to knock it out.
