Psoriasis of Scalp	Happy Hair, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/24/2012 3:31:48 PM	For the past year my scalp has become very crusty &amp; scale so I went to the Dermatologist. At first they prescribed a topical steroid, after using this for several months my conditioned didnt get any better. I went back to my doctor and she prescribed Derma Smoothe. I used it three nights in a row and it has worked so fantastic. My scalp is completely cleared of all crusty scales and when I shake my head it doesnt look like its snowing...YEA! Wearing the shower cap at night was so worth the wonderful results. I only wish I would have started to use this months ago.
Psoriasis of Scalp	Happy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	10/25/2011 12:12:18 PM	I have had scalp problems for years but thanks to my new stylist, she was able to identify my condition and referred me to a Dermatologist. I was prescribed Derma Smoothe and it worked wonders! My scales were literally almost completely gone after one use. I treated my scalp with Derma Smoothe for 3 days and the results are amazing!!! I am african-american and I can tell you that this product works. Yes, it is drying to our hair but with a good conditioner, you should be fine. Now, I only have to use Derma Smoothe when I have flare ups. I am so grateful that I do not have to walk around embarassed anymore. I feel free!!!!!
Atopic Dermatitis	buddysmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	10/20/2011 12:23:45 PM	Works well for my itchy, flaky scalp which seems to come and go with the seasons. Use a little and keep it on during the day.Very thick hair so the oilness of the product does not affect me as much. 
Psoriasis of Scalp	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	7/9/2011 10:18:12 PM	My normally healthy hair was falling out in clumps.  A wonderful dermatologist at Emory correctly diagnosed psoriasis and prescribed a two-step treatment: First Derma-Smoothe for at least 4 hours to loosen the scales, then after shampooing, applying Fluocinonide.  The Derma-Smoothe is predominantly oil, so I agree with those who find it challenging to wear the shower cap for hours, but it really works.  Without the softening oil treatment first, the Fluocinonide just made my scalp flake, but the Derma-Smoothe makes the scales disappear.  Using it once or twice a week has kept my scalp psoriasis under control for about 10 years now, and I have a thick healthy head of hair.

Psoriasis of Scalp	Mike, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	2	5	Male	45-54	6/5/2011 11:20:05 PM	For me this is by far the most effective treatment of scalp psoriasis, it makes major improvememts after one use. I need to use it once weekly to maintain results.It isn't easy of use, keeping oil under a shower cap for at least 4 hours (and hearing my wife complaining), but the results are worth it.
Psoriasis of Scalp	13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	13-18	7/2/2009 1:23:26 AM	My son had a drug reaction to Remicade which caused severe Psoriasis on his scalp for 8 months. I tried every shampoo and prescribed shampoo and washing hair up to 5 times a day. I was at my wits end, I was even using pliers to break the scales apart on his scalp and ready to cut off all his hair since he couldn't get it cut anywhere because so bad. Then GI refered us to dermatalogist who prescribed Derma-smoothe. This product cured my son's Psoriasis in 2 treatments. 1st treatment he left on for 9 hours and then washed it out. That night he was late home and couldn't do the treatment on day 2. The next morning he showered and the scales just fell right out of hair when drying. So we did treatment (2) that night, and by the next morning everything was gone from hair after washing. No other treatments have been needed since. This in my book gets 3 A+'s. I might even think about letting my son go back on Remicade now that we can treat the side effect of a much needed treatment he requires. 
Psoriasis of Scalp	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	25-34	4/27/2009 5:29:27 PM	I prefer to shower at night, so allowing the medication to sit for 4 to 6 hours was problematic at times.  However, the product worked wonderfully for me.  I have used it once every other day, and approximately 96% of all scales were gone after one use.  Unfortunately, this is not a cure for scalp psoriasis.  At least it helped me with removing the scales, and it appeared to slow down the accumulation of scales afterwards or in between uses.
