Prevention of Liver Transplant Rejection	My2Livers, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	1/16/2012 8:58:33 AM	I used Prograf for 5 yrs post-liver-xplant, and became increasingly paranoid, confused and delusional during that time. My docs said &quot;You're bi-polar&quot; &amp; put me in the mental hospital. I'm not bi-polar, but I sure appeared to be. After doing my own research, I discovered that brain damage, paranoia, hallucinations, mania and even hair loss are COMMON side effects. I showed my doc my print-out w/ my symptoms hi-lighted, and he weaned me off prograf. Now I'm only on cellcept. That was 3 years ago, and I'm no longer crazy. But I have psoriasis, which just spread to my face, and just discovered that prograf topical is used for psoriasis! hmmm.. lose my hair and my mind or walk around w/ red blotches all over my face? I'm alive anyway, and I'm glad for all of U who are similarly blessed. Has anyone tried this stuff for psoriasis? Maybe topical won't affect my psyche! thx for any input. Peace.

Only annoyance is hand tremors but recently found out about tegretol for tremors. Tegretol has been effective in reducing tremors greatly. WARNING&gt;you do have to be diligent about avoiding people with contagious diseases. I recently contracted RSV which landed me on life support due to pneumonia. Am back to &quot;normal&quot; now thankfully.

My transplant was due to Cryptogenic Liver Cirrhosis. My life changed dramatically but I have no complaints because I am ALIVE. I have been on prograf since my transplant. I had a rejection in 2004 when my enzymes went up and a bx was done. Since the rejection I have been taking 2mg in the am and 1 mg in the pm along with 8mg medrol twice a week. Since May of this year, my  liver enzymes elevated and my doses were increased to 2mg in am and 2mg in pm. My Drs also increase the medrol to 12 mg.Thank God so far my enymes level went down to normal and I hope they stay normal. I just did my labs on 7/5 hopefully the results are normal. I am hoping my Drs will be dcreasing the meds again. SIDE EFFECTS High BP, anxious,ect but the benefits to me is greater than the risk of side effects. But its  been a life change since my transplant. No complaints at all because I am so very happy to be alive now. Thank God for my daughter and the medications. God bless everyone and thankful for all.

Vision would go from being great and seconds later blurred - sometimes back to normal, could not trim shrubs without having to stop 5 mins. later from shaking, can't sleep without the help of 1/2 to 1 tab of Valium before bedtime - that does the trick- Then, there is weight gain - maybe from the junk food :) But I consider myself very lucky - I started out taking 1.5 mg 2x daily - now it's been reduced to 1 mg. 2x daily. This drug is great - it's given me a chance to see my girls grow up. Much better than being on chemo and dialysis any day. I had RPG with P-ANKA - so I'll take the Prograf anytime. Thanks to this great drug company for giving us another chance. We are the lucky ones - never forget that. Stay positive :) you could be back where you were before your transplant. God is good :)Life is good!!!

I take 2mg 2x a day.  I have some side effects such as GI distress, tremors (once in while), nervous and I am not sure, but I recently started having pain in my neck and jaw on the right side of my body only.  I also seem to have some swelling in my hip and lower back on the same side of my body.  Overall, it does prevent rejection.  I did have a lot of infections in beginning about 4 months after my transplant.

I have a great hair stylist - they work with the American Cancer Society Look good feel better program. They recommended I use the scalp/hair treatment chemo patients use - Nioxin. It is wonderful! About 1 month after treatmend - new hair started growing in - I had long hair, had it cut short and kept it that way until the new hair was long enough, you couldn't tell the difference. Now it's growing back out and looks great.Good luck I hope it works for anyone going through this. Being a recipient is great but being female without hair, it's a vanity thing! It gave me glimpse into the life of a cancer patient. Much respect

I have had chronic vomiting from the very start as well as lower GI problems and hand tremors. I am also losing my hair. I had an episode of rejection while on this medication even though my prograf blood level was optimal. It keeps my kidney alive though and for that I am grateful.

My doctors believe it was result of multiple blood transfusions I received in mid 70's during birth of kids. I feel very blessed to have received my liver from one of my daughters and have been given a second chance @ life. I was equally as blessed to find myself in the incredible hands of doctors surgeons, coordinators,and nurses at Mt Sinai Hospital. They are a unique group of people that did not just treat our medical needs but also our souls. Their care and kindness shown to my entire family is something we will always carry in our hearts. I currently take 4mg.of prograf (2x) daily.I was initally takng .5mg (2x) daily. It has gradually increased to the current dosage, which has remained at this level since 12/09. I have difficulty sleeping, find myself short tempered and a bit emotional and anxious at times. Many foods don't agree with my stomach, so I avoid them. I have begun with muscle cramps the past few months. I'm not sure if this is related to the prograf or cellcept 500 mg(2x) daily. My next app't is in Sept. Seems like I am taking a high dose of prograf in comparison to other postings I have read. regardless of the side effects of meds before my transplant I was existing through my day, I am now living in my day!!   
Prevent of Transplant Rejection	Mary, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	55-64	7/14/2010 3:16:13 AM	By the seventh day of taking prograf,I began noticing a dimming/darkening of my vision.  By the 2nd month I was completely blind in one eye and had lost about 3/4 of vision in the other. Opthamologists &amp; neurologist say the optic nerves have been severely damaged; eyes had been checked less than 2 months before transplants.  Eye that still has vision stopped losing vision after discontinuing prograf.We have found some case studies listing this as a rare side effect of Prograf, but my transplant team were not even aware of it. It should be better publicized.   My life has changed dramatically because damage to the optic nerves is irrevocable. And, it's the full black out type of blindness in one eye and a small tunnel remaining for the other.Prograf seems to have worked fine as an anti-rejection med, but this rare side effect exacted too high of a price.

This medication should not be taken without constant monitoring. Prilosec increases Prograf levels and prograf should be adjusted up or down. I have been on this medication for 5 years after my transplant and have done well on it.

Side effects for me include headaches about every three weeks which are nulified by hot tea/soda (caffine) and Tylenol.  I did have 3 days in a row of faintness after 2 years out.  We did every possible test and couldn't come up with a reason why.  With both side effects above it's hard to say if it's the Prograf, Imuran or something else.

If your on this drug,drink water!!It also helps to limit the side effects.

On occasion she has headaches/migraines that sometimes result in vomiting.  Other than that, we've had no concerns with the drug.  Her lab results have been good and her growth and development seem to be at the same rate as a normal child her age.  Sometimes it can be difficult to determine whether or not something is from her condition or just that of an 8 year old.  Overall, pleased with the medication.

The GI distress in the form of slight nausea and diarrhea has been an increasing problem as time has passed.  Have appointment next month and will try to get dosage reduced.  The drug has been very effective in preventing rejection episodes.  I have had no additional side effects.

The new kidney immediately began to recover after stopping the Prograf. Expert medical studies show that Prograf is toxic to the kidneys... Medical studies by experts at Albert Einstein Transplant Center support/promote the idea of stopping Prograf due to toxic effects on the kindey and using Cellcept (and Rapamune combo instead). Additional Comments: In my opinion, Prograf should be banned...as much better options are available (meds such as Cellcept and Rapamune that protect the kidney). By 2003, the studies and experts have known of the issues with Prograf. Yet nothing has been done in the interim to resolve the issues. Even today, Walter Reed transplant lists Prograf high on thier list of protocols, well above the Cellcept/Rapamune protocol. This is a travesty and needs to be corrected so that other patients do not continue to suffer from the use of the drug (Prograf) and the harmful effects on the kidney.

My Dr. gave this to me to prevent rejection. I take 2mg in the morning and 1 mg in the evening. So far the medication is working great. I haven't had any rejection symptoms. The only side effect I notice with this medication is that it makes my hands a little bit shaky. I had leukemia so if now all I have is shaky hands, I can deal with that. I'm just happy to be alive!

Apparently one of the side effects is posterior residual encephalitic syndrome. I was started on rapamune but experienced rejection 2-3 months out. prograf has been restarted and no more evidence of the PRES. It seems to be controlling the rejection though the 3 most serious side effects so far are the tremors and the peripheral swelling and cramps.

I broke out in hives so bad for over 7 years.  The last two I was taking over 7 epi shots a day, 100mg of predinsone, and 5 anti histimines, and I am a type I diabetic for over 13 years.  I went through several treatments of IVIG. (you can look that up on internet if you are interested in knowing how it is used.)  I quit responding with it, I was also on cyclosporen and after three months ended up in the hospital.  It quit working.  When I say sever hives I mean to the point I was taking epi shots just to breath.  Several times taken by ambulance and spending days at a time in the hospital on breathing treatments.  I was at the end of the line when one of my Doctors said lets try prograf and  if it does not work we will try Chemo. I also later had to be put on Gastrocrome.  Well 2 years later no epi shots, no hives and the only down side is my hair is thin and does not grow as well. Only shave about once every 3 months also. LOL. I do get sick alot, but it is better than dying or wanting to.  Blood pressure use to run 112 over 62 and now it is up to 142 over 84, but still not that bad.  Good luck to you all who have to use it.  I hope that my insurance will make sure I never loose this drug.

Hairloss was due to the surgery (massive trauma  to the body as told by my Dermotologist) swithced back to Prograf I've had no rejection issues but sideffects include sweating (not as bad as when first started, I use Secret Clinical, it helps) and thining hair on the crown of head. My dermo said to wait 18 mo. after surgery until the hair cycle gets back to normal then my hair stylest said to wait another 5 mo. to see new hair growth. That comes at the end of January 2009. But like another reviewer said if this is all I have to deal with, I think I'll be OK.

Had pancreas txp 5/2008, some initial rejection issues and prograf level too high caused strange pains and inability to grip. Tremors starting to go away and bowels back on track (loose before) - now that dose lower. Newest issue is hair loss. Hoping that improves - or I'll get a wig! Happy so far, though it is a pricey med. No complaints after getting the gift of organ donation!

I developed high blood pressure and diabetes after transplant and due to the drug.  Some leg/joint pain which prevents significant exercise.  Overall, the side effects do not limit me from enjoying life. I have not experienced any episodes of rejection to date. Prograf is the only post transplant drug I've used, so can not compare to any others.

Took heavy doses of steroids right after transplant but quickly moved to prograf. 3mg twice a day keeps the doctor away. I have diabetes just diagnosed this year, but I need to lose some weight (20 lbs.) and I'll be fine. Thanks to the transplant team and clinic follow-up at Univ of Penn.

The first year is the hardest. I have not had any bad experiences so far and I hope that this will continue on.

After that no nightmares, but I have not been able to sleep since (I'm not a wuss -  it's not because I fear another nightmare - that was a one time event -- but more because it happens to be one of the side effects.)  I take one half milligram of Xanax at night and sleep well and wake up easily and rested.  Bottom line.....it beats dying.

Prevention of Liver Transplant Rejection	jaeri, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/27/2008 3:25:23 PM	I'm not quite sure if the epiver which I use is the reason for my muscle spasms or the use of prograf.  I'm trying to dicipher this by educating myself about the uses of both.  I'm being treated for the effects of RLS as well, a previous condition but aggrivated further post possibly by other medications.  I'm trying to find out.  I'm not sure of the improvement due to all of the combined elements. It's been 6 months.  I'm just questioning what is the best way to treat my symptoms.  My doctors have changed from transplant to maintenance and I'm not sure that my doctor in maintenance is very interested in the maintenance just my stability.  I want to just feel better.  I'm giving my all and pay highly for it.  I'm finding self education to be my biggest tool.  Are the changes I'm experiencing from prograf, epiver or lack of magnesium.  My new liver  is a miracle all it's own.Post transplant and the monitoring of prograf at the center where I was treated was of the utmost quality.  We went through continuous blood monitoring and thorough physical monitoring for three months post.  Many in my group didn't pass after three months with prograf.  I basically AM VERY HAPPY.  Prograf seems the least intrusive therapy and maintenance in accordqance with my body and lifestyle.

I started severe headaches several weeks ago that will not go away and have constant nausea so bad I can hardly eat. I do have to take a sleeping pill at night because of insomnia I think is caused by the Prograf.
