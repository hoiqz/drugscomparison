Chronic Hepatitis B	TattPayne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/14/2012 12:07:50 AM	I have mild chronic HepB and liver adenoma, started Baraclude 0.5mg daily since Sep 2011. Dec 2011 I had a blood work showing the viral down from 5 trillions to about 19,000. AST was back to normal at 34 from 76. ALT was high at 41 but down from 98 though. Antigen was still positive showing &quot;active&quot; so I need to continue this drug until it is negative, will get another blood work again in Mar 2012. This drug works well so far. My joint pain and fatique are way better than before and I am ready to go back to work again!

Baraclude has been a life saver for me.  I find it very easy to take first thing in the morning, and my system tolerates it very well.  My quarterly blood tests all come back with normal numbers.  I'm extremely happy that my liver doctor chose Baraclude for me.

Chronic Hepatitis B	Mark H, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/28/2009 8:34:24 AM	After a liver transplant almost 2 years ago I was taking Baraclude.5mg daily and receiving HBIG injections monthly. Currently the HBV level is low and the HBIG has been reduced to every 3 months. My doctors seem to be against stopping the HBIG immediately  but hope to reduce or eliminate them over time. So far Baraclude is working for me. No problems at all. A little triangular tablet sure beats a double shot is the a$$. A LOT less expensive than HBIG too.
