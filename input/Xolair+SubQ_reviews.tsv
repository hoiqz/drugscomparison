Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	8/30/2012 7:18:07 PM	I have been using Xolair for several years due to severe urticaria and several anaphylactic shock reactions. Prior to going on Xolair, doctors tried every drug on the market to try to stop my allergic reactions due to an autoimmune disorder. None of these drugs helped at all and had horrible side effects. After going on Xolair, I have not gone fully into anaphylaxis again and have had great success with no side effects! I am beyond thankful for this drug!

I was starting to accept the fact that I was going to die from my asthma. I was on every medication that exists for asthma and I still had to prepare my breathing machine before bed. They came on so quickly and so hard that I couldn't even tear open my meds. Finally, I had a doctor test my IgE levels and suggest Xolair.  My doctor thankfully fought the insurance company and I got the approval.  I am so blessed to be on this medication.  I am able to exercise once again, I haven't taken a breathing treatment in 2 years, and I rarely use my rescue inhaler. Xolair has saved my life and my kids don't have to watch me suffer through hours of laying on the floor trying to breathe. Not to mention I have not had a single negative side effect.

Since early 2009 I have been on steroids either monthly or daily in order to minimize my asthma symptoms.  I have been on Xolair for almost 1 year.  I still need my other medications including prednisone; however, I have been able to reduce the dosage of prednisone significantly.  It has not been a miracle drug for me, but Xolair has definitely reduced my asthma attacks and my daily symptoms.  I have had no significant side effects and would recommend the drug to anyone with severe asthma.

I deal with the hair loss (I have long hair) and the agonizing bone pain.  I very rarely have to use an albuterol inhaler and have quit using the others all together.  If I had known of all of the side effects before I started the shot I would not have started. At this point I want to quit but am scared to.  I do get tired alot ect.  Be very mindfull of the side effects.  I do have a heart condition and was never warned of the effects of the drug.  Be carefull.

I have had several problems this year getting the shots due to insurance and the doctors office i use changing their drug company, and i can tell a really big difference this year with more problems due to having shots like 2-3 weeks late. I have been using it since it came out, and this is the first years since then I have had problems, so try and keep on schedule.

I think I have tried just about every asthma/allergy medicine available on the market. My first inhaler sent me to the emergency room with anaphylaxis. I have gotten increasingly worse over the years, and it got to the point where I was afraid that nothing would help.I have no medical insurance , so the cost of the xolair is bery high...but who cares...it changed my life totally within two hours of the injection.I am &quot;alive&quot; for the first time in a very long time.I was coughing non stop until I coughed up bile/blood and every muscle in my body ached all the time. the last four years I have taken Cipro for my bronchitis and Cortisone to be able to open up my airways.I lost my sence of smelling in my twenties and have had numerous polyp operations in my sinuses.I would be on meds for up to 20 days,getting a little relief, and one week after the last pill it was back to the same sleepless nights with the coughing &amp; sweating.I would wait as long as I could before starting a new round of meds, and my last asthma attack did not go away even with higher doses of cortisone.I was told that my last resort was xolair as nothing else helped, so I was a little nervous when I went for my first shot.What if it did not help?Wow, I've never been happier??? I coughed up some mucus that was trapped about an hour after the treatment, and have not been coughing since. And moreover, I got my sence of smelling back and it's just like coming from a &quot;dead&quot; world back to life.I'm alive!!!!!!!!&amp; I can breathe.

I am taking it for chornic hives. It has had its ups and downs but I was told to see full resoultion over time 6 mos. So I am still holding out hope. 1 dose per month and one dose last about 2 wks for me so the last two weeks I have to take prednisone for 1wk to control the symptoms as well as other antihistamines. But over time per my Allergist the symptoms will lessen.

I have been taking Xolair for about a year. I was put on the medications due to developing Cushing's disease from the amount of steroids I was using to control my asthma. This has changed my life. Prior to taking Xolair I had bronchitics about every 3 months due to irritation caused by allergens. I was unable to ride my bike or be outside for very long. Now I am able to be outside! I feel normal, asthma is still a part of my life but it no longer controls it.

I started Xolair injections bi-weekly in July 2009 and have never been happier. The nightly allergic reactions are gone and I'm breathing better than ever. I only wheeze now if I get sick or am exposed to a trigger (smoke, perfume, etc) for an extended period of time.Only hassle has been with my insurance and the inconvenience of going to the office every 2 weeks. Haven't started immunotherapy yet - too scared after anaphylaxing the last time. I'm happy being healthy right now!

Before taking them I had daily asthma attacks. Since taking them I have not had one single asthma attack i do use my inhalor if am in the cold or get short of breathe just as a precaution. It has changed my life. The biggest issue is the hassle with insurance. My company just switched insurances and now they are telling me I have to pay $140 a month for the shots. So I may have to stop taking them entirely.

Daily allergy/asthma meds include Zyrtec 2 tabs nightly, Doxepin 50 mg nightly, SVN with Albuterol 3-4 times a day, Advair 2 x's a day and ProAir as nec. I have allergic asthma due to environment allergens. I am concerned that my allergic response after the Xolair injection has gotten shorter just with 2 doses.

I started Xolair in July 2005. At that time I carried around my nebulizer, was taking Singulair, steroid inhalers and prednisone pretty frguently.  Within the first year, I was done with the nebulizer. I did start regular allergy immunotherapy injections in 2007. Allergies (runny nose, cold type symptoms, itchy eyes, etc.) are progressively getting better.  I hate to admit I am noncompliant, but the only asthma meds I take now are OCCASIONAL use of Asmanex. No albuterol type, cannot remember last prednisone, and no idea where my nebulizer is!   Dosing is set by the med guidelines. It has to do with your IgE levels. I take 2 (300) shots every two weeks. If I go longer -about 18 days, the asthma starts in again. I bet that if I used the Asmanex more regularly this would not happen.My only complaint is I have to drive 30 miles each way to get my shots. Overall, the drive is worth it. Xolair is the best!

Within 24 hours, my nose swelling decreased significantly. I am still taking all my asthma and allergy drugs as advised (Singulair, Symbicort - maximum dose, Flonase, Zyrtec). Since I have severe pollen induced Asthma, especially from ragweed, I was doubtful that Xolair could help me. Plus, my allergist said it will take 4 to 5 months to step down from all my other asthma drugs. I am already feeling so much better that I am very surprised. Thank you, Genentech people! I can yawn again and may actually be able to sit ony deck or porchagain. Am hoping for an almost normal life soon!!!

My cough is so bad my fellow workers made comments .  My doctor recommended Xolair and I began treatment apx 6 months ago with 2 shots/1 time a month.  Todate I have not seen any marked difference in my condition.  Could I not be receiving the correct dosage? I am very concerned that I am taking a drug that is not going to work for me - I had really hoped this would be the answer to my issues.  Who can I consult on my concerns? Another issue is the cost for administering the shots( my insurance pays forthe shots but I have to pay the inject fee which is costing me $170 per month - this while I have been unemployed for 8 months.

I use it for horrible allergies; which had given me breathing issues from time to time when my allergies meds didn't cover me well enough.Great drug for healing eczema!  No more greasy creams that ruin my clothes, no more stinky tar to wash with, and I'm not embarrassed from being a head-to-toe scab.  This drug also boosted my immune system, it used to take forever for antibiotics to work; used to take them for 6-months or so, now I treat 7-10 days like a normal person.  That's a miracle.I used to get flu-like symptoms 3-4 days after injections (900 mg/bi-weekly, but wears off in 8-10 days for me) but I pre-medicate with acetominphen &amp; antihistamines and that solved it.  This has been a miracle drug, one in which gave me my life back, however, recently, I'm experiencing memory issues and had to cut way back and now I'm not feeling great like I used to without it since the dose isn't high enough for me. This makes me unhappy.

I have not had any kind of reaction to it at all.  The most pain is you have to call the Pharmacutical company to get it shipped to the Doctor so they can administer it for you.  There is always a hastle with insurances as the medication is very expensive.  Good but expensive.

From his 20s through his 40s he was symptom free, but then his asthma hit him hard and has continued to do so for the last 11 years.  He has tried so many medications; some will work for awhile and then quit being effective, then he'd be on something else.  Finally received a blood test in August 09; his IgE level was well over 500.  Finally got approved to take Xolair, however, after only 2 injections in November '09, he broke out into hives and extremely severe itching.  Stopped the Xolair immediately to see if this was causing the hives.  He is also diabetic and was taken off of insulin for a short period of time to see if that may be the cause of the hives or reacting with the Xolair.  It has now been 3 months since his 2nd and last injection of Xolair, and he is still suffering from extreme hives and itching.  Has been to his dermatologist (he also has mild eczema)twice, his regular doctor twice, and an allergist twice.  The one good thing, however, is that he has had no breathing problems at all!  Has not even used any of his other asthma medications, although we worry that eventually his asthma symptoms will return.  So, I'd have to say it has helped his asthma, but the side of effects of the itching is just not tolerable for him, and so far none of the medications are helping with the itching.  Perhaps his problem is tied to the fact that he is diabetic.  His eczema is very mild (was severe when he was a child); only needs an injection once a year to clear it up.

I was clear most of the time. Even had a dramatic decrease in sinus problems.  18 months after starting once-a-month Xolair shots, it suddenly stopped working and I got worse than I was when I started the Xolair.  I got more severe asthma than I had ever had before, and it never went away.  The next 18 months have been very bad.  In short, the Xolair suddenly stopped working, and my once-moderate asthma is now severe and does not subside unless I take oral prednisone, and then only temporarily.  I have spent the last 18 months coughing and wheezing, and no doctor has yet been able to explain why.

I am very concerned because I had asthma as a kid but outgrew it. After 40 yrs. of smoking, I developed COPD. I don't actually have asthma anymore just COPD. But, I do have allergies and an IGE level of 589 and that does make my COPD worse at times during allergy season. I have not seen anyone in the testimonies that has COPD only asthma. Does anyone know of anyone that has been on this medication for COPD. I am very scared about this. I would appreciate some feedback. Good luck to all with this medication.

I am curently taken off of the shots because my CPK number is 1080. I'm being told it should be about 100'ish.  I have a lot of muscle cramps caused by myopathy, and they say the elevated CPK levels can cause other serious issues if not rectified.  I wish I could have made it long enough for the meds to start working.
Allergic Asthma that is Resistant to Treatment	cfcne3, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/12/2009 9:12:46 PM	I have had severe Asthma for 48 years.  This is the first drug that has kept the asthma under control for months at a time.  I did stop the drug for a time due to insurance issues, and wound up in the hospital within 12 months.  Restarted the drug in March 2008 and have had to get rid of several drugs I used to keep on hand, because they were expired!  This has been the best and least complicated treatment I have ever tried. On the rare instance I need a rescue inhaler, I often have to find it first,or get another refill if the one I have is now out of date.

I have tried many different cocktails of medicine to control it. Nothing seemed to help. I started with the injections 7 months ago and I have not felt this great in a long time. I am able to have a normal productive life. I go once a month to get the injections. Yes they do hurt for a very short period of time. This has been a great drug to help me get my asthma under control after 30 years for nothing working.
Allergic Asthma that is Resistant to Treatment	dakotabillg, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	2	5	Male	35-44	10/27/2009 11:41:00 AM	I have had allergies since I was a baby and have had chronic allergic and asthmatic symptoms my entire life.  This is a hands down miracle drug for me.  I'm not cured, I'm not symptom free, but I'm a normal person.  A house with cats doesn't send me into a wheezing fit, I don't break out in hives, dashing past the perfume counter at the drug store, I can actually sit outside for dinner without undue suffering.  I still get some tightness in my chest from ragweed and dogs still make me a little itchy, and my nose runs when someone is cooking potpouri, but I'm just a person with some allergies, not someone who is two steps shy of a bubble.It is a royal pain going for an Allergist appointment every two weeks and the injections sometimes hurt like a horsefly bite, but being able to watch my kids play baseball without having to hide in my climate controlled car would be worth three times the toil.If all of the other medicines seem like they are just the barest mask of relief, seriously consider medicine.
Allergic Asthma that is Resistant to Treatment	mrs.claus, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	55-64	10/27/2009 10:55:15 AM	Neutral because I start injections later this week. Several concerns...I have read all of the reviews here and also all the info I was given and on the 'net.  Why are some of you - with heart issues - still taking the drug?  Also, I am going to get an injection once a month - some of you every 2 weeks - I will ask about this.  FYI I started having severe asthma 32 years ago (I am nearly 58) and took steriods until about 12 years ago....then 4 years ago I became a type 1 diabetic and several specialists  have decided it is because of the long steriod use...so be very careful!  I am truly going to give this my all and hope for the best since I need to be able to play with my grandchildren and live my best life possible.

I am just beginning treatment this Friday and I am terrified!  I am in the middle of school and looking to start clinicals at the beginning of the year.  I'm scared!  I know how it is &quot;supposed to work&quot;.  The reviews aren't great.  My Ig levels are so far the computer could not read them on 4 occasions in a one month period while hospitalized on all the IV juice.  I have had docs giving me allergy shots and I've told them &quot;you are killing me&quot;  &quot;I can not even get out of bed or think&quot;.  They coined me a complainer.  I hope this doesn't happen again. If you suffer like I do then you know the people that look at you and say you are not sick, when you can't shower (only wash your body and not do your hair), how accurate are the tests by whom? Furthermore can anyone hear us out here????  And my favorite-being cussed by old farts because you can walk but parked in handicap! What a joy!  They don't know that I'm trying not to have to be on the news tonight thank you.  It's all about preventative and knowing limitations with that in mind-sorry old farts in wheelchairs - soon to join ya!  Just so happens a bad aid is not made for me right now! I wish the best for you all - I understand the struggle and times of waking up refreshed are few but they are damn good aren't they?

I was able to control my asthma with allergy shots until 9 years ago.  I had a mild heart attack and was no longer able to receive the shots.  No amount of inhaled steroids could give me much relief.  Two weeks after my first shot the difference was so much so that I've been able to walk without any shortness of breath and can climb hills and stairs without help of an inhaler. My quality of life has improved so much.  I haven't had any side effects so far.  I feel very fortunate that I've been able to get this medicine.

Prednisone and sprays cannot replicate the way my lungs open up from xolair. 
Allergic Asthma that is Resistant to Treatment	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	3	Female	45-54	9/4/2009 8:43:26 AM	Have Asthma since moving to Olklahoma. Never had it any other state of residence.  Take my shot every 2 weeks and have had 3 doses.  Experience a weird side effect that seems to be unique.  In about 8 hours after the 3rd injection, I experienced a strong alteration to my sense of smell.  Everything had an acrid, almost waxy rancid smell to it.  Took 25 mg of Benadryl about 3 hours from the onset of the symptom, noticed a small reduction in the intensity and took another 25mg about an hour later.  I continue the 50 mg of Prednisone therepy scheduled for that evening.  Noticed I still had a slight alteration of sense of smell in the am.

I never attributed it to the xolair as we had just returned from scuba diving and site seeing in Mexico.  After 6 months, the rash has spread up and around my leg, from my ankle to my knee.  It swells by almost 2 inches as the day goes on and the itching is driving me crazy.  Lately I noticed a lump in the middle of it that was painful at times.  I have been to 7 doctors and today had a surgical biopsy where they went down to the muscle.  The infectious disease doctor believes it may be a reaction to the xolair.  The last couple of weeks my asthma returns at night, first the coughing and them my inhaler.  I have even had to use my nebulizer several times.  I had been so relieved to be off the steroids.  We know steroids are bad - could xolair be any worse?  What are the long term effects of xolair - it hasn't been on the market that long.  
Allergic Asthma that is Resistant to Treatment	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/11/2009 10:28:34 AM	I have just completed my third shot and have found that I am breathing like a non-asthmatic for the first time in over 20 years. After starting off the year with 4 asthma visits to the ER in one month, my asthma specialist suggested Xolair. I did my research on the drug, its FDA approval trials, web researched how the drug is made and searched the reviews of current users and made my decision. I have been living like a different person for the past three months, feeling almost asthma symptom free. My specialist informed me of the new FDA information on Xolair and I will continue to use the shots until the FDA study is complete. At this point the quality of my life is so improved with Xoliar that I am enjoying a life freerer of the asthma symptoms that have plagued me for the past 20 years.

Luckily for me, I only has 1 year of this suffering before I was introduced to Xolair. Now, I feel as if I never had asthma before now as long I continue my inhaled steroid, but if I forget my inhaler, I know I'm ok. During my year before I was on Xolair, if I went on vacation and forgot my inhaled steroids, I would feel it right away, now, when this happens, I don't anymore. Xolair has given me great results. Now, I don't about you guys, but this drug is expensive. I hope someone makes another drug like this soon to drop the price down. I've been on this for 3 years now.

I would recommend this product to anyone with a history of allergic asthma and sinus infections....talk to your doctor for a recommendation.  Thanks for making this product!!!

I went from living with regular ER visits and hospitalizations for large steroid and albuterol doses to not having used a rescue inhaler in over a year. I am prescribed the highest dosage based on my IgE levels, so the administration is unpleasant, but it is a small price to pay for the relief.

I have had severe asthma for over thirty years ending up in the hospital usually twice a year on IV steroids.  I was using so many medications I had to carry them around in a shoe box and I was in fear of going anywhere without my  portable nebulizer. I have been on the Xolair for a little over a year and I have had only one asthma attack and it was mild( compared to others). Being on disability I have had to fight to keep getting the shots as Medicare does not cover them.  Fortunately at present I am not on Medicare, but fear the day I will be. I hope this company does everything they can to get it approved by Medicare and for anyone that needs it. Although my health has deteriorated  from the constant use of steroids over the last thirty five years, I feel considerable better than I did and know that if I had not been put on the Xolair could likely be dead by now.

After three years of battling with insurance companies and drug reps, I have finally been given the opportunity to use Xolair and it has changed my life.  In the first 2 weeks of treatment I noticed a remarkable difference.  I look forward to a new year free of steroids, free of moon face, and freedom from having to lug my nebulizer around with me.  What a blessing!
Allergic Asthma that is Resistant to Treatment	lilmcd8777, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	1	5	Female	25-34	12/13/2008 5:01:50 PM	The medication has been a God-send.  Over the past two years I've finally been able to start living my life.  My asthma no longer controls my day; I no longer have to worry about whether or not I'm going to be exposed to something that is going to trigger my asthma.  I actually went hiking in Yellowstone this past fall and didn't one single flare-up.  I no longer take dozens of drugs that only somewhat controlled my asthma.  The ease of use issue isn't related to Genetech or the drug itself...it's related to the stupid (and stupid is a very nice way to put it) pharmaceutical company.  I've had many problems with OptionCare.  Every four weeks they are suppose to automatically send the medication to my doctor's office.  More than once I've gotten there to find out they forgot to send it.  I end up being 1-2 weeks late due to the screw ups.  I've gotten calls asking me to pay outrageous balances that I don't owe, only to find out they have me confused with someone else.  I've also had them incorrectly calculate how much I owe.  When I do have balances, I call within a few days of getting the bill to have the payment handled electronically.  Even after attempting to pay bills in a timely fashion, I get calls and letters threatening to send my bill to a collection agency or small claims court for failing to pay it on time.  I have to keep very accurate records of who I talk to and when and half they time they tell me that the person I talked to wasn't in the correct department and couldn't have handled the payment...so why did they take my payment information and tell me they would take care of this?!?!?  My favorite is when they call me in MAY or JUNE to let me know my insurance had made changes to the payment plan in JANUARY!  Are you kidding me...you just figured this out?!?!?  I'm nearly at the point of stopping the medication because I'm so tired of dealing with the pharmacy.  The hassle I go through on a regular basis just doesn't seem worth it.

Have recently had to begin the inhalers and Advair again, but have not been hospitalized, which I had been every year at least once, with IV steroids.  Sometimes have to take a round of Prednisone tablets, about once a year only.  I could tell at the end of the month that I needed the shot.

It took about 5 months to start working for me.  Just about when I was ready to call it quits on the shots, the Xolair did its thing. I was on high dose steroids all the time before and never could get my asthma symptoms under control no matter what combination of medications we tried. My quality of life had really deteriorated. For someone 31 years old, I felt like I had the health of someone who was 80.  Now, my peak flows are consistently higher and even though I do occasionally have symptoms, they are very mild and actually go away after a dose of albuterol instead of lasting for weeks and weeks with little relief.  I really never thought anything would significantly improve things, and that constant asthma was just something I had to accept. But this was the magic bullet. All I had to do was give it time to work.  It truly changed my life.  I never review medications, but this one was worth it.

I haven't required any steroids in 4 years and have not had a asthma attack either.

After one year of injections (2 every 2 weeks) I decided to stop for awhile-went off for about 8 months only to find my symtoms returned and asthma began controlling my life again. My asthma began at age 39. (Currently I receive 3 injections every 2 weeks and am symtom free! The day of the injections I do feel tired so I time my appointments for later in the afternoon.The injections can be painful.  If this occurs, I recommend asking for a different person as every nurse is not talented with injections. I am very pleased with the set-up at my doctor's office. Find the right provider for yourself-it makes a difference with your success. Regarding cost; It is an expensive drug, you have to commit to the time and the affordability issue. BUT you just might get your life back...as I have...Good luck!

I have only just started Xolair, but someone told me they read if you go off of Xolair, your IGes return with a vengeance ten times more than before.  Is this true?  Does anyone know anything about that?  Would that mean if I really get into this (I've only had two injections so far) that I'm going to be on it for the rest of my life?

It has worked great on treating my symptoms. I have been on it a very short time and have been wondering if it causes some mild side effects for me. I feel very tired within 8 hours of my injection and kind of sore for the next 24 hours. But my energy level is through the roof and I am sleeping through the night. I have not needed my inhaler once since I started this drug. The cost is really high, I am not certain that I can continue because my copay is so high. The drug cost $2100 a dose and I have to pay at least $100 of that, the injection fee per visit is $200 and I have to pay $150 of that. On top of all the other medications I use I don't think that I can hope to afford this long term. My family does not want me to go off it, even they have noticed how much better I am (breathing wise).

Ran to the doctor.Only to find out that he couldn't have it as I do not have the base amount of 10,000 to get him going.I've contacted the makers of Xolair and begged for help. I was told no. I wasn't given any options.I am still lobbying charities for help. If anyone out there knows of any help I'd appreciate it greatly. Polarity.75@hotmail.com

Before Xolair, I was in and out of the hospital 5-6 times per year.  In 19yrs I've only been back 1 time.  Its a miracle drug &amp; I would advise anyone with severe asthma to give it a try.  Its expensive, but worth it.

I would have attacks every six weeks, they lasted 7-14 days and I had to use large dose of steriods. I could not tolerate my allergy shots and was stopped at a certain dose. For over one year I have had one or two very small episodes. I am exposed to agricultural dusts and pollen. Now, they have a limited empact on me.

I started Xolair last July and this spring was the test.  A real miracle-- I have not used my albuterol inhaler once this season, compared to going through at least 2 per season in previous years.  It has performed so much better than I had dared hope!

I would recommend this to anyone who has chronic asthma.  It did take about 6 months to start working, but it was well worth the wait.  Don't get discouraged if it doesn't work right away/

Have not had the problem recovering as before and have cut out all the other meds that I had to take regularly to try to prevent episodes everytime I had an allergic reaction or trigger that couldn't be controlled without hospitalization.
