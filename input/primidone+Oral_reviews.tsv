Essential Tremor	JIMMY D., 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male	55-64	7/2/2012 10:07:09 PM	Primidone was prescribed for me by a G.P., VAMC quack ( a quack for many reasons ) for treatment of my Essential Familial Tremors - hereditary in my case.  He wanted me to work up to, via 250 mg pills, up to 750 mg/da.  I was okay except for sore stomach, as I got up to 400 megs/day and they seemed to be helping.  As I increased over the 400-500 I started getting intermittent spazms where I couldn't even stand safely.  I worked my way back off from Primidone and notified my DR. that I was doing so.  It took no less than two weeks of NO Primidone to get back to my normal state of tremoring.  (do not drink alcohol with this!!!!!) That's not what caused my severe seizures!  BTW, YES, rough on the stomach.
Essential Tremor	cherylbow@windstream.net, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	6/17/2012 11:22:17 PM	My doctor prescribed 50 mg of primidone for a slight hand tremor.  I took this med at 10PM and by 8AM, upon arising, I found I was unable to do so due to extreme dizziness and nausea.  I remained in a state of nausea, vomiting and dizziness, extremely sick, for the entire day, unable to stand or eat.  The next day, I was improved, but was weak and continued to have remnants of the stomach upset. Perhaps my history of motion sickness and inner ear disturbance contributed to the problem, but this drug did NOT work for me.

Essential Tremor	oweemytoe, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/27/2012 9:44:03 AM	I have only taken a few doses of this medication and am stopping it. I have had severe nausea so strong I thought I was going to throw up all over the place, the only time I got relief from this feeling was when I was laying down. I also have experienced extreme exhaustion, sleeping for 14 - 15 hours a day. In regard to my tremor, it has no effect on them and I have a feeling of an internal almost jittery feeling..I know this is a top tier medication for Essential Tremors, but I am really wishing I never switched. 
Essential Tremor	marcie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	5/1/2012 3:02:23 PM	I was started at the lowest dose and got terribly sick, weak, very disoriented, I staggered rather than walked, within 2 hrs of taking it at bedtime as rx'd. Tried it a 2nd night with same results. Then tried 1/2 the dose, only difference was I wasn't nearly as disoriented. There is a chance because I am on another anti-siezure med for neuropathy..the combo of 2 different ones was too much for my body in spite of what the dr.s said.As with any med..proceed with caution.

Other	battlehead99, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	10/27/2011 6:50:04 AM	I began taking this medication because of uncontrolled shaking of hands and legs, and body twitches. I could no longer write clearly or type. When I first began a couple of months ago I felt a numbing sensation on the left side of my head and had sleeping issues. Now that sensation has gone, but I feel like I am having short term memory losses. There has been nothing major just little things that I didn't use to forget. This medication has done wonders for my shaking and twitches. All in all I will give in to forgeting a few things if it means I can get through the day without shaking &amp; twitching! I would not have been able to type this before the medication without alot of frustration and mistakes.

Essential Tremor	frank, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Male	55-64	8/14/2011 9:30:58 PM	it made me want to throw up and pass out and i slept for ten hours or more.............. not going to take it but it did stop my hand from trembling.   So i have to decide , what is worse the side effects or the medication. I took it only one day and one time............. so maybe i  need to to  give it more time   but i take other medication also..............so things need to be regulated with in my body if i am gong to keep taking medication.   But my wife is trained in medical leeches which we are trying to get to help  with  other problems also............ i would rather go with the natural way and less invasive to the body and mind than mans way..........

He unfortunately committed suicide just before Christmas 2010. There were some stressful things happening in his life, but one of the rare but possible side effects of primidone is suicidal thoughts/attempts. We didn't realize this until after the fact - so read the material that comes with all drugs and be especially careful with this one!

Could not go to work that day afraid to drive. Called the neurologist back and he had me to cut pill in half and try that still had problems. Called my family doctor and told him what all was going on and he said for me to get off the medicine had only been on it 4 days.

Doctors kept saying they thought it was all psycho related. It affects both my arms and legs. I got so bad that I could not even get around sometimes in my own home. Needed power chair and power scooter to do anything. Driving was out of the question. In 6 months now, I have gone from 50mg of primidone to 200mg and will be evaluated again in about 2 months. I spent 30 visits in physical therapy learning to walk and regain muscle control. Now I have my life back again. Back to being able to drive again even. Not even having to use a walking stick anymore. My Balance is getting so much better as well. I feel like this is almost a miracle drug.

I've had tremors all my life as did my father and GF. Had to go off Inderal when my breathing got worse and have used alcohol to control this most of my life (not the ideal choice).  Don't drink AND use Primidone!  Here's my experience:PROS:-Cuts shaking way down on 250mg/day-Helps me sleep (I've always had insomnia)-Was able to stop drinking right away-Am less depressed (maybe just because I don't shake as much or because I quit booze)CONS:-Problem with balance from medication-Vision (hard-to-describe trouble focusing on objects in plain view)-Harder to wake up, often sleepy-Some itching on forearms &amp; torso 1st mo. only-Fell &amp; broke my nose on 2nd day when I was still drinking. That's when I decided either the pills or booze had to go.  BE CAREFUL!OVERALL, the pills are worth it.  After 6 mos I'm still experimenting with dosage and times of day to dose.  Obviously they don't appeal to everyone but I would recommend a try.
Essential Tremor	Pop, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	8/11/2010 3:15:45 PM	Major success with reduction of tremors. The only difficulty I've noticed is with vision which may or may not be caused by the primidone. I have many other meds that I take for various malfunctions so finding what is causing specific problems is difficult. I do know that this particular problem did not exist prior tp taking this med so it is a probability that itis caused from the primidone. But I can deal with it better than the constant tremors.

After bring on this medication for over a month I started to notice a big difference in the occurrence of these episodes. I take 50mg twice daily and it seems to be the right dosage for me.  The only problem I had was when the pharmacy mixed medications and gave me a look alike/sound alike medication of Prednisone and I took it for 6 months thinking I was taking Primidone.  Needless to say I was in bad physical condition until the mistake was found by accident.  Never assume and always check.  I'm back on Primidone and after awhile it was doing it's job again.

Without it,I have days where I can't put food on my own plate from the stovetop, as I'll miss it and shake all the food all over the place, or try to type on this keyboard,and have to use one hand to steady my other one,to type ,or control the mouse on a small area can be impossible. With the Primidone, my tremors are much less noticeable, and makes my life alot easier.I have been on EVERY drug made,from the time I was 9 years old to stop my shaking, and I'm 54 now.They tried artane &amp; ativan mix,plus too many to remember.It does seem like it works better some days than others,but that may just be me too.... 
Essential Tremor	shake, rattle and roll, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	65-74	5/2/2010 5:09:12 PM	I have been taking primidone for  over a month now to treat my hands shaking.  My Dr. started me out slowly with 1/2 tablets (50 mg) 2 times a day and built up from there over a 31 day period.  I'm now up to 3 tablets 3 times a day.  I still have the shakiness especial in the morning and sometimes when I use the keyboard. I feel there may be some improvement in my handwriting and other things like applying eye makeup, holding up a mirror.  It seems to vary throughout the day.  My Dr has me remaining on the 3/3/3 schedule until I see him in 3 1/2 wks.  I didn't notice any side effects while increasing the dosage (I must say I seem to tolerate all medications well); however I forgot he said no alcohol and had 3 glasses draft beer yesterday with husband and friends and my husband observed very impaired walking motor skills, so no alcohol from now on.  Dr had me try Gabapentin (300 mg) first but it didn't help.  If the Primidone doesn't improve the tremors more satisfactorily I'll see what other medication he suggests.

My tremors improved after using 2ea 50mg every nite but Doc increased me to 250mg per day for some reason and now I am experiencing weird things such as turning the water faucet the wrong direction for hot water, trying to pick up the hot stove grate right after I turned the burner off and reaching inside toaster to feel if I had put the bread in to be toasted. Wonder if my dosage is too strong so am contacting Doc to discuss this. Has anyone else had this problem?

Essential Tremor	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	10/4/2009 10:37:48 AM	I have been on Primidone for probably a year now and I'm up to 500 mg (250 AM and 250 PM). My tremors are getting worse, my speech is getting worse, my balance has always been an issue; but more so now. I don't know how I would feel without the medication, I am assuming worse. I was recently laid off from my job, I have been a secretary for 15 years and I strongly think that my tremors and &quot;wall walking&quot; were a deciding factor in them laying me off. I hate this!!!! I used to type and now if I twitch I hit the wrong keys, or if I'm working with the mouse I can't control it like I used to. I don't like going out in public, I don't avoid it; but I don't like it. Some days are better than others. The vertigo has gotten worse, I don't drive as much because that makes me dizzy; I think that's a side effect of the drug, but I had previous issues with vertigo too. I wish there was something that could help me function. I want to work, I want to paint my own nails, I want to be able to thread a needle and all these things seem to be out of my reach. They have recently started me on Klonopin, which makes me a little nervous about taking that medication because of the side effects listed for that. Hopefully something will help soon. I have two baby grand son's and I would love to be able to hold them and play with them without shaking or twitching.

I am to go to 25m.g. this week at bedtime. He is gradually working the dosage up to 50m.g. The first week I experienced headache and nausea. However that side effect has passed. I am anxious to see how I feel with the increased dosage this week. The hand tremor is some better, but still have jaw tremor which is my main concern.
Essential Tremor	Virginia Trombetta, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	7/25/2009 11:17:46 AM	Have been on mysoline for the ten years for essential tremor and have been happy with the results.  However, for the past couple of yeas, I'm finding myself becoming extremely irritable.  I was contributing this behavior to the fact that I have been a caregiver for the past 3 years and it has become increasing difficult for me.  Now I have cut back on the medication from 300 mgs/daily (2-50/mg. a.m., 3- 50/mg, p.m.) to 200 mgs. nightly and will see if this makes a difference.  Have not consulted with my doctor on this yet.

Excessive Involuntary Trembling	Pammy53, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/13/2009 6:28:36 PM	I started shaking as though I had Parkinson's, so I went to my neurologist about it.  I would shake as though there was an earthquake going on inside of me.  Sometimes the shaking would just begin, just in my hands and arms and I would have to just hang on to my clothes to let it pass; it was almost seizure-like but fully awake.  After he could not diagnose it as Parkinson's (he said I did not have the &quot;frozen face&quot; look to diagnose it as such), he blamed it on my chiari malformation. That is part of the brain in the back touching the spinal cord; people are born with it but sometimes don't have trouble until adulthood. I thought it was just too easy for him to just brush it off as that because of not being able to pinpoint exactly.Anyway, the Primidone does help, but at first the side effects were easy to cry and drowsiness during the day.  I had to cut the 50mg into fourths, then halves, then work up to whole.  Sometimes when I forget to take it at night, for a few nights, I have to start over again.Like an earlier response, I can almost feel the shaking coming on; the more I concentrate on it, the more it breaks through to fully happen.  If I get up and move around, it gets better.  It's right the opposite of essential, in which the shaking starts when movement starts.

I have tremors that make me feel I am in a paint shaker! The drug at first gave me rushes through out my limbs and face. I've had tremors since 2006 and they say I'll always need the Med. or have an electrod put in my head. I choose the Med.I can always tell when it is time for the Med. I feel the tremors coming on or when I get excited or mad! I had to let the med. do its Job and now I have Good and some not so good days. I also have hardware in my neck so they affect my neck as well!   
Essential Tremor	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	35-44	6/8/2009 11:19:33 PM	Just started taking this a few days ago. I've had pretty bad tremors in my right hand for about 8 years, tried both propalanoyl (I'm sure that's spelled wrong) and inderal with no success. I take klonipin to sleep, which they also say can help with the tremors, but no luck.This past year I started shaking all over, and decided I HAD to try something else. My hands shaking were embarassing enough, but this is nuts.The primidone is awesome. It works as well as alcohol, which previously was the only thing that worked (not that drinking is any kind of &quot;treatment,&quot; but it does work). The only problems are the side effects. I'm exhausted, my eyes don't focus, and I drop things. I've lowered my dose from 50 to 25, and will be taking it at night for the next week or so. I really, really hope to get used to this, it's so exciting to find something that actually works.

Essential occur when you start to do something with hand or hands affected.

Doing well, does not make me sleepy, but i have been on serious meds.  Hands have slowed way down, and its nice to feel normal and not to be scared that i am shaking to bad to go out in public.
Essential Tremor	my_angels_in_heaven, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		5/5/2009 2:55:31 AM	My mother-in-laws' Dr put her on this medicine because she has a bad tremor. But she also has diabetes, and she had a pacemaker put in on January 2009.  She is getting up there in age and we try to take care of her. Because we know how it may be when we are olderrrr.  But My mother-in-law took this medicine for 2 days. It feel like she was lossing her mind and didnt want to live any longer. It also made she sugar level go down to like 50-70 for those days also. So, she talked to her Dr. and she went off of this medicine. I looked the medicine up on WebMD and it said it was for Epileptics. I knew the name sounded familar because I am a Epileptic myself. But I dont take that one.  That concerned me also, because most people take so much medicine anymore.  Including myself, I general look everything up anyway because of the side effects and so on. But I just try to be careful and I thank WebMD for being there also.  SO EVERYONE JUST PLEASE BE CAREFUL.
Essential Tremor	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	4/7/2009 7:51:54 PM	Was prescribed 50mg once a day and told to increase to 100mg once a day after 7 days.  On day 7, I was released from work because I could not function in the classroom.  Severe sleepiness, confusion, and disorientation, with no decrease in hand tremors were what I experienced.  I was frequently late to work, seminars, and church because I could not force myself awake in the mornings.  I could not remember the times and dates of appointments, even after posting them on three different calendars, and was even confused as to the current date.  I had trouble concentrating on creating lesson plans, IEPs, and teaching.  I had trouble remembering where I was or what I was supposed to be doing.  And on top of all this, my hand tremors did not improve!  They didn't get worse, but they didn't improve, either.  I started taking the drug on 2/27/09 and I decided to stop taking the drug on 4/4/09.  I wrote a letter to the neurologist explaining what I had been experiencing and why I had to stop taking the drug.

The tremors have helped minisculey but I don't like what it's doing to her face.  She looks like a chipmunk.  Her checks are so puffed out.  I have to decide if the slight improvement is worth her looking like a freak
Essential Tremor	Julie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	45-54	2/10/2009 10:33:18 AM	I have been on Primidone for 10 days.  I started at 25mg. at bedtime.  My hand tremors improved 100%.  However I was so sleepy and dizzy, I cut my dose back to 12.5mg.  I am still feeling dazed and confused.  I love having my hands work again, but I don't know if I can put up with the side effects.  I will give it until by follow up visit with my Dr. to decide if I will continue
Essential Tremor	Kay-Sea, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	55-64	2/3/2009 12:19:38 PM	Have already read comments to date (2-3-09), &amp; found many helpful.  My tremor is a hand-me-down gift from my dad and his mother...  I'm a beaded jewelry artist, and have been unable to create for months -- very frustrating!  Took 80 mg of propranolol for many years, then tapered off, and have had no tremor meds for a month.  Hand tremor increased, wrist jerking developed, and calf, shin, and thigh muscles started tremors -- all on my right side.  My neurologist started me on 1/4 tablet, that's 12.5 mg, after dinner for a week, then very gradually increase.  Last night was my first tiny dose, which I got through just fine.  I'm eager to increase the dosage in hopes of improvement.  But comments here about side effects, especially when starting off with a full 50 mg dosage, or even 25 mg, will help me be patient.  I hope to continue comments as time goes by.

Essential Tremor	Brooks, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	10/12/2008 12:25:24 PM	A modified dosage of Primidone has suppressed hand tremors but they are not totally gone.  The overall effect has been good, since I can now function more effectively at work.  I am still in the process of modifying the medication and have found my thought process to be dull with higher dosages.  Overall I am very pleased.

I've recently been made aware thru this web site, that the drug might be responsible for an itchy skin allergic reaction that I've had since about the same time I began taking Primidone, though I cannot be certain as yet if the two are connected.  I've been on this drug for 5 months and up to now 4 tablets a day.  As yet, the drug has not stopped my hand tremors.  For me, and tremors are most embarrassing at social events.  I'm seeing my doctor next week to discuss with him the possibilities of trying something different.

I also had hallucination-type dreams and sleep disturbances at first, but stuck with it because I noticed an improvement in my voice tremors. Most of those unpleasant side effects have disappeared. Still, I can't tolerate the 250mg/day my doctor wants; have to settle with 150. Some days/times feel more tired. I think each individual will have to experiment to find the right balance.

Still have the tremors I hope 3 tabs makes a difference. Now I get headaches I never got before taking meds. Tired endlessly. Tremors are a nuisance when talking and eating.

Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy	Lorie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/5/2008 12:05:16 PM	I have had epilepsy since age 13.  I started taking phenobarbitol with Dilantin and then at age 19 switched to Mysoline and Diamox.  When I was 25 I switched back to Mysoline and Dilantin.  I am on 360 mg. of Dilantin. All has been great other than now I have had to switch to generic Mysoline and I have had some side effects of drowsiness and fatigue.  I pray that these symptoms will soon go away like they did when I was 19.  This drug has been a life saver for me.  I am now a retired teacher and coach and have led a very productive and busy life.  I take 750 mg. per day.  I am still on the same dose but and was concerned about the generic Primidone.  So far - so good. It is a drug that you have to have patience with.  Anyone with experience of shifting from the real thing to generic?  Thanks, Lorie

I was prescribed Primidone 50mg.  This stuff is great, no more hand tremors and a return of strength to the effected hand.  I was a little drowsy the first week of taking it, but when taken at bedtime, it can actually help you sleep.  Now, I don't get the sleepy side effects, but my hand is tremor free.  Even if I miss a dose, my hand immediatly doesn't go back to shaking nor to I get a withdrawal response.

I do not recommend this medication if you have a job which requires alertness. I had to leave work. There is a hang-over effect into the next day. I am one of the few who cannot tolerate this medication. My neurologist prescibed this for essential tremor.
