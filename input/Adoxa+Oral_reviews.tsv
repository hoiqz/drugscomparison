Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/7/2012 10:57:27 AM	My doctor gave me samples of this medication and it works beautifully! So when I went to fill the script at my pharmacy I was given the generic doxycycline for $10. It did not work so well. My acne came back and may have been even worse. I spoke to my doctor and he wrote me a script for &quot;name brand only&quot;. The name brand would cost me $475 for a 30 day script and that's with my insurance. Without insurance it would cost me $1500 a month. It should be illegal for a drug company to charge this. $50 a pill? Really? Absolutely unethical!
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/11/2011 3:09:50 PM	The price for this product is absolute absurd. You can get a rebate card from your dermatologist that brings the pills down to only ten dollars. Unfortunately, if the pill is not covered under your insurance, you cannot use the card. And, OF COURSE, it's not covered under mine. I had two weeks worth of samples, and I started seeing results right away! I am completely bummed that I can't purchase these pills :( For anyone who is lucky enough to use the rebate card, DO it! 
Acne		1	1	1			3/10/2011 1:11:48 AM	For my daughter her Doctor prescribed Adoxa-when I sent my husband to CVS to buy the medicine, but when we heard of the price($900), disbelief shot through us. What is this product, made of gold or what? I couldn't buy it.
Acne	belairbum, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	2/21/2011 5:34:47 PM	My daughter was prescribed Adoxa and when we got to the pharmacy to pick it up, we found out that the cost for #60 pills was $500.32.  I almost fainted!!!  With no RX coverage, how can anyone afford this!  It should be illegal for pharmaceutical companies to jack up the prices so much!  I was told by the pharmacist that it is Doxycycline, which there are several brands and had to call and get replaced!  Wonder what &quot;kick-back&quot; the doc gets for writing this one??  THis is a hug problem in the medical and insurance fraud problems that I wish someone would approach!Very disappointed!!
Acne Rosacea	Gsmpb5, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	55-64	11/28/2010 8:48:53 PM	This is week three of Adoxa 150 for Rosacea and Acne.At first all was well no symptoms with med but after 3 weeks I started with lower back pain. It has really cleared my skin and most cysts are gone but I might give my Dr. a call because of the lower back pain and I am suppose to be on this for 3 months. Possibly a lower dose might be better .

Acne	Kat, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	1/11/2010 5:14:04 PM	I am a 27 yr old female and i started getting acne in my 20s. I went to see a dermatogolist who concluded it was hormornal. At this point i had tried every acne cream from everywhere. So my doc prescribed Adoxa, Retin-A and Benzalin. My acne cleared up within a month. Adoxa was the miracle worker because after i stopped taking it (I take it a month at a time), I stay clear for a few months and then the pimples start to pop up again even with continued use of BenzaClin and RetinA. Taking it without food is best but i always got sick so i had something really light like crackers or a slice of bread with the drug.

Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	10/19/2009 2:54:46 PM	After developing a resistance to another anti-biotic, my doctor put me on Adoxa. I saw a difference almost immediately. My acne took about a month to clear up completely, but each day it got less noticeable and definitely less painful. Although the instructions say don't take it with food, I would ask your doctor's advice. Mine told me to always take it with food. One morning, I was in a rush and only grabbed an apple. When I took it on such an empty stomach I got VERY sick and threw up twice. So clearly I know why he told me to take it with food. Bottomline--everyone is different so make sure to ask your doctor. Other than that, I think it's a great drug and I am SO happy that it worked for me.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/5/2009 2:06:08 PM	I've been on this medication (150 mg/day) for one month. I had some severe acne above my lip for a few months and nothing was taking care of it. Went to the derm, got this and Ziana, and in conjunction they worked amazingly. My face is absolutely clear, not a single blemish or zit. I haven't decided if I want to get it refilled because it is supposedly very hard on your stomach, and I take enough pills as it is. Overall I had no severe side effects, maybe a headache but I get them often so I'm not certain if the Adoxa caused it or not.
Acne	jewelj80, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	25-34	9/22/2009 5:58:21 PM	This medicine makes me sick, especially in the summer when it's hard to avoid the sun. I cannot take it without food. I have mild diarrhea and vomit when I do. There are very few foods you can eat with Adoxa. You're not supposed to take it within 2 hours of eating magnesium, calcium, iron, zinc, aluminum, or antacids. If I were a doctor, I would not prescribe any drug with Doxycycline for long-term use. I took Accutane over 10 years ago for 6 months and never had such symptoms (e.g.vomiting, diarrhea).  Also, it cleared my acne for the next five years. I'd much rather do Accutance than Doxycycline.
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	35-44	9/10/2009 10:24:05 AM	Taking this medication with food reduces it's effectiveness, and taking it on an empty stomach makes me very ill.  So remembering to take it 2 hours after and 1 hour before eating is critical and makes it more likely to foget.  But it absolutely works when I take it properly and has much fewer risks than the alternative (Accutane).
Acne		5	3	4			6/5/2009 10:02:04 AM	I've been taking Adoxa 150 mg for two months now, and my skin looks great!  The only problem is that the medicine makes me sick, so I have to take it with food. It also gives me headaches. I think it is a great short term solution, but I wouldn't want to take it long term because the side effects aren't worth it.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/9/2009 10:38:19 PM	I have been using adoxa 150mg once a day for over a month now to clear up my acne.  I never had acne before and after stopping birth control my face had a major acne freak out fit.  I have to take this with food because I got very nauseous and sick from taking it on an empty stomach.  I have been having some mild diarrhea after being outside too long in the sun.  And I must wear sunscreen &amp; reapply every 2hrs. when going outside since I have already burned once.  Overall I am happy that my skin is clearing up and the side effects are bearable.  The dermatologist said I'll have to be on this for approx. 3-4months.
Acne	13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Male	13-18	2/17/2009 3:41:34 PM	My son has only been on this medication for 3 weeks but has seen considerable improvement in the clearing up of his acne.  He is on 150 mg, 1x daily and takes it approx. 1 hr after eating and has had no stomach issues.
Acne	~H, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	1/4/2009 1:30:00 AM	I have been taking this medication for Perioral Dermatitis for 3 weeks and I see a very small change in my skin. It defintely makes me sick so I HAVE to take it with food. I also notice headaches and I think it makes me really sensitive to alcohol (makes my heart race). All in all I will stick it out for the 6-12 weeks. 
Acne	suznata, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	11/22/2008 2:13:18 PM	My son takes this after he's eaten and has no stomach upset.  It was slow to work at first maybe because he was taking it with food,but it eventually kicked in and his face is clear now.
Acne	cutezakry, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	8/30/2008 11:11:48 AM	I'm taking 150 mg capsules 2x a day for two weeks, third week and fourth week is 1 150 mg capsule a day.  I'm on my third week.  I continue to feel dizzy like that of nausea but the medicine really works great. The pimples dried out and no more skin break outs.  It takes time though to completely dry all the pimples.  One month of Adoxa intake.
Acne		5	5	5			3/28/2008 2:58:07 PM	after only a few days my cysts felt smaller or had went away. this has been the only oral medication to work for me

Acne	Kim, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	10/19/2007 8:31:17 PM	This medicine treats cystic acne quickly and effectively.  The only drawback is that it is very harsh on the stomach.  
Acne	rantam, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	45-54	10/19/2007 8:27:28 PM	Makes me feel nauscious. I have difficulty making myself take it due to the stomach upset.
