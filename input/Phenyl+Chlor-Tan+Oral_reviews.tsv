Other	35-44 Female  (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/22/2009 10:50:15 AM	Given to my 7 year old son by an Allergist and we have had excellent results.  Sometimes it makes him a bit grumpy, sometimes tired, but he is able to sleep better because he can breathe easier.  We take this during peek allergy season when his other meds are not working as well to relieve the congestion, and when he has a bad cold to help relieve some of his symptoms.

It works wonders on her.  She will have a running nose, water eyes, and itchy throat and in two doses she is a normal kid again.  When she first started taking the med she was very tired, but after the first prescription she was fine.  I never had any other problems with it.  She takes it before school in the AM with breakfast and at night after before bed.  She has never had a problem with being tired at school.  The medicine actually gives her back her energy after not feeling well.  I highly recommended this prescription.
