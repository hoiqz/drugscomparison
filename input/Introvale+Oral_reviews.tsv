Birth Control	livimo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/2/2012 1:30:07 AM	I just started my 7th week of Introvale today and so far so good. I have been on 2 other types of BC and the first one made me break out like crazy and the second one made me way too emotional. At the beginning of starting Introvale I did end up breaking out a bit but its cleared up since. No emotional problems (at least I think lol). Within the past few days I have started spotting but this could also be do to the fact that I have taken a few pills a little bit late. My doctor says that this too should subside. Other than that, I haven't really had too many issues. Not having a period for 3 months is kinda nice and I haven't gained any weight which is also a plus. would recommend.

Sometimes my period was very light and sometimes it has been heavier. Now I feel like the first pack is like that first week after your period, the second pack is that great &quot;ovulating&quot; time period, and the third pack is like a month of serious PMS symptoms. Moodiness, breast swelling,etc. only getting worse each cycle. This month, I am extremely bloated and experiencing major cramping and it is still one week til my period should start. It is more painful than I remember a period ever being. My stomach is very sensitive to the touch. What usually happens when you feel this way is that you start bleeding and the cramps do their job of pushing blood out. But I won't bleed for days!! IF I bleed this time. These periods are not normal. The blood is usually very dark or brown and thin. If the side effects are different when using a different generic, then I will ask my doctor to switch or try the Depo shot.

I have only been on it for 11 days, but the first week of taking it was hell. I was very irritable, depressed, and over-analyzed things WAY more than I usually do. I have developed acne on my chest and between my shoulder blades on my back. I have decided to stop the BCPs today and will be calling my doctor to try something else.
Birth Control	Mar, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	3/30/2012 10:01:30 PM	What is the point of birth control if you're always spotting? I'm on my second pack of pills (been taking this drug for a little more than a month) and I started spotting last Monday. It hasn't stopped yet. Like I said, I don't need birth control if I can't ever have sex anyway. If things don't improve by the time I finish this whole pack I'm switching. Also had a really bad anxiety attack before the bleeding started. I take meds for depression already and I haven't noticed that being any different. Lots of cramping and bloating, though. And I wad nauseous for the first three weeks I was on it.

Birth Control	xxmm, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	2/29/2012 9:50:05 PM	I have been taking this pill for over a year now. I bleed everyday since I've tooken it. My Doctor said this is normal but I think not. I can only spend so much money on tampons and pads! My right breast is constantly sore and swollen. I have very sharp pains in my uterus.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	2/3/2012 7:30:36 PM	I hate, hate, hate this pill! I have been on 4 different generics for Seasonale, and Introvale is BY FAR the worst. I just started my 4th pack about a week ago, and it keeps getting worse.I have horrible acne, I get emotional over little things, and I've has 3 migraines in less than a month. I also bled every day for 2 out of the 3 months when I started this pill. Not just a little spotting--I usually had to wear a tampon to control it. I never had any of these symptoms when I was on another generic (Quasense). I'm switching back asap. This pill is awful.

I gained like 10-15 pounds. I didn't like anything about it. I always felt moody and just got upset over simple things that i shouldn't have.
Birth Control	KLC,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female		9/26/2011 10:03:28 AM	This pill works for contraception purposes, but the side effects are terrible in my opinion. Since I began taking this pill 2 months ago, I have been exhausted, nauseous every day, and getting more migraines than usual. Lately I have been experiencing some depression and am going to switch back to the Depo shot when my pill pack is out. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	9/22/2011 7:08:29 AM	I am on my third month of taking this pill, and for the second time I have had breakthrough bleeding.  Last month for two weeks and this month a week and a half before the white pills! My doctor said it was because of the hormonal changes my body experienced in recently having a baby, but I have never had this issue before- I was on another generic form of seasonale for a few years with no problems at all.  I have had  nausea off and on for over a month, and experienced extreme lower body aches (in the thighs and pelvic area) just prior to the breakthrough bleeding.
Birth Control	season-eek., 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	2	Female	19-24	6/20/2011 4:27:56 PM	I have been on generic Seasonique for 3 years. Last month my mail in pharmacy sent me introvale, a new generic for Seasonique that I had not taken before. I have experienced two different accounts of break-through bleeding, the first for 15 days. This time, I have refused to wait so long to seek medical attention and am switching off of the pill completely. I have noticed a decline in my mood and my want for interaction with others, I have also been experiencing high anxiety and slight bouts of depression.
