While the entire process lasted nearly four hours, there was no discomfort, no reaction to the Lexiscan sdministration, and only a minor (2 on a scale of 10) headache, which the technician relieved in about two minutes with the injection of another drug.  Walked out the door, had lunch, and went shopping!  Piece of cake!

There was a brief unpleasant feeling like I overexerted myself, it lasted a few minutes. I had back pain from lying on the hard surface during the scan this was not related to the drug. I went home and took a nap then went out to dinner and shopped. No other ill effects.

The entire test lasted 3 minutes.The worse part was lying still for the half hour of the MRI.I stressed out for no reason.  This test for me was a breeze.
Medication to Aid Study of the Blood Flow in the Heart	75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		8/5/2011 4:41:09 PM	My mother had a LexiScan yesterday at her cardiologists office.  She had a very bad reaction during the test and after.  She had diarrhea and vomiting. Her lower back started hurting so bad she could hardly walk to the bathroom.  She was still throwing up this morning at 1:30 am. She is totally exhausted. I thought she was going to pass out on me in the office. Her cardiology office told me they had never heard of any other patients doing this.  Of course, they are not telling the truth.  I have taken her to several stress tests before and she has never reacted like this before.  The lab was trying this new chemical out.  Wished we had known.  Do not use this chemical.

I passed out an hour after I left.  I could not stop sleeping for over 24 hours.  Husband became concerned. Called cardiologist's office.  Sent to ER.  Everything is fine.  Two days later I cannot stop sleeping, have a non-stop headache and want to throw-up.  Cardiologist's office said they never heard of this problem before.

The worse part of the test was worrying about it for a week before it happened.  The second worse part was laying under a camera for 20 minutes, two days in a row, but that is only because my bad back was flaring up.  The actual Lexiscan only lasted a total of 5 minutes.  I felt dizzy, then hot, and extremely out of breath.  Just when I thought I could not take anymore, it eased off and I returned to normal.  For the two days following I have felt worn out and with headaches.  I think the reason we see so many different accounts from people about their experiences is because some people HAVE heart problems and some don't.  I am still waiting to hear the results but I hope and pray to God my heart is healthy.  The test is not so bad, and if your really worried just make sure there is a doctor present.  
Medication to Aid Study of the Blood Flow in the Heart	dandduce, 55-64 Male  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	5/31/2011 11:17:36 PM	This is a dangerous drug and patients are not adequately informed as to the possible fatal, and longstanding side effects.  My wife had a Lexisan stress test and survived it, but was very ill during the test.  She since has developed PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) that make her feel as though her heart is missing beats.  This side effect now is chronic and has not abated since the test, mid April 2011. Do not use this drug!  Make your cardiology group inform you completely about this drug.

No heart problems but my head felt as if it were splitting wide open.  This lasted for at least 20 minutes.  I have multiple allergies of which the doctor is aware.  I have yet to learn exactly what caused the reaction--probably one of the fillers or agents.  Never again.

Two nurses said it was the worse reaction that they had even seen.  I am still suffering from the side effects and am concerned if I will ever be able to recover from this!
