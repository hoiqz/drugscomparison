My findings were, blurred vision, trouble waking sometimes, dizziness.  The positive side effect is it helps with sleep.  Once I fall asleep on this medicne, I sleep completely through the night. I have been taking this med on and off for over a month.

I have been on dilantin since and tranxene which helps greatly, especially when I feel a seizure comming on sometimes I can take tranxene and ward off the seizure. Lately I have been on atavin but it doesn't work as well for seizures.

Anxious	2brn2b, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	8/28/2011 5:09:28 PM	Was on 3.75 MG for mild anxitey and to help lower blood pressure. After 3 0r 4 days I began to feel depressed and sad this was followed by days of crying jags as though the worst thing in the world had happened. It took three weeks before my son suggested he noticed the change beginning after I had started the medication. Discussed with my dr., he said this is an unusual, but reported side effect for some. Quit medication have slowly returned to my &quot;normal&quot; anxious state.
Anxious	Adrian, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	19-24	5/20/2011 9:16:56 PM	I'm an RN and was very impressed by what I've read about this medication, especially the long half-life which decreases the chance of tolerance or addiction. However, it didn't work for me. 7.5 mg had no effect. At 15 mg, feeling of pounding heartbeat turned to a fluttering but didn't go away and I just felt tired. Seems like this would be a great medication for generalized anxiety but I just didn't have much luck with it.

Anxious	boxerdogs3, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/14/2011 12:38:37 AM	I have been a worrier and anxious since childhood. I started taking this medication in my later teen years. I am 51 now and still occasionally take it. It has helped me tremendously. I have not ever noticed any side effects. If I do not take it for a while I dont have any withdrawals from it. I would recommend trying this med first for anxiety before taking the newer ones.

I was agoraphobic with panic attacks. The Tranxene T-Tab brand along with the others have cured me. Been on the cocktail since 1990. No problems

It works very well, allowing me to sleep during the night without sudden muscle pain awakenings.  As far as I know, I have not experienced any adverse side effects.  I do only get two to three refills per year.  Thank you.
Other	ariesstar2, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	3/10/2010 10:33:31 PM	i relly liked the way it helped me. i had a bad case of anxiety and panic attacks and since i have been on it for years i have to go to some thing that will work in the same way as tranxene. it is to expensive to take when your insurance company wont cover the cost or help with the cost. living on a fixed income. i have called all the medicare supplement plans and medicare plans and no one will help me. i even called the company that makes it and they dont have a program that helps either. so what do you do. my hands are tied.

Anxious	MINDSCI, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	45-54	2/8/2010 1:42:48 PM	I have been taking Tranxene (Clorazepate 7.5mg T.I.D) for over a year now. I started it for Chronic Anxiety &amp; Stress Over-Reactivity. It has worked extremely well. Moreover, it has not lost its effectiveness at the same dose- no tolerance! Within 2 weeks of starting Tranxene I noticed my fingernails had started to grow out! I had always bitten them all off till they bled since I was 4-5 years old. I no longer dread answering the door or phone, nor have ruminating anxious thoughts. The Tranxene is also an Anti-Seizure Medication; consequently, it allowed me to drop Lamictal, a Sodium Channel Blocker, from my Seizure Med List.  The Lamictal and all the Sodium Channel Blockers (Tegretol, Trieptal, etc.) always caused me too much Cognitive Fogging. Tranxene is a PRODRUG which is quickly converted to NorDiazepam, a Benzodiazepine, which has a half life of 45-75 hours. As such, steady state levels of Nordiazepam are reached within several days of initial dosing. In my experience, there is No &quot;Cognitive Fogging&quot;; No &quot;High&quot;, No &quot;Amnesiac Effect&quot;,and No &quot;Sedative/Hypnotic Effect&quot; which are all to common with other Benzodiazepine drugs. As a Neuroscientist I cannot tolerate the Side Effects of any of the more commonly prescribed Anxiolytics and Anti-epileptics. It's too bad the Vast Majority of M.D.'s are not aware that TRANXENE and some other Benzodiazepines are not very addictive- contrary to popular &quot;Medical Community&quot; belief.

I could not stop drinking because of alcohol withdrawal so I saw my doctor. He selected this drug and all I can say is wow! I took it for only 5 days and had no withdrawal symptoms and no desire to drink after completing the medication. This medication saved my life.

And this drug is like a miracle for me. No side effects at all. It is excellent for my panic attacks, and ocd problems.  I would highly recommend this medication.  It beats all the other newer drugs I have taken for panic disorder and ocd. I'm still me, but the anxiety is gone, gone, gone.  Thank You God !  
Other	knotart, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/2/2009 11:52:56 AM	This drug is prescribed for reasons other than Anxiety. After being diagnosed with PPS, Post Polio Syndrome, my Doc suggested I try this drug for muscle spasms &amp; neuro-transmitters (spelling)nerves sending crossed signals through my body. It works better &amp; is less harmful &amp; addicting as narcotic pain pills. It helps with migraines, sleep problems, muscles, tendon &amp; joint pains, even bone pains. I do not experience any negative side affects or withdrawals when I cannot afford them or go without them because Medicare or Humana Insurance no longer cover this drug. I have a friend with MS-she says it helps her tremendously. WHY HAS INSURANCE STOPPED PAYING FOR THIS VERY HELPFUL DRUG ?????

Anxious	vjtesitor, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/18/2009 8:10:57 PM	I was put on this in 1982 when my blood pressure spiked because of divorce.  I took it daily for about 4 years with no adverse effects, slept like a baby!  Quit taking it with no withdrawls at all.  In 1990 I had a hysterectomy and asked my doctor to prescribe it again.  They will only give me 30 at a time but has not been a problem.  I get a new prescription for it about every year and a half.  I only take it when I am really stressed and it works like a charm! I had been given antidepressants since my female surgery for &quot;hot flashes&quot; which they did nothing for me except make me depressed!  I weened myself off the last one, Zoloft, about a month ago only because I could not afford to go to the doctor and get a new script.  I found that when I was totally off of it my emotional state improved 100%!!!  The tranxene has helped with a few of those withdrawl jitters but only took a few.  Love the stuff!!!
Anxious	Margie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	9/2/2009 11:35:17 AM	I have taken this medicine for 20 years the only problem is that Medicare will not cover it.  I don't think I would, at this point, want to take anything else because it works so well without ANY side effects.  I am allergic to many meds so this is a blessing.

If you are suffering high levels of anxiety, please go see your doctor.  I waited years before taking action and am now living a completely different life.  No negative side effects.  Just very calming with no noticeable side effects for me.  
Anxious	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	5/8/2009 1:06:42 PM	After being prescribed different anti-anxiety medications I was told there was one older medication that might work.  That was the beginning for me in a life free of anxiety.  I don't like feeling the effects of benzo's! It was great to take a medication that did not make me feel different in any &quot;except&quot; I didn't feel anxious that part was just gone.  I have not had to change my dosage, not undergone the typical need for higher dosing - it just plain works.

This is mainly her docs fault. But she has since had major sleeping spells where she is unresponsive, went to hospital for it, fell and hurt herself, nursing home, and now is back home and has fell again and requires full care. I started digging trying to find cause and this med had just been prescribed. In her spells when she wouldn't wake* she also could not speak* and when did, it came out slurred*. Her walking* became a problem. Before being prescribed to this she was fully independent. I just wanted to review so that maybe if another elderly is taking this maybe it will warn them if they begin seeing these symptoms. It may also prevent an elderly from continuing this prescription after seeing the first symptoms and taking the same road grandma has. Hope it saves someone.(not a negetive review it did help her nerves as im sure it does many people. just be weary with giving to elderly)
