Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/12/2011 2:43:00 PM	I have been taking the generic version of this drug for 5 years now and I couldn't ask for anything better to treat my hyperhydrosis. Before I would sweat through a hoodie standing in twenty degree weather. I had to deal with the problem for about 5 years before that and it was incredibly embarassing but now I can wear the &quot;sweat showing color&quot; (especially gray and pastels) without worrying about sweating. I do still sweat but not to the extreme. It just simply makes me normal. 
Other	agdevry, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	4/1/2011 12:57:08 PM	Used for underarm hyperhidrosis. Completely helped. 99% effective in my case. The only negative side effect I am experiencing is dry mouth but that just causes me to drink more water which is a good thing overall.
Other	Marlameiko, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/9/2010 4:57:35 PM	I have been using Robinul for excessive sweating, particularly of my scalp. my head would sweat profusely everytime I went shopping, had any kind of deadlines to meet, etc. In other words, anxiety. Also if I exerted myself in any way, like cleaning house, gardening, etc. I had gotten so that I hated to go shopping at all and getting ready to go anywhere because my hair would be soaked before I could finish getting ready! The Robinul has been like a miracle! I couldn't ask for better results. However, I seem to be gaining weight around my middle quite quickly and it is also showing on the scale. I wonder if anyone else had any weight gain when taking this drug?
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	35-44	8/8/2010 6:51:01 PM	I took my daughter to a dermatologist for botox shots for sweating and I asked her what I could do as well besides the shots(which is very expensive). She recommended robinul! I started taking this med 4 days ago 2x day. It is a miracle! i stop sweating....period! I have been so embarassed from sweating for so long, I honestlly didnt think i would ever find anything that works! I live in Texas and the MD was from california. She is my angel for both me and my daughter! I hope this info helps. oh yeah...my mouth is a little dry so i think I might cut back to 1 pill a day and see how that works!
Other	Flipper, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	6/15/2010 6:20:44 PM	I too suffered for year with sweaty hands and feet. I tried everything from electrical shock to soaking my feet in various home remedies to no avail. Starting taking this 1mg 3x a day and I cannot believe that I am not wiping down my hands and feet all day long. This was the last straw before trying Botox which I did not want to do. But it is working for so I am really happy with the results. Have had some headaches but not sure yet if it is a result of this medication.

After i had several tesst and a colonoscopy the GI determined that i have IBS. Taking this medication has changed my life. I no longer have to worry about where the closest bathroom is!

It started working within 2 days.  As soon as a generic was available I switched because the Robinul is so expensive.  'GLYCOPYRROL' 2MG, 2x day works just as well!  My side effects are dilated pupils and dry mouth but no more sweating!

When I would lay down to go to sleep I would go back and forth; dig my fist into my stomach to try to relieve the discomfort;  when I would watch TV I would take the remote and push it into my stomach for relief.  My doctor finally put me on robinul.  IT IS TRULY a life saver.  My quality of life has turned around.  I am so thankful.
Other	sjf210, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/26/2010 10:31:14 AM	I really can't believe how well this medication has worked. For years I have sweated (hyperhidrosis) to the extent I would have to carry around extra clothing, I clould never wear my hair down because even before I could get ready It would be DRIPPING wet! I would sweat outside in 25 degree weather.  I went through the hormone therapy, and every other test you could imaging until I saw an article in my local news paper and brought it to my doctor. He prescribed Robinul (Glycopyrrolate 2mg) and within 4 or 5 days I have had a big difference.  I started with 2 pills a day and with some uncomfortable days I figured out I only have to take 1/2 of a 2mg pill a day.I hope others can benefit from this medication.
Other	T, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	1/22/2010 11:47:45 PM	Wow. I have been taking this for 2 days and my life has changed. I have hyperhidrosis and i have seen a huge difference in my sweating. This is so surreal because just last week i was thinking about how this problem has ruined my entire life. I dont know who to thank, but i have constantly been thanking God for this. I have an iontophoresis device which did not work at all. I had purchased Robinul to apply to the water as a strategy for treatment but when that didnt work i just went ahead and swawllowed one out of frustration. 4 hours later i was noticed how i wasnt sweating circumstances i would ALWAYS sweat in. Amazing. If you have hyperhidrosis, this is it...period.
Other	HappyUser, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/18/2010 6:50:13 PM	I have been taking Robinul for close to 7 years and it has been a miracle drug for my hydrosis. It took me awhile to figure out the perfect dosage for me. I take exactly 6 1/2 1mg tablets first thing in the morning. This keeps my hydrosis in check all day and night. If I take more than that my mouth gets too dry. I tell my friends it doesn't totally make me stop sweating it just make me &quot;normal&quot; I take a generic version and it works just as well and is probably a lot cheaper. I would highly recommend this drug to anyone before they move to any more evasive procedures to fix their hydrosis.

At my husband's insistence, I spoke to my doctor about the problem and he was able to lower the dosage. At the time I was taking 2 mg. twice a day. Today, I take 1/2 of a 1mg tab. each day, and it works great (no vision problems either). I am so grateful for the makers of this God-send!

It has been very effective with reducing the sweating caused by hyperhydrosis.  She has had blurred vision at night, insomnia and increased nervousness at night.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Was your dosage reduced?  She currently is taking 1mg 4X a day.

Not a cure, but not nearly as invasive or dangerous as other solutions that aren't guaranteed to work. No side effects in my personal experience. My only real complaint is that it's very expensive!
