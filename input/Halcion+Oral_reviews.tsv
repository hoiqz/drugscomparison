Other	dd, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	9/17/2012 11:43:58 AM	I took 3 halcion to get 2 teeth extracted. I am terrified of dentists. I took the pils 30-60 min before I saw the dentist. I was disappointed because I expected to be a zombie. I could read and understand all the paperwork. I would have had anxiety through the roof had I not taken them. I came through the tooth extraction fine. In the future I might try Valium. I wanted to be very out of it.

My Doctor gave me a script of .25 Halcion. He said it would knock me out. Wrong, the first night took me forever to fall asleep. It now allows me some sleep, but I wake up every hour on the hour every single night. Haven't slept straight through the night in almost 4 years. I guess I just have to live with it.

The dentist gave me Halcion for anxiety.  WOW!  Best thing ever for dental anxiety.  You are mostly aware for the procedure and don't remember it afterwards.  &amp; hours or so you will not remember most things until someone talks about it and then you will remember it.  Excellent for dental procedures.  I can't say enough good about it.  
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	9/16/2011 4:07:49 PM	I was given Halcion (4-pills,along with 2 Valium-I don't know either mg's?) along wih my regular pain med's,before I had 3 teeth pulled.I asked several times if I was to take the drugs they gave me.along with my regular med's and I was told by the dentists wife/office manager to &quot;yes-take all.&quot; Almost immediately I was completely incoherent,and I do no remember ANYTHING for at least 9-hrs, and I slept (or was out of it) for 12-hrs.!When my husband got me into our car to drive me to the dentist office-they had to come out with a wheel chair to take me in their office, and they let me leave their office in the same condition! When we got home-my husand had to sit with me,in the garage, for 4-hrs before he could wake me up enough to help me out of the car and into our house. I would NEVER recommend anyone take this drug-but especially anyone that also takes other pan med's!!!!!

I would sleep 2-3 hours before waking up, and couldn't get back to sleep. What was amazing was that I could break the pill into quarters, and one-quarter of a pill would let me sleep an additional 3-4 hours. I have experienced no side effects after approx 7 years of using this medication.

I only use it when my brain won't stop chattering, about 2-3 times a month. After 2 hours of trying to sleep, I take one or 1/2 one and get the sleep I need, but can wake up and go right back to sleep.

I didn't do anything!!  I ended up increasing the dosage throughout the first week to 2 pills a night and I still didn't fall asleep...just laid there all night.  It didn't do anything.  I even wondered if it was a placebo.  My doc and pharmacist assured me it wasn't.  Oh well, back to ambien.  Heck benydril works 10x's better than halcion.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	dottie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	4/8/2010 4:12:56 PM	At the age of 90 my mother admitted to me she was addited to the drug Halcion for 13 years. She was not sleeping any more with this drug and could not get off of it. Because of HEPPA - her pharmacist could not tell me - so my mother suffered greatly.  No one helped her.  By the time I helped her become drug free she had other issues and died 2 months later.  But what I now understand is that although Halcion is outlawed in some countries, it is given out like candy here. UNDERSTAND THIS.  THIS IS AN ADDICTIVE DRUG.  YOU MIGHT SLEEP NOW, BUT NOT FOREVER.  AND WHEN IT'S ATTRIBUTES WEAR OFF - YOU WILL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN.  Please look for natural ways to fall asleep and stay away from this drug.  The addiction is horrible.

I have tried all &quot;sleep medication&quot; with having the opposite effect on me. Ie, Ambien gave me so much energy I cleaned all night. I have taken this medication now for about 4 months unfortunately I have had to increase it 2 times now but it def works. Because my body got used to it so quikly my DR is going to now change it to a similar drug for a few months and then use this again when/if I get used to the other. I would def suggest it to anyone who has SEVERE insomnia.
Other	CreepedOutWife, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	2/4/2010 5:54:55 PM	The dentist gave this drug to my husband prior to his appt.  He took one before bed and one in the morning.  About a half an hour after taking the 2nd dose, it was time to leave.  My husband could not tie his own shoes.  He was trying but couldn't make his hands coordinate to tie them.  He then almost fell down our front steps.  I got him into the car and had to buckle his seat belt.  When we got to the dentist he did not want my help.  (The Halcion actually made him a bit belligerent.)  He started up the 5 stairs to the dentist's office and after one step fell flat on his face and never even attempted to put his hands out to brace himself. Luckily he only banged his elbow a bit. He was supposed to take another pill when he got to the office and I made sure they knew he should not.  He came home and slept for 5 hours and awoke with a headache.  He doesn't think the drug was that bad but the dental hygenist told me about the amnesia affect this drug has so I don't think he really remembers it all.  As a matter of fact, I know he doesn't because when I tell him about his morning he doesn't remember what I'm talking about.  I hope he doesn't ever feel compelled to take it again.  It was tough to watch. 
Other	Lisa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/17/2010 8:36:09 PM	I have taken Halcion the last three times I had dental work done due to the fact that local anesthesia does not work for me. It has no effect. I was prescribed one .25 mg pill half an hour before my appt and then once I was there, they would decide if I needed another which I did each time. It reminds me of what others has told me about being so drunk you can only remember bits and pieces of what you were doing. My husband has taken me home right after and I have slept the rest of the day. The next morning feeling just fine. Do not go anywhere or try to function on this drug. My kids told me some funny things I did while on them and can't remember afterwards, however I'm so thankful to have something that will keep me from the horrible pain of dental work. Dentists in the past have had me go through it feeling the whole thing.

It is our responsibility to look up info before taking. Had major dental work adivan made me irritated. Horrible  experience. He gave me Halcion for 2nd go around. Didn't remember much thankfully. He gave me 2 .25mg (slept the whole time no memory) which was fine for me but could be 1 too much for someone else. Always have someone drive and be  with you for the day. Each person is different so err on the side of caution. Personally my drug of choice for dental from here on out.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	REMParalyzed, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	19-24	9/25/2009 8:05:33 PM	I'm probably the only one here for whom triazolam worsened his insomnia (in ways)... although it'd knock me out just fine, within 2 hours, I'd wake up partially and have parasomnias (i.e. abnormal sleep -- this includes sleep paralysis, open-eye hallucinations, and other not-fun stuff).  I would also have extremely vivid dreams (occasionally nightmares). My liver and kidneys run through drugs like nobody's business, so maybe I just temporarily experienced the positive effects of the stuff and suffered withdrawal early in the night.  I cannot give this drug a good rating, but it's just possible that my body and brain are unique and don't like the stuff, making me biased.

I can sometimes IF I AM LUCKY get 3 hours sleep if the medication knocks me out enough but then the next day I am hung over and tired and cranky along with hurting. Yesterday my doctor reluticlantly prescribed Halcion for me.... OH MY I slept soooo good last night for the first time in years and this morning I feel great!  Revived and well rested, if my doctor tries to take this medication away from me I just dont know what I will do!  It REALLY worked that good for me.  I think I can finally sleep again!! WOW
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	4/1/2009 5:37:09 PM	I've had sleep problems for 14 years.  Avoided prescrip. drugs for years then finally tried: diazepam, rhohypnol, Ambien CR, Lunesta, Trazodone, Elavil.  Rhohypnol (aka the date drug) was marvelously and 100% effective but brought about some changes in thought patterns so I quit after a few months.  I've been taking .25 mg of Halcion for 3 nights and still wake up in the night but less and easier to get back to sleep. I think I will stick with Halcion because even though I don't get a full night's sleep, it calms my mind, doesn't give me weird dreams and doesn't leave me groggy in the morning.

My weapon of choice in the sleep war is Remeron. It poops out rather quickly, however. When my Dr. recd the Halcion,. I was excited at the prospect of 7 or 8 hours of sleep. My jets were cooled around 6 Am, when I woke up after a paltry 6 hrs. Better than nothing, but about the same I I would expect on Xanax. I am not a fan. I feel like I'm losing my mind, the morning after. I feel ragged out and very nervous; much like trying to sneak back in the house after doing coke with strippers all night. This sucks...

I WAS UNCONSCIOUS ABT. 10 MINUTES AFTER TAKING THE PILLS (0.25MG EACH) I LATER ON FELL WHILE TRYING IN MY SLEEP TO GET OUT OF THE CAR, DAMAGED MY FACE, NEEDED WOUND CLOSING, SPRAINED MY WRISTS AND LANDED IN THE HOSPITAL WHERE I DID NOT REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS UNTIL AFTER 4PM. I GOT TO THE DENTIST'S PARKING LOT BEFORE 9AM. I ALSO HURT MY KNEE WHICH WAS OPERATED ON BEFORE, AND NOW NEED MORE AND MORE THERAPY AND DOCTOR VISITS. THE DENTIST'S WIFE WHO SEEMS TO RUN THE OFFICE TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS ALL LAUGHABLE, THAT THEY GIVE THE SAME DOSE TO EVERYBODY (O.5MG). I NEVER HAD TO READ OR SIGN ANYTHING - THE DENTIST AND WIFE WERE OUT OF TOWN ON THE DAY OF THE CLEANING. I AM HAVING MULTIPLE SIDE EFFECTS SINCE THIS EPISODE. SWELLING , HORRIBLE SKIN ITCHING, SHORT TERM MEMORY TROUBLE, MOMENTARY DIZZINESS ETC.I DID NOT YET FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF MANY WHO TOLD ME TO SUE, BUT I DO WISH TO NOT HAVE THIS HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT I SHOULD DO TO PREVENT THIS?I AM A VERY HEALTHY 77 YEAR OLD WOMAN, WAS ALWAYS VERY ACTIVE, TOOK NO MEDICATIONS WHATSOEVER, AND WAS NEVER AFRAID OF A DENTAL PROCEDURE. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN -- INCIDENTALLY, AFTER THIS HAPPENED, THE DENTAL OFFICE (WIFE) HAD SOME FORMS DRAWN UP FOR ME TO SIGN (AFTER THE FACT). I NEVER RETURNED THEM, AND ALSO DID NO LONGER GO TO THIS DENTIST (A HIGHLY CREDENTIALED ONE). I INCURRED GREAT EXPENSE AND HAD TO HIRE HELP ETC. I DO HOPE THEY DON'T GIVE THIS DOSAGE TO OTHER PATIENTS WITHOUT WARNING OR CAUTION. I AM STILL SUFFERING FROM THE AFTEREFFECTS.

Just do not take too much.  I only need .25mg most of the time and sometimes only .125mg per night.  By the way this drug is not intended for daytime use for any reason, it is intended for sleep only.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Tracy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/14/2008 2:19:42 PM	I'm a 40 year old female that has had chronic insomnia since age 14. Tried many other meds before this. After less than a week I've had fantastic sleep each night, even being able to fall back asleep after waking for the bathroom, dog walking over me, etc. I've had minor drowsiness in the morning (after6-8 hrs sleep), but definitely not as much as I've had when I'm struggling to fall asleep all night. I will gladly continue to use this as needed without using it every night so my body doesn't get too used to it.

The dentist put me in her car basically unconscious and she had to manage to get me into her house.  I was not awake good at 7 pm but drove home at 8pm because I had dogs to let out.  I got violently ill, couldn't work the next day due to confusion and aggitation.  Don't take this drug.

I slept WONDERFULLY both the night before and the day of surgery. I wish I'd had this before rather than Sodium Seconal (twilight anesthesia)!

She not only cannot remember me practically carrying her into the dr.'s office but 8 hours later still cannot function. She will not be taking the other pill prescribed for tonight.

Slept through the night, and was fine the next morning.  I have used it off and on for 4 months with no side effects.
