The only side effect I have noticed is I get a headache for about 30 minutes after use each use.

I have not experience swelling or discoloration like others have.  I also have dark eyes too, so I don't know if that makes a different. It took about 6 weeks for me to notice longer lashes. Without mascara, you can see the difference in my lashes and with mascara, the lashes look amazingly long. TIP: buy an eyeliner brush and use that as the applicator.  You use less solution and you fully coat the area you need to.  The applicators that come with latisse are too thick and one drop is not enough.
Increased Number of Eyelashes	angelical, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/1/2010 1:45:32 PM	I've only been using Latisse for 2 weeks, but I can see new lashes coming in and my 'older' lashes are getting stronger! I have GREAT TIPS; I use 2 eyeliner brushes, one labeled Left, the other labeled Right. I clean them with Dial soap before use to sanitize and because they are so small, I only use one drop of Latisse for BOTH eyes!Place that one drop in lid and dip brushes in. Another tip my Dr told me is after 3 months of use, I should use Latisse every 3-4 nights to maintain! This means 1 bottle will last me 3-4 months, thus saving me a TON of money;) That's always nice!!! Good luck! Be consistent!

I now only use it every other night.  It did cause discoloration on my eyelid, it just looks like I have a little eye make up on.  Someone told me a good tip.  Put the drop in the lid of the bottle and dip the brush in-then you don't waste any. I have experienced some blurry vision, it seems to come and go.  This definitely does what it says it will.
Increased Number of Eyelashes	nana s, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/9/2010 12:57:53 AM	I had to stop using Latisse after 6 days because my eyelids were so swollen, red and itchy.  The Dr. said to wait a week or so and try again.  I did as instructed but had the same reaction again.  I must be allergic to some of the ingredients.
Increased Number of Eyelashes	Kaye, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/5/2010 2:02:21 AM	I started using Latisse and after the first day my eyelids starting itching and swelling.  I continued to use it for 6 days and my eyes were very red and swollen.  I had severe itching and had to use cold packs to help relieve the discomfort and swelling.  I called my Derm. and she said to discontinue use for a week and then resume using it again.  I did as she suggested and once again, the redness, swelling and itching returned.  I will not use it again.  I paid $200.00 for 2 vials. Unfortunately it turned out to be a big, expensive disappointment for me.

I'm so excited to see how long they get!

This was fantastic in that they grew out and became lovely and long and curly but NOT dark.  I'm no long blond.  I've used it for the full 4 months and am not sure how to taper off so that I maintain them.  Any info would be heplful.

Thrilled to have the long eyelashes I had as a girl back again. However - it also makes dark hair grow on my face, around the lower orbital rim. I don't look like Bluebeard or anything - this is short, very fine hair that is easily bleached. Well worth the tradeoff IMO. I'm olive-skinned and rather hairy anyway, so maybe that's it :)

After the first two months I saw some improvements, nothing to bat an eye at but it has been almost three and a half months and my lashes look pretty much the same.

I use a tiny clean paintbrush instead.I have inverted eylashes and my eye doctor was pulling 4-5 out every 5 weeks because they were scratching my eye. I have been using Latisse for only 3 weeks and I have not had an inverted eyelash yet, and it has been 5 weeks since he pulled 5 out. My lashes are a bit longer, but even better they are stronger.... no fear of losing lashes when I use the eyelash curler ! My eyelids were a little red for the first few days but they are back to normal now. So far a win,win situation for me.
