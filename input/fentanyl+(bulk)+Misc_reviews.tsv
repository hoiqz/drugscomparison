Other	65-74 Female  (Caregiver) 	3	2	4	Female	65-74	9/16/2012 6:57:00 PM	Effective for pain relief for limited time. My relief wanes before period of use ends (3 days). I do not use every 3 days, so there is no relief between uses. Only use when pain is unbearable (recommended by physician). Have arthritis, so I sometimes need help to manage application of patch (somewhat clumsy to use).

Other	silvertop77, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/26/2012 5:39:50 PM	The fentanyl patch was given to me as my main source of relief but used another medication for break through pain..After reading some of the reviews I hope this little bit of info. may help those of you that are having problems keeping the patch on.  If you look on the side of the box you medication comes in, there will be a toll free # you can call, they were very professional &amp; knowledeable on this medication &amp; they will send you sheets of what looks like clear saran wrap and this sticks over your fentanyl patch because you make it about an inch larger on all four sides and it has much stronger adhesive than the patch does. It will not come off in the shower, while sweating, etc.  As far as another reviewer ask about adding a second patch.  I am not a physician by no means, but this is a very strong narcotic and I would not think it to be safe at all to just take it upon ones self without contacting your physician.  You could be putting yourself in grave danger.  If you have just started using them, maybe your body just needs to get regulated to the dose you are on and if it still is not helping your pain, talkn with your physician.  please do not add another patch without your Doctor's permission.  I have been on nearly every narcotic pain medication there is in the past 25 yrs.  Fentanyl is a wonderful help, although I no longer use it for other medical reasons, I would not hesitate if need be to go back to using the fentanyl patch.  No taking pills every 4 hrs. was a great advantage for me.  Hope this helps someone or every one

I have been trying to control pain for 5-6 years now.  I'v ebeen all of them, including 80mg Oxycontin with 5-10mg for breakthrough.  Now, after 4 years off Oxycontin, I've been needing 6-8 5mg ocycodone/day (about 120 pills /3 weeks).  My doc put me on 25mcg Fentanyl 2 weeks ago and I can't remember feeling better.  I am having NO side effects and have no problems with adhesion.  Doc tells me I can use Oxycodone also, when needed.  After years of pain rating 7-9, I am currently at about 1-2 (usually) without any pills.  Also, I would be VERY concerned about a doc. cold-turkeying anyone from this drug.  It is an opioid and sudden stopping can lead to withdrawal symptoms, which can be deadly.
Other	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	4	5	Male	55-64	1/18/2012 7:32:05 PM	I am 57 years old with lower back and hip issues.I have taken the oxycette,oxycotin trip with only having to increase doses to dangerous levels by myself because of the pain that the doctors can`t feel themselves so when i heard of fentanyl patches i asked to try it and behold, almost a immediate improvement to about 75% pain free.Because i`m a large individual 270 lbs,6`-4&quot; i needed to gradually increase patche doses from 50mg patches slowly under the doctors supervision to 200mg[2x100mg] where the pain decreased enough to be bearable with just the two 100mg patches and no more other pain pills.Instead of changing patches every 3 days i found every 2 days had better effect since pain began to increase after the second day.The few draw backs are some crazy nightmares and constipation.Typical day at work for some. 
Other	DLinFL, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	1/2/2012 3:38:46 AM	I have been using Fentanyl for DDD for 5 or 6 years now. Before using this med I could barely walk. It relieves 50-75% of my pain and I don't take any oral meds (except for OTCs) but I do have to change the patch every 2 days instead of 3 because of my metabolism. Dr. tried to increase the dose a while back and higher dose gave me severe migraine headaches so I am at the max I can use now. As with any strong narcotic meds, there are drawbacks. Because I have been using it for so long I do have severe withdrawals when I forget to change my patch on time and it starts to wear off. I have constant dry mouth and eyes and problems with constipation but it's better than feeling like my spine is in a vise and not being able to walk. I have no trouble with the patches staying in place (I wear them on my lower abdomen) but I do prefer using certain brands because they are smaller and I do get some mild skin irritation. The best benefit is not having to take oral meds and going through the ups and downs and 'high' feelings they cause. I just stick a patch, (remember to change it on time!), drink lots of water and use eye drops. I have been able to prolong fusion surgery with the use of Fentanyl and that is the best thing about it! I would highly recommend this med to any one suffering from chronic pain over using addictive oral meds.
Other	Nomadic , 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	35-44	11/28/2011 10:22:55 PM	For those who have a problem with it peeling off... I used &quot;Tegaderm dressing&quot;. They are a large 10.2cmx 12.7cm transparent dressing that you put over the entire patch. You can get them at CVS or probably any medical supply store. I actually got them wet in the shower a few times with no problem.The medication itself would work great for about 2 days; but it would become rapidly ineffective around the 8hr window before replacing it. So it became a roller-coaster. It just wasn't for me.

I take it for basically nerve damage and being in pain every day of my life. I have too many spine issues to list so would rather not. My last one I had was a yr. ago and it was my fourth. This drug has been a life saver but also one in which I gave alot of thought before I started it.  I was on 25mcg not for very long because in a short time it started not working very well as in length of time not effectiveness.  I went to 50mcg which in my case was a huge improvement and then he decided it was ok to change it every 2 days after speaking to my doctor of course. For some reason my body metabolizes it differently than most. I am so happy that this plan has been successful for me but I do want to say it was a long road to get there and very very difficult to be where I need to be BUT FINALLY I HAVE ARRIVED AND THAT IS SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE!

Just as every one else who has reviewed this medication, I have problems with it staying on the whole 3 days.  I use a 50mg patch along with 15mg oxycodone @ 8/day.  I also wear the 5mg lidoderm patches at night, which help me sleep.  I have had cortisone shots, steroid injections and spinal fusion surgery on the L5, S1 disc.  Nothing has helped with the pain like the patches with the pain meds.  I do have a burning itching sensation @ the location of the patch but I will take that any day over the intense tormenting pain that I have been dealing with for the past year.  Good luck to all chronic pain patients!              Finally 75% pain free,                Shawn &quot;KC&quot; Farmer

I have been through the medication roller coaster and accidentally overdosed, passed out and woke up in the hospital. I was detoxed off oxycontin 80mg, 2X a day and dilaudid, 40mg as needed. My doctor detoxed me with the use of the fentanyl. I tried Lyrica and it had some nasty side effects and I took myself off it and had and am still having nasty withdrawal symptoms. The ER doctor put me back on the fentanyl patch and the only sides so far are sleeplessness, and very vivid nightmares, but I'll take the nightmares and the sleeplessness over any other drug that I have tried. This has been a Godsend for me. I can function again. Also no &quot;highs&quot; as with other opioids.

That not all my issues but other are easier to handle. I had injections in my lower back on my spine prior to taking this medican. I'm on 25mcg yet only lasts 2of3days &amp;dr won't go up 2higher dose havent had any weird issues&amp; sticks pretty well-being as long as it gets placed right the first time and my hair doesnt get caught under it.  I place it on upper back just under shoulder blades ( braline area). When I first started it worked pretty good but after I think 4months I only got 2days relief B4 it wasn't working all that great.Prior to the patch my doc hade me on methodone which did nothing except not allow me to go to the bathroom and then I was placed on morphine( not together)  which just made me sick 5 minutes after I took it neither worked, the patch works i just think that my dose is off-line a bit. So Im thinking I maybe a good canident for medical marijuhna but most Va docs say no-no to that. Sorry for misspellings. Hope this helped some. Ill be waiting for my doctor will up my dose soon.25mcg is not strong enough for me but not any two people are alike .

If you prefer the thinner patches, try purchasing TegaDerm.  It is a self sticking &quot;saran wrap&quot;.  Altho, the TegaDerm is great, it does need help so it don't &quot;roll&quot; off and stick to your clothing.  I used the fabric medical tape in thin strips to keep it in place.  After using this for almost 6 months, I have gone from the lowest dose to almost 100mcg.  I find myself sleeping 12-17 hours a day, falling asleep while driving, my pain is not controlled in either my back or feet.  I have degenerative disk disease from T4 down, Kissing bone spurs at T8-T10, and arthritis in back and feet to the point if I stand still for more than 2 minutes, my feet are screaming.

Unable to stand or participate in vigerous activities without 7-10 pain for 2 days or so. Epiderals ineffective for more than a few weeks. Fentanyl patch 25mg every 3 days. pain relief at least half, however the itching has become crazed, rash and sores, benadryl hardly effective-muscle rub however decreases the itching and calms that horid gnawing feeling in my R thigh and restless feet/leg. Please beware and stand up for yourselves, because the ping pong effect depresses you, the doctos each have their own opinion for treatments and rarely are they the same opinion, they can make you feel as if you have been doing something stupid the whole time  and all we do is follow orders until they ping pong you again to another doctor for his opinion.I am now up for fusion above and below to include L4 L5. One swears by  it, one would never do such a thing, one wants to know why it hasn't already been done and one says it's not necessary YET!! and they have me off the patch which did so much for neuro pain, off vicodin which killed 70% of pain- only the sciatic pain nothing touches and being in chemical induced sleep is not being pain free. Rolling over is horrendous.The patch Fentanyl, good for pain , but monitor the side effects like my skin, I have red raised areas you can count back a month or so ea 3 days, and the itching horrid rashes, hard to tell if you want to be pain relieved or rash/itching relieved??Careful Folks the glass if half full but of what?????

Also had same trouble with sticking and found that even my hair cond. would mess the patch up. After your shower regimine wash the patch area again with soap and do not apply lotion or anything before you put your patch on.Plus different brands stick better than others.Before surgery the patch did allow me to get up in the a.m., but, I am so glad I stopped it and no more burn holes in my carpet,pillows,me,etc.I weaned myself off the patch slowly and carefully adding an extra day on the first patch then 2 extra days with 2nd patch, etc. The medicine slowly decreases and I didn't have any withdrawel.This was with a 50mcg patch.Maybe 4 yrs was just too long and it increased the chances of side effects.If you start having weird things happen often make your doctor listen and take you seriously. I could have saved alot of clothes,couch pillows,carpet from burns,spilling strawberry punch and pretty much anything else I tried to keep ahold of.

The only complaint that I have is that the patches DO NOT adhere to the skin very well at all.I have searched EVERYWHERE for some sort of tape or clear covering to go over the Fentanyl patches to keep them in place.  (In my situation I have to use two patches to deliver the required medication I need).I have, however, come up with one solution to help keep the patches on.  Take an ordinary piece of Saran wrap or kitchen wrap and cut to size to cover the patches.  Then place the Saran Wrap over patches and use surgical tape to keep in place.This will allow you to see through the Saran Wrap and keep an eye on the patches to make sure they are sticking AND you can see the date that you write on the patches so you will be aware of when to change the patches.I hope this helps someone, and if anyone has any ideas whatsoever as to a good covering I would love to read about it on this reviewer board.Thanks and good luck to you all.

I was given a patch that lasted for 72 hours.  I normally take other pain meds for the pain but, I am always so tired and not really able to get anything accomplished in my day.  It was great.  I was actually able to get up out of bed and enjoy my days that I was on this medication.  It was a great change that I welcomed.

It could not be repaired surgically.  In addition I was taking oxycodone (10/325) every four hours. The patches didn't work at first. So they increased from 25 to 50 to 100. I was on them for about four weeks. When I went to get them refilled I could not afford the 275.00 and my insurance wouldn't cover it. So I had to quit cold turkey.  I could not tell any difference in the pain relief.  I did not have any withdrawal symptoms.  I really can't say if they worked or not. I guess if you are on them for something other then a severe bone shattering then they might be effective.

I WAS OUT OF TOWN AWAY FROM MY MD AND WAS RUNNING OUT WHEN I REALIZED I HAD NO LIFE SO I GRADUALLY WENT OFF THE PATCH.  I HAVE GONE THROUGH SYMPTOMS THAT I WOULD NOT WISH ON ANYONE. I AM STILL GETTING OVER IT AFTER A MONTH. THIS MAY BE THE PERFECT PAIN RELIEVER FOR A DYING PERSON BUT NOT FOR A BACK INJURY.
