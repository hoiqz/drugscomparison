My blood pressure has been up and down.She told me to keep a chart of my blood pressure and bring it along with my blood pressure machine in with me on my next appointment. At this time she will decide what to do.

High Blood Pressure	el, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/19/2010 8:09:55 PM	Been on Atacand HCT for over 5 years and has controlled my bp 120/80. Had to switch to Hyzaar due to insurance company switch and it's not on their preferred drug list. Atacand is very pricey but may be worth the high cost. Hyzaar appears to be a problem for me (joint pain)and since i have RA, the joint pain is much more pronounced!Will have to switch back to Atacand.

It has been so effective that I have not gone to anything generic (Atacand does not have a generic yet), even with no insurance and paying $90.+ for a month supply. No side effects.  It's great.

High Blood Pressure	Lou, 75 or over Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		1/27/2010 5:03:14 PM	This has been a very effective drug for my blood pressure, but the cost is prohibitive on  us being retired, the cost of $270.94 for a 90 day supply is much higher than we can afford. Is there another medication which will be as effective?

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/28/2008 1:48:37 PM	This is only the 2nd medication I have taken for high blood pressure. I started on the Atacand only and switched to Atacand/HCT. After one day of slight drowsiness, I have felt NO complication or unusual effects other than a consistent 120/80 BP. This is an amazing drug-no nitceable bad effects and has not impaired sexual performance as other BP meds do. Strongly recommend (I am in my mid 40s).

I do have some light headed feeling but I don't know what it is related to since I also take some other meds.
