My surgery was just two weeks ago. They did a Hystorectomy and of course removed my ovaries and left the cervix. Dr says it would help with the control of my bladder and sex life to leave the cervix since I've never had a abnormal pap. During my two check or post op appt: Dr found bacteria in my urine and I've exsperianced iching and some incontenance when I sneeze so he put me on Clindimyicine and Premarin for hot flashes and for lack of sleep. I really don't know if this is the right prescription for me. I never wanted both of my ovaries to be taken because of this dive straight into mens anyway, but he said I had cyst on them and I know I had a large Fibroid at the top of my uterus thus the surgery. Is there something else I can try instead of the premarin for I don't want dependency on this drug for the rest of my life.  Thank you, Miss Concerned

I had hot flashes within days, couldn't sleep. I have gained about 20 lbs, I stopped taking it due to the weight gain, symptoms returned within a few days. I started taking meds again, now find myself very depressed over the weight gain. Are all HRT meds going to cause weight gain? I went from 144 to 160 from June to present date. Have joined Weight Watchers &amp; going to invest in a treadmill, if weight loss doesn't occur I will stop meds.

Im 34, just had total hysterectomy, have been on premarin for 2 mnths now, and have started to notice things. I have little bumps all over my face that look like acne but isnt. Dont know if this is what they consider rash? (side effect)  Also out of the blue, I have had severe nasal congestion and chest congestion, to point it is hard to breathe and causes choking, like bronchitis (rare side effect) has any other women had these or am I just overreacting to nothing?

I tried a number of &quot;natural&quot; therapies with no success whatsoever. I finally went on to Premarin 0.6 with great success. I literally go my life back. I reduced down to 0.3 and was taking this comfortably for nearly 5 years. I tried recently to wean myself off premarin. I was back to severe night sweats and hot flushes again to the point of absolute misery. I have been back on 0.6 for a couple of days now and already I am almost symptom free. I have not suffered any real symptoms with this drug except hair thinning but I guess that happens with age anyway. I plan now to stay on this drug for as long as I need to despite the doctor warning me to get off it!

Then in 1983 I had a complete hysterectomy after being diagnosed with endometriosis.  I went on Premarin in 1983.  Then in 1988 I had a car wreck that paralyzed my left side.  My entire left side from my head to my foot still tingles all the time.  As long as I take the Premarin (I am now 64) the tingling is minimal.  I tried to stop taking the pill when I turned 60.  Within 4 days, my speech became slurred, my face drooped on the left side, my left foot dragged when I walked, and my shoulders and neck hurt terribly.  Within 24 hours of resuming the Premarin, the pain was gone, my speech was clear and I did not walk like a drunk.  I have asked a doctor, a pharmacist and a physical therapist why Premarin does this.  Not one could tell me any connection between the hormone and my weakness.  I only know I will take it forever!

However, 2 years on I felt very tired, my skin had gone very dry, my libido virtually nil!  I decided to see my doctor who prescribed me Premarin.  I have been taking this HRT therapy for 2 months now and I can honestly say it has transformed me.  My skin is a lot better, flushes have completely gone. Oh, and my dose is .625mg.  Ladies, the benefits of this product do outweigh the negatives.  So, if you are feeling lethargic, listless, experiencing flushes etc, I would recommend you give it a try! Good Luck

I often have really,really bad migraines ever since starting this medication. I have notices very tiny,to no change in moodiness,and the worst of everything, IS THE HOT FLASHES,that are still just as bad a s ever. In fact my bedroom air conditioner runs year round,24/7,and I live in upstate NY,where winters are frigged cold,but here I am,in 16 degree weather,sweating to death. I will no longer be taking this b\medication,instead opting for bio-identical hormones,I have heard only wonderful things about bio-identicals.I am now 28 years old,and had my total hyster 2 years ago,and obviously this has impacted my life severely.This medication does work well for me,and I do not like the side effects at all!

I tried getting off it by taking it every other day but my face broke out, and cleared up in a day or two after resuming taking it.For the past several months I've been cutting my pills in half (with my doctors permission) and taking them daily.  So far no mood swings or night sweats, but I feel too warm a lot of the time.  I've also gained weight but most of it in the past 10 years after taking an office position.  I'm now 71, retired and in very good health and probably just need more exercise.

At the age of 50 things changed for me. I had severe hot flashes and I felt like I glowed. I had trouble sleeping along with the headaches. I tried numerous other options, until my Dr. put me on premarin. I started on .03, but immediately needed a higher dose. Now I am on .45 dose. It took away the hot flashes and headaches and I sleep very well. I am over weight so I am dieting to lose weight, lost 4 pounds. It will be a battle for me, I hope premarin won't hinder me to lose weight, time will tell. I am concerned with all the news about HRT in general, but not enough to stop using premarin, it makes my life easier. I take my premarin early in the morning and by the next morning I need it or I have alittle break through hot flash, not enough to bother to get a higher dose. The only side effects I have are tingling in my feet and legs which I am watching. carefully.

I still have my ovaries.  At age 46 I began having hot flashes/mood swings/night sweats.  I tried to tough it out for 9 years.  The flashes became so severe I would cry at night.  My Dr put me on premarin in Dec 09 (.3 mg).  My flashes became much less severe and less frequent.  He increased me to 2 a day and my flashes pretty much went away.  Now they are starting back.  I've read where other women have been on this for 20 or 30 years.  I really don't want that to happen.  My late mother-in-law was on it for many year but quit taking it when she was 74 and her flashes and mood swings came back.  I think I can deal with them now better than when I'm in my 70's!!  I seriously considering quiting it and letting nature take it's natural course.  God give me strength!!

Dr has just increased my premarin to .625 dose. MY joints HURT! I hurt! This has been my only med change, so I think it is due to the doseage increase. I also just read that it can interact with my thyroid meds. I already have a low thyroid and am overweight. I'm lost. What is the normal length of time that this med is taken. Are there valid alternatives?

The sensitivity to sun exposure is not just awareness, it is unpleasant. Exaggerated intolerance to the heat is problematic for a gardener and outdoor enthusiast. Libido still wavers,issues of dry skin is not improved, and depression is still evident. Mood swings are less severe and emotions are more in check. I am ready to seek alternative symtom relief. I won't renew my script.

I started @ the highest dose after a partial hysterectomy due to fibroids and a 2nd surgery due to pelvic abcess infection which left one ovary non functioning and with a cyst. Over the years my gyn and I have had discussions and reduced my dosage over time (currently @ .625).  I tried to stop @ one point but the hot flashes, mood changes and inability to sleep drove me back.  I have had no problems. I do get little bumps that come and go. Also, the patchy skin showed alot this summer. I have not gained weight. I still weigh the same as when I was 18.  However, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and cholesterol problems after the birth of my son (pre-premarin).  I take blood pressure medicine also.  However, the Premarin has been a life-saver to me.  I cannot stand the hot flashes.  The sex drive has not changed for me.

It immediately eliminated the depression I felt following the surgery. Prior to the last 6 months I did not have any problems with it. Now, however, I am experiencing a skin problem involving individual tiny bumps which itch severely. They appear on my arms, hands and trunk areas. They itch when they first appear, subside and then begin itching again. My doctors can not determine what they are or what is causing them. I do have sensitive skin, but I am suspecting that I may have developed a reaction to Premarin since it is the only drug I take. Has anyone else experienced a similar reaction?

Although my labs are within &quot;normal&quot; range, I reported to my ob-gyn my symptoms which were determined to be perimenapausal(fuzzy thinking, night sweats, leg discomfort and increasing moodiness).  I take .3mg Premarin every other day.  THANK GOD FOR THIS MEDICATION!!!  I feel SOOOO much better. I've added a baby aspirin nightly due to increased risk of blood clots as result of taking medication.

I have reviewed all the negative reviews and press against this drug and my own dr told me that the report done on this indicating it caused cancers and heart attacks was the most flawed study he had ever reviewed. Premarin just keeps me on an even keel, no mood swings or anything and will continue to take this for as long as i can get a prescription for it. The only negative thing is the cost of it, and it is pretty pricey.

My physician started me off on Premarin 1.25 for about 2 years, then gradually lowered my dosage to .325.  Over the last 2 years, I have noted a great deal of hair loss.  My hair has thinned considerably.  Until this year, I had no issues with sleeping, night sweats, or muscle cramps.  Now, I am experiencing foot cramps when walking, sitting, or sleeping (they wake me up). About weight gain - I did gain 20 pounds and was able to lose the weight after joining Weight Watchers.  It took me 8 months to lose 17 pounds and it was not easy to lose it.  But it can be done.

But in 2002 I started taking Premarin and it has helped so much with the night sweats, hot flashes and improves my energy level tremedously. It also seems to relieve the vaginal dryness issues as well. I do experience leg pain from time to time, but found eating a banana (for the potassium) relieves this pain.  I did stop the use of the drug for a time, because of some of the reports; but found I feel better on it.

I am taking .625 and I am still having night sweats about 3-4 nights per week and sometimes during the day.  Although this may be just the summer in the deep south.  However, my mood swings are GONE, which I had prior to having my hysterectomy.  My sexual drive has decreased compared to what it was before my hysterectomy and Premarin.  Any Suggestion from anyone would be greatly appreciated.

Less than a year later, I had to have my ovary removed because I had developed a tumor in my ovary.  Before my surgery, my ovary stopped functioning.  I had hot flashes, night sweats, and fatigue.  I have only been on premarin for 2 weeks, but I immediately felt the results.  No hot flashes, no night sweats, and no fatigue.  As a mother of 4, with a full time job, this medication was a God send.  I have had a few side effects, such as leg pain and headaches, but over the counter pain meds and a heating pad help.  I am willing to deal with sore legs and headaches if it means I have the energy to care for my children.  I am not concerned with weight gain as this medications seems to have deminished my appetite, and I hit the ground running at 5:00 am everyday.  As far as the more serious health concerns, I am fairly young and no longer have any female organs, so they seem to be non-issues at this time.

I have always had problems with my period, either being irregular or very painful and a lot of clots, since as far back as I can remember. My OB started me on Premarin while I was still in the hospital, however I got very ill after returning home and had to go without the pills for a week. It was a very miserable week, I had horrible hot flashes, night sweats, headaches, etc. I could not imagine having to be going through this with out the Premarin. My OB said for someone my age the advantages of taking a estrogen only pill far out way the risks. Since I have no female reproductive organs left I do not have to worry about the increase risk of cancer and for my age that is really the only risk. She said I will probably have to take it until I am around 50 years old then I can reasses. I started out taking .625mg per day, in June of 08 I recentaly went up to 1.25 mg per day due to increasing hot flashes, headaches and discharge. I have gained quite a bit of weight but I dont know if it was from this or the Lyrica that I was put on at the same time.

I have had numerous bouts with cysts (benign) and recently had a gall bladder attack with my gall bladder being removed w/gall stones included, I now have spasms in my upper stomach, some blurred vision and increased loss of vision, minute loss of hearing, but none of which are caused by this medication at least it was never mentioned at the time of any of my diagnoses. I am 53 years old and my doctor loves to prescribe medication. He feels the quality of life is more significant than the quanity and with a sufficient amount of drugs you can be pain-free for the less time you have to live. I disagree and sometimes do not take my medicines as instructed because I seem to have a new pain every week and I am already taking 4 different medications daily. All of this said, by the information printed above, some of my problems could have stemmed from this medication.

My Dr thought it could help my deppression and it did.  I haven't dared go off it but my Dr now is recommending that I do. I am so much older now that I am afraid of how my body will respond to not having it.

Gradually my hair thinned - which I could live with if necessary - but when I developed a goatee my husband envied (and which involved shaving twice a day) and extremely sore, hard breasts (especially the nipples which couldn't be touched without pain), I convinced my doctor to put me on Premarin again.  Within 3 days my breast symptoms disappeared although the beard is still there (but seems to be getting less).  The Estradiol was costing me $33 for 3 month's supply; the Premarin is $135 but I don't care if it takes care of my symptoms.

I was first given Estrace and got a mustaches. At some point I started on Premarin and Prempro. A pharmacist told me Provera made his wife &quot;mean. The Provera just didn't &quot;feel right&quot; to me. I am OCD about how I feel. Always searching for symptoms when I take a vitamin or a prescription. Then I started reading negatives about Provera and stopped it and have been on just Premarin for decades. Provera is &quot;poison&quot; said one prominent physician and author of many popular books. I don't want to poison myself so I just take Premarin. Sure, I may be rolling the dice; but I feel well rested and relaxed while doing so. Never stop taking Premarin suddenly. You have to wean off it. I tried in 1988 stopping it and I felt like committing murder. So I re-started it and will continue as long as I can get my wrinkled old hands on it.

Started have night sweats, hot flashes and severe mood swings.  Started taking .625mg and immediately all symptoms disappeared.  Dr. said that the hysterectomy should not have caused premature menopause, but had no trouble before. I have been able to loose weight also.

BUT i have put on 20 lbs and am very upset about it. I eat right and exercise regularly, nothing is working.

I was unable to sleep at night due to night sweats and insomnia and now am sleeping so much better.  The hot flashes have subsided almost completely after only about three weeks of HRT.  It has been a miracle for me.

After my hysterectomy, I had awful hot flashes all day and night.  As a result, I was awakened about 12 to 14 times a night and was unable to sleep.  I was completely exhausted.  This drug has allowed my life to get back to normal.  It has eliminated all hot flashes and I sleep all night again.  I am currently taking .625 and, because of all the controversy with HRT, on my next doctor visit, I think I will try the lower dose.

Premarin stopped the hot flashes, weakness, sweating, shaking, &amp; exhaustion within 2 days.  Have taken it for 20 years with no problems.  Because of health scares, tried to lower dose to .625 but got severe symptoms again &amp; returned to .9  Health scare bugs my doctor, she says she gets conflicting reports constantly &amp; just lets me choose whether I want to stay on it. I look really young still, dont know if the years of estrogen have anything to do with it.

Recently I started to experience shortness of breath and an irregular heartbeat.  I am worried that it has to do with taking premarin.  I just refilled my monthly prescription, but, am seriously thinking of not taking it anymore.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to stop night sweats in a different, less risky manner?  Thanks!

On the downside, it increased my appetite and gives me a feeling of ovulating all month long.  I have returned to monthly periods on this drug, while without it I had periods about every 3 months.
