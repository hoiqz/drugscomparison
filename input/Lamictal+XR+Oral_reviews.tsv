I haven't had ANY episodes since the start of the medication.  I take 100mg 1x day, but I did have to start taking it at night as it made me drowsy... I take it with 50mg of benadryl at night and sleep better than I have in years.
Convulsive Seizures	seizing_beauty, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	1/17/2012 9:50:28 PM	200 mg daily with 300 mg topiramate daily for grand mal seizures; the topiramate seems to be controlling the seizures more than the Lamictal XR. Some side effects; main ones are major loss of coordination, some memory problems, achy muscles, loss of appetite, and hair loss. Otherwise, it isn't that bad of a medication, but is costly if you don't have prescription insurance.
Other	Cazzandra, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	45-54	10/5/2011 1:55:20 PM	I have seizures due to MS.  Lesion on the wrong part of the brain kinda thing.   I've been on this drug only 9 days and can't truly speak to it's total effectiveness but - wow.   I still have seizures but not nearly as many therefore no new fractures.  This drug DOES give me a boost of energy.   I am wired for sound 15 minutes after taking it and it lasts about 10 hours.   Pretty good boon for an MS patient.   It does make me dizzier and a bit ditzier but I'll take that.

Before I always dreaded the next morning because I didn't know how I would be feeling. Now I can predict my moods because they don't change so fast.

I had some problems at the beginning, but I have trouble starting every drug I've ever used.  It's worked really well w/ my seizures.  I get some occasional dizziness and dehydration, which may actually be from the topamax. 
Bipolar Depression	rsoxforever,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female		3/4/2011 9:24:00 PM	taking for bipolar 2, hypomania, interfering with bulimia trtmt. before this, i was manic and crashing several times a day, almost failing out of school, couldnt focus, resorted to behaviors such as b/p, shoplifting, cutting, etc to control my mood. after 2ish wks on this, felt much more stable and NORMAL- not acting like a nutcase and then having self-esteem crashes that make functioning impossible. im going thru a very stressful period right now i think that has triggered some of the problems ive been having with more manic symptoms, but its much better than it has been and im so glad i got over my fear of psychotropic meds. no weight gain, no hair loss, no rash, and trust me these worried me because im bulimic and by definition very vain and irrational about these sorts of things.

I have had problems with headaches, grinding my teeth and blinking my eyes alot, kinda like a tick. Which causes joint and jaw pain. I am also having problems with my memory and getting worse everyday. I actually forgot how old I was today. I told someone I was 2 years younger than I am.

I have not had any since being on it. But makes me nauseous in the morning and a bad headache in the afternoon. The worst symptom is grinding my teeth and tensing the muscles in my head and face. This may explain the headaches. I noticed no one else has mentioned this. Am I the only one???

I was on regular Lamictal before for a few years, also with no seizures, but had waves of slight dizziness, which the XR has eliminated. The only potential problem I have with this drug is that my memory is getting to be terrible, heading toward dementia symptoms. The other day I had run out of my meds, and didn't take it until about lunchtime. I was so clear headed and able to remember a list of four things to get at the store! That was so cool! That is when I began to suspect this med may play into my symptoms. Has anyone else had this problem?

While at first I thought it was working after thte after about 1 and 1/2 month I have been covered with  a horrible rash with an ich that covered my body. I don't think it is really worth all this.
Simple Partial Seizures	stewdaniel, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	9/19/2010 6:23:07 PM	I have partial seizures. I was on Zonegran which made me severely depressed. I switched to Lamictal XR one tablet in am &amp; 2 @ bedtime. I had another seizure about two weeks ago. Dr.'s since then raised my Lamictal XR to 2 tabs in the am &amp; 2 tabs @ bedtime. We will see how that works. I am starting to get the smell AGAIN right before I have another seizure. No weight gain and no depression with this medication. Time will tell....

I also have bipolar amd post dramatic stress syndrom. They decided to kill two birds with one stone. It was working wonderful for me until the past 2 months I have had 2 seizures and my aggresion and irritabilty has gotten extemely worse. Now they have decided to put me on keppra for my seizures, but it has made me very drowzy. I quit smoking 2 months ago and this medication is making me crave ciggarettes.
Simple Partial Seizures	megs, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	5/5/2010 1:04:45 PM	I have temporal lobe epilepsy in my left temporal lobe and I suffer simple partial seizures.  I took Keppra for years and it worked wonders but turned my memory to mush.  My doctor recommended Lamictal.  Right now I take it along with my Keppra.  I don't particularly care for Lamictal, it makes me a little jumpy and it gives me a feeling of artificial happiness ( if that even makes sense).  I am a happy person.  My seizures are increasing as the Keppra is decreased and the Lamictal is increased.  I think I will stick with Keppra, eventhough my doctor thinks I should stick with the Lamictal.  I also have trouble finding the XR, and it takes my pharmacy  a week to get it.
Bipolar Depression	edie55, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/23/2010 2:48:22 AM	This drug is extremely useful for someone who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  As a former anoretic, I am worried about drugs for bipolar symptoms that might make me gain weight (many of them list this as a primary side effect).  I have not only not gained any weight, but this drug has helped me achieve a healthy, active lifestyle. In other words, this drug works.  I don't take anything else for a diagnosed anxiety disorder and/or possibly bipolar disorder (it runs in my family and I definitely show symptoms).  I would highly recommend this drug because it has few, if any, side effects. The only trouble is your doctor will have to start at a low dose because sometimes people have allergic/fatal recations.  So be patient!  While at first you may not notice a difference, if your body tolerates it, your doctor can gradually work up to a therapeutic dose. This drug helps tremendously!

Simple Partial Seizures	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	3/24/2010 8:30:35 PM	I experience complex partial seizures as a result of a non-malignant spot on my brain.  I started taking Lamictal XR and it was WONDERFUL for about the first 4 months.  Then all of a sudden my seizures came back with a vengeance.  I was having them several times a day.  My neurologist doubled my dosage.  That was about 4 months ago.  Since then my seizured happen about once a month.  I just don't want them to happen at all.  This is the only medication I've ever had for this condition so I don't know if this is good or not but I still get seizures so I'd say overall I'm not completely satisfied, but it has definitely made a tremendous difference.

I HAVE NEVER ITCHED SO MUCH IN MY LIFE. I HAD TO TAKE A ROUND OF PREDISONE TO GET BETTER.  I WENT BACK TO TAKING TRILEPTAL FOR MY SEIZURES BECAUSE THE ONLY SIDE EFFECT OF IT IS WEIGHT GAIN WHICH IS BETTER THAN THAT RASH.

The lesion was removed a month ago, but I am still taking the drug for another six months.  I have not noticed any side effects and I am quite happy with the results.  I was previously on Keppra and that was the worst drug I have ever taken.  Lamictal XR is a good fit for me.  I have also had issues with it being in stock at my pharmacy...especially when I needed a 50mg pill.

The orange starter pack was awesome.  Little to no side effects and worked like a charm.  All good until I went to fill my first prescription.  No pharmacy seems to carry this in stock, but they were able to order it...for a $75 copay as there is no generic available.  I will be discussing other options with my doctor since this one isn't in the budget.  It's unfortunate because this stuff is a really good fit for me.  Hopefully there's something else out there that will be as well.
