Acne	Alex, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Male	13-18	8/23/2012 7:35:37 AM	This is the first time a treatment in a 4-year battle against acne that finally gave me the results I was looking for. I've tried many products like Pro-Active, Clean and Clear, and Acne Free Severe. I've used each of those products for almost a year switching to another if it didn't work. Then my friend told me about Ziana and not even a month later I see the effectiveness of this medication. My acne has stopped dead in its tracks and everyday there's been less and less of those persistent bumps on my face.
Acne	GMoney, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	8/22/2012 1:14:47 AM	been using this product on and off. never really had a great result. I continue to use it hoping that it  will reduce the amount of scarring that I will eventually have. note : i was on SOLODYN!*** for a couple of years and now I have severe liver problems due to this. please be careful with SOLODYN and any other antibiotic that you take for acne. im 20 and already have liver issues due to taking antibiotics.
Acne	yrehappy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/24/2012 10:17:45 PM	I had never had a major break out so when like 15 bumps appeared on my forehead and chin i ran to the doctor to stop what ever was happening.  He recommended Ziana gel along with solodyn.  I was suggested to apply at night all over my face.  On about the 6th day i was traveling and i woke up and areas of my face felt raw and sore...  very concerned i stopped using my ziana and went online to see what others thought of the product.  by the next day and after putting plenty of moisturizer the tender areas began to peel.  I was afraid that Ziana had burned me and i was going to look worse than before i started, but within about 3 days everything was back to normal and a little better like as if i had a chemical peel.  after a day or two more i noticed a few new small bumps starting to appear so i decided to start back with my Ziana every other day.  I actually notice a glow again!  The redness and tenderness never happened again.  It totally keeps bumps at bay and now i use it every day.  I feel it has somehow lessened the appearance of fine lines under my eyes.  And I do not have not one bump right now.   
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/28/2012 1:45:10 PM	It been 4 weeks with Ziana, Spironolactone, aczone gel and Yaz birth control. My skin has improved about 75%, face is much smoother and radiant. First 2 weeks was purging last 2 weeks I have seen a great difference and I am sure it will continue to get better. I had very little flaking but moisturizer takes that problem away. I dont like the greasy feeling it leaves but I rather sleep with a greasy face knowing the next morning my face will be smooth and radiant.
Acne	Katy, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	13-18	6/24/2012 9:40:15 PM	I used this product for 2 years and it didn't help my skin a bit. All it did was caause my skin to get flaky, making it worse. I definately don't recomend it.
Acne	From Hawaii, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	5/28/2012 9:59:49 PM	I have been prescribed Ziana by my dermatologist for acne.  It has made a huge improvement in smoothing my skin.  It is very expensive but well worth it.  I had my sister try these little sample tubes that the nurse gives me (I take when I travel).  My sister found that it helped reduce little bumps that she had on her face.  She decided to start seeing my dermatologist to get a prescription.
Acne	cangel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	5/6/2012 11:24:26 PM	The only thing Ziana has done for me is GREATLY increase the oiliness of my skin - yuck!  I have been using it now for about 3 1/2 months and my skin cleared up at first, then broke out horribly.  I have been on everything, and I mean everything (including 2 rounds of accutane), for acne and alas, this medication is not the answer for me either.  
Acne	Abbys, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	10/16/2011 12:42:37 PM	I had mild acne that was mostly a few small nose whiteheads and then that once a month terrible cystic zit that left scars. I use ziana once at night before I use moisturizer. I have also taken doxycycline 50mg once per say for acne purposes as well. This drug has worked great for my skin. I get none of that awful cystic stuff and only the occassional dirty pore or two. 
Acne	Casey , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	8/25/2011 11:34:18 PM	Since I was 16 I have had problems with my skin, I never had severe acne, but always have had a pimple on my face or my skin just didn't feel smooth because my forehead had small whitehead bumps. I have combination skin so my skin can be very oily and dry at the same time. I Started this medication 8 weeks ago. week 1- clear glowing skin but very oily!week 2-3- a few large painful pimples, whiteheads backweek 4-6 large pimples disappear but still have small whiteheadsweek 7- 8- super clear smooth skin. Its been 2 weeks of very clean skin, so it seems this medication is finally working great!Overall the &quot;purging&quot; period for me was not too bad, but be patient- this medicine does take at least 7 weeks to work. Now my skin looks so smooth and my pore size is reducing. 
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/27/2011 10:04:20 AM	I have had perfect skin my whole life up until 6 months ago.  My chin and mouth area broke out in horrible acne.  I finally had ot breakdown go visit the dermatologist.  She recommended Ziana and my skin started clearing up with a few days.  It's been 2 months and no new acne.  Just a few dark spots that hopefully with lighten.  This medication had given me my confidence back.
Acne	mpiper , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	7/13/2011 10:50:31 AM	This did a good job of clearing up my mild/moderate acne BUT for me, the side effects out weighed the benefits. I started having hot flashes, facial sweating...im not at the age for menapause either. 
Acne	Jules, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Female	7-12	3/15/2011 4:49:21 PM	I took this medication and I have immediatly noticed a differnce. I am still working on my acne, but its getting a lot better!!!
Acne	pj, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/1/2011 12:04:19 PM	I am 33 years old and suffered from moderate acne especially around my chin, even after a cycle of accutane 10 years ago.  I have been using Ziana for 1 1/2 years and have had one or two small pimples since.  My skin is virtually perfect.  I have tried everything over the last 20 years from oral antibiotics, retin a you name it.  Ziana works for me.  It took about one week for my skin to be pimple free.  No major peeling, my skin did not get worse first, it was not hyper sensitive during use.  The trick for me is to use a tiny tiny amount.  Just a tiny drop for my entire face.  Love thie medicine.

Acne		3	5	2			7/30/2010 10:37:00 PM	PROS : after trying EVERYTHING this finally was the answer for the moderate acne i had..it worked really well for me, i used it with a sulfur cleanser and i had beautiful skin by the first month and my pores were pretty much invisible..looooved it !BUTi continued using it for like..eight more months and it completely stopped working for me, and i went through a few months of toughing it out and i just now decided to go back to the derm who put me on a ton of different prescriptions to try to fix the problemCONS : stopped working for me after close to a year..and it smells like chickenOVERALL : it's worth a try. if it worked for me for a while it might work for you !
Acne	chablis23, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	6/14/2010 12:35:58 PM	This did pull out lots of clogged pores at first so I did have a breakout period. Now my skin is silky and soft with a great glow. I use this at night and moisterize with a AHA moisturizer during the day. Make sure to wear sunscreen, it did make my Melasma worse.
Acne	Heather, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	5/31/2010 11:53:56 PM	So I have mild acne and was prescribed this med and all it did was make my face even worse.  It peels and is flaky, and oily after I put it on.  I called my derm to get something else, they said I hadn't been on it long enough to see results.  I've been on it for 2 1/2 weeks.  They prescribed Solodyn to use along with the Ziana.  I am not a satisfied user.  I do not see a difference, some people noted that they have horrible side effects, I do not have those although nothing is working.  This is very annoying.
Acne	Switchfoot101, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	3/19/2010 12:22:22 PM	I started using this after I went to the dermatologist and was given some samples. I began using it every day but started to break out and get dry skin. i gave it a 3 day break and then started again.... since then my face has cleared up SO much! I encourage anyone experiencing the side effects that I mentioned to give it a chance! It really works!
Acne	clari85, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	1/10/2010 7:46:18 PM	I have been using Ziana for a little over a week now.  My skin has never been so bad!! It's like the medicine is drawing everything up from the very bowels of my skin.  And it's not bringing up the typical small little acne bumps I'm used to..it's bringing up these deep cystic-like bumps.  My skin is painful and it's peeling like crazy.  Honestly, I rather have dealt with the little bit of acne I had pre-med then deal with what my skin looks like right now....blahhh....I'll stick it out for a couple more weeks. Hopefully I'll see clearer skin by then.   
Acne	fetching42, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	11/24/2009 8:46:29 PM	I've been using the Ziana gel about 2 weeks now and have had the same experience as the previous reviewer. Noticeable dryness and not much of a change in blemishes. My chin area, which was smooth and clear, has actually started breaking out all over. It's possible that it gets worse before getting better (which is frustrating) so I'll hang in there for a few more weeks. All that aside, I'm most worried of long-term side effects (previous review mentioned ulcerative colitis). Has anyone else experienced this? If so, how long were you using it??
Acne		2	5	2			11/4/2009 11:28:51 PM	After reading the reviews I understand why I was breaking out more after 2 weeks of usage. I used it at night and noticed my skin was worse than before it was flaky and I had even more acne. Hopefully it will get better but so far it has been a disappointing experience.
Acne	Cat2337, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/9/2009 9:43:38 PM	My Dr. gave me samples to use on my big pustule pimples that I seemed to have accured after pregnancy. I've been using it for 2 days now and all my acne has miraculously disappeared. I wash my face w/ a benz peroxide twice a day and use the ziana at night.
Acne	pjkwis, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	10/7/2009 2:11:56 PM	While Ziana was effective at treating my acne, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis within a year of usage - having no previous IBD symptoms.  I researched and found that Ziana was a replacement for Accutane which was pulled from FDA approval for known IBD complications.  I am sorry, but getting rid of my acne isn't worth having a chronic irritable bowel disease for the rest of my life!
Acne	darla, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	9/11/2009 1:40:41 PM	I have suffered from acne for over 10 years now.  I began using ziana along with doxcycline at first I was so satisfied my face was clear and there was no evidence of having a problem.  Now, though after been using the product for over six months all my conditions have returned just as before.  I don't know if my skin became accustomed to the medication but it is no longer effective.
Acne	jdb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/5/2009 7:18:15 PM	During the initial 2 weeks of use, I noticed a slight increase in break outs, but after that period I have had only a rare pimple.&#160; I was have cystic break outs.&#160; I have also noticed a slight decrease in pore size, but no change in white heads type pimples.
Acne	bikegal, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	6/28/2009 9:45:01 AM	I have been using Ziana for about a month and am breaking out more than usual. This is hard to go through and after reading the reviews its normal.fine lines are disappearing..I wish the Dr would have told me about the breakouts..
Acne	Dallas TX, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	5/12/2009 1:08:09 AM	At first I thought it was going to work.  My acne seemed to ease a bit and I thought if I continue to use this product for a few months this might be &quot;it&quot;.  I read the reviews and I was patient for the first couple of months as I read &quot;it will get worse before it gets better&quot; and I've now used the product for nearly four months and it doesn't appear to get better.  I use it every night religiously and wash face with neutrogena foam cleanser.  I wash my face 2x daily, clean pillow cases, etc...but this product does not prevent those deep pore acne.
Acne	groy10, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	13-18	2/23/2009 9:52:25 PM	I just started using ziana last week and as i am told my acne will get worse before it gets better(i guess thats part of the healing proccess) Right now I am at the stage where my acne is getting worse so i guess the medication is working, so i am really hoping it gets better, and from what i hear it does get alot better.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/30/2008 8:19:15 AM	I have struggled with acne for over ten years. I am in my early thirties and have tried everything short of accutane. Ziana has cleared up my skin and given my skin a glow. My skin has never looked this radiant. I wash with cetaphil cleanser, use ziana at night, and inova benzoyl peroxide/salycilic acid wipes in the morning. My skin got worse at first, in the first two months of using the product. I know this is hard to go through, but it is worth it. Now my skin is so much better. It is much less red, and doesn't get irritated as easily. I have been on ziana for 4 months now
Acne	goldenvan, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/6/2008 4:48:38 PM	MY son and i have both been using ziana for two months now &amp; wow! we are acne free! i was taking an oral antibiotic for the first month (minocycline) &amp; my son took the oral antibiotic (minocycline) for 2 months.We first wash our faces with neutrogena bar soap for acne prone skin &amp; pillow cases are wash with free &amp; clear laundry soaps.
Acne	Cole, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/12/2008 9:58:52 PM	I have been using Ziana for almost a year and I love it!  I have tried Retin-A, Tazorac and Differin as well as Dorac pills.  My acne has cleared up and I have not had as much dryness.  I only use the Ziana about 2 to 3 times a week at bedtime (a pea sized amount after washing with Purpose, and follow with Neutrogena oil free moisturizer!).  Also, a big tip, I change/flip my pillowcase nightly.  Keeps from rolling around in a night full of facial oil!
Acne	emilysmith, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/8/2008 2:15:10 PM	I use Ziana and Tazorac (I alternate using one each night).  I started Ziana about a year ago now.  For 10-12 weeks it was rocky with moderate swelling, stinging, breakouts, and discomfort.  Not much peeling for me, though.  The one thing I dislike is how greasy it makes my face - especially in the summer when it's already prone to greasiness.  I try to moisturize only in my eye sockets and around my mouth, where my skin does dry out, and that has somewhat helped.  Anyway, now that I'm on it and my body has adjusted, I have virtually no acne ever.  I have noticed that the wrinkles forming around my eyes have disappeared (yay!).
Acne	glorianj22, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	5/15/2008 10:43:11 AM	I have been using Ziana for about a year now and it has worked.  I was able to see results about a month or two after use.  I have been using it every morning. The dr had me on this regimen of Oscion cleanser to wash the my face, then apply Ziana to the effected areas and then Lustra to lighten my dark blemishes and finally a mosturizer with SPF 15 or 30.  I love my results. I have tried other products and they just break me out worse. Just stick with the dr, you will not see fast results, give it time.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/12/2008 10:28:52 PM	I have been using this product for a week, and I already have seen drastic improvement. I had very blotchy, sensitive, oily and dry skin on my face. This has evened out the whole texture of my face. I have seen a new glow to my skin. Wash with a foam cleanser and use this every night. 
Acne	montana07, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	3/5/2008 1:51:39 PM	the dr prescribed this medicine for my 14 year old son, and with the antibiotic that was prescribed, it has worked very well, so far for us.  He does still have some break outs but we knew it wasn't 100%.
Acne	jamie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	1/27/2008 11:04:57 PM	I have been on Ziana along with an oral antibiotic, and haven't seen any change.  The first two or three weeks my face started clearing up, but since then, it has gone back to the same old pimply mess.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	19-24	12/21/2007 2:14:45 AM	I started using ziana and I was not completely satisfied, but my dermatologist also precribed me an oral anitbiotic, for pimples underneath the skin. The antibiotic is Myrac and I saw a tremendous improvement after about a month of using it. I hope this helps for anyone not completely satisfied with ziana!!!
Acne		2	3	2			12/6/2007 3:23:55 PM	when I first started using the medicine, I noticed a slight improvement. After 5 months of using the product,I can say that it hasn't worked for me.  I still have pimples.  
Acne	christy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	10/26/2007 11:35:56 PM	I've been using Ziana about a month &amp; am disappointed that I haven't really seen any improvement.  In addition, I seem to have side effects, such as flaking &amp; stinging.  My face has become shiny/greasy since I started using Ziana.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	10/9/2007 11:20:06 AM	We got this for my son (13) it's a little messy, and he had the vomiting &amp; diarreha side effects. (Wish the dr would have mentioned that) He was only on it for 2 weeks before we had to stop, but it was working...
Acne	Mel, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	9/20/2007 10:38:19 AM	I've been using Ziana at night for the 1st week but the derma told me to use it in the morning instead. It's been 2 weeks now but I still don't see changes. I put moisturizer with sunblock after the Ziana. How do you use it Lachelle? Glad that it worked for you. :)
Acne	Lachelle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/19/2007 4:46:28 PM	I've only been using Ziana for 2 weeks and have already seen improvement.  I'm so happy with this product.  I would recommend it to family and friends.
