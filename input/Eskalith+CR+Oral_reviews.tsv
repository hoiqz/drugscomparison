It is one of the hardest on your body, but it really works.  Maybe not how one thinks it should but it does level you out as much as possible.  Should help those who self medicated like I did as well ease that transition.

And it seemed to help others but didn't do what I expected it to do so I got off of it. I myself like Ativan &amp; Strattera.

Bipolar Depression	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	13-18	3/26/2008 10:14:08 PM	I've been on this medication for a year now. If it weren't for the random addition and subtraction of various antidepressants/antipsychotics in that period, I would have to say I see very little change in my behaviour.

Bipolar Depression	Vickiamos, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	12/30/2007 1:46:18 AM	I don't know if it is the disease or the medication, but it seems that since I've been diagnosed and treated with bipolar disorder, I'm no longer capable of having genuine feelings.  The only feelings I have are when I'm angry.  There is no sensitive, loving person inside me anymore.  It seems like with all the advances in pharmacology, someone could come up with something better.  And this is one of the older and in my experience best ones.  I've tried cymbalta, effexor, lamictil, neurontin, and yes, I've used anti-depressants with it because otherwise I'm too depressed to even get out of bed.  The only thing I'm aware of that I haven't taken is Depakote.  I know the mind is a complicated thing, but I wish there were another way besides drugs.  I've read something about a shock instrument placed at the base of your brain to shock the chemicals or transmitters, or whatever to change the chemical embalance.  I'm not quite sure if I'm ready for this..but I'm really sick of the drugs.  I live through the drugs, and I'm not living at all.
