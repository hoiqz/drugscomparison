It knocks me out, but when I awake, I feel so incredibly better. It truly dries up the post nasal drip that leads to an annoying cough that brings no rest. I suppose in that regard, the drowsiness it causes is a good thing. I wouldn't take it during the day if you have a job to do. With me, I am sound asleep within 30 minutes of taking it. I am usually so allergic to most meds, but I seem to tolerate this one very well. I have taken this med off and on for quite awhile.

I have a deviated septum and get horizontal nasal congestion.It's a terrible combination as I cannot breath when laying down for sleep.  I used to take Triaminicin for nasal congestion relief at night, but that went off the market. Then I went to Flonase, but got headaches.   A pharmacist said to try Wal-Act.  That was three years ago and this product is perfect.  I take 1 tablet or less at night when I go to bed. As soon as I lay down my sinuses close and I cannot breath.  But within 15 minutes of taking a Wal-Act my sinuses are open and I can breath all night.  No side affects, except I think I cannot sleep without them now. They are a miracle for me.

So glad I found it again. I used this for years until they took it off market. I have suffered since then, it should be tested for asthma it really helps mine.
Cold Symptoms	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/28/2010 2:14:54 PM	This is a great drug to take for a cold or allergies. I would not suggest taking two though, because I did and I fell asleep at work!

I took Wal-Act because the pharmacist told me that it would be good to clear my head.  I had a sinus infection, and after I was finished with my antibiotics, I could still tell that my sinuses were clogged.  Although I had no stuffy nose or congestion that I could tell, my ears kept getting clogged with what I assumed was congestion from the sinus infection.  The stuff was still in my head and it was giving me a forever headache.  I was constantly yawning or opening my mouth wide to pop them clear.  After taking the first tab, nothing happened.  Six hours later I took another.  About an hour later, I had a terrible urge to 'go'.  When I did, I felt constipated and could not go.  Then, about five minutes later, I got terrible 'gas-like' symptoms, so I tried to go to the bathroom again.  That's when all hell broke loose.  I sneezed.  Then, I got a little tickle in my throat, then my sinuses completely clogged up.  I could not breath at all through my nose, and my ears were clogged.  I immediately had diarrhea.  My lips started tingling and I thought I was not going to be able to breath.  I called the pharmacy and was on hold for forever!  When the pharmacist answered and I told her what was happening.  She was not very understanding.  She told me that I had an allergic reaction to something.  I told her that I thought it was the medicine and she said my symptoms are what the medicine was supposed to cure. No kidding, huh?  My ears clogged up, there was stuff dripping down my throat and my nose was dripping clear post nasal drip.  My nose was throbbing!  My throat was killing me.  She told me to take Benedryl.  I took two teaspoons of  Benedryl that I bought for my daughter and within an hours my congestion began to clear.  One ear is still clogged and my throat is terribly sore.  I will never take that medicine again!  She said I could get a full refund.  That was a very scary incident.

For severe symptoms I have even taken 2 tablets, which was the generic equivalent to something my doctor had prescribed(RX), with success

But, unlike all the stuff you can buy off-the-shelf, Wall-Act actually works as promised.  Great.
Cold Symptoms	Tiffany, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	2/4/2009 2:13:48 AM	This medication helped me by stopping my post-nasal dripping which was causing me to experience a great deal of coughing.  My cough was so persistent that I was unable to sleep; that is, until I took 1 tablet of Wal-Act.  Twenty minutes, or so, after taking this medication, my coughing ceased and I was finally able to sleep.  Drowsiness does occur with the use of Wal-Act, so it is advisable, at least in my case, to not drive a vehicle or do anything which requires a certain amount of alertness.
