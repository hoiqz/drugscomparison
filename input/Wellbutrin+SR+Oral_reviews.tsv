Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/30/2012 8:00:42 AM	Been on this med for 4 weeks and love it.  I take 150 mg twice per day.  I have had no side affects at all besides loss of appetite and weight loss (8 lbs so far!) which I view as a bonus.  It helps me sleep as I am prone to insomnia when I am depressed.  It's been almost a year and a half since I've had a full week where I wasn't up all night long at least 1 night and up to 3 nights a week until I started this med.  It has eliminated my anxious feelings.  I only wish I would have went to the Dr. and been put on this earlier.

Stop Smoking	Yodel, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	7/5/2012 5:59:26 PM	I had smoked for 15 years and tried all kinds of crap to try quit.  Chantex was crap for me and I quit smoking so easily it was freaky.  I would go outside to smoke and realized on the 3rd day that I hadn't gone outside all day.  If I misses a dose I actually got nic fits (shorter temper, jumpy, edgy) and if I took the skipped dose and grit my teeth for a half hour I was back to the easy going.  Tried the patch, gum, lozenge etc but nothing was better, more affective and easier to remember.
Depression	justtrying, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	7/5/2012 11:29:56 AM	I recently switched from 60mg of Prozac a day (took that for 4 years) to Wellbutrin SR. I have no appetite what-so-ever (fine with me!), but feel anxious and jittery and have trouble falling asleep. I have much more energy, but feel nauseous and dizzy very often. I have not been on the drug long enough for the side-effects to subside, so I am toughing it out. From what I've read, the benefits most often outweigh the side-effects, and it's worth it to wait 4-6 weeks.
Depression	parsonsjo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	7/3/2012 11:50:00 PM	In a two week period I went from trying to control my depression to a worsening depression/psychiatric conditions, unusual behavior changes, thoughts and other mental/mood changes (including new/worsening anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, irritability, hostile/angry feelings, impulsive actions, severe restlessness, very rapid speech). I didn't care about anything or anyone. I was very hostile, angry, and snapped and anything. I reached a point where I wanted to put my fist thru someones face and I was waiting for someone to piss me off. This drug made my PTSD overwhelming and I was seeing things and the images of the warzone was always popping up. I was seeing the flesh rotting of peoples faces. Worms, maggots, snakes crawling out of thiers eyes, nose, ears &amp; mouth as I was talking and looking/ talking right them. My night terror dreams left me screaming until I would wake my hearing impaired wife up. I lost over 25 lbs and nearly lost my mind with this medication. My wife, son and daughter were in constant fear of setting me off. I wouldn't recommend to medication to anyone. It was like my brain was on fire and my thoughts were racing a 1,000 mph. I so badly want to crash my truck in a brick wall at 120 mph to put a end to this madness. I have been taking meds for over 9+ years to treat my depression, socail phoia, anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping. I feel that after a little two weeks of taking this pill at 150mg twice aday that my menatl state is even worse then ever before. This medication has triggered some veterns with PTSD to kill and kill themself. If you have PTSD or know someone who does please stay away form it.

My mood is horrible to a point I can't stand myself.I am mean to everyone. I have bad taste in mouth, and feel light headed most of the time. I guess I have to take the good with the bad.
Depression	Boris, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/14/2012 11:22:04 AM	No side effects experienced with Wellbutrin... other medications tried.  In fact, I have taken this medication twice daily for 12 years without a relapse of my severe depression.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	6/8/2012 9:25:33 PM	side effects such as dry mouth, ringing in ears, constipation, and irritating cough.

I ask my dr for it in place of Celexa because the Celexa was causing sexual dysfunction but i had to go back to Celexa the Wellbutrin made me agitated, anxious &amp; ANGRY towards everything. I had homacidal &amp; suicidal thoughts &amp; just couldnt tolorate it @ all. It did not help me @ all.
Stop Smoking	Ex-Smoker!, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	2/13/2012 3:25:16 PM	My doctor suggested I start with 1x150mg a day for the first week and then bump up to 2x150 a day starting the second week.  He also said to continue smoking up until the beginning of week three.  I did, but honestly after a few days of even the 150mg/day I felt the need to smoke significantly less, after two weeks quitting was incredibly easy.  Had some &quot;nic fits&quot; but nothing so strong that I couldn't handle.  I was a pack a day smoker for 20 years and this is the first time I had been able to stop.Personally, I had a little trouble sleeping the first week or so until I got used to the drug.  Since then I've had no real problems with it at all.I do need to mention that I started this with my girlfriend and she had a completely different reaction.  After a few days of taking the exact same dosage she began to act very hostile and began having uncontrollable crying fits at random.  She has not been able to sleep a full night for some time and has stopped taking it because the side effects were very strong.  She did manage to put up with them long enough to break the nicotine addiction, but the side effects were very scary and I would never want her to take it again.
Depression	vegasdeb, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	2/7/2012 8:38:15 PM	The firt week I took Wellbutrin it curbed my appetite. I barely ate. Into my second week I woke up wtih severe chest pain all day that would not go away and hives all over my body. I couldn't breathe. I had to go to ER and be admitted. Two days later I woke up with hives all over again and couldn't breathe. Went to ER. got beter. This was a severe allergic reaction to Wellbutrin. Very scary. It worked very good for my appetite. I wish I could have stayed on Wellbutrin for my weight issue. 
Depression	COF momma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/24/2012 9:43:58 AM	I started taking the generic form of this med in August 2010.  Originally, it was given to me to help with anxiety and overall being overtaxed with the cares of life.  It took about 2 weeks to really start feeling a change.  I typically have seasonal affective disorder; so, this medicine was extremely helpful during the fall and winter months.  I stopped noticing much of an impact in the spring; so, I gradually took myself off of it and did fine through the summer.  I went back on it in September 2011 when I felt the symptoms of depression and anxiety start to creep back up on me.  In the winter, I could gain 20 pounds EASILY but since I started taking this medicine, I have lost 30 pounds and actually feel motivated to take better care of myself (which is required to take the best care of my family).  Overall, this medicine has been very effective for me.  The only drawbacks I can see are that, after a while, I stopped seeing any effects of it (during the warmer months).  I also had extreme bouts of sweating and some insomnia.  I have some occasional dizziness as well.  But as infrequently as I have any of these side effects, this medicine is still very much worth my time and money.
Depression	sunshinesmiles, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	19-24	1/7/2012 2:53:57 PM	I personally have been taking this medication for almost 4wks. The beginning was fine, and just the waiting game for it to kick in. At about 3wks I started feeling more than just the dry mouth, the headaches were horrible a few hours into the med, been having to take laxatives for the constipation, which at 21 is a horrid reality. The kicker for me is the nausea the constant cruddy stomach feeling, I dont eat because I am not hungry, but then the pain worsens as it generally does when you dont eat. If I try eating, I feel sicker to my stomach afterward. The dr just upped my med from 100mg 2x day (am,pm) to 150mg 2x day, I am praying (and I am not religious) that this gets better. I'll update later on if symptoms clear up. best of luck everyone.

Depression	Shaky Von Spazy Hands, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	12/7/2011 7:53:04 PM	I had been on Wellbutrin for about a year before I stopped taking it (I felt better). Big mistake! After about a month off it I felt the major depression coming back. The most prominent side effects I have noticed are terrible shakes and a &quot;spacey head&quot; feeling. The last time I was taking this they went away after close to 6 weeks. They problem is the shakes get so bad at times I can't even write. It's frustrating. But as treatment for depression goes, I find it to be a fairly good drug.

Depression	Resume, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/18/2011 7:41:53 PM	I started 150 mg generic once daily in the morning about a week ago. I was very nervous to start taking it after reading all of the horror stories about side effects. However I had no bad side effects other than some constipation and it made me tired. I was on Lexapro for a little over a year before this and while it did help, it made me very zombie like and emotionless. And after awhile it didn't seem like it was helping anymore. (weaning off Lexapro is not fun either!) I know it's too early to tell if the medicine is working or not but I notice that I am happier. Most things I used to cry about don't upset me anymore. I can actually deal with a stressful situation instead of giving in to my emotions. I am supposed to up the dose to 150 mg twice a day in a few weeks so things may change but so far so good!
Depression	momOthree, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	11/17/2011 3:54:37 PM	I was put on Wellbutrin to help with general anxiety/depression. (150 mg X 2 per day)  I quickly began to notice having the 'shakes' and on the 4th day of taking the medication I developed severe involuntary muscle movement.  I was immediately taken off the medication.

So the combination of both have truly worked wonders for me. I have not had any side effects to this drug. I have so happy to finally be able to just breath, and I do a whole lot more smiling then crying theses days. For me life is looking a lot brighter!!

I dont smoke cigarettes like I used too and I dont have the craving to drink alchol like I used too either. I also am able to concentrate more on activities that make me happy...i also am able to recognize and process my feelings and emotions before I just react to them, which usually didnt work out too well for me or my family.

Depression	dannyboy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	9/23/2011 11:08:29 AM	So I myself am taking this medication for depression. I take 150 mg twice a day. I can honestly say that so far it has improved my daily attitude and certainly is helping me deal with my depression.  I also have experienced some weight loss, and some constipation.  At first this medication gave me cotton mouth as well, but I am into week 3 and that seems to have deteriorated.  Even some of my longtime co-workers notice a difference in my attitude.  Also I think I myself am trying to change the way I think and this medication only helps me to do that.  I sleep better than  I did before taking this, and the dreams like other people have said are very vivid.  They aren't nightmares but they are easy to recall.  Hope this helps for some of you with worries about taking this.  May not be for everyone, but so far it has worked well for me.

I suffered a severe neck injury( 3 surgeries) that rendered me disabled way before my time. Became depressed after I had to resign my job and give up golf and other activities that I loved. I tried several other meds but between the constant pain of my injury and the depression I could barely get out of bed. My Dr. put me on wellbutrin sr 100 mg twice daily at first and it helped for awhile before I fell back into a rut. Then he suggested 100 mg prestiq ALONG with the wellbutrin and everything just clicked. I know that this may be an strange combo but I also know that it has worked wonders for me ! I have proof every morning as my first hour of the day is still brutal until the medication takes hold. I now have the energy and resilience to face each day in a positive manor. A little wordy here but if I can help just one person it's worth the extra typing. I now have a renewed and much needed energy level and feel light years better than I had before.

Depression	smashvio, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	7/18/2011 8:06:59 AM	I had been on Zoloft for three years to treat depression and anxiety. It worked excellent for me. However, last week (7 days ago exactly) I switched to Wellbutrin SR, 100mg in am and 100mg in pm, secondary to significant sexual difficulties experienced with Zoloft. I started Wellbutrin SR to also treat ADHD, hoping that it was a &quot;bang for my buck&quot; type med. As of this past week I have been experiencing side effects of agitation, shakiness, dizziness, and emotional. At the same time I have been significantly functional completing my daily tasks and then some. I have been able to go to BJ's and not feel overwhelmed and actually focus on my grocery list!!! One of the major issues I am experiencing is a very odd &quot;electrical shock&quot; type feeling upon movement. I have experienced this before if I missed several doses of the Zoloft, so I am wondering since I have recently switched, is this the side effect of not having Zoloft in my system or the Wellbutrin SR? 
Depression	moneysavor, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	6/12/2011 9:56:09 AM	I was on effexor for a yr. gain 20lbs and started having nose bleeds related to high blood pressure. i was considered over weight just in a yr. Now on wellbutrin and only started 3 days ago. I noticed jitters and just a overall sicky feeling in my head. i take (100mg 2x) 1 in am than 1 in pm. i lost 3 lbs already. which i havent had constipation like most patients. i notice energy after my head feels better later in day after am pill. but i normally have to take a nap in mid afternoon to help with the jitters and sick feeling. I have slept better not sleeping all 12 hrs of day away like in last yr. I get up and start the day with energy for house chores but only have the energy till i take the am pill than I seem to loose the energy and the jitters and shakes come. i hope the best on this and pray the side effect goes away like today but i understand takes time. I do believe with losing 3lbs already and energy increase this will work out. Also I have to say Im a bit more short temper with wellbutrin right now too. Feel that should go away too. Im to stay on 2x 100mg until further doc. tappt. in next 4wks. I will update after my appt. I hope to help others believe me I have switched it up 3 time in one yr. before going on effexor. now im on another path to try and turn around bad side effects of weight gaining from effexor.

I would get up and around the same time everyday I would feel very very sleepy even though I just slept 7 hours or so. Then I would wake up an hour later ready to go.

Depression	mitzi427, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	5/18/2011 1:08:07 PM	I switched to Wellbutrin from SSRIs because I was tired of the sexual side effects. However, Wellbutrin made me constipated and dizzy, gave me extreme dry mouth and headaches, and made me feel feverish and exhausted for about two hours a day, every day. Worst of all, it made me incredibly anxious and nervous. It may have actually made me feel worse. After a month, I went back to my Dr and I've been off of it for a week and a half. Now I'm vomiting and I'm even more constipated than I was before.I'm really glad this drug helps some people, but for me it has been nothing but an absolute nightmare.

That along with my high blood pressure was bringing me really down.  My Dr. put me on Wellbutrin.  Been on it for 7 days and had to return to the Effexot.  Hot flashes came back, blood pressure went up and had anger issues.  Not a good drug for me. Has anyone had similar issues.  If so - did you ever find a anti depression pill that worked without those side effects.

Depression	florida girl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	3/18/2011 1:28:33 PM	I have only been on the Wellbutrin SR 150 mg medication now for 4 days. I start another 150 mg which will take me to 300mg daily starting in 2 days. So far Im very tired in the morning but increase energy as the day goes on. Having difficulty falling asleep at night. I have felt a little anxiety but the Xanax takes that right away. I also noticed that when I smoke a ciggarette sometimes I get nauseated. Overall Im going to stick it out and see how it works for me in long run.

I'm not going to give up on the med; it's much too early. I hope this review is helpful. I will give the med a few months. I will be adding reviews while I go through this adjustment period. I'm told it takes about 7 wks to level off. I can't wait to experience all the great affects of this med. Any reviews regarding stopping the constipation and terrible headaches are greatly appreciated. 
Depression	Lorilee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	2/26/2011 3:47:23 PM	I have been on Welbutrin for about two months now. I had few side effects in the beginning but they subsided. Recently I feel very very tired within about 45 minutes of taking it. I have looked for side effects of this nature but haven't found any. All in all I think it works great. All my life medications have had the opposite affect on me. For example, Nyquil wakes me rather than helping me sleep. I think for those who may have this same problem may have the same affects of tiredness like I have had with it.
Depression		5	5	5			2/20/2011 7:37:09 PM	I have been taking 150mg twice a day. Before this I have taken a lot of other kinds over the years, this medicine has given me my life back! I feel good, think clearly, sleep good. No weight gain,and has even helped with PMS. I am so thankful for this medicine.

Depressed Mood Disorder Occurring Every Year at the Same Time	gammyd, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	1/24/2011 11:48:05 PM	I have been on a combination of 300 mg Wellbutrin and 150 mg of Effexor for 10 years. I have finally weaned myself off of the Wellbutrin gradually as it caused trouble sleeping which then required that I take 2mg of clonazepam. My dreams were so vivid and weird. I would be running and running all the time and wake up exhausted. I'd dream about people I hadn't seen in 20 years who I barely knew. Wild weird dreams and extrememly vivid. I have been able to cut my clonezapam down to 1mg and hope to gradually wean myself off of that as well. I hate taking a narcotic to offset the effects of the Wellbutrin. It did pull me out of a severe depression which was the lowest point of my life but I hope to make it without it. I waited until after the seasonal fall depression was over before beginning my withdrawal of the drug. I had attempted to quit smoking and my doctor gave me a stop smoking medication. The combination made me feel suicidal. Do not take Wellbutrin in addtion to Chantix.....!!!! ever ever. My depresson started when I was peri-menopausal

I started this drug yesterday and had trouble going to sleep and woke up @ 4 am.  I tried to use this for a week previously with the same thing and feeling spacy.  Any suggestions?  I took an alprolazam and it did not help.  I really want to quit smoking. Tried Chantix and it made me sick to my stomach.
Depression	Lil Irish, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/4/2011 4:30:00 PM	I have been battling depression for my entire life - suicide attempt at 24. I was on tricyclics for a while in my late 20s (horrible side effects), and then the SSRIs (first Lexapro, then Celexa). The Lexapro had NO effect on me. The 20-mg Celexa made me sleep 12-14 hours a day (seriously), gained 7 pound in 1 week (ug), lost my motivation, lost what was left of my sex drive, and made me feel quite drugged. I insisted that my doc let me try Welbutrin. He put me on 75 mg generic Welbutrin SR. I feel fantastic! My energy is back, I am starting to get bursts of happiness, I smile more, my sex drive is creeping back, and I lost a couple pounds without trying.I am SO happy that this drug is around because talk therapy and exercise was not enough for me. Depression is a genetic disorder that causes chemical imbalances in the brain. So you have to keep trying different meds - in my case, it was an imbalance in norepinephrine and dopamine, which is was Welbutrin treats.

That was horrible for me to go from 110 lbs. to 155 lbs! I swiched to Wellbutrin SR and lost 38 lbs. in a few months.  I found for me the Wellbutrin works better, too!  
Depressed Mood Disorder Occurring Every Year at the Same Time	KateBogz, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	12/3/2010 2:14:58 PM	I started this medication due to on and off depression, especially seasonal(winter). I have been on 150mg SR daily for 3 weeks. Definitely had a lot of side effects the first week and half. Noticed diaherra, nausea, lack of appeitie,sweats,flushing,couldn't sleep and would wake up worried someone was in my home. The symptoms have gone away the long I was on it. I do feel more upbeat and less lethargic. Plan to continue medication as long as it is reasonable in price.

I have panic attacks and I do have to take a Xanax every now and then to help get rid of it.  The major benefit that I am happy about is that I have lost about 14 pounds in three weeks...much needed!!  I have had a little bit more energy but I still want to take a nap after work.  Overall I am satisfied just because of the weight loss.
Depression	Barnzo18, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	11/25/2010 5:42:05 AM	I've been on Wellbutrin SR for 150mg per day for about a month now. This drug has turned my life around and is working better then I ever thought it would. Before taking the drug I was always tired, lazy, and just really not myself. I know the reasons why I felt like this I had a few pretty horrible personal issues and I just kept dwelling on them. Believe it or not this drug has given me my life back. I will tell you right now your sleeping pattern will change 100%. You will not sleep as well as you normally would but you also don't feel tired because you didn't sleep that well. For example I could sleep 8 hours before the drug now I only sleep 6 but have the energy like I slept 10 and the mood that all is well. THIS IS KEY!!! I HIGHLY SUGGEST you talk to your doctor and have him prescribe you e Klonopin or Xanex. I shouldn't say that but for my situation this drug can cause anxiety because it is a stimulant and every now and then you may need a benzo to calm down. Highly reccomend the combination of Wellbutrin and a benzo if your life is in the dumps at the moment

I thought the depakote had stopped working and asked the doc for this drug (want to quit smoking also) For the last year I have been completely lost!  No memory! Confused1 Shakey and twitchy BAD! The twitching even wakes my husband sometimes!  Also- I was NEVER told that this drug causes weight loss! I have always been 110-115pds. Now I am down to 85!  I smoke more than uusual also.  BUT IT DOES HELP WITH SEXUALL MOTIVATION!

I have been on 150mg for over a month and so far it works for the depression....can any one help me with this?
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	10/26/2010 9:46:45 PM	I have taken Wellbutrin SR up until about one year ago.  I was originally taking 300 mg when I first started using it about five years ago.  I really liked the way it helped with my depression.  However, I did notice an increase in anxiety with it, and the headaches were awful.  I took it for about four years and during that time felt better but sleep problems, headaches and anxiety were issues.  I cut my dosage down to 100 mg daily last year and added Zoloft 100 mg daily.  Headaches did not improve and overall feeling of well being decreased.  I am now off Wellbutrin and just on Zoloft 100 mg daily. Since I stopped taking Wellbutrin I've gained 20 pounds (I had lost 50 pounds over the four year period I took it, which I loved!).  Anyway, I'm debating taking the Wellbutrin again because I feel less depressed on it, and have more energy but I hate the thought of going back to severe headaches and more trouble sleeping (even though I have headaches and trouble sleeping all the time due to Fibromyalgia).  I do take clorazepate to help sleep and that has worked nicely without the hangover feeling of other sleep meds.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to deal with the headaches if I start taking the Wellbutrin again???  Thanks!

I have high hopes, as the Prozac I've been taking isn't working.  My doc didn't warn me about seizures so that has made me nervous.  But I'm excitied about the possible weight lost and help with the stopping smoking :)  I take 300 mg a day .. I will come back at a later time and repost my thoughts about this pill and how it's working for me :)

Stop Smoking	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	10/11/2010 9:47:49 PM	I've been on this med for about 2 weeks. Sometime during the first week, I began to experience a few weird symptoms - feeling a bit jumpy and nervous for no reason, talking alot about nothing, swings to slight depression when I didn't want to speak to anyone. As for the smoking, I had cut from a pack to 1/2 on my own; with med, cut down to 4 or 5 a day in the first week. I just had my last cigarette tonight, and don't think I'll miss it, even after 44 years at a pack a day. I was recently diagnosed with COPD, so quitting is no longer an option. This med has worked very well for me and I highly recommend it.

Has helped me get back on track and take care of my family as well as myself.  Started off taking 150mg a day.  After 1 week, took 150mg 2x a day.  The only issue I have had was minor insomnia and excessive sweating (which is something a little more bathing cures).

I was very depressed due to my divorce and anxiety ridden along with the fact that I'm A.D.D. This medication started working the next day. I don't feel depressed anymore, I have tons of energy and have a positive outlook. I'm more productive at work and it's helped me focus (A.D.D.). I'm glad I don't have to take Vyvanse anymore. I don't like stimulants. The only thing I've experienced as far as side effects, is a sore throat. But not too bad, the benefits definitely outweigh the side effects.

Thank you Wellbutrin SR from the bottom of my heart.
Stop Smoking	icedad, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/1/2010 3:35:27 PM	Was prescribed Wellbutrin SR (Sr means has Zyban) 150mg twice a day.  Smoked pack a day (Camel non-filter) for 40 yrs and quit completely in less than one week! Really wanted to quit so that probably helped but still amazed at how easy it was.  By the way, this drug is a mild stimulant so don't take it close to bedtime.  That will help with the insomnia.
Bipolar Depression	catlover, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	45-54	8/22/2010 3:09:23 PM	Have depression and bipolar disorder for over 10 years. Originally on celexa 40mg and lamictal 200mg.  Had trouble with concentration and short test proved attention-deficit problem.  Weaned off celexa and went on Wellbutrin 2 months ago.  I originally felt increase surge of energy, cleaning house, etc but also felt angry and hostile and not sure why, could not pinpoint my aggression.  Went back to doctor and he added 20mg of celexa back to the Wellbutrin.  Everything was great after that.  My mood and emotional well being was great.  Yes in the beginning of taking med, had nausea, stomach pain, alot of constipation mainly and that &quot;electrical current&quot; feeling everytime I turned my head. After celexa added to Wellbutrin I was ok within 24 hrs.  Side effects do get better. Feel like this is a good drug if you have depression, bipolar and attention problems.  Each person is different.  Doc will review all your meds and history and determine what is right for you.  If some medicine doesn't work after a few months then say so and request an adjustment.  I am doing fine now.  Good luck.

Stop Smoking	annie12, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	2	Female	45-54	7/21/2010 9:10:13 AM	I just stated taking Wellbutrin SR 150mg 1 per day, then after 1 week I am to take 2 tables per day.  I have read most of the comments and I am now more afraid than ever.  I have always suffered from some mild form of depression, but never got help for it.  I am taking this drug to help me stop smoking, but I am afraid of how it is going to affect me.  I can't afford any of the horrible side effects, as I work in a very dangerous occupation and must be mentally alert at all times.  I am willing to try this drug, but at the first sign of any negative effects I will have to stop taking it.

Depression	quatchisaurusrex, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	19-24	5/29/2010 6:20:12 PM	I first tried Wellbutrin about a year and a half ago for a clinical trial, and it was pretty bad: the doctors had me start at 150mg and tried to push it up to the max dose in about a month, and then threw on a mystery drug (which turned out to be Lexapro) on the side for another two months. That was rough: the first few days of just Wellbutrin, I was an insomniac. It got better with time, but when Lexapro got added to my &quot;treatment&quot;, I became such a zombie that I failed my classes that term. I was headachey, couldn't move, didn't want to...it was worse than my depression.Now my doc convinced me to retry Wellbutrin, so I've been taking 75mg for the past couple of weeks. It's not bad. The first couple of days it felt like I was on speed or something because I was really hyper and jittery, but it's calmed down. The only thing I really notice is that I don't fall asleep until about 2 in the morning, and I sleep through my alarm clock (9am). I also had headaches for a couple days as well, but I can't blame that or anything else solely on Wellbutrin, as I'm taking BC along with it, and it's allergy season and I get really headachey during that. I'm a bit disappointed in the reviews I've found here though: some of you aren't giving your body enough time to get used to it before you start ranting about how you're going to get off it. Obviously if it's put you in the hospital already then yeah, you should find something else, but for the rest of you complaining about not being able to sleep/think/whatever since you started three days ago...BE PATIENT!

I was first prescribed Lexapro, after a 20 pound weight gain I decided thats probably not the best for me. I was diagnosed with Bipolar depressive, and am now feeling a ton better and hopefully  i can shed these pounds. I went from 175 to 195 in 2 months. Scary. 
Stop Smoking	April, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/12/2010 4:13:04 PM	This medication has helped me stop smoking after 36 yrs. and a pack a day. It starting working at the end of the second week and by the third week I was done. Even when you try to smoke a cigarette you don't crave it nor do you get the high off of it any more. It even had a nasty taste. So why bother? What a great feeling to finally be free! I have had no side effects and I feel great. And I'm loving life smoke-free! Thank you Wellbutrin!

I have been on the medication for about 2 weeks and have not expereinced any reactions to the medication. I have actually been able to experience what &quot;normal&quot; feels like again!! The severe anxiety has diminished and has made it manageable on a day-to-day basis. I am hoping after a few more weeks all the anxiety symptoms will be gone!

I took it for about 5 weeks and then stopped (with permission from my doctor) because it slammed me into serious depression, I was super emotional and tired all the time but it did nothing to slow my brain down, or to help me focus and prioritize to make rational decisions. Basically, it did absolutely nothing for my ADHD symptoms and it's funny how my doctor put me on this because she was worried about me going into mania if I was on a stimulant yet being on Wellbutrin did the exact opposite, in fact it was the first time in my life I have ever felt suicidal.

I am only on day 3 but I am dizzy, have vivid dreams and a generally spacey.  I am nervous going to 1 twice a day but I figure it is worth it if I quit smoking. I have tried the Chantix and numerous self help books so this is my last chance. My doctor recommended going on the patch after 2 weeks on the drug to aid me. I hope this works for my childrens sake, I want to be around in their life for a long time.
Depression	thecatlady, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	1/8/2010 12:51:28 PM	I had taken 100 mg of Wellbutrin SR for about two months. For awhile it seemed to be working really well, but whether due to a placebo effect or the current stress in my life, it stopped working and my severe depression returned. My doctor increased my dose to 200 mg in two divided doses. I'm still waiting for it to kick in (it's only been 3 days.) I have had no side effects on either dose--unless you consider increased libido a side effect! (My boyfriend &quot;complains&quot; that I won't leave him alone!) I also take Celexa for anxiety, and the two have been just fine together.

Depression	redloxlover, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	12/1/2009 4:16:21 PM	Started Wellbutrin (Bupropion SR) about 5 weeks ago.  During the second week, I thought I was going to have to quit this Rx.  I was wired, buzzing, in a brain fog.  I decided to tough it out as these were similar side effects I had when I had tried Zoloft just prior to the Wellbutrin.  I gave up on the Zoloft, though.  After 5 weeks, I feel pretty much normal. I still have insomnia.  From time to time I have &quot;low&quot; periods and need to cry a little to feel better.  I do feel a little jittery sometimes and my heart seems to race.  I do have more energy and am able to focus at work.  I have not been having any weird dreams as others have stated.  In fact, I can't remember but one dream for the last 10 weeks.

GREAT results. No side effects for me, and still effective nearly 4 years after taking it. Take with an anxiety-related medication and does not conflict. I recommend this to those who want to try something other than Prozac, and some of the other anti-depressent medications out there that do have side effects.

Have been trying different Anti-Depresents for Months. The 2nd one prescribed to me by Dr. worked very well - BUT! Thanks to our great insurance companies, they would not pay for it, forcing me to try others (Generics) they would pay for. This one ain't it.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	11/17/2009 5:00:15 PM	I've been taking anti-depressants for 10 years now. I've never had a side effect from any of the previous 4 I have been on. The first day I took Wellbutrin I immediatly felt good mentally. I could talk forever. The second day is when the side effects started. I couldn't sleep, anger (totally out of character for me), anxiety, fatigue, dizzy, slight headache. The anxiety was so bad I just ran away. I felt like I just needed to leave my house. I dunno why. I'm still on it today. I've been on it for about a month and a half and im still really dizzy. I keep spacing out writing this.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/9/2009 6:16:48 PM	I have been on Wellbutrin for almost 6 years now.  I had done Paxil which deaden the sex driven and made me gain weight.  St. John wort wasn't strong enough (I think my depression is somewhere above moderate.)  Wellbutrin gave me more energy, helped me lose 40 lbs and begin to turn my life around.  Six years later I am much better than at any other time in my life.  I had no side effects.  But if this didn't work for you, please try another - there is something out there that will work for you.
Depression	stillsoscared, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	19-24	10/31/2009 1:44:39 AM	I have been taking well butrin sr for about 5 days now. One thing that I have noticed is I'm not as hungry as I used to be, increased energy, dizziness(if I do not eat when I take it), and my hands feel really shaking. I'm not likeing the way it makes me feel but my doctor said it takes about 4 weeks to see the effects so I am going to give it a try.But if the dizziness and shakiness continues I really think it should no longer be taken.

I noticed an immediate increase in my energy as well as a decrease in my appetite resulting in a 10lb drop in 5 weeks. The negative side effects I have noticed are constipation, strange taste in my mouth, and slight shaking in my hands. I am so happy with this drug it's unbelievable. I have completely eliminated caffeine in my diet as well as naps during the day b/c of the added energy. I never expected to be so happy with the results.

Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	25-34	9/24/2009 9:29:21 PM	My doctor prescribed Wellbutrin SR for my depression and anxiety.  I only took it for 5 days, and during that time, my anxiety was through the roof.  I was so anxious I almost ended up in the E.R., so I had to stop taking it.  I had a pretty good headache for about 3 days after stopping this med., but getting rid of it was well worth the pain.  I don't recommend Wellbutrin for any type of anxiety disorder.  Why my doc gave me a med that would increase my anxiety I'll never know.  My experience was quite scary!
Depression	jennyb1422, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	35-44	9/12/2009 4:54:01 AM	I started taking Wellbutrin to treat my depression and to stop smoking.  I have only been taking it for about 2 weeks, but I feel horrible!  I'm still tired all the time and have no desire to do anything, but to stay in bed.  I am having tingling in my arms and legs and feel dizzy.  I hope it's just a side affect and not something life-threatening.  I may stop taking it to see if tingling and dizziness goes away, if it doesn't, I may need to have some tests run to see what is causing these problems.

Depression	calymadi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/3/2009 12:13:46 PM	I have been on the generic of this drug for a week now and it has really made a difference.  I experienced loss of libido with Lexapro so I talked to my Dr. about changing meds.  While I don't know how it has made a difference in my libido, I have found that I have more energy, more focused, happier.  I even laugh at myself now.  I didn't expect this medicine to work so quickly, but it is almost amazing.  The first 3 days I took it only once in the morning and then on the 4th day in the morning and evenings.  As far as side affects, the first 2 days felt some initial stomach discomfort, but this has passed.  Also when I increased my dose as instructed to twice a day, I noticed that at bedtime I was very awake, but not to the point where I couldn't fall asleep.  Also, the first two days of increased dosage I had disturbing dreams, but those two have stopped.  Also, I found it has curved my need to smoke meaning I smoke a lot less often.  Overall, I am pleased with this medicine and hopes it continues to work this well for me.

Depression	Trish, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	7/24/2009 9:20:24 AM	I took it for 4 weeks. Side effects were sleepiness, a tick or jerking of the nerves on the right side of my nose and r. eye,increased anxiety attacts,increases in heart rate,sore and dry throat,headaches daily,dizziness,ringing in my ears,inability to concentrate,stomach pain,nausea,and constipation.Upon increasing my dosage after 4 weeks as directed, my abdominal pain was so severe that I had to take demerol for the pain just to make it barable .  After two days, my doctor out of the country,I decided to discontinue the Wellbutrin SR, it had no benefits for me except for an increase in energy. After stoping the med,the pain went away and the side effects have disappeared.

They all made me feel like a walking zombie.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  This is the only one, that boosts my energy level &amp; makes me WANT to go out and do things.  I couldn't control my blood pressure with Wellbutrin XR.  Welbutrin SR seems to be one of a kind.  I do get surges of panic, but at least I can function on a day to day basis. That's the only side effect for me, so I'll take it.

I had VERY bad dreams where I was cutting people. I switched to Wellbutrin and the &quot;bad&quot; dreams went away. The dreams are still weird and very vivid, but i'm not slashing people to death. It starts out helping the depression but levels off. I don't think that much of it. On the medicine, you don't think much at all.
Depression	wildflower, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	6/13/2009 1:52:37 PM	I have suffered from depression since 1994 and had been on a variety of SSRI's and TCA's before being tried on Wellbutrin SR 10 years ago. I found the SSRI's and TCA's all had similar side effects with me, some lightening of the depression but I always seemed to have a crash when I was under stress that resulted in hospital admission for worsening depression and either suicidal thinking or an attempt. Initially my dose was titrated up to 300mg per day but I found I became very agitated and anxious at this dose and my doctor and I slowly decreased the dose to 150mg a day about 9 years ago which is the dose I have maintained. I found that I didn't have any crashes on Wellbutrin SR and I didn't feel depressed anymore. However I am a smoker and I never felt the urge to quit smoking or any reduction in my craving for cigarettes. This feeling of well-being continued until March of this year when a fill-in doctor prescribed 150mg a day of Wellbutrin XL instead of Wellbutrin SR.  Gradually over the last 3 months I have become more depressed and occasionally have suicidal thoughts. This surprised me when I started feeling this way again as there seemed to be no reason for it until I remembered that the doctor had changed my antidepressant from Wellbutrin SR to Wellbutrin XL. The drug manufacturer indicates that doses of the two drugs are equivalent and switching between them at the same dose should not result in any problems. However, in my case, I feel the dose of Wellbutrin XL would have to be increased to give me the same feeling of well-being that 150mg of Wellbutrin SR gave me. I will be switching back to Wellbutrin SR next week and expect that my feelings of depression will be history. As everyone responds to medication differently, there is no reason to believe that anyone else will experience the same effects that I did. However, it is something to consider if you are switched and find the same dose of Wellbutring XL to be not as effective as the Wellbutrin SR.
Depression	sdmlink718, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/8/2009 6:45:15 PM	I have suffered from depression and increasing anxiety for a very long time.  This is my first attempt with medication and I have had great results.  I have been on it for almost three months and I no longer cry everyday!  I am able to deal with my stress and I am able to confront issues that I am upset about instead of running away.  At first I had more panic attacks and had trouble with dizziness but that wore off after three weeks. Be careful driving for the first few weeks-I had problems with the dizziness and focusing about an hour after taking the pill. I also still have problems with my memory-forgetting important numbers and names.  I have noticed that I tend to feel anger and irritability if something is annoying me more so than without the drug.  I have lost 11 lbs so far and hope to continue with the weightloss.  I have had problems with insomnia but rememdy it with 1 Tylenol PM which helps tremendously. I quit smoking two years ago but now more than ever I can't stand the smell of cigarettes-hope I can get more accustomed to that soon.  This drug has improved my life so much-I am a completely new person and I am thankful that I decided to give it a try.
Depression	grparadox, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	6/7/2009 1:13:08 AM	I have been taking this drug for depression for 4 weeks now.  Initially, I had uncontrolled crying spells, increased energy, and loss of appetite.  Now that it has stablized, I have energy, have lost 20 bls, decreased from 2 packs to 1 pack of smokes a day, have a pretty good feeling of well being, no crying spells, my emotions are in normal range, and I am getting my libido back gradually.  I am currently taking 300 mg daily (150 mg x2).  I was taking Zoloft with Lithium before.  Now I take Lamictal for my bi-polar.  A previous review mentioned that no drug is a cure all for depression. I believe that we can manage our depression with medication and therapy.  We just have to find the right one that works for us.  Never give up hope. Never. What works for some, doesn't necessarily work for all.  That is why these forums are here, to help people.  Wellbutrin Sr, had some side effects intiially, but like the literature stated that came with my bottle, the doctor thought the effects of the drug out weighed the side effects.  I have tried several medications in the past 8 years.  At least for me, I was told to give a medication 4-6 weeks to see if it is going to work, unless you are having sever side effects.  Obvious side effects aside.  Wellbutrin is not the cure all for everyone, but it seems to be working for me pretty well.  I have my life back. I can get out of bed in the morning. I want to walk my dogs, exercise, go shopping, eat, and just plain live.  Before I did not, and attempted not to.  So best wishes to all.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/19/2009 11:35:55 PM	I was on wellbutrin for 3-4 years for depression and it worked great.  The first several weeks were hell- I was already severely depressed, and once I started the wellbutrin I couldn't eat or sleep.  So if you're about to start taking it, try to have someone in your life watching out for you, because the first few weeks can be really unpleasant.  After that it controlled my depression perfectly, and as a bonus I lost some weight.  I'm not taking it now because after several years it started to affect my cognitive abilities (couldn't think of words, etc.), and I'm on celexa instead, but wellbutrin worked so well that I might even risk the cognitive effects to go back on it.  The longest-lasting effect was not being able to stand the smell of cigarette smoke- it's been over a year since I stopped taking it, and I'm just now becoming ok with walking past people smoking on the street.

I started with Zoloft after the birth of my first child, and then switched to Prozac and back to Zoloft. It worked well for me until recently. I started having anxiety attacks( which I had never had before) and I became very irritable. The doctor changed me to Wellbutrin SR, and I've been taking it for about a week. The first two days it was like I was on speed or something. I had more energy than I've had in years. I cleaned (really cleaned) my house for two days straight. Third nothing unusual, fourth day very sick (possible reaction from other medications). Today, I feel kinda foggy, jittery, and dizzy. Not sure if it is the medication or the medication with coffee. I had two cups which normally wouldn't bother me, but wondering if I shouldn't drink with this rx. So far, side effects aren't anything I can't handle. Hoping the dizziness tapers off, but hope the energy stays.
Depression	BoroGuy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	6/1/2009 1:01:14 AM	When i started taking the medicine i would have such bad days that i just wanted to be left alone. I've been taking it for about 2 months still have the insomnia(but had it before started taking it, just got worse), I still have some bad days, just no where near as bad or as many, i have noticed shortened temper where little things set me off, some lil things make me wanna cry, i am dealing with somethings a lot better, but actually started smoking more, have the jittery feeling but its manageable, have noticed i have started talking a lot more, used to be quiet(not really a good thing for me). It is a good medicine has helped a lot, just has some side effects. I am taking Budeprion SR 150mg 2x daily. Was hoping it would help me stop smoking by now, and the insomnia mixed with crazy dreams would go away but it hasn't yet.

I have been taking Wellbutrin SR for 1 week now. cravings for smoking gone,I still grab for cig out of habit but get no satifaction smoking.  OMG, the depression GONE! I had the desire to do simple tasks and just counldn't before. Well, day 5 I was cleaning out cupboards and organizing trying to undo over 10 years of &quot;that will have to do&quot; cleaning. I went thru years of excuses for the way I felt.Until I was at the point of just waking up in the morning took every ounce of energy. There are the side effects,at first I felt like I was in the clouds, had the jitters, the headache and I dont sleep as well but I dont feel sleepy or tired in the day, but this is only week 1. I not sure what effects will happen over time.

I don't feel the depression everyday as I used to and it is no where as bad as it used to be. Overall, it is great to take if you give it a chance.
Stop Smoking	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	5/3/2009 7:48:38 PM	This med does curb the cravings to smoke, but the side effects are very rough for me. I feel very nauseus most of the time, can't eat at night if I want to avoid the nausea. Also I have had trouble sleeping, my heart rate increases every once in a while, and I'm always tired. My doctor said this is because of the medicine. I have to admit, this will help me quit smoking becauses the faster I can get off this medicine the better!!!! I have lost a couple pounds though, mostly cause I'm afraid to eat! Its not this bad for everyone, just depends on how you can deal with the side effects.

If you already have anxiety, Wellbutrin alone will make it worse. I took Wellbutrin for 3 years, and then started experiencing severe anxiety, heart palpitations, jitterness, etc. I went off Wellbutrin and started taking Prozac. The Prozac works, but of course then you have the weight gain and the decreased libido. I read here on WebMD that you can take Wellbutrin along with SSRI's, and it will actually increase your libido and will help control your appetite. I tried the two together, and it works! My sex drive came back within two days (yes, two days!), and my appetite has significantly decreased. I think the combination of the two (Wellbutrin and Prozac) brought me to exactly where I need to be!

Other	BeCareful, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	3/14/2009 5:41:00 PM	I was probably mis-diagnosed. My family care doc put me on Wellbutrin SR for anxiety/depression. What it did was take my anxiety and make it 1000x worse! Wellbutrin increases dopamine, which if you're depressed is a good thing, but it made my racing thoughs a thosand times worse. I thought I was going crazy. All I could try and do was make it until night-time when I could take my Ambien and get a few hours of sleep. If you're just depressed, it may work great, but use EXTREME caution if you've got anxiety as well as it sent mine spiraling totally out of control.

Everyone gets depressed but I never have been down like I was before I was on it.  The only thing I found strange was that I take the generic and if I take the TEVA brand name I have horrid stomach aches.  Thank god my husbands mail order pharmacy uses a different brand.

I am scared to take the wellbutrin in fear of a wierd reaction or not the &quot;right&quot; feeling. IDK is anybody in the same boat?
Depression	LilTexLady, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	2/22/2009 8:35:28 PM	I've been on Lexapro for 2 1/2 years.  For the past year I have put on ALOT of weight, which wasn't normal for me.  Since I have depression, had the weight gain, feeling fatigued and smoke, my doctor started me on 150 mg of Wellbutrin for the morning and 10 mg of Lexpro at night.  I have only been doing this for 1 week. I have noticed a decreased in appetite on some days. I haven't seen a difference or a urge to quit smoking yet, I actually may be smoking more than usual because of the following. I do have the jitters, its like I drank too much caffiene. I do see a bit of an energy increase, but I would like it to me more. My sleep is fine, but I do take Klonipin, so don't know how I would be without that. This combination has been good so far.
Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	2/17/2009 9:09:10 AM	I was prescribed 100mg Welbutrin for my depression symptoms after being on Zoloft for a couple of years. I feel some improvement but still have &quot;bad days&quot; and lots of sleeplessness. I've been on the mdication for about 3 weeks, so I'm hoping that the effects kick in very soon. I've read everyone's reviews and not alot about how long it takes to kick in.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	1/31/2009 9:52:36 AM	I have been taking generic Wellbutrin SR 300mg for just alittle over a month. I had heard only good things about it and how much everyone liked it, so I thought I'd give it a try. The first week when I was taking 150mg I had so much energy and really felt good, plus it decreased my appitite. Then I went up to 300mg and my energy level tapered off which wasn't bad, my appitite came back which wasn't good, and I was more depressed, moody, agitated..just all around a bitch. It was like I had PMS everyday and I would be mad and not really know why. So, I am now in the process of weaning myself off it taking 150mg a day instead of 300mg. I haven't really had any withdrawal problems. I guess because I haven't been on it that long. I go back to my doctor on Monday and will have her put me back on Effexor which is what I was taking before and I love it. The only reason I quit taking it was because my health insurance changed and I could no longer afford it, but I found out it comes in generic now and is alot cheaper. If anyone else has had the same problems that I have experenced on Wellbutrin please let me know, because everyone else  I know that is on it thinks it is so great and don't understand why it isn't for me. My email is lorim71@ymail.com
Depression	eburk, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	1/28/2009 12:32:45 PM	While Wellbutrin helped with my depression, it made me severely constipated and impacted.  I also had difficulty sleeping and that was only on the 150 per day. I never went up to 2 per day b/c of the side effects.
Depression	micrograd, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	1/25/2009 1:24:35 PM	I read all of the posts and found some that I could definately identify with.  I've been on Wellbutrin SR for almost 2 months.  I transitioned to this from Zoloft (taken on and off for 3-4 years).  I switched because Zoloft drastically increased my appetite and I began gaining weight.  I have had some improvements on Wellbutrin including: weight loss, increased energy, getting out of bed much easier, return of sex-drive, and more motivation.  I did have insomnia when I started the Wellbrutrin.  That has gone and I actually think I'm sleeping better than I have in years.  I have also experienced some minor upset stomach from time to time, slightly shaky hands, and weird/stressful dreams.  The only concerns I have are that I am starting to feel a little paranoid and I tear up extremely easily.  I haven't started any uncontrollable crying but I'm afraid I might.  I am having monthly check-ups with my doctor so I can voice my concerns.  I also think it is very beneficial to seek out the help of a psychologist/psychiatrist.  Overall I am pleased with the progress.  I'm very close to finishing up a PhD and this has greatly improved my productivity and motivation.

In my experience, this drug has helped out tremendously when taking 1 in the morning n 1 at lunch if i take it any later i have even more trouble sleeping. I also take trazadone to help me sleep. this medicine has something in it to make u feel more energetic. i do experience occasional jitters but i just put up with it. as for anger/ irritability i have learned to control it on my own to a certain extent n feel that is key to trying to feel better. the more u can do on your own the better it is for you so u dont have to depend on it as much. now i cant blame the medicine for not working to &quot;fix&quot; my anger i recognize its in my control to help myself.
Stop Smoking	mike, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	4	Male	19-24	1/14/2009 4:46:25 PM	I've been on generic Wellbutrin SR for about a week now. I came here to see the other reviews to see if anyone had the tremors around day 5. I feel better knowing that other people have the tremors as well. I don't like taking it twice a day. I'm waiting two weeks to quit smoking and I haven't notice a decrease in nicotine cravings yet, but remain optimistic. Aside from the tremors, which aren't too bad at all, I don't have any negative side effects. My sex drive has greatly increased.    
Other	tiffney, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	1/12/2009 10:03:22 PM	After 1 month I have quit smoking with no desire to go back. My depression has diminished incredibly. I had all types of side-effects including the dry mouth,nervousness,fidgeting,insomnia,sick feeling. As the days went by, the side effects lessened in intensity, most have gone away entirely. I have not experienced the heightened sexual desire yet! I still have hope! My advice to all who are struggling is to hang in there and let the meds stabilize in your system. For the review of the lady who is angrier then normal, were you on another antidepressant? If so you may need to take both for a while, ask your doctor.
Depression	Charity, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/11/2009 11:39:29 AM	I am on two different depression meds. I take lexapro in the morning and wellbutrin at night time. It takes about three or four weeks to get used to the wellburtin. You will have all the side affects mentioned, but once it gets into your system it works great. All the side of effects seem to go away. I still have muscle aches every now and then. I had problems sleeping two, so my doctor put me on trazdone. It is wonderful, but you have to get a full eight hours sleep when using this drug. All the meds combined seem to be working for me. I did notice that I do have weird dreams sometimes, but overall I would change the meds. I would rather put up with my dreams then to be taking off my meds. I hope my review helps answer someone's questions.
Depression	stressedout, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	35-44	1/11/2009 10:13:57 AM	I have been on and off of Zoloft for 12 years. The last 3 years I have gained a lot of weight an lost a lot of my sex drive. My Doctor put me on Wellbutrin 150mg a day. I have been on it for 6 days now. Here is what is happening to me.....I am having very crazy dreams when I am sleeping (which is very little),I am very mean and aggressive (which is very rare for me),I am driving everyone at work and home crazy because I talk more than I ever have before, I have dry mouth and I have a flushed and nauseous feeling. I am going to give it one more week to see if it works. I hope to still have my job and my husband at the end of that week

It is a great product if you don't experience the side effects. I am having trouble in that area. I feel dizzy, muscle aches and pains, and I feel nauseated most of the time. I am not sure I want to take this medication anymore. I have been on it for a week and none of the side effects are deminishing.
Depression	Tiffney, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	12/26/2008 8:05:56 AM	I have read all 62 reviews and not seen what I am feeling, I have been on celexa for 6 years for depression and anxiety. The switch over from celexa to wellbutrin was bad....I attempted suicide. Doctor said to stick with and a continue on my celexa. Does anyone else take 2 depression meds at a time? Also, I can not sleep, I am awake during the day but I feel like I'm going to crash eventually. I am getting about 4 or 5 hours of sleep a day. I normally sleep at least 10 and nap after work. I am encouraged however by what I've read I am just waiting for the drug to 'kick' in. It has been 6 days.

Seasonal Affective Disorder.  The first 6 days I was very foggy, with a lot of somewhat sad thoughts and a lot of jittery-ness.  The past 3 days I have been pining over old regrets, and mistakes I made a long time ago.  Perhaps the medicine is adjusting my focus level.  The fogginess has gone, but I am struggling to get to that 3-4 week threshold when I hope to feel better.  Winters in New England suck, and I feel like this year started early.  Hoping that things kick in and make me more level.  I plan on getting off of the Wellbutrin come spring, when the clouds always clear.  My energy level has been normal, but the jitters have been irritating.  I will review again later.

Depression	KJ, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	11/20/2008 11:59:27 AM	My doctor prescribed a medium-low dose for me about a year ago for mild depression and intense anxiety attacks.  For a while, I wasn't sure if it was helping or not, but while I've been on it, I've had fewer panic attacks and have been able to deal with stressful situations in a much more collected manner.  It has also helped with my depression symptoms (I sleep better and am less distracted).  As a full-time college student, it was important to me that I only take long-term medications with minimal warnings about missing a dose once in a while, and I've never had any problems when this happens.Overall, I have had a positive experience with Wellbutrin and have noticed no negative side effects.

I must say though that I was changed to generic and each manufacturer is different.  One generic form actually put me back to where I was originally depressed and paranoid.  When I discovered this I got put on the first generic which had the same smell as Wellbutrin.

My depression has improved immensely-I have no trouble getting out of bed and being motivated for the day.  Also a bonus is the return of sexual sensitivity and libido.  I had taken Paxil at one time and it totally eliminated sexual feelings.  Have also noticed it helps considerably with weight loss.  On Paxil I gained a lot of weight.  I am on 300 mg. a day and intend to stay on it-please give it a chance if you are having side effects-they are temporary!!

Depression	applefarmer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/16/2008 5:23:32 PM	Nothing else I have tried has helped my depression like this - not Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, or Lexapro. And this does not have any side effects that I cannot tolerate. When you first start taking this, if it causes insomnia, shakiness, hand tremors, or nervousness - ask your Dr. to temporarily give you something to help you with these side effects so you can stick it out and stay on it for 6 weeks to see if it helps you. If my Dr. had not given me Ambien for the insomnia and Propranolol for the hand tremors, I would not have stuck with this long enough to tell that it works much better for me than anything else I have tried. Also, it is the only antidepressant that give me the side effect of decreased sexual sensation. Also, it actually greatly increases my libido! The only problem is that it made me constipated and every few yrs I need my dose increased and then the constipation comes back. So if you have this side effect, eat more fiber and drink lots of water and if that is not enough ask your doctor if you can take a stool softener the first month or so you are on Wellbutrin. Your body should adjust after you have been on this for 3-6 weeks and then you should be able to taper off the stool softeners and be fine. PLEASE insist that your doctor tell you how to counter any side effects and try this for 6 wks before you decide whether it is for you. I know 4 people who have been greatly helped by Wellbutrin when no other antidepressants worked or when the other antidepressants had bad side effects.
Stop Smoking	glitterfreak21, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/11/2008 9:38:20 AM	This medicine is the only thing I could use to stop smoking, tried everything else and got sick. I started the meds with 1 a day for 3 days and was fine, then I double my dose to 2 a day and well I started to feel some side effects like panicky feeling, confusion, and shaky, but I read about people experiencing this so I figured it was me getting used to the medicine and it was, cause after about a week I was fine, took the pill twice a day and it was like taking nothing, My want to stop smoking was more than the side effects, I figured if they wouldn't go away after a week I would stop but they went away. If you have some slight uncomfortable side effects, I would say give it a week, they will get better, but if you start experiencing a bad reaction then stop. I guess I'm trying to say don't be in a hurry to stop the pill when feeling a slight weird cause it just may be the adjustment. This pill was a lifesaver to me.

Decided to get on it after taking lexapro for a year because of the sexual side effects. After taking it I felt wired and could not sleep. I had to take ambien to sleep. I also was nauseas 24/7. Also got slight headaches. I stopped taking it after 3 days. Side effects just too much. Also after reading that 1 in 250 people get seizers, that did not help my anxiety at all.

I actually stopped looking people in the face and held my head down in public, It's really amazing how red and &quot;glazed over&quot; my eyes look. I honestly did feel better even after day 3 or 4 which is making it a hard choice.. stay on it and look like a meth addict? or go back to being sad with (beautiful) blue eyes?!
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	6/5/2008 2:12:19 PM	The only good thing about this medicine was the slight increase in sex drive. I have been trying to find the right medicine for my anxiety attacks and mild depression. no luck yet this medicine made me more depressed, have suicidal thoughts, increased irritability, headaches, muscle aches, more frequent bowel movements, gassiness, stomach pains. I have felt like i am losing control of myself and am losing my mind. My doctor has prescribed Elavil now but the side effects from that look awful so i dont know what to do! this is a constant uphill battle finding the right medicine. it takes 3 weeks to find out that one isn't going to work. I would not recommend wellbutrin to anyone. also the pills stink like rotten eggs, very odd. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/31/2008 11:30:25 AM	It has improved my feelings not only emotionally but has helped my sexual drive. Other anti-depressants seem to decrease the drive but not this one. 
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	5/27/2008 2:33:24 AM	I've been taking Welbutrin 150mg for 4 weeks know after having been on Zoloft for 5 months and gained 20lbs. My doc said I would lose the weight with Welbutrin but it hasn't happened.  Frustrating to say the least.  It's also made me alot more irritable and have had continual thoughts of suicide.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	5/19/2008 2:03:28 PM	Took this medication for 7 years. Lost weight,controlled deppression, no sexual side effects. But quit working 4 months ago. Tried Cymbalta, it is the worst drug and scariest I have ever taken. Now on effexor. No improvement yet. Good Luck
Bipolar Depression	Megan, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	5/14/2008 5:00:19 PM	I just started taking wellbutrin sr about a week and a half ago, started out with one pill in the morning, and after a week was taking 2 a day. When i increased the dose 5 days ago, i've had nausea, vomiting and really bad dry mouth and sore throat.
Depression	lise, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	4	2	Female	25-34	5/11/2008 2:19:32 PM	I have been on Wellbutrin for about 6 weeks.  I have moments of intense aggresiveness and anger and then it goes away.  I feel heart palpations and don't necessarily think it is taking the edge of but creating one big edge a day.  I was on effexor before and gained so much weight and couldn't keep my eyes open.  The only positive so far about wellbutrin is increased energy level.  I am still on the fence with this medication.
Depression	7winter, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	5/6/2008 4:26:22 AM	I suffer from anxiety and depression . This drug seemed to cause my anxiety to get worse also I couldnt sleep and I had to take tylenol  pm . It also seemed to make me feel more angry . I was taking the generic so maybe that had something too with it . I read the generic released faster than wellbutrin. I loved how this gave me more energy though but overall I couldnt deal with the anxiety.
Depression	sweetheart1110, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/15/2008 11:13:14 AM	Tried switching to remedy sexual side effects.  But I had so many other side effects on this drug! They didn't start until day 3. The worst is pain in stomach that lasts for hours after taking it, even if I eat a huge meal first.  Also have experienced abdominal cramping, increased bowel movements, gas, insomnia, zombie/drugged feeling, overall sick and just numb feeling. I think my body is just not reacting well to the drug. I called my doctor this morning and said I want to go back to zoloft. Plus, the twice daily dosing is a pain.

I liked the recent review from the female below, she pretty much says it all. drug keeps me motivated and alert all day, and allows me to easily fall asleep every night. most days i take two, some days one. does not affect sex drive at all.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/22/2008 10:35:01 AM	I love my Wellbutrin. Originally I was perscribed a twice daily routine but once daily was actually more effective for me. As far as side effects at first it actually decreased my appetite tremendously but that wore off over time. The biggest thing to remember with this drug, or any antidepressant, it takes at least 4 weeks for the effects to really be seen. Also if the depression is being caused by a specific situation the drug is not going to fix or cure that situation. I have clinical depression and this drug has helped balance my body so that I can have a healthy or &quot;normal&quot; range of emotions. I still get mad, sad, and depressed at times because of different situations in my life but because of the med I can cope with them. Overall, the drug is extremely effective but please keep in mind no antidepressant is a &quot;happy&quot; pill that will all of the sudden make you want to go skippy through the fields. If you have a natural chemical imbalance it is extremely effective at helping create a healthy balance with minimal side effects.

Depression	happygirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/29/2008 2:14:50 AM	 After suffering from depression most of my life, Wellbutrin has been the only drug that really works for me.  I was on generic Prozac before this, which made me less sad, but also numb, like a drugged deer. Couldn't even cry.  With Wellbutrin I feel great, have appropriate emotions, and have lost 60lbs (along with Weight Watchers).  It has also increased my sex drive.  Who could ask for more than that. I take 300mg/day and it has changed my life.
Bipolar Depression	D String, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	2/12/2008 10:17:04 AM	I settled on Wellbutrin after trying several other antidepressants, because it left me with a normal level of energy as opposed to the other meds, which made me feel like I was made of lead. I have been with it for about ten years, with Eskalith (now Lithium carb) and the combination stabilized my moods, with two exceptions. I got a heightened sex drive. If I was a male I couldn't have left the house! I brought that down somewhat with meditation, because as a single woman I didn't need it. The other side effect was an increased sensitivity to beauty, particularly music. Most of my adult life I had enjoyed classical music and opera, and played and sung myself. On Wellbutrin most &quot;good&quot; music, whether an aria or a touching country music song, opened a floodgate of tears in me and I had to simply stop listening to it. Today I can listen to topicly less personal genres, such as adult Christian music, but the high-powered stuff the young people are doing I sense as being too beautiful to bear. Also, when singing or playing an instrument for myself or friends, I have to choose my pieces carefully so that I don't break down when performing them or when hearing my friends perform them. As you can imagine, John Denver is no longer in my repetoire. Music has always been a part of my life, and I'm taking it back! Mostof my friends are into listening to or making music, and I want more! I'm preparing to step away from Wellbutrin and try one of the antidepressants that worked safely before and left me with more aesthetic self-control. 
Depression	sbartlett, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	2/3/2008 5:48:32 PM	I experienced severe mood swings, nausea, insomnia and almost every conceivable side effect listed.  I took myself off before I did something dangerous with my physician's approval.

I LOVE WELLBUTRIN SR.  I have been on it for 4 1/2 years and feel awesome~  I have gained weight, but I'd rather be overweight than depressed all the time and my husband is a happier man!!  And I can interact with my daughter instead of sleeping all the time like I did years ago.
Depression	countrygal, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	1/16/2008 12:12:24 PM	This medication is easy to use. But I had a terrible reaction from it. My blood pressure was going down everyday I was taking it... the lowest I let it get before I stopped taking it was 103/68.. i was real shaky, light-headed, chest and stomach pain, etc. It has taken me about a week to recover. Wouldnt recommend this drug, stick to herbs!!

Otherwise this is working well.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	12/12/2007 10:25:47 AM	It made me cry all day long and want to kill myself
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	12/9/2007 12:26:52 AM	While Wellbutrin SR was effective in treating my depression without the negative sexual side effects, I suffered a seizure (first time) after six months. This medicine is known to possibly cause seizures, and I am discouraged to trust certain anti-depressants because of this.
Depression	Sport, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	11/28/2007 3:22:30 PM	There is no real cure for depression or any mental problems we are having but, there are medications out here that can help (ease) out of your sad moods of hopelessness. I have been on many different depressions medications over a ten year period and found some were better than others but all had side-effects of some nature if it was skipping a dose or not eating,sleeping or more stresses arise all of a sudden to add to your burden of emotions has an effect on your daily drug. Wellbutin is good for weight loss or  quitting a habit like smoking but' that's it. It's an old school pill and Effexor or Lexapro should be given a test. It has helped me to change to new life when the more modern Doctors came in and put me on the new up to date drugs And, I've been though all depressions and mood swings has to offer in my disfunctional life of stresses. So Welbutrin rates low with no help to highten my mood level and I've to say change. A waste of many months with Wellbutrin.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	19-24	11/25/2007 5:51:40 PM	I was recently on Zoloft when I started this medication.  I  cannot say that I am impressed at all with this drug.  I recently lost my mother to cancer, and my anxiety is higher, and my temperment is out of control, I feel as if I have lost my mind!  I don't recommend it.

Depression	UHF, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	10/30/2007 12:20:11 PM	This drug (100 mg of the generic) seemed ok at first but began to make me feel manic and irritable most of the time until I would crash. I also take seroquel (25 mg) which takes some of the edge off the wellbutrin but not enough. I would have fits of rage in which I punched the wall until the skin split on my knuckles. I became a overtalkative nuisance to other people. I began to think they were plotting against me. I suffered from constipation, muscle twitches, seizure symptoms, respiratory problems, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety (there were many occasions where I was afraid to leave the house), and teeth grinding. It got to the point where I had to skip a dose every other day for me to calm down somewhat. My Psychiatrist recently instructed me to ween off the drug and start taking Lexapro. Though its too early to tell how the Lexapro's been working, I've been feeling more like Dr. Jekyll and less like Mr. Hyde lately.

I never would have started taking this drug if I would have known this in advance.

SINCE I HAVE STARTED THIS MEDICATION I SEE A GREAT CHANGE IN MYSELF. IT'S EASIER FOR ME TO DO MY DAILY TASKS AND I AM ABLE TO GO OUT AND NOT THINK ALL EYES ARE ON ME. ALSO I SEE A GREAT CHANGE WITH MY KIDS AND HUSBAND. IT HAS MADE HOME LIFE ALOT BETTER FOR ME. I FEEL LIKE A MOTHER, WIFE, AND A WOMAN AGAIN!!! ALSO I HAVE LOST 20LBS ON WELLBUTRIN SO IT HAS BOOSTED MY CONFIDENCE. I WALK WITH MY HEAD UP NOT DOWN!!!!
