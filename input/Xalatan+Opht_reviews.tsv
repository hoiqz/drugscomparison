Increased Pressure in the Eye	shira46, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	55-64	2/22/2012 3:41:53 PM	I am on the generic for this drug.  After 3 months of use, the eye pressure has lowered to within normal range. No big problems with side effects after the first couple of weeks. The main reason I am doing this review is because I am feeling ripped off and maybe I can save somebody else from the same experience.  A 3 pack of the generic at a major drugstore chain cost me $255 (no health insurance but I was willing to pay that when the other option was blindness...)  And now I am due for a refill.  I remembered my eye doctor telling me that Costco had good prices on it so I called them yesterday.  The lady said their price was $24.99!  I couldn't believe it, asked her to repeat it a couple of times, then called another Costco just to be sure and got the same answer. Yeah, this is sounding like a Costco add so I assure you I am in no way affiliated with that company.  I am fortunate that I haven't had to take a lot of prescriptions in my life so maybe everybody else knows to shop around, but if not, learn from my $200 plus mistake.

Episodes lasted a week or more. Timolol alone was effective without any of these side effects.

I have been taking it for over 2 years.  Recently was switched to generic due to group insurance coverage. The generic is NOT working for me.  
Increased Pressure in the Eye	Carrie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	11/2/2011 11:11:19 AM	Had been on Xalatan since Jan. 2007.  In April, 2011, switched to generic.  Have been getting sinus headaches and back-of-neck pain, almost daily since April.  Altho Drs have diagnosed sinus problems, two rounds of antibiotics and nasal steroid spray don't help.  Pain is not debilitating, but aspirin or other OTC pain meds don't relieve pain.  Reading reviews of others makes me wonder if the generic X and I just don't agree.  Pressure headaches also.  Change to generic is only major change in my life since then.  Any thoughts from others?
Increased Pressure in the Eye	KL, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	10/6/2011 11:03:38 PM	I only used the generic version of this drug (latanoprost) 3 times. Each time I put it in, about an hour later I got a stiffening feeling around my eyes and down the area near my nose to my lips. The muscles quivered, lips felt slightly numb. 3rd night my heart started racing. But these symptoms went away in about an hour. Today, around noon, 12 hours after the last dose, I started sweating, got very red in the face, my heart raced, the muscles not only in my face but in my thighs started quivering, also around my eyes. Symptoms seemed to fade, but then came back. Called the doctor who prescribed it and my general eye dr. The latter told me to take benadryl, immediately. On the way to get it my tongue started feeling swollen and swallowing was starting to be obstructed. I took the pill right in the drug store and that stopped the worst of it after about an hour. Told to continue taking the benadryl until totally normal. which (11pm) is not yet. If you are taking this, or any of its sisters or cousins, keep benadryl and/or an epi pen by your side until you find out if you are okay on it. And don't ignore any symptoms, no matter how slight they seem. This turned on me really quickly and I didn't know what it was. Never had an allergic reaction like this before. Nothing about these symptoms mentioned in the enclosed literature or in the formal information on line. It may be a fine medication if you can tolerate it, but they really should warn about this kind of reaction.

It was only 18 and 20, but was told I had glaucoma and should reduce the pressure. The side effects were not too bad. Now I am taking the generic, Latanaprost. I have experienced all the side effects others describe and my doctor thinks I need an additional drug, Brimonidine to reduce my pressure even more. It has double the side effects. I have stopped using it. What should the eye pressure be for a person with glaucoma?

The first time I lasted about a month this time I am a week into it and I think I am going to have to stop it again, my body hurts my muscles ake and I feel sick all the time.  I keep telling myself that it will go away after awhile, but I dont know how long I can keep feeling this way.

(This is definitely making my arthritis &amp; fibromyalgia much, much worse.) The hair growth is not just in the eye lashes, but all over the face! The dizziness, headaches and constant feeling that sand is in your eyes is secondary to the joint pain.

I live in Spain and my national health plan covers most of the cost (I pay the equivalent of $10 a month for Xalatan), so the cost has not been an issue for me. I'm sure that there are many, many people like me, whose experience with this drug has been totally satisfactory. Unfortunately, most of us only comment about medications and treatments when they have not worked for us.

No bad experiences yet except a little burning when putting drops in.  Been on it for about 5 months and major issue is cost for that little bottle. Works good so far.

It has lowered my IOP as desired (it was near-normal before, but was prescribed due to signs of open angle glaucoma).  I've experienced no side-effects at all other than occasional minor stinging when I put the drops in.

Its been very scary for all of us. Her pressure was 28 in one eye and 22 in the other, After being on Xalatan for 3 mos her went down to 15 in both. The only concern I have right now is her telling me she is having chest pain. I didn't know that that is a side effect until I ready this sight. I think this is cause to take the back to the Doctors. will give up on her soon.
Increased Pressure in the Eye	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	55-64	10/21/2010 11:05:39 PM	I have tried Xalatan, Istalol and now will be trying Alphagan P.  The Xalatan lowered my eye pressure, but caused me to have severe headaches and pain behind my eyes.  The same with the Istalol, plus it caused my blood sugar levels to increase.  Upon stopping both of these drops, the side effects went away.  Concerned about the Alphagan P because of possible interactions with other meds I have to take, but will give it a try.  It is so discouraging to have to keep doing this trial and error method of finding the right meds for my eyes.

I have, however, found that it interferes with the blood thinning medication Warfarin.(Generic for Coumadin). Within a 2 week time period my blood thickness (Protime) went from a 3.1 to a 1.7. I contacted my heart doctor and he said Xalatan was the reason why. I have an appointment next week and I will learn more and update. If you are on any type of blood thinner, you should contact your doctor before using Xalatan drops.

These reviews are what people need to read when taking any drugs !!  I had great success with the drug dropping my pressure from 21/19 (borderline) to 13/13 BUT I don't know that I will keep taking if this is what's causing my pain.  I'll call dr asap.  Without reading these, I would NEVER have put 2 and 2 together.  I take anti-inflammatory drugs and just couldn't figure out where this pain in my lower neck was coming from all of a sudden.  But it makes since because I get the pain first thing when I wake up and it gets better as the day goes on.  I'm feeling fine tonight so think I'll skip it just one night and then see if the pain is there in the morning.  AND THE EXPENSE !!  I've been told Tolmoptic works just as well and is much cheaper per my pharmacist..........told my eye dr this but &quot;yada yada yada&quot;, &quot;new drugs&quot; are always best !!  Well, if I'm taking it because it is borderline AND the other drug that has caused the Glaucoma may be stopped, I think I need to check further into other drugs !!

I am 62 years old.I have complained to my eye doctor aboutthe pink eye symptoms, he gave me more eye drops to combat those sytoms and basically said liv e with it. But this week at work as a nurse, I began with sudden onset, debilitating and painful hip joint pain.It required steroids, percocet and xray When the xray was negative, I looked at other causes. Very little is written in the sideeffects regarding joint pains, but this blog from users has confirmed suspicions. Mydoctor has changed the prescription but doubts this medicine is the cause. I personally know that my 82 y/o mother figured this out on her own when she suddenly could not move her shoulderBecause she is old, no one wanted to listen.!!!!

Increased Pressure in the Eye	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	3/21/2010 2:59:37 PM	So many side affects for me I felt like I was losing what sight I have left. Pay attention to what your body is saying to you! Upon getting RX was told there were virtually no side affects to this medication. I trusted the Dr. and started and continued to use for 4-5 months. Noticed several changes over the months but didn't contribute to medication at first. Finally when I was so sensitive to light it felt like I was trying to focus through wax paper I stopped using and all symptoms disappeared within days. Eyes still somewhat sensitive to light but continue to improve. Dr. had told me to stay on them but I refused to. I'm feeling much better and my sight is getting back to &quot;normal&quot; for me.

It is a little difficult to get the drop in the eye, and I sometimes miss!  Leaves a &quot;burning&quot; feeling for several seconds, but now lasting.  I am extremely grateful that my doctor prescribed it for me.  The alternative is decreased eyesight, and maybe blindness so no matter what reactions I may have it is preferable to what could happen!  (And yes, my eyelashes are a bit darker, fuller and longer...and that's not a bad thing!)
Increased Pressure in the Eye	Honeydip74, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	7/24/2009 4:47:53 PM	I haven't had any side effects with Xalatan. Although I think I've noticed my eye lashes getting longer or their being more of them, but I'm not sure. My pressure went from about 25 to 15. I ended up having to get another medication to get my pressure down further but overall I'd say Xalatan was very effective. I think it can be difficult to get the drop in just right considering the size of the bottle and the fact you have to hold your bottom eyelid open. But once you get whatever technique down that's comfortable for you, it's fairly easy to use. Just be careful not to waste any drops because the bottle doesn't include much extra for mishaps.

I have arthritis in my hips.  The ache was incredible.  At first I didn't realize it could be the eye drops.  After about a week I stopped taking them (found out from my sister that joint pain was one of the side effects).  Two days later I was fine.  My wife is still angry that we didn't get to see any of the attractions.  Now have new doctor who said it wasn't very effective anyhow (24/24 to 21/21).  Now taking Alphagan P for about a week, so far so good.Also Note THIS: My sister's prescription from 2004 says it aggravates joint pain.  Her current 2009 prescription has NO MENTION of the joint pain issue!

Thats the great part. I had a strange pain that radiates from the center of my chest to the left side. The effect was bothersome while trying to go to sleep. I take the drops before I go to bed. My doctor told me to stop taking the drops for a week and see if the effect stops. the effect has stopped. I also had the effect of a strange almost flu like symptom with out getting sick. Its a shame because the drug works. I will have to try something else. Please do not stop taking your drops without talking to your Dr. first.

The allergy was very bad when Xalatan and timolo were used on my right eye. The allergy has caused mild blurrness over my left cornea, but was severe blurrness on my right eye.  It takes 8 weeks before the blurrness is completely eradicated after i stop using both drops.  However, the pressure has come down from 21 to 16.  I have stopped using Xalatan because of the allergy.

Increased Pressure in the Eye	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	65-74	12/3/2008 5:11:45 PM	This medication has been very effective in dropping my pressure from 23-26 to 13-14 in both eyes. I only wish that the cost would be lower or a generic drop could be developed. It's cost for retirees living on fixed incomes is quite high.

Also my regular hair color is light brown, and found far longer hair on my fingers and arms/brown. The literature mentioned longer eye lashes would result from this drug, but I never expected this result. After much electrolysis and laser hair removal, I am getting back to normal.  Just be advised - I wish I had been.  Perhaps the drug manufacturer could revise this as a hair growth product!

In a nutshell, some are: red, itchy eyes &amp; lids; &quot;greasy&quot; feeling to eyes &amp; eye area; pimples/acne; increased anxiety; hair loss; cholesterol deposits around lids/orbital area; blurry vision; &quot;raccoon-eyes&quot;--darkening around eyes &amp; lids, chest pain, and more. Also, the bottle is very small and it is very hard to squeeze a full drop out of it.

Not realizing it was the drug I continued for another 3 months until I began also having flu-like symtoms, blurred vision and then dizziness. This is a bad drug.

For me, this worsens a condition I have already with embedded eyelashes due to scar tissue on my eyelids from 30 years of battling this dreadful eye disease with caustic glaucoma drops. Also, the manufacturers of this drug only give you a small amount. If you are blind in one eye (like myself due to glaucoma), we don't always get the drop in the eye each time. I wish they would stop measuring the amounts out to the single drop dosage of 30 drops per month. Ridiculous!
Wide-Angle Glaucoma	atswank, 55-64 (Patient) 	4	5	4		55-64	11/13/2007 12:02:00 PM	Within a few months of using this medicine, I started experiencing flu like symptoms. Think of the worst flu shakes you've ever had and triple that. I noticed it only happened at night after I used the drops and it lasted only 4 to 5 hours. I now take an allergy med once a day and have not had this side effect since I started taking it. My eye doctor said he had never heard of this, but my GP doctor felt I had a legitimate claim.

This drug may well have saved my vision. Zero side effects. Pricey, but how do you put a price on your sight?

After 2 years Xalatan has not diminished the light flashes in the corner of left eye.  Dr. too rushed to explain beginning administration.  Online reading warned me of potential danger to heart.  Should I use another drug and/or another doctor.
