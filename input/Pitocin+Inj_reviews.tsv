I was only 1cm before AND after 1 bag of pitcin &amp; 2 rounds of cervadil. I think Dr's at too quick to want to drug you up * rush things along when this is NOT a medical procedure, its a natural process God intended &amp; our bodies know what to do &amp; how to do it in Gods time!

Use of Drugs or Surgical Procedures to Begin Labor Process		4	4	3			1/7/2009 10:29:39 PM	I used this drug for both pregnancies.  The first time was for stalled labor.  Everything went beautifully.  The second time was for elective induction.  For both pregnancies, I delivered vaginally.  However, I had an allergic reaction from the epidural the second time which caused me to want to scratch my skin off.  I can't say conclusively it was because of the pitocin.  I can only say that it was the difference between my spontaneous labor and my induced labor.  My first child was 7lbs. 10oz and my second child was 8lbs 12 ozs.  Both are happy and healthy.
