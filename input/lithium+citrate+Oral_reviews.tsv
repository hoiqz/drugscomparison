Rapid Cycle Manic-Depression	pyxiechick, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	7/2/2012 7:51:11 PM	I only took lithium for 2 weeks before my husband took me the the ER.  Unfortunately I don't remember the entire week before going to the ER.  He said I was bouncing off the wall - literally, which was evindent by the many bruises I took note of after I had been detoxed.  I lost my balance badly one day and fell into the street.  All my NP's, RN and CNS's knew this, but didn't connect it with the litium.  I was just a tad over the minimum level, but it was toxic to me.  I was hospitalized for 3 days for detoxification.  If I had been alone I don't see how I would have known that the drug was having that bad of effects for me.  Make sure your medical team sees you every week and hopefully they will see the drastic change in your demeaner.  Just because you lithium levels aren't outside the range does not mean you are not toxic.  I can't even imagine if I had gone driving.  It was one of the scariest two weeks of my life.

The sever depression pushed me to suicide.  I survived double the lethal dose to this medication.  They say that it works in 70% of the patients for the treatment of bi-polar, however for the 30% that it doesn't work for will have very, very serious problems.

Lithium works for me. Patience is very important. Watch the your weight while taking this and guys you may want to ask your doctor for a &quot;booster&quot; , taking lithium. it has helped.
Bipolar Depression		1	1	1			3/17/2012 2:33:55 PM	Do not ingest this toxic substance if you want to have a good life. Lithium is a non-essential alkali metal, meaning it has no actual biological function in the human body. It can interfere with potassium and sodium which are essential metals that are involved in nerve communication. Lithium completely destroys the renal (kidney) system and many long term lithium users die prematurely from kidney issues due to lithium. Lithium also interferes with thyroid function. Thyroid hormones are critical to the proper functioning of the human metabolism as well as the nervous system. Lithium also interferes with a number of other bodily functions like hormone and enzyme production. In clinical studies lithium has also been proven to prevent the female estrous cycle. Overall lithium is a harmful alkali metal to the human body as well as other Earthly organisms. It is not something that should be recommended to patients. I personally know someone who was harmed by the metal lithium, therefore I am committed to helping others. A substance used for decongestion and amino acid, N-acetylcysteine has been proven to somewhat lessen the effects of lithium induced renal dysfunction (if the lithium is discontinued) it has also been clinically proven to lessen symptoms of bipolar disorder and OCD. If anyone is currently having issues with lithium treatment, ask if your doctor will switch to N-acetylcysteine. I sincerely hope that this information helps someone out there!

Manic-Depression	LACali, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	35-44	3/9/2010 12:23:50 AM	During my first week of treatment, I had some weird feelings and a ugly taste in my mouth of metal. Then I was sensing shaking of my hands no appetite. I was really thirsty and urinated more than usual. I drank about 12 glasses of water because I didn't want any kidney issues and wanted it out of my system quickly. My psychiatrist was no where to be found to evaluate my blood and adjust it accordingly, so I adjusted it myself and took only 600mg per day rather than 900mg as prescribed. Hopefully it will keep my kidneys and thyroid side effects reduced. I hope it works!

Manic Phase of Manic-Depression	pennywinkle,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female		11/15/2009 12:24:41 PM	I took Lithium for several years. It had to be combined with another medication to get any effectivness. I took it because the doctor prescribed it. They told me it was safe. I have bloodwork done about every three months. I did everything they told me to. I think it took its toll on my body. I was hospitalized for a psychotic episode. They told me in the Er that I had toxic levels in my system. I had to detox from it. I ended up with hypothyroidism and some kidney problems. It is not worth what it does to your body. There are plenty of better meds with less side effects.

When I spent too much time in the heat I became sick with exhaustion. I went through three or four days with no memory to what had occurred in these days.

Water would probably be a better mood-stabilizer than this slightly toxic non-natural piece of metal that they sell as 'the' bipolar medication.
