Other	ncmom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/8/2012 4:17:05 PM	My Dermatologist's PA applied Altabax to the 2nd degree burn on the top of my foot. At first, it burned but was told it would go away. Within 30 minutes, I experienced extreme pain, swelling, reddish, burning and piercing like a needle was going into the burn site along with nausea. I went back to my doctor's office, they wipe off the Altabax and applied hyro-perxoide to clean the burn site then ice for 1hr. I have been home now for 4 hrs and the piercing pain is still happening. My reason for going to the doctor was to make sure that I didn't get an infection. Now I am worst than I was before I went to the doctor!!!

This can make the difference between earlier successful healing than the embarrassing and unsightly sores. This is the first time I have been given Altabax. At this time, I have sores on about 25% of my face and had such serious itching and burning I wanted to tear the skin off my face. Unlucky for me, it was a holiday weekend and could only contact my pharmacist. Lucky for me, however, was that I had some Bactroban cream and oral Bactrim on hand from another skin infection--also on my face--less than 3 months ago. It has been almost a week and very little healing has taken place.My results will not be typical for most people--I am immuno-suppressed and am a very slow healed. In doctor's offices so much I forgot to ask for an Rx..but had MRSA in sinuses within the last 6 months.Please wish me luck--my son's wedding is in less than 3 weeks and my face looks like it was shot by a machine gun.

I have three tiny scars on my leg instead of a quarter sized crater thanks to this medicine. No side effects whatsoever.

I was prescribed Altabax to apply to the wound twice a day.  It was a dredful experience!  It caused the area to itch uncontrollably, and then it burned badly. It actually worsened the wound. I immediatetly stopped using this product and warn others to beware!
