Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	2	Female	25-34	9/14/2012 2:46:49 AM	I am 26 and have suffered with year-round allergies my entire life. I have taken many nasal sprays and switched to Flunisolide due to insurance coverage. This is the most painful nasal spray. I have never had a problem with Nasonex or Flonase, but this burns so bad I am not able to take my full dosage (two squirts per nostril, twice a day). I can only do one squirt/nostril because it burns. The taste is also so bad! There are much better products that are way more effective and without the pain!

This nasal spray helps with the inflamation and pain year round.  I do not like the weird taste I get, but it goes away quickly.  Am going to a specialist to discuss long term effects of this drug

Just one spray in each side before bed each night did the trick. I was able to breath through my nose all night and in the morning I didnt have a big build-up of snot to blow out. What a relief.

Have lived on some medication or another. While not a big fan of inhaled steroids I will confess that it works. It is better than the old inhaler filled with Beconase.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy		1	2	1			7/10/2008 2:52:36 PM	I came from using Flonase which worked well. That only needs to be used once a day. 2-3 times is a hassle. Plus, I have had a cough ever since I started using it.

Not worth the side effects.  I was using Rhinocort without any of these symptoms.
