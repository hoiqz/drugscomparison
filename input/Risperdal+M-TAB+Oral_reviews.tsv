I just know that  
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	Mrs. S, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	12/5/2010 6:39:09 PM	Was on drug regimen that worked for my bi-polar then traumatic life event suddenly occurred and my meds seem to stop working overnight.  I began rapid cycling with extreme fluctuations and of course the problems that go with the deep depression and mania states I was in.  I was hospitalized in March 2010 and placed on resperdal 2mg at bedtime.  I am careful about my weight as I take other medications that cause fluctuations.  Until today (12/5/10) I was unaware this medication caused weight gain.  In the last 4 months I've gained over 20 lbs even though I've been trying to control my weight.  I'm heavier than I've ever been and I also suffer from Fibromyalgia and am small framed.  My body can't take the extra weight as its too hard on my joints.  I am now considering having my meds changed.  I've been through that too alot thru the years and don't like to mess with a good regimen but I really am having a hard time with my added weight and wonder if the risperdal has contributed.
Additional Medications to Treat Depression	Melody, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	8/10/2010 12:41:02 AM	I've been receiving treatment for panic attacks and anxiety for a long time. Zoloft and Xanax work very well for me. But there are times when I get so frustrated and feel agitated that even I know there's no reason for feeling like that.  My doctor included Risperdal M-Tab 0.5 to be taken ONLY when I get very frustrated.  They worked very well even though I rarely ever take one.  I'm 56 years old and the possible side effect of sudden death or stroke from use of these tabs creeps me out.  Otherwise, I think it's very helpful.

Psychosis caused by a Disease	Very Sad for my Son, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Male	7-12	9/30/2008 12:32:38 PM	My son is Autistic with ADHD and is Epileptic as well.  Risperdal is one of the medications that he takes and he has worked for 2 years now, but I am now seeing that he is protraying alot of aggressive behaviors, perfanity and is very irratible after he is administered the medication and my son is only 11 years old.  He still acts aggresively even if he doesn't take it and he's never been so disruptive in this manner before.  I do not recommend anyone taking this for an extended period of time if you are taking other medications as well.

It is still early &amp; I plan to give it a full month before I re-evaluate this medication &amp; regiment
