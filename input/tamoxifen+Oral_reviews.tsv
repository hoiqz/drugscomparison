Breast Cancer	Sherri, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/9/2012 12:52:04 PM	In December 2011, I was diagnosed with Stage 1 estrogen positive. I had a double masectomy in January with the removal of 5 lymph nodes.  I was fortunate enough where I did not have to have chemo or radiation.  So, tamoxifen has been it for me.  I've been on tamxifen for 6 months now and am experiencing every side effect - mood swings, hot flashes, swollen ankles/feet, anxiety, weight gain, change in eye sight, etc.  I'm just now coming to the conclusion its the medication. We'll have to see where this journey takes me....
Breast Cancer	pinkribbon, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	8/1/2012 4:20:47 PM	Hi everyone! I am 35 yrs old and last year end of march I have diagnosed with stage 1 node negative hormone positive breast cancer. I had my tumor removed from my breast(left)and I had 4 cycle of chemo and 21 session of radiation. I am taking tamoxifen since 2011 October, my doctor put me on for 3 yrs because we want to have a baby before I turn 40. we have 12 embryos frozen waiting for the time to get approval from my doctor about pregnancy. I have not experienced any hot flushes or night sweats and weight gain (yet). however I am experiencing fatigue and bone pain especially my feet, my heels, my ankles and my lower legs.. and noticing some spider veins on my upper legs as well.. I am also experiencing some memory issues here and there too. I am still having my period but not as much as I used to be.I think the positive side effect I am experiencing is it's slowing&amp;thinning down my bodily hair growth which I am not complaining at all lol. and I don't think it is affecting my hair growth looks like it's growing normally. I am just hoping  that all those aches and pains will eventually go away. because sometimes it affecting my quality of life.                    
Breast Cancer	Cynthia in Texas, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	7/30/2012 4:37:07 PM	I had a lumpectomy, radiation, and chemo then started the tamoxifen for what was supposed to have been 5 yrs.  It was like being in menopause for years, night sweats, extreem mood swings, poor memory, and all the physical aches.  After 3 years I told my dr. some things are worse than death &amp; that was living on this drug for 2 more years.  I believe tamoxifen has no merit.  I believe the help is chemo &amp; radiation.  I am 21 years chancer free.  DON'T TAKE THIS DRUG.

Breast Cancer	one more day , 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	7/9/2012 5:21:26 PM	I was prescribed Tamoxifen once I'd completed chemo and radiation.  The first month was the most difficult.  My bones ached so much I thought I would not be able to continue the meds for another month let alone 5 years.  However I stuck with it and turned the corner the second month.  I take 20mg every morning and I'm on my 9th month of the treatment.  My bones no longer ache.  The fatigue comes and goes, but mostly when I over exert myself.  Overall I feel well, however I do feel nauseated and lightheaded more frequently which I attribute to the medication. After all I've been thru with surgery, chemo,  &amp; radiation I can do this!  I'm very happy it's only one pill a day!!!  51.5 months to go....
Breast Cancer	DoubleFavor, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	6/22/2012 12:45:07 PM	I haven't read all the reviews of this medicine but about 20 most recent ones, think I'm the youngest.  I was diagnoised in Aug 2011, did chemo, lumpsectomy with 27 lyphnodes removed, just completed radiation June 1, I was prescribe Tamox in march but didn't actually start taking til April, I was a lil skeptical about taking this med so still not taking it as should I take it on MWF instead of everyday but I still experience the leg joint pains, hot flashes (not as severe as when I was on chemo), headaches (didn't realize they were from the med til I read reviews), tiredness (thought that was from radiation).  I feel like older lady, because of the pain i feel of getting up or sitting down notice it alot in knees &amp; heel of my foot. I also suppose to be on this pill for 5 yrs...gotta be a better alternative, why does every medicine you take have side effects....
Other	pshack, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	6/14/2012 9:09:27 AM	I took this medication 2009 - 2011 for dcis. I had 2 mini strokes and took myself off this medicatiion and changed doctors, who told me I did the right thing by quitting the tamoxifen especially after having a mini stroke and possibly should never have been put on it. Went through 33 radiation treatments prior to taking this which made my white blood cell count low, which was another reason I should not have been put on it. He said what I had been thru was overkill treatment for DCIS.  I think it affects your mental outlook permanently.

The side effects were tolerable considering the alternative. I found taking it at night was better, also, take the Effexor - it's amazing how much it helps. I am now on Femara for another 5 years and will stay on Effexor throughout these 5 years. I hate being on medication but I want to see my adult sons succeed in their lives. Stay as active as you can, the more exercise you can get the better you will feel.

I have 3 1/2 more yrs to take it &amp; am wondering how I am going to get through it... The side effects were gradual but now they are full blown...fatigue, depression, hot flashes, joint pain. I too have lost my pep in my step. My onco gave me Effexor but I am afraid to take another med. I am trying to exercise more to counter the depression.
Intraductal Breast Cancer	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	5/28/2012 5:10:02 PM	I had minor side effects--leg cramps which subsided with time.  But then I started feeling lousy--no appetite, weight loss, nausea, no energy, fatigued.  My liver enzymes were sky high--AST 696, ALT 808.  They have taken me off tamoxifen.  I have been off of it for one month and both values are in the 200's.  They are continuing to monitier me every other week.  Oncologist has decided not to put me back on it even when the liver returns to normal, and I agree!

Unsure if chemo treatment 2 years ago caused these changes, or the ongoing tomaxifen.  I don't want breast cancer again so I take it every morning, it is real, but worry about what impact it has on my life and relationships for 5 years ???
Breast Cancer	jds, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	4/11/2012 6:04:20 AM	Am a survivor, 1 year and 7 months now. I had a lumpectomy, lymph node disection which tested negative-cancer hasn't spread, then radiation. No chemo though dr said if the cancer comes back then chemo will definitely be done, which I dread. Am taking tamoxifen for 1yr 5mos and will do so for 5 years. There's night sweats, insomnia, leg cramps-this really painful, fits of depression, vaginal discharge everyday, always feeling tired...lost 20lbs on the first 2 months 'cause I was terrified that anything I eat would kill me, so I quit the sodas, canned and preserved foods, sweets, rice, breads ... losing weight was maybe good at first, but my taste buds were so sad and I was miserable. Since then I gained back 10 lbs, started eating more, though the occasional cheating on the sweets not good as this feeds the cancer...so far so good ... take care of yourselves, especially watch the diet.

If I am active, even walking around the mall I begin sweating and it takes me until I can sit,and get in a very cool place before the sweating will stop. I don't know if there is something I can do to  help this problem or not but it is very annoying.

I have suffered severe insomnia, extreme fatigue, been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, I can't eat, I am completely nonfunctioning.  I think about suicide everyday.  I work with my doctors and am on a high dose of effexor.  They have tried everything they can think of and nothing is helping me.  I'm just giving up hope and I have no quality of life.  Is it time to quit tamoxifen?

The weight gain has not happened; the pain in the legs have subsided; sex drive &amp; exhaustion I believe is just an ordinary part of life; the hot flashes are still there, but seem to only happen right after I take the T.  I take it in the evening around supper and have hot flashes on and off all night; I will report however, that my lining of my uterus has thicken and had a DNC last month; would really like have all that removed so that isn't a concern but have to follow protocol before surgery can happen.  Again, it's a simple solution to prevent breast cancer so I will continue another four years!
Breast Cancer	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	3/15/2012 7:05:41 PM	Small benign breat tumor; lumpectomy &amp; sentinel node procedure (all negative-Thank you Lord!); 30 radiation trtmnts (then we went to Disney World :-) I was hesitant to go on as concern of weight gain, and I'm already battling weight. But finally decided to try based on Dr saying I could go off immediately if desired. WELL, the only bad side effect I experienced was I noticed hair thinning (but unnoticeable to others). AND, a &quot;good&quot; side effect - I LOST weight! And I was not experiencing anything other adverse that would be of concern toward that. HOWEVER, after about 7-8 mths the Dr who prescribed me Wellbutrin (Bupropion 300mg/day) said that a study indicated the Wellbutrin would negate any affect of the Tamoxifen (NOT harmful just negate) so I went off it. My hair improved but unfortunately my weight went up (not drastically but there was a difference when on or off Tamoxifen). So as far as the Effectiveness rating, I couldn't really tell as not on long enough but I had to pick a rating so went 'middle-of-the-road'?
Breast Cancer	Kerry, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	3/11/2012 1:10:24 AM	I don't like taking this medication. My body has never been the same. My joints ache and my bones feel sore.I have bad hot flushes. Although I have a choice I will continue to take this medication.It has been 2yrs have 3 to go which I will continue. I have heard in the USA research has been done stating that Tamoxafen should be taken for 7yrs not 5yrs I'll consider that when the time comes.

I take it for prevention. I have had hot flashes, a little bit of nausea and have recently been experiencing joint pain. These are symtoms I will deal with as I had an MRI and MAMMO that finally came out ok. I am pre-menopausal and I guess there aren't alot of us out there on this med. I wish everyone luck in what seems to be a long journey.

I can sleep at night, I have NEVER gained weight in my life, but have gained 10 pds since being on tamoxifican.  I do not believe it does not cause weight gain as everyone else has the same side effects. I wish there was an alternative for peri menopause women, and hope it is effective, will see.

It's been over one month since my radiation, I just went to see the doctor yesterday who is trying to talk me into taking Tamoxifen.  I already take Celexa and read in the reviews it does not help Hot Flashes, I'm 52 so weight is already getting to be a problem, I have not gone through menopause but feel like I'm about to start, ugh...I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm as brave as a lot of you to try it, I feel like this medication is so wrong.

Nada.  No weight gain, night sweats, etc.  It has literally been as easy to take as a vitamin.  I was frightened by all the reviews but I needed to dive in.  Once I did...nothing.  No horrible side effects. No side effects at all.

Breast Cancer	Sajana, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	12/2/2011 2:44:21 PM	Age 48, diagnosed 4/11 with invasive ductal carcinoma, stage IIA (by size, otherwise stage I characteristics), EST+/PR+/HER-, no nodular involvement, began treatment 5/11. I'm currently taking Tamoxifen, along with hormone suppression therapy (Zoladex) to reduce the size of the tumor for lumpectomy. No chemo, but I'll have radiation after surgery. The tumor has shrunk more than 50% so far (5 cm to -2 cm). Other than hot flashes (10-15/day avg.) and occasional tiredness in the afternoon and a brief period of hair shedding (not visible loss, just more hair in my brush/the shower drain) after beginning the treatment, I haven't experienced any other side effects. I feel it's been a very effective treatment so far and for the protective benefits it offers against future recurrence, well worth the risks in my case. (My oncologist is considering the possibility of moving me from Tamoxifen onto Arimidex at some point b/c recent studies have shown greater protective benefits from using Arimidex following two years of Tamoxifen than from Tamoxifen alone.)

Anyway I have now been taking this medication for 3 years, side effects are weight gain and joint pain and hot flushes, but I truly believe its a small price to pay if these tablets stop the cancer coming back. I am losing weight after joining a slimming class, I take pain killers for the joint pain.......all in all after my initial kicking and screaming about taking Tamoxifen...I wouldnt be upset if I had to take them the rest of my life!

I took Tamoxifen for the standard 5 years. Dr. let my stop taking this drug April 2011 and, now in Oct. my mamo showed 2 tumors. I am back on Tamoxifen for another 5 years! Can't live without it, can't live with it! What can you do? HATE the weight gain, the indigestion, and just feeling like a 70+ woman when, I am 47. Want to feel good enough to get all I can out of life! Because life is way to short!

I chose to wait 3 months before starting Tamoxifen on Oct 24, 2011. So far so good. I cannot identify the side effects directly related to tamoxifen because small side effects from Chemo still there a little bit. Hot flashes and joint pain from CHemo subsided and do not return with Tamoxifen. No bone pains or headaches. I have some sleeplessness but dealing with it by taking Tamoxifen in the morning, only one coffee in the morning, and dringking Camomile warm tea before bedtime. This is helping so far. Every other couple days, I will take 1-2 capsules of valarian roots to help get a good night sleep. You are not supposed to take this every day. Noticed slight weight gain but control with healthy eating and less portion of carbs at dinner time. No fried food. Big breafast and lunch with increase in vegetables and fresh fruits. I do not exercise! In fact,I notice a light weight loss this morning! I read a lot of reviews about this drug and took some preperation prior to starting Tamoxifen. I am now taking 1 Omega-3 in the morning, 1 multivitamin (1 a day woman) at lunch time and 1 calcium with D3/Mag/Zinc &amp; 1 Omega-3 at Dinner time. I think this keeps me from having bone and joint pain and also keep blood clots which cause leg pains away. For those who have a lot of side effects, you might want to consult your doctor to see if these vitamins will help you. Good luck everyone! I hope my information helps!

The headaches were also migraine-level but did not respond to treatment.  I was removed from treatment on this medication because of these and other side effects after 5 weeks, so its effectiveness cannot be really examined accurately.

Joint stiffness, hot flashes and numbness from Taxol. Got better after Chemo. Start Tamoxifen Sept 26th, 2011. So far so good. I just don't know when the side effects supposed to hit me. Joint stiffness still here, hot flashes has somewhat disappeared. Still easily tired. Sex drive gone before dignosed anyway. I don't feel as sharp as I used to be. A small weight gain I guess but I think it's also related to getting older and after 2 kids. I wonder if I don't have side effects now, does that mean I won't? Praying.

I was fortunate that my tumor was found in the early stage and most of it was removed when the biospy was taken; 6 wks of radiation and then 5 years of this...pretty simple   will make the effort to take this medication to make my life better/before breast cancer, hodgkins visited and had a stem cell transplant to rid myself of it; so Tamixofen doesn't seem to be a big deal to help prevent breast cancer!
Breast Cancer	PinkLady, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	8/11/2011 8:09:57 AM	Stage 1 invasive BC. 2 Lumptectomies and 33 radiation treatments. I have taken Tamoxifen since February and feel awful. Bone/Joint pain; couldn't think clearly so Dr. put me on Clonidine. Not many hot flashes, but I don't sleep well; I now have age spots; I just feel old and rundown. I walk everyday so I do stay active, but the bone pain makes it difficult.Have had some depression but I am peri-menopausal so that could contribute. Not sure I will stay with Tamoxifen for 5 years. Afraid I will age another 20 years in 4 1/2. If my cancer wasn't caught so early and my chances of reoccurance were greater, it might be worth it.

I started taking Tamoxofin on June 04, 2011. My body immediatly responded to the medication. I noticed the nodes in my breast were shrinking. The only side effect I had was the hot flashes. After about three weeks, the hot flashes stopped. I am very satisfied with this medicine. Im very hopeful for my future and recovery.
Prevention of Breast Cancer	dd, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	7/14/2011 1:04:47 PM	Have taken this for a year; problems occurred; did some testing; re-prescribed; was off this for approximately 8 months; since returing to this the side effects appear a little worse than the 1st time; I get up almost nightly with horrible leg pain; the weight gain has been significant and I have even had the lap-band procedure; hot flashes has increased; and just tired beyond believe; however, i'm hoping after a six-month run it will all even out.  Willing to accept what is being offered so that breast cancer doesn't find it's way back to me.

It went on for  three weeks until I stopped taking the medication and it stopped.  Dr said he had never known anyone with these results. I am very sensitive to all medications so it probably was me and my system.

I was premenopausel when I started the drug, so chemo + Tamoxifen have put me into menopause (I guess).

Have been on Tomoxifn for 4 months now and have had awful side effects, Hot flashes during the day and night so severe, I have to sleep on a towel - because it gets soaked everytime I have one and usually have to reapply my make up during the day.  Dr. put me on effexor to ease the side effects - no luck.  Haven't slept thru the night in 4 months and have started to get hip and ankle pains along with alot of forgetfulness - Meet with my oncologist in two weeks - Is it worth it?  Can I do this for 4 1/2 more years?

Breast Cancer	sandogger, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	1/4/2011 3:14:55 PM	I have been taking Tamoxifen for almost 2 years. So far, so good, as far as being cancer-free. The main side effects for me:  joint pain, but some of that has subsided; and hot flashes.  The hot flashes are pretty extreme and sometimes make me feel nauseated.  I have been given neurontin to help with the hot flashes.  It does help, but I still have them.  I hope that with time, they will calm down.

Did gain a little weight, but with diet and exercise was able to lose that and more.  Can't say I've experienced joint pain.  Doc wants me to switch to arimidex, but after reading others' comments, I am going to stay on tamoxifen.

I've had 5 years of clean tests. The only problem was a few more leg cramps. I did gain about 10 pounds, but only because I was not active.  Stay active and I don't think you will gain weight. Ask your Dr. about taking an Aspirin, if it will ease the worry of blood clots. I had DCIS in left breast, had an lumpectomy, MammoSite.

Went through 3 lumpactomies, then a mastectomy. Chemo for 5 months, then 7 weeks of radiation- I didn't panick. Then I was told I had to take Tamoxifen for 5 years - I panicked.I had all these horrible side effects envisioned... Finally I broke down and started taking them - and nothing happened! No side effects to talk about - a couple of days of being extremely thirsty. Weeks later - 2 depressed days. 6 months later - achy fingers which I don't even know if it's related to Tamoxifen... it's been 9 months and I haven't had a single hotflash. Just wanted to let people know that even though many get horrible sideeffects, it doesn't have to happen. You have to try it and see if it works for YOU.

The cancer was so small that my only treatment was Tamoxifen. Coming up on 2 yrs., I notice my hair is thinning and my uterine lining has changed from a 3 to an 8. A wait and see situation. But I did have terrible hot flashes. My dr. put me on Megace..very low dose and they're gone! So far, I feel very fortunate to be where I am in this terrible disease.
Breast Cancer	Free Bird, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	9/21/2010 7:31:41 PM	My Story: Stage III Breast Cancer in one breast, opted for Bi-lateral mast, 6 treatments chemo (TAC), 5 years of Tamoxifen (which I discontinued after the first month).  I was really stressing about whether or not to even start the drug but finally did so because &quot;Doctor knows best&quot;.  Well, they don't.  They do the best they can and I'm grateful for them. But Doctors often recommend standard treatment for everyone (surgery, chemo, radiation, etc.), followed by 5 years of Tamoxifen.  Whether you take Tamoxifen or not your cancer could come back.  If they could tell me by taking Tamoxifen and dealing with the side effects that I would never get cancer again, I'd be the first one in line. But the truth is, there's no guarantee, so I'd like to make the choice about whether it's right for me rather than let a Doctor scare me into taking it.  Do your research about this drug before you make your decision ....I'm glad I did!         
Breast Cancer	Peaches, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	9/21/2010 2:20:14 PM	Diagnosed with Stage IIIA Invasive Ductal Carc in right breast, elected Bi-lateral mast., Dr. said &quot;He got it All&quot;, followed by 6 rounds chemo.  Pet scan showed no spread, no cancer anywhere else. Went on Tamox at oncologist urging, stopped after 3 weeks.  Too many hot flashes, ankle swelling, insomnia, plus anxiety over risk of serious side effects.  Not worth it. No guarantee cancer will not recur with this drug so not putting myself through it.

Went into immediate menopause. Have always had some hot flashes, but the last 6 months they have increased to being almost unbearable. Started being nauseated all the time; swollen throat, muscle aches and being more fatigued. Don't know if these symptoms are from drug since I have been on it for awhile. Need something to help with the nausea and sore throat. Feel like I need to stay on it for at least 2 more years. Tired of feeling so bad lately.

My sister took the same dosage after her surgery and never had any problem.  I have been on the drug for one year.  I have had weight gain, and terrible hot flashes, many every day. I am 55 years old and was already in the middle of menopause when I started the drug.  I'm counting off the days when the next four years are over.

I've taken Tamoxifen for 16 months, and recently noticed weight gain (hips, stomach). I'm not sure if it is the drug. I cannot sleep and an occasional hot flash.

Breast Cancer	Leanne, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	7/12/2010 4:18:27 PM	I was diagnosed with bilateral cancer in Jan. 2009 &amp; was 46 at that time.  It was caught early; stages 0 and 1 (non-invasive LC &amp; DC stage 1). I opted for a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction &amp; saline implants that followed half a year after my mastectomies.  When I first went on the tam., I was miserable with hot flashes, joint pain, a terribly broken out face, and I could not sleep at night.  My nephew had just committed suicide which did not help my emotional state... I went off the tam. until I saw my oncologist, who strongly encouraged me to go back on it.  He said side effects generally subside after a few months.  I have now been on tam. for 1 1/2 years.  For the past 6 months, I've had terrible pain in my calves &amp; easily pull my calf muscles when doing any kind of exercise.  This has been hard for me because I like to be active (tennis, aerobics, biking)&amp; I've put on weight since being on the med.  I was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism after being on tam. for one year.  I was constantly cold &amp; very fatigued - I attributed this to having 3 surgeries in 11 months.  I've now been on synthroid (75 mcg.) for 4 months &amp; am feeling less tired &amp; cold, but continue with the cramps/pulled muscles.  I struggle with staying on tam. - I feel as though my skin, face, &amp; body have aged considerably in this short time.  I wonder how much of a risk there is for recurrence when there is little breast tissue left.  I feel my doctors are quite competent, &amp; yet I wonder about their motives for pushing women to take tamoxifen.  If the muslce pain con't. &amp; I can't figure out a way to treat it w/out more drugs, I am considering going off tam. altogether.

Surgery in Oct 09. No nodes involved. Had OncoDX done, no radiation therapy or chemo. Oncologist started me on Tamoxifen, 20mg in Nov 09 (7 mths). Side effects: irritability, hot flashes and night sweats, insomnia, rash on my face, one bout of infection, brain fuzziness, no weight gain or loss, some tiredness and occasional hip pain. Had my period for 6 mths, this is first mth with no period. Hooray! Sex life is fine. Overall, I feel the benefits of taking the drug outweigh the negatives at this point. I am blessed and will continue to live my life to the fullest on this drug. I pray that all will make the right decision for them and their body. We are all phenomenal women. God bless you all.
Breast Cancer	Tracy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	6/27/2010 11:19:40 PM	I hope to say that is really effective, but who knows long term? Diagnosed in 2003, chemo-6 rounds, lumpectomy stage 2+ (but chemo shrunk it to stage 2)and 20 radiation treatments. Removed a few lymph nodes, found cancer in all, but did radiation on all of them as well vs removal of remainder. Completed treatment 2004, tamoxifen completed August 2009. I also had hot flashes, but I went thru immediate menopause so understandable. Also had severe leg cramps, weight gain and nails would not grow. They were rock solid before and were brittle and broke easily. Now that I am off, they grow normally. Also had memory loss and forgetfullness that has not gone away. Chemo related and tamoxifen enhanced. But I'm still here, so it's all worth it!

Surgery in Oct 09. No nodes involved. Had OncoDX done, no radiation therapy or chemo. Oncologist started me on Tamoxifen, 20mg in Nov 09 (7 mths). Side effects: irritability, hot flashes and night sweats, insomnia, rash on my face, one bout of infection, brain fuzziness, no weight gain or loss, some tiredness and occasional hip pain. Had my period for 6 mths, this is first mth with no period. Hooray! Sex life is fine. Overall, I feel the benefits of taking the drug outweigh the negatives at this point. I am blessed and will continue to live my life to the fullest on this drug. I pray that all will make the right decision for them and their body. We are all phenomenal women. God bless you all.

Lumpectomy, followed by 35 radiation treatments.  Now on Tamoxifen, 20 MG for past 4 1/2 months.  Terrible hot flashes, do not sleep thru the night, rash on face, hip pain, rib pain.  Oncologist took me off of it for six weeks to see if symptoms subside.  I feel vulnerable without it (the tamoxifen), hoping for an alternative drug.  I am peri-menopausal, so I understand some drugs will not work.  Wondering if removal of ovaries only option?

Went on Tamoxifen in Nov. 08. Had bad night sweats,aching hip joints, dryness. Stopped having periods. Had a kidney stone in Nov. 09 (no history previously) and catscan showed ovarian cyst (again, no history.) Went off T. and cyst resolved. Staying off this drug as it seems to do more harm than good for me.

I was post-menopausal when diagnosed through my annual mammo. Following rads, I tried 2 separate aromatase inhibitors which caused depression, fatigue and severe body pain. Gave each a 3 month trial - gave up on each. Decided to do Tamoxifen. After 8 months, lots of hot flashes, severe depression and fatigue, I quit the tamoxifen with my oncologist's blessings. Because my oncoDX score was low medium and my cancer was caught so early, the tamoxifen would statistically only afford me an 2% improvement in absolute (not relative) risk of recurrence. (Did that make sense?) Anyhow, I hope I'm doing the right thing. I began feeling better the next day after quitting.   used to be positive, funny, a generally happy person. I had not been myself for 2 years with treatment and these hormone therapies! I am grateful to be alive and regaining my health, mental and physical.

The onc. changed me to tamoxifen and I thought all was going well, but after several months I developed a blood clot in a deep vein. Now I'm on Aromasin and it's much harsher on my body.

Lymphnodes negative---Estrogen Positive--Oncodyte Test was good---I scored 12 out of 100. this gives me a 9% Re-occurrnece. I had Lumpectomy surgery and 33 treatments of Radiation---The Radiation was great---I felt like I was in a tanning bed. Since I have been on Tamoxifen-20mg. I have had side effects such as night sweats, headaches, dizziness and blurred vision. I am losing weight instead of gaining weight--which is great! I saw my doctor for other options-he said I can have my ovaries removed which would give me options of Femera, Aromasin or Arimidex. I checked on the reviews and the side effects tend to be simular. My other option would be to take 10mg in the am and 10mg in the PM to help reduce the side effects during the day when I am working. The other option would be to reduce to 10mg per day or not to take it at all---If I don't take it all all I will go from a 9% reoccurence to 13.5% re-occurrence. My doctor stated that I am youung and still producing Estrogen in my body---I  have decided that if I want to live a long life, I need to take this medication and just deal with the side effects. I know this will effect my quality of life for 5 years---I pray every day this does not come back---if taking this medication and possibly not even working for the next five years---I will do just that---because my health is that important to me.

Severe joint pain, nausea, and dizziness.  On Tax for one yr. I took myself off a month ago. I have tired of feeling irritable, hair loss, weight loss (35 lbs.), joint pain, and insomnia.  I feel like I'm gradually returning to normal.  Haven't found an oncologist that I like or trust.  I am a trained medical scientist.  I do not feel the oncologists are truthful about side effects!

I had mammosite radiation and 4 sesssions of chemo.  I've started Tamoxifen in October 2006 and switched to Arimidex in March 2008 but the side effects of Arimidex were terrible and switched back to Tamoxifen.  Overall the positives outweigh the negatives until I reach my 5 year in October 2011.  I've been able to deal with the hot flashes but the weight gain has been terrible and no matter what I do to lose nothing seems to work - it is very depressing.  However I keep telling myself that it is now only 1 1/2 years more and then i'm done.  Has any been successful with any diet to counteract T?

Breast Cancer	CGB, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	55-64	2/5/2010 6:21:53 PM	2 years ago I was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer with 1 postive lumph node on the left.  I had bilateral lumpectomies and then received 6 wks of radiation, no chemo.  I was initally perscribed Arimadex and took it for about 6 months.  I had to stop because I couldn't tolerate the side effects. My expercience with Tamoxifen has been leg/foot cramping mostly at night, joint pain, short term memory problems, depression and hot flashes.    Last month my oncologist suggested taking SAMe 400mg 2-4 times daily for depression and joint pain. I have also changed my diet to an antifungal diet recommended by Doug Kaufmann from knowthecause.com.  So far my joint pain is about 80% better and my energy and motivation has noticably improved.  Still having ocassional leg cramps at night but the hot flashes have decreased...not sure if it's due to the diet change or the SAMe.  Hope this helps someone!God Bless!!!

Just went off T because of unbearable side effects. Terrible hot flashes and night sweats. Severe joint and muscle pain. Chronic yeast infections. No sex drive. Depression got so bad I was thinking seriously of suicide even while on lexapro. No energy and can't sleep even with ambien. Gained 25 lbs. even while going to aerobics 3 times a week, weight lifting and walking 10 miles per week. Had to stop all this exercise due to pain. Been of T 7 days and symptoms are improving. I was told by my oncologist that effexor will interfere in the effectiveness of T. T is a miracle drug for some but at some point I had to make a choice between recurrence of cancer and quality of life and I only made the decision after much prayer and careful consideration and have left the rest up to my Lord Jesus. Each of you need to make a decision based on your individual results and I encourage you to stay with T if you can bear the side effects.

Lumpectomy showed no more invasive in the breast but lots of LCIS. Doctor was shocked to find 4 lymph nodes positive. Chemo followed. Then double mastectomies. Wanted to avoid the DIEP flap reconstruction so expanders were put in the same day. 5 weeks radiation. Have been on Tamoxifen for 3 months. First side effect noticed was my eyelashes were almost gone. Was scared to lose my hair again. Stopped T for 3 weeks but husband begged me to go back on it. Eyelashes are fully back. Main side effects since have been flushing, small headaches of short duration mainly around one eye, trouble sleeping, dizziness when suddenly sitting up or standing, no noticeable weight gain yet. I've read others comment on joint pain. I had achiness in my arms and legs after chemo. Had been drinking tons of water with Crystal Light as flavoring. It occured to my doc husband an uncommon side effect of the sweetener Aspartame is joint pain. Switched to Propel and the joint achiness immediately went away. Thought others would like to know this. Stay positive!!

I took a 45 day break and went back on T on October 15th. Blood work excellent and bilateral mammo perfect after a Stage 1 , lumpectomy and radiaiton last spring. Now, I have cystites in my uterous which were picked up by a tansvaginal ultra sound. Will have a biopsy done in the office on December 23rd. This is supposed to be a common side effect of T. Who knows? The probitic acidopholous really, really works. I also take lots of Vitamin D as per my oncologist. Dexascan slightly better this year than last. Still have osteoporosous so when I switch to Arimidex in 2 years, I will go on Actonel or Boniva. T works on building up the bones differently. Too risky to take another bone med. now.

Awful joint and muscle pains making it hard to function and walk.  Terrible hotflashes until the dr. put me on Gabapentin.  Helped A LOT!  Memory losses, hair loss, tiredness, no ambition.

I started on Tamoxifen and stayed on it for 2 years. I was switched to Aromasin and took it for 6 months. I had swelling of face hands and feet, Weight gain, unbearable leg and feet pain. I am switching back to Tamoxifen after consulting with my oncologist.  Aromasin just was not tolerated well. I am a very happy active person and I could not even take walks anymore and became so depressed. Hopefully on Tamoxifen again, I will have the night sweats again but not the pain I have been experiencing with Aromasin.

I thought I was getting old and decrepit at the age of 50 something!  I have really bad leg, muscle and joint pains since I have been on Tamoxifen for 3 years.  Also have lots of yeast infections and horrible itching quite often and hair thinning.  I'm glad to see that I wasn't prematurely aging!!!  A neighbor of mine was also on Tamox for 5 years and experienced the same things.  I was so relieved to hear that from her. My question to anyone is:  Do any of you have to be on pain medication for your pain?  My oncologist thinks that there is something else wrong because I have to have the pain medication to treat the pain.  He says that there isn't anyone else that has to take pain medication because of Tamox.  Sure would like to hear from any of you that have had to have pain meds.  Thanks again for each and everyone for your comments.

I was one of the unlucky ones.  I took Tamoxifen for 6 weeks, and of the 20 plus side effects they list I saw about 15 of them along with a couple not listed.  Huge blood spots broke out under the skin on both legs, I lost about 20 lbs, and have never felt so bad in my life.  Words do not describe how this medicine made me feel. Cramping toes, unbelievable hot flashes, no appetite, extreme tiredness, fuzzy brained....I could go on. I will take my chances on recurrance of cancer than have the quality of life I had with this medication.

Breast Cancer	Survivor, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	9/23/2009 2:01:30 PM	First of all want to let you all know that I am a 9 yr breast cancer survivor. Mastectomy and 5 months of chemo. I had terrible hot flashes and night sweats.  I did Tamoxifen for 4 years at which time my memory was so bad I was leaving the elctric burners on, on the kitchen range. I also lost a very good job because of my memory problems. (My doctor said no one could prove that it caused memory loss at that time anyway.)  I then went off of Tamoxifen on my own. (My husband insisted.) My B.C. was Estrogen positive and had already had a complete hysterectomy 2 years before; but now cannot take hormone drugs ever again. My memory improved a lot after discontinuing the Tamoxifen.  Originally I was told that my memory would improve about a year after chemo; but it did not.  Still have memory problems; drawing blanks on words and transposing words; ie: hot for cold, etc.But yes, I am a survivor and thank God every day for the extra time I have been given!! God Bless you all as you go through this journey....

Back on the Tamoxifen October 115th. If I get another yeast infection (3rd) he will switch me to Arimidex. Then, I will need a Dexascan first since I went off Actonel years ago since I was afraid of getting cancer of the bone.

Hot flashes has been the worse sympton I have experienced.  Have had some weight gain, but uncertain if this is due to the medication or just knowing it could happen; Also, have had some cramping in my legs, but again, this also occurred before I began the Tamoxifen.  I have decided to see what the next 6 months bring and compare.

My BC was small enough that the dr. felt radiation was not necessary.My main side effect has been intolerable hot flashes. Tried Effexor generic and it made me sick. My dr. prescribed Megace. I was afraid to take it at first because it is mainly used for weight gain in HIV patients. However, their dose is 400-800mg. daily and I am taking 20mg. After two weeks, my flashes have completely stopped during the day. Do have a couple upon waking up so dr. said to take 20mg. at night. Side effects say possible sleeplessness so am holding off for the time being. Overall, Tamoxifen is doing its job and I only have 4 yrs. and 4 mos. to go.....

Also I have had two urinary tract infections, a bacterial infection and vaginal soreness and flushing for the last 6 weeks.I had not had any of these problem before.

Of course it is Canndida Gibata and must be treated with Terconazole. What to do? My recurrance rate was 15% by doing nothing and 9 % with rad and Tam. I did 34 of radiation. I see the oncologist next Thursday. Everyone thinks I am bonkers but I googled Tamofifen + yeast infection and there it was! Anyone else have this problem?

I also found summer heat &amp; outside activities bother me. Test coming back great .I feel some of the symptoms that others complain about is from forcing your body into menopause before it is ready.

Is this normal?
Breast Cancer	Sarahdoc, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	7/26/2009 10:06:26 PM	I have ADD. The symptoms increased dramatically when I started using tamoxifen.Had to stop taking it after 2.5 years. It felt like having fibro-myalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome at the same time. I was severely depressed and even contemplated suicide. Was crippled by arthritis, couldn't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes, became disoriented, emotionally unstable. I'm a clinical psychologist, Ph.D., but had to stop working because of symptoms. None of my doctors could tell what was wrong with me. Stopped taking it 3 years ago, and much of my cognitive functioning hasn't returned. I know many doctors who admit they won't treat a patient who won't take tam. This is unconscionable, as is the behavior of doctors who withhold discussing possible side effects for fear patient will refuse it. As far as I could find out, there has been practically no research on the cognitive side-effects. I think it is absolutely essential that these cognitive symptoms receive attention and research. Patients with ADHD MUST BE WARNED of possible side effects. This drug can ruin your life.

I learned to take it at bedtime due to nausea and slight dizziness if taken during the day. I do wake up sometimes after being asleep for about an hour,I get up and walk around the house until I feel I can try to lie down again. This doesnt help with being up at 6 am to go to work. Within past 2 wks I have developed left leg pain. Not sure what is causing this. Will report this to onocologist though. I am not a pill taker so I really don't like taking this med but it is said to cut my risk of developing breast cancer in half, I guess it is worth the risks.

Had that done in Jan 09, got called back for MR-guided core needle biospies x2 areas of concern. 1 came back DCIS,another lumpectomy in Feb 09 then 28 radiation treatments followed. Now into second month of Tamoxifen. I discovered early on to take at bedtime, however I do wake up and wander around the house at times. Not so good when I need to be up at 6 am to go to work. Occasional night and day sweats, (I am post-menopausal, so I thought that I had the night sweat thing behind me but they are back.) Become more easily fatigued, not sure whether to blame Tamoxifen, radiation, the stress of the surgery, the diagnosis or all of it! Most recently developed left hip pain with radiation down back of left leg. Not sure if this is something to worry about or not. Unilateral leg pain often symptom of deep vein thrombosis so I am going to call oncologist to report this to him. I do worry about taking the med then I worry if I don't take it there may be recurrence of cancer. It is a very confusing time in my life and I am a nurse of 33 yrs! One would think that I would have all the answers. I am trying to put faith and trust in my team of doctors,I know they are following the &quot;standard of care&quot;. God bless all of you who are dealing with the same issue.This diagnosis has given my new insight as a nurse.
Breast Cancer	JMO, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	7/17/2009 10:01:49 AM	I had invasive, Stage 1. I underwent 2 lumpectomies and 6 weeks of radiation before starting Tamoxifen. After taking this drug for 12 months I was exhausted and had nausea every morning that lasted through the entire day at times. Luckily my oncologist suspected liver damage and sent me to a liver specialist. Turns out my AST and ALT levels were steadily climbing. Four months later these levels were 10 times what they should be and I had developed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). I immediately stopped taking Tamoxifen but it took 6 months for my liver readings to return to normal. After consulting with my oncologist and radiologist we decided the risk to my liver was far greater than the risk of reoccurance. It's been almost a year now and I feel great!

I have only been on tamoxifen for three months now, I had to have the surgery then Radiation and after that I was rather weak and had to rebuild my strenght so that they could remove my thyroid 'had multi gouiters on both sides 172 grams removed on the right side and 133 from the left, so large that the surgeon I decided on stated that mine was the largest he had yet to see and remove in the USA and he is very notable for his work, an artist of sort if I say so my self 'I have such a small scare that is hardly noticable that surprised me to high heaven!  So just back to working on this dang depresent state of mind in finding something that can be used with my tamoxfien!

I am a mother of 2 young girl and wife to a very supportive man. I am the only 1 of 7 girls (2nd to youngest)to have breast cancer. All sisters checked yearly was my first mammo. I starting taking this farce 2 months after initial surgery (no more breast tissue). Have been active and healty all my life. I can relate to the side effects. Starting 1 month after starting to take each of the following popped in at a rate of 2 each week. Depression, Blood pressure high even w/pills to lower, outer vaginal rash/itching all over, joint pain I limp after sitting at my desk at work, or driving, isomni, Sweating during the day just going to the bathroom or moving around, tired/ lack of motivation, gained 10 pounds immediately and then kept gaining and swelling everywhere could tell if I had any salt the day before. After I quit taking last month I want to get busy in the bedroom, exercise, don't have to keep buying clothes every week, take my girls to have fun and the sweats and cramping in legs and feet have decreased to a dull roar. I felt I was pushed into taking this pill and I see no benefit to my quality of life. Am encouraged to see other woman say no........ I will not take multiple other drugs to keep this other cancer causing pill under control. I enjoy keeping my wits about me to take care of my family,make choices to improve mental and physical health. I know there are other choices but for me I am looking forward to running and getting in snuggle time with my family.

I continue because I'm afraid to stop.  The experience has been torture but it's better than cancer.

I will be as simplistic as possible.  Benefits seem to outweigh the negatives.  Treatment should include a slower introduction to the drug and move the dosage up to avoid the side effects.  I grind my pill up and put it in yogurt.  This lessened the side effects for me.  My breast tissue changed very quickly on this drug. They wanted me on 20 mg but the side effects were severe and I went on 10mg.  My mother survived breast cancer and was given 5 mg.  I think this is a miracle drug from what we have seen in my family.  Caution should be used  to adjust your body to this drug.

That was 3 years ago. It's so easy - like taking a vitimin everyday.  Hot flashes?  Occasionally - but definitely bearable - and they have lessened over time. 
Breast Cancer	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	6/5/2009 6:55:41 PM	this medication cause me a lot of other problems. I was having panic attach, high blood pressure, could not sleep well and could not  concentrate. To deal with the side effect I was taking lexapro to deal with the panic attach, xanax, and a high blood pressure medication. I did stop taking tamoxifen and everything went back to normal. I am not sure if the cancer will be back, but I really needed my life back to normal. I prefer to live well that little I have left then try to stay alive and die for the side effect just to prevent recurrence of the cancer. I was diagnosed in 2006.

When he told me only 3% and yet refused to change me to another drug, I quit taking it myself.  I am now about to go back for another lump found in my breast (in the scar tissue) and will find out the results soon.  Even so, I am glad I did not continue this drug.

The &quot;hot flashes&quot; are not too terrible. They have increased over the months but not a big deal at all. I do get sad but never suicidal or deeply depressed. Giving up watching the news and crime shows daily cured my blues. Gained some weight and ran to see Jenny Craig! I have had some increased amounts of hair falling out however completely unnoticeable. And finally, I have had only one period since my double mastectomy last June which was two and a half months before I started taking Tamoxifen. What a nice bonus! I have also had three reconstructive surgeries while taking Tamoxifen with no problems. Attitude is 90% of the cure. I am happy, I am alive! Don't sweat the little side affects, things could always be worse. Good luck to you all. :)

Got my first blood work and have fibrin strands in my blood sample. Never knew that my 2 calf cramps were due to T, I thought it was from my Physical Therapy for my bad back. Need to talk to my oncologist on Monday. Eye exam in Sept and Gyno exam in October. I worry about getting a blood clot. May go off this drug if symptoms progress and go on Arimidex and a shot for my bones once a year. Don't know how my bone density is since last October. My oncaDX said I had a 15% recurrance rate and 9% with the 34 radiation treatments I had and taking T for 3 years and Arimidex for 2 years. I am kind of concerned now.

Breast Cancer	Peggy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	4/22/2009 7:34:19 PM	This was possibly the worst medication I ever attempted to take.  Found a list of 35 side effects and I had 32.  Couldn't sleep, weight gain, hair loss, deep depression, among other side effects.  Quit taking it and was changed to femara.  It was even worse in it's side effects.  Depression  Was so bad that I was threatened with termination from work. Was told &quot;Having cancer was not as bad as getting a divorce&quot;.  A lot they would know.  These 2 ladies who told me that should walk a mile in my shoes.  Finally,  I sought a 2nd opinion from another oncolgist.  He reviewed my history and since I had less than 1 cm lump that had not spread, he decided that I could go off both of the medicines I had tried at one time or another.  My depression was so bad that I am now on Cymbalta, thank goodness it has helped.  I am still having side effects after almost a year but they are slowly disappearing.

Started on tam Nov '05. Constant hot flashes, b6 helps a little, efexxor made me feel weird. Hard time sleeping, sleep aids make me feel groggy. Weight gain, was always thin before, now it's hard to lose. Leg cramps, magnesium helps greatly. Vaginal dryness for the last year, ouch! I feel like I've aged a lot physically. I do like that I stopped having periods after 6 mos, hope they stay away after I'm done. I'm happy to be alive and plan to keep taking it for the full 5 years even though it's been rough, the Dr said it means it's working, which also helps me to keep on going. I will be having a huge celebration in Nov '10! Good luck to all of you, keep on keepin' on! 
Breast Cancer	irajayhawker, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/6/2009 6:52:06 PM	I have chosen NOT to take Tamoxifen. Too many side effects for me. I was diagnosed with DCIS Breast Cancer. Found during routine mammogram. Had lumpectomy and am starting radiation next week. My doctor explained to me that Tamoxifen is separate from radiation, it does not go hand in hand. Radiation will decrease the chance of the cancer from coming back in the one breast. Tamoxifen decreases the chance 50% from cancer appearing any where. so the way i look at it is it is a 50/50 chance either way. Not enough for me to take Tamoxifen. This to me is a very scary drug. Everyone of course needs to make their own decisions. But before taking it i would research and not take it unless you feel comfortable with your decision. I hope this helps people trying to make this decision. talk to your doctor, surgeon, oncologist, and radiation doctor before making your decision. 
Breast Cancer	dedav, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	4/5/2009 12:04:43 AM	I am frustrated that I have not been able to find statistics that would help me make an educated decision on whether or not to continue the tamoxifen as I am very concerned about all the possible side effects.  Almost all info states that the risks are worth the benefits.  I am not convinced.  If my risk before the chemo and radiation was 10% of recurring, how much does taking this drug decrease my risk of getting breast cancer again.  I had a lumpectomy for stage 1, 1 cm ER positive tumor which had not spread to the lymph nodes, with good boundaries. What is the chance that I will develop another cancer due to taking the tamoxifen which is a known carcinogen.  How wise it to give women who have had breast cancer a drug that is a carcinogen?  My fear is that if I stop taking it, my luck it would return &amp; then I would kick myself for not staying on it. IF I continue to take it, any one of many possible horrible side effects could occur. I wish I could have some peace of mind!  I am also concerned about what the lack of estrogen is doing to my aging process.  I feel that I have aged considerably since taking this medication.  Not to mention that if I have a stroke at my age, or vision problems, I may have 30 years to live with those side effects.  What are the odds of getting these side effects?  I haven't been able to find this information. If anyone can help answer these questions, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you.

Has a hysterectomy 10 years ago but no breast cancer or lumps to date.  Don't like the sounds of the horrible side effects of Tamoxifin. Just have gotten the hot flashes/night sweats somewhat under control after the hysterectomy.  Any suggestions/recommendations from anyone else in a similar situation would be greatly appreciated.

Breast Cancer	GinaS, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/16/2009 7:16:21 PM	So far so good. Learned after my second upset stomach to take with food. People , please look up the interactions and anything else on T. Be sure to tell your doctor all meds,  herbs and vitamins you are taking. They have now found out that depression meds can make T not work. Black Co hash is estrogen. Do NOT take Omega-3 Fatty Acids or any antioxidants. They interact with T. Now I am going to be tested for the CDY4D6 genotype. 7-10% of women will not benefit from T with this out of whack. Also, if have a variant of e-cadhern protein, T will cause a different kind of aggressive cancer. I have been on T for about a month and no side effects except my nails have become brittle even though I take gelatin caps. Small price to pay. I am Stage 1, oncaDX 15, had a lumpectomy and second surgery for clear margin. I have 12 more radiation treatments and have some redness since didn't really spread the aloe gel around. No chemo thank God!
Breast Cancer	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	3/15/2009 3:04:34 AM	Lumpectomy no nodes involved Started on tamoxifen after having lumpectomy, chemo(5 treatments of 8) and radiation.Stopped chemo due to allergic reaction to taxol. radiation was a breeze(33 treatments). After 1 week of tamoxifen i got horrible hand pain. Drs said it was carpel tunnel and arthritis. to young and it came on suddenly so i didn't beleive this.Couple weeks later and no releif from tylenol, ibuprofen and tramadol. I realized that the pain started after taking tomoxifen and i stopped taking it. Contacted Dr.and he put me on gabapentin and to hold tamoxifen for a week. Hand pain is slowly getting better but i really know it if i am late at taking the gabapentin.Hoping to quit tamoxifen all together.

I was DX with stage 3 Adenocarcinoma in July 2004, &quot;my hubby did a little squeeze&quot;. He found my lump. it turned out to be not one, but five lumps in three diferrent positions on my right breast. Thankfully they all grew independently, and it was determind to not have been metastasized.

Surgery in May with a 2 cm cancer.  No nodes involved, radiation therapy only, with tamoxifen after.  I've been taking tamoxifen for 3 months now.  I had regular periods for the first two months, no period this month.  Night sweats (bearable), some fuzzy-headedness, dry mouth (especially during winter).  Minute weight gain, but my side hurts where the lump was removed.  I read another lady had the same problem.  I find that when I use that side (stretching, lifting, sometimes even holding the leash in that hand when I walk the dogs) causes that side to hurt.  I try to favor the left and use heat when the right bothers me.  Not having a period is weird, don't know yet whether I like it or not.  Sex life is fine.  All in all I've had a pretty positive experience thus far.

No chemo required due to excellent results from OncoDX testing.  I have experienced occasional night sweats and weight gain.  However, I am also experiencing a lot of pain in both armpits.  I have swelling at times.  Body is achy (flu-like symptoms).  Oncologist and internist not very concerned.  They both feel these are side effects of tamoxifen.  Is anyone else experiencing pain and swelling in the armpits?

I was extremely tired so my oncologist suggested I take it in the evening and that has helped considerably. I wish I had known that sooner.

Other than some joint pain, and some hair loss, I really don't think my experience has been that difficult. Life is so important to me that having some discomfort with a drug is no big deal !

I've gained over 10 pounds in the last year and a half on this drug.  My appetite has increased.  I have been unable to lose the weight despite intense exercise, weight lifing and yoga.  Very frustrating.  I know I should be grateful that my cancer has not returned, but the weight gain really has gotten me down.
Breast Cancer	monitor, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	55-64	11/28/2008 10:44:05 PM	I did have difficulty with mood swings and a general depressive feeling for much of the 5 years I took daily doses of tamoxifen.  My weight steadily increased and after 5 years on the drug, losing even a portion of that weight is difficult. A brief trial of Femera, about 3 months, was most unpleasant, with excessive vsginal dryness during intercourse.  I stopped the drug.

Initially I had lots of hot flashes and my period stopped almost immediately(yeah!) I'm 46, had stage 1, had chemo, radiation and now on T. I have had some kind of infection in the outer vagina since the beginning and none of my doctors can figure out what it is - anyone else with this proble? Also a constant yeast infection. Also a very dry vagina making sex impossible due to pain. I have told my doctor that after 1 year we will look at alternatives. He will test my hormones to see if I am post menopausal yet, is so, we will switch to an AI. If not, he tells me my only other alternative is steroids. I WILL NOT take them. If necessary I will simply stop taking! The side effects are killing my sex life and my marriage. I have zero sex drive.

Now, six months later, I wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced chronic diarrhea? I've been having issues with it, and can almost pinpoint the onset to about a month after I started taking this drug. None of the posts have made mention of it. Anyone?

Breast Cancer	Dots, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	9/20/2008 11:27:37 AM	I have real bad hot flashes, leg and joint pain sometimes are horrible.  Eyes tear up easy, fatigue is a norm. Brain Fog a lot and Nausea at times. No weight gain but, I've cut back on the sugars and grains. I take Vitamin E, D3, Multivitamin, Calcium with D, Glucosamine, Magnesium to give back what the Tamoxifen and my high blood pressure pill take away and Lots of water daily.    Joined a Yoga class and walk and try to do something each day to keep the weight off.  I was told to watch my intake of Soy as that can act as an estrogen when taking Tamoxifen. I get headaches...low back pain, and now have a bacterial infection and discharge.  Have an inflamed ovary now also...ultrasound next week...no periods since Jan. 08 when I started chemo..simple/radical mastectomy ...17 nodes taken all clear...invasive ductal carcinoma.  Stage 1 In Oct. of 07 1.3cm...Nov. 07 Stage 2- 2.5cm  Grade 3.  Suppose to be on Tamoxifen for 2 years started it in March of 08.  Then suppose to go on 5 years Arimidex. All in all if this works GREAT...I am 46 and would like to be around for a few more years without Cancer as a recurrance. Pray Daily!!

I guess it helped to put me into clinical menopause.  I do have hot flashes but they don't bother me. I have maintained a very active schedule with really no complaints, weight gain, or mood changes.

OncoDX test resulted in low recurrance level. Oncologist recommended tamoxifen instead of chemo.  I have experienced weight gain and made an appt. with a weight mgmt/nutrionist doctor to address this issue.  Hopefully she can put me on a helathy diet that will result in weight loss.

I have had slight weight gain and experienced hot flashes - some minor, some more intense.  Nothing I can't deal with.  My dr was going to put me on Efexor for the hot flashes, but after looking on WebMD and reading reviews of others on this drug, I decided it wasn't worth it.  99% of the reviews for Efexor were frightening.  I am so glad I checked it out on here before going on that drug.  As for the tamoxifen, so far so good.  I guess we won't know until later in life if it was successful, but I'm sticking with it.

It's been 13 days and while I don't see immediate results, I'm staying off of it.  I gained 16 pounds since January and now find it really hard to lose.  The hot flashes seemed to have subsided, now let's see about the sex drive. The vaginal discharge was horrible for about 3 months but seemed to have gotten better.  If I hadn't read the comments on this site, I never would have stopped taking it.  I think while it may be great for some, it was horrible for me.  Thanks again everyone.
Prevention of Breast Cancer	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	8/17/2008 9:30:21 PM	I began Tamoxifen on 7/1/08.  I have gained 7 pounds (all in my belly) and have had tons of hot flashes.  I also have crampiness in my belly and have to use the bathroom frequently.  I discontinued use because I felt it was interfering with my quality of life.  The more I exercised, the more weight I gained.  I'm disappointed.  Did anyone else experience this?
Breast Cancer	tamoxofen hater,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female		8/6/2008 11:40:48 AM	I, like many women on this site, was diagnosed with early breast cancer a year ago.  I had the Mammosite Radiation procedure and a lumpectomy.  The Oncologist put me on Tamoxofen for 5 years.  In the 9 months that I have been taking this horrible drug, I have had the following side effects:  Loss of sexual desire, vaginal dryness, vaginal discharge, hot flashes, weight gain, fatigue (no matter how much I sleep), and a feeling of being mentally foggy.As of today, I am going to stop taking it.  After reading everyone's comments, I feel I would be better off seeing if I get my energy back, lose the weight I put on and regain my sex drive.The negatives far outweigh the positives for me.Thanks to everyone who took the time to input their comments.

I am 47 yrs.old. I was Stage 1. I had a Lumpectomy and Radiation. From the start of taking the med. I have been having Hot Flashes/Night Sweats, Weight Gain, Hair Loss, Irregular or Heavy Bleeding,Constant Thirst,Mood Swings/Depression,Trouble Sleeping,Yeast Infections.{ WOW! } Way too many side effects for me to continue using the Tamoxifen.And I worry about long term side effects. I think exercising, eating a good diet, and( praying) is better than taking a pill that could cause other problems.

Breast Cancer	Salvation, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	7/21/2008 8:26:13 PM	I refuse to take this drug.  i have done extensive research and for me, I do not beleive this will help my 'Quality &quot; of life.  Way tooo mnay side effects.  i have had a double mastectomy due to satge 2 invasive lobular carcinoma. No radiation was required. My oncologist wants me to take this in case the cancer has spread. They have no way of knowing if it has spread due to the fact that i had a rare undetectable cancer. never showed on the two mamo's i had or the ultrasound. Only a soft tissue MRI showed any growth. I did have chemo and that wiped me out.  The pathology report showed all cancer gone.  I do not want to spend the rest of my life taking drugs to ward off any 'chance' of a reoccurrance elsewhere in the body. Especially, when the drug can give one cancer, and many other health risks.   I would rather live healthy in mind about my decision than second guess a maybe.  Hope this helps some of you.

I had 2 lumpectomies, radiation, and bilateral mastectomies.  i've been taking tamoxifen for about a year and a half i think.  i had no peri-menopausal symptoms prior to taking it.  i still don't have hot flashes, night sweats, or anything like that, but my period trickled off and now i've only had 1 period in the past year.  my gynocologist said i have plenty of hormones and am not peri or menopausal.  i never thought i'd miss my period ... i think i've been somewhat depressed since i started taking it.  i've had some very squishy weight gain.  i've had all kinds of gynecological issues that i never use to have.  i've been diagnosed with lichen sclerosis.  i have an ongoing yeast infection and i don't have a history of them.  at least i had a good sex life til i was diagnosed with those, now it hurts to have sex.  i wish i knew more pre-menopausal women on tamoxifen to talk to.  i hate this med but my oncologist doesn't seem to want to talk about anything else.   i don't know if the medicine is &quot;effective&quot; for me until i live the rest of my life without getting breast cancer again so i rated that a &quot;1&quot;.  sure, the medication is &quot;easy&quot; to use, i swallow a pill every day.  i'm not sure if tamoxifen is causing my gynecological problems, depression, weight gain, and tiredness, but in case it is, i'll rate &quot;ease of use&quot; a &quot;1&quot;, too.  damn.  i didn't realize how much i sounded like eeyore.

Worst side effects ever. Uncontrollable hot flashes, horrible weight gain, pains and aches. Hot flashes were not controllable even after effexor. Doctor switched me to Evista and although the weight gain is bad, the effects of evista are hardly anything. Am happy i am off the tamoxifen.  Evista has been approved for early stage breast cancer and i am feeling MUCH better, heavier, but better!!

Five years ago I started taking Tamoxifen. 3 days ago I got done with my 5 years. During the 5 years I have had joint pain I have not felt like I had energy to do much, I had really bad hot flashes. Would I take it again and go though 5 years of this.... YES!!! 3 days ago I stopped taking Tamoxifen and I am already starting to feel better. I was told that I should feel like a new woman within 2 weeks. I am counting down the days. Right now I do fine for a while and then all of a sudden I can't keep my eyes open. My doctor said that I will be that way for a little while and then one day I will wake up and be totaly awake and have my energy back. I am just so glad they now have RX like Tamoxifen to give us a fighting chance.

Thank the Lord, I am cancer free at this time!

Breast Cancer	Me, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	65-74	5/10/2008 12:08:31 PM	I had been taking estrogen injections for 24 years until my breast cancer diagnosis. Off the HRT, I began having severe, frequent hot flashes. After mastectomy and 2 doses of chemo(I felt like more would kill me it was so horrible), I've been on Tam for a month.The hot flashes are even worse despite using  Vit E, Black Cohash, &amp; now trying Clonidine and Gabapentin: mood swings and depression plus worsened (long term) insomnia.  I must decide if living this way is worthwhile. I may opt to go off Tam and back on estrogen.
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	Diane, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	4/28/2008 5:01:19 PM	I have been on this drug for approximately 6 weeks after initially trying Arimidex and not being able to tolerate it. I am post-menopausal so am not experiencing many of the harsher side effects as many of you, though that's not to say they won't pop up in the future. After my negative experience with Arimidex, this drug has been been relatively easy for me to tolerate. Main &quot;symptoms&quot; have been: sluggish, little energy and mentally fuzzy at times, difficulty sleeping some nights, mini hot flashes that come on about an hour after taking the drug then subside after a short time, and occasional charley horse cramps in my feet. If this is the extent of the side effects, I'll be delighted. After my Arimidex experience, I was terrified that I wouldn't be able to tolerate any of the follow-up hormone treatments, but so far so good.

Breast Cancer that has Spread to Another Part of the Body	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/21/2008 3:53:07 AM	Diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in November 2007, my doctors are amazed at the miraculous recovery they have seen and the way my body has responded to tamoxifen.  Tamoxifen not only treats the cancer of the breasts and the metastasis to my liver as well but in three months od taking the drug it has continued to control the cancer in my bone and since sarting the treatment in Feb 07, my liver enzymes have gone down from over 800 to 267 and the high normal is 111.  The doctors no longer consider my condition terminal and the best part of the whole thing is that I have the confidence o knowing I get to be a mother to my five month old daughter.  I was diagnosed in my seventh month of pregnancy and I was 32 years old at the time of my diagnosis.

So I guess I won't be able to tell the difference when I go on Tam.  My Doc recommended Remefemin,  Black Cohosh, Soy, Vitamin E, Multi + B Complex vitamins and if needed my Effexor increased, since I am already on it.

Had chemotherapy first, then lumpectomy, then radiation, then tamoxifen. Been on and off Tamoxifen since July 2007. Finally reached the point where I can't take it anymore. I have foot cramps and sometimes leg cramps. My menstrual flows are inconsistent with heavy bleeding. I have experienced terrible hot flashes and nausea. I was given effexor which adds to my fatigue and too much increases nausea. The worse symptom is the extreme fatigue. It makes me feel like I am becoming ill, and it happens at various times of the day, sometimes only one time per week, sometimes multiple times. The doctor has tested my thyroid and blood sugar, but can't help me. I want to give up even though the doctor tells me it is dangerous for me not to take the pill.

I have been told of yet another side effect. I now have a heart condition called cardiomyopathy. I am only 41 and too young to feel this old! I am grateful that I will soon be off Tam (by the way also probably was a major contributor to extreme heavy bleeding which lead to a partial hyst.) and on to an AI. All you who are younger watch your heart! Get a baseline EKG ASAP.

Started taking Tamoxifen 3 months ago.  Hot flashes for first month then no side effects at all.  My periods stopped during my chemo and came back this past week.  I'm am concerned why they have come back and now considering hystorectomy.  Going to the doctor soon to have questions answered.  
Prevention of Breast Cancer	annieruns2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	4/1/2008 7:36:09 PM	I am taking this drug after 5 of my doctors said I should take this drug for prevention of Breast Cancer. I am a 14 yr survior of Hodgkins. I am taking this drug because of all the radiation I received in my treatment. I have pretty much taken all the radiation I can receive to my upper chest area. At the time I also took 4 chemo drugs for 6 months. I am now 41 yrs old. I am having tons of side effects. Hot Flashes   ( worst then the ones from chemo) and many sleepless nights. I have also had some emotional days( which are not pleasant because I work with young children). Leg cramps and severe foot craps. I am trying to combat sleepless nights by exercising. Have not had any weight gain. But I have added miles to my runs and even added an extra &quot;run&quot; day. On days when I run I can get several hours of sleep. Wish I didn't have to take the tamoxifen. But when 5 out of 5 doctors encourage you to take something then you take it. Got to go having a flash now! Stay well everyone!
Breast Cancer	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	4/1/2008 9:24:34 AM	I've been on Tamoxifen for 2 1/2 years for Stage 3 Breast Cancer following bi-lateral mastectomy, chemo and radiation. The hot flashes are tough and I've gained about 10 pounds but that is probably due to lack of exercise and poor eating habits. I have terrible back pain and nerve pain (not sure if it is attributable to Tamoxifen). Some vaginal discharge but most of my symptoms of leg cramps and muscle pain have subsided with time. I have had emotional issues but those too seem to have gotten better with time. My Dr. told me hot flashes are a good thing because they mean the Tamoxifen is working - that makes them bearable. I'll take the side effects if it means I get to see my kids grow up!
Prevention of Breast Cancer	spicygrits(Girls Raised In The South), 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	3/26/2008 11:06:11 AM	Dxd with IDCIS Stage I RT. Treated with lumpectomy. Lymph nodes negative. Margins not clear. Needed mastectomy.  Four weeks later did bilateral mastectomy with TRAM reconstruction. When I started Tamoxifen I had terrible headaches which went away after 1 month then the bone/joint pain started.  It was terribly severe. Because of postoperative anemia I could not take NSAIDs.  My period stopped after 2 months on tamoxifen.  On month 3 I began heavy menstrual bleeding which lasted 4 months and was stopped after a hysterectomy.  The pathology report from the hysterectomy was negative and it is likely that Tamoxifen caused the adenomyosis symptoms and the bleeding.  I am happy to get &quot;anything that could get cancerous&quot; out of my body and do not regret the total hysterectomy.  Upon resuming Tamoxifen again the headaches are not as bad but the joint pain makes it impossible for me to do my job (clerical) I'm going to try physical therapy and possibly a TENS unit but if it does not work I am not sure I will continue the Tamoxifen.  I cannot afford to be unemployed.  I am doing healthy dieting-limiting sugars (cancer's favorite food) and will start exercise program after physical therapy to educate me on new movements because of my abdominal (TRAM flap) reconstruction.

The hot flashes/night sweats are unbearable.  I can't sleep sweating all night.  I actually sleep with Ice packs, fans, etc.  I have put on so much weight and I don't eat more than I used too.  I am so miserable.  I don't have the major mood swings of menopause because I take effexor, which helps.  I can't believe they can't find a &quot;cure&quot; for the hot flashes/night sweats.  The doctors just shrug, &quot;Oh, well&quot;...  This is no life, I spend the summer inside and very rarely leave the house and I'm only 43...  It's so embarrassing having a hot flash at the grocery store, they look at me like I'm nuts...  I'd rather go through Chemo again than live like this...

I am trying to get through this but I am at my wits end.  Started walking and dieting and still weight gain. I can live with that but the hot flashes are unbearable.  I can put up with most side effects from my medications, this is the first to throw me a loop. Havent had a good sleep since starting tamoxifen{two fans in bedroom, window open in winter  zero temperatures] wearing shorts and halters in daytime.  I just want to cry.I was always an easy going,happy  person, now I am tired ,hot and cranky. seeing doctor next week to see if some medication help or change will work. considering going off the drug as I cant live like this.

Breast Cancer	princess, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	2/27/2008 4:22:20 PM	The first 60 days I experienced severe joint pain and heavy feeling in muscles-aching and mental foggines. I thought you gotta be kidding me.  All those symptoms disappeared after 60 days. I hung in there to give it enough time for my body to synthesize to the medication. The only remarkable issue I am having is a burning sensation around the vulva which I have never experienced prior to using this drug.  Can't seem to get a straight answer from anyone if it is related to the drug.  I will say this-I quit smoking recently using Chantix and I do think it has had a positive effect on mood enhancement due to the way it works with the dopamine receptors in the brain.  The mental fog has cleared that I was experiencing after treatment and early use of tamoxifen and I feel much more like I use to before cancer!

All mammograms are clear so guess it must have done it's job.

Have not slept since I've been on it, sleep 20 mins up 45.  Leg cramps, night sweats and hot flashes keep me company while I'm not sleeping.  My cancer was caught early, slow growing and non-invasive.  I'm going to take my chances without tamoxifen - the quality of my life means more to me than the fear of a reoccurrence.  If my cancer had been more aggressive, or if my treatment had been more intense, I might reconsider.

How come it prevents breast cancer when it is possible to cause three other types of cancer???? Shouldn't it prevent ALL cancers????If I am on it to stop estrogen dominance, why can't I use natural progesterone cream instead which would do the same job WITHOUT the side effects.?????Am seeing Specialist tomorrow and WILL NOT USE IT ANY MORE.
