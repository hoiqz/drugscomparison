Cold Symptoms	thehoffaman, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	4/7/2010 10:09:34 AM	I would take that one review with one star with a grain of salt...i don't think its meant to do much for no voice- but it worked wonders for a runny nose, head congestion and overall cold symptoms- Its definitely worth a try!

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	bob, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	4/18/2009 7:12:23 PM	acute sinus infection, burning nasal passages, ears affected, stuffy with occasional runny nose.I slept for two days while taking ala-hist d and slept without disruption from running or stuffy nose. I am six foot and 200 lbs and tapered off my use quickly when symptoms diminished as driving on a full dose didn't seem to be a good thing.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/26/2009 1:33:39 PM	Ihave tried everyone from benedryl, claritin, to zyrtec and none seem to work at a full day except ala-hist D. After my physician suggested I should try this first to see if it works, I was completely feeling better after just 2 days of taking it. I live in a state where weather change is every other day and my allergies are no help either. I find this drug very effective especially with anyone with severe allergies.

Non-Seasonal Allergic Runny Nose	VCS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/22/2008 1:31:50 PM	I have tried many different prescription and OTC drugs: Xyzal, Clarinex, Claritin D, Alavert D, and more and Ala-hist D is the only drug effective enough to last all day.  After comparing active ingredients, Ala-Hist D has 25 mg diphenhydramine, 20mg phenylephrine and 6 mg brompheniramine maleato which pretty much blows all the others off the charts by comparison.  My only complaint about the drug is that I was not able to easily find it in retail drug stores and could only order it through my mail order prescription plan.  It was expenisve but very much worth it.
