Convulsive Seizures	Cesar, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	8/18/2012 6:43:03 PM	First I's like to say I take Lamictal, 300 mg (three 100 mg tablets) twice a day, for a total of 600mg a day and the generic version of Keppra(Levetiracetam) 2000 mg (four 500mg tablets) twice a day for a total of 4000 mg a day.I first started having seizures at age 13 (gran mal), I have been given what seems like every anti-convulsive medication out there with no avail, I was still having seizures at a minimum of 2 a week. A little over 5 years ago a neurologist after spending almost 15 days in the hospital as she found the right medications and balance to these medications (Keppra being the main medication) to help stop the seizures. On the positive, it stopped the seizures totally (have not had one since I started on this medication); but....This is where the satisfaction &amp; effectiveness blend together because to me one effects the other. The overall rating does not display my true feelings about the medication. While my satisfaction on how will it works is 5 star, the side effects makes me want to give it a one star, but the medication deserves more the one star. Having two medications with high dosages that can make a person tired does not help.With that said:1)This medication makes me be easily irritated with people, I really have to try hard not to get angry and yell at someone. I feel tired all day but can't sleep, but then can't sleep at night. I will play video games till 3am to get tired enough to sleep and still wake up at 5 or 6 am. 2)My main problem with this medication is memory, or lack of it. I cannot remember things 5 minutes after its told to me, my girlfriend thinks I am the most forgetful person she has ever met and I have to agree because I always had a good memory. I have told my doctor who sent me to a specialist, he blew me off saying I was just getting old. I am truly concerned, and you should also if this problem arises.  
Convulsive Seizures	Anniewhereugo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	8/13/2012 4:16:14 PM	500mg for a week.  After a few days I had horrible pain in my ears, then at the one week mark I was at work and could not get my breath, which made me hypreventilate.  My stomache muscles were tight and I became aggitated and anxious.  My thoughts were like a tennis ball in a heated match and I could not concentrate.  I felt like I was going to have a heart attack.  When I finally went home I took two sleeping pills and slept till the next morning at which time I felt much better, though still quite spacey and had intermitant feelings of anxiety, agitation and fear.  I have not taken it since, though my doctor does not think that the medicqation had anything to do with what happened to me....yeah, right.

I now only take 1000 mg at night for 2 years now. No side effects like dilantin. Is expensive if you don't have good insurance to cover. Seemed to help with sleep and little less anxiety.
Other	Tom M., 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	35-44	6/23/2012 11:13:05 AM	I have a form of Reflex Epilepsy that caused me to have two Grand Mal seizures and have problems reading. I was first on Dilantin then Depakote, both controlled the seizures but not the reading problem. My doctor prescribed Keppra and for 2 years no problems with reading. However, the side effects were a problem, mainly agression, I could not control my temper. Talked with my doctor, he told me to continue my keppra regimine along with the depakote to maintain my mood. This has worked very well for me. If you are having mood problems talk to your doctor about combining something like depakote. The only problem I've noticed recently is maintaining an erection. Seeing my doctor next week about ED treatment (Viagra or Cialis).

I do not feel I need this drug because at that time I had severe prostitus at that time which has been corrected  one and half years ago with laser thereby.  At the time of seizures I was not drinking hardly any liquids at that time and on both days had hard physical workouts in the gym.  No more episodes, drinking lots of fluids daily, working out 2 to 3 times weekly.  I feel I do not need this medication anymore and I think it depresses me. I also think it has decreased by libido substantially.

Convulsive Seizures	mandiii83, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	4/3/2012 3:34:04 AM	I was diagnosed with epilepsy at age of 20. I am on lamictal(generic) since 2003 I have had 4 seizures. My 3rd seizure was 8/20/11 in which my doc upped my dosage. And my 4th seizure was on 3/19/12 my doc than prescribed Keppra he gave me directions on building levels in my system less for the first couple weeks until 4th week which I'll be on 2 pills 2x day total 2000mg. So far no mood changes. My current issue is lack of sleep. I haven't slept well during the first week of taking it. I have been going to sleep around 3a-4a. Thank goodness my work is allowing short-term disability otherwise I'd have major issues concentrating and staying awake at work. I hope this works because seizures suck. I actually had my 1st seizure when i was 13 and doc put me on depakote which is an evil medication-talk about mood problems..oh and weight gain! but he didn't diagnose me with epilepsy at that time. I was on depakote for 2 yrs and doc thought I grew out of them. And 7 yrs later at age of 20 that's when i started having them again. :(  Best of luck to everyone that is going thru the same as me.

I had seizures in Oct which caused a fractured right shoulder that had to be fully replaced and I need a second surgery. So I would rather take the Keppra and be seizure free. Never had a seizure in my life before all this happened to me.

For having BI-Polar syndrome at the same time, Levetiracetam has changed my life. The tornado I have been living in for over 15 years from the BiPolar has stopped completely. My thought process is clear and proactive and I move the speed of normal people now. Anybody experiencing BiPolar disorder should speak with their doctors about this med. It was a horrible medication to get used to. At least one month of all kinds of changes and unpleasant symptoms but life changing. Just for info, I am taking the Leve in addition to Effexor. Good luck!!!                      In Sync
Simple Partial Seizures	RoyShelley, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	2/18/2012 9:33:25 AM	Keppra was given to my father after a mild stroke and suspected seizures.  For 3 days he had a severely altered mental state &amp; we were making plans to institutionalize him. Fortunately a Dr took the time to listen to our recount of the events &amp; decided to try stopping the Keppra. Dad returned to normal within a few hours &amp; was back at his house the next day.  This was a very scary situation.  Makes me wonder if there are people institutionalized now just because they are receiving this drug.

I have seen people writing there reviews that want their cake and eat it also.  If it is working use it if it is not get a better doctor. I have tried ALL the meds that they currently use for seizures and have had neurosurgery.After this taken some study meds and I really do like Keppra it has narrowed my sez's from 20 a month to 5 so I hear a lot of people complaining, but it has worke for me when the others have not. The only draw back is that YES it does make me tired like most all Sez's Med's will, but you have to think for yourself and get off you rear and take walks do things take frequent naps and keep checking and monitoring your blood through your doctor. Trust me since I have had seizures I have had to treat it like a bad cold ...just take care of yourself exercise and eat good. If youo slip up any of those you can get things (in your body) chemically out of balance.....I just hate to see people whine when just a little thing is not working for them ...accept it work through it and move on.  Come on people remember there is always someone worse off than you are Billions of people maybe that will put it in perspective for you.

Other	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		2/3/2012 8:46:40 PM	My 69 year old Mother had a stroke 1 1/2 months ago.  The new neuro doctor, at the logn-term care facility,  said her EEG shows low/high waves indicating &quot;possible&quot; seizures.  She is on 500 mg of Keppra.  She is unable to speak and move her right side due to the stroke.  The day after she was given this medication she started experiencing extreme depression, anxiety, aggression, ripping out her trachea/iv's/feeding tube, pulling my hair, hugging me.  The doctor is trying to tell me this is normal for stroke patients.  Seriously, this is so scary.  I am forcing my Dad to get a 2nd opinion.  What is weird is that I don't see anyone else on these reviews state this drug is given to patients for strokes.  I'm so sad for my Mom because she can not tell us what she is thinking.

Then had a fit which resulted in a brain hemmorage so they put me on keppra instead. Since then I have had a first about once a month compared to once a year but whether this is due to the keppra or the brain injury I am not sure. Side effects for keppra for me include VERY short temper which was never as bad as it is now and random bouts of really deep sadness which have no real cause. Apart from that it is well tolerated but they just keep increasing it in the hope it will eventually keep me fit-free!

It has been very effective. Yes, the first two weeks he was in a sort of stupor but that was until his body became accustomed to it. His drug company decided to put him on the generic brand at some point and we noticed he started having anxiety to the point of contemplating suicide. We requested that he be put back on the brand name. He still has a few anxiety attacks but these were cut by 90% when he want back to Keppra, and the ones he has had were very mild.

Extreme overwhelming fatigue, drowsiness,nausea,depression, loss of appetite. I have been on Keppra for a month now and I have decided to discontinue it. I felt tired before I started the drug. I feel like death now. I have come to believe that this drug is killing me.I am scheduled to return to my neurologist in another 3 weeks but Im not so sure I will still be alive if I continue to take it until then. My seizures are a tiny bit better but I didnt feel like I was dying before. I do now. They should take this drug off the market. What little it does help is not worth the side effects. I am going to continue on my Tegretol and Neurontin until then. But I cant take another one of those Keppra pills. This drug is so bad I absoulutely dread taking it. It is all I can do to take the top off the bottle because I know what hell awaits me there.

I've gone from having 50+ a day of the absence seizures  to none, and have only had 3 grand mal seizure in the past 8 yrs.I love it, with exception of the occassional insomnia and forgetfulness its the best.

Simple Partial Seizures		2	1	1			9/14/2011 1:27:37 PM	Initially, Keppra seemed to be working. Initial side effects-dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, sadness, tiredness. All of these except sadness and tiredness resolved after approximately a month. Neuro suggested changing when I took the dose to deal with the tiredness and what started as a bit of sadness before became overwhelming. I would yell at the drop of a hat, which was not part of my character previously. My emotions would be up and down over small issues. I tried to tough it out hoping that the symptoms would subside. They did not and became worse. I needed help due to thoughts of self-harm. Once I came off of the drug everything settled down within less than a week. If you experience any psychological effects PLEASE contact your doctor immediately. There is no need to suffer needlessly, and there are many other drugs available that may work for you. The neuro put me on Tegretol and it is working very well without any of the side effects of Keppra.

This drug should be taken off the market. I had extreem mood changes and many other difficulties with it. At one point I even grabbed my wife by the throat and had her removed from the hospital where I was being treated. I've talked to several doctors who share the same feelings about taking it off the market. If you are a doctor, do not dispense it. If you have siezures, do not take it.

We took him off the drug and he finally improved but he is still having trouble 3 years later with his memory.  This is a horrible drug

Her neurologist weaned her from Trileptal and added the Keppra, now is on only Keppra. I am calling the neuro Monday, I want her off of it NOW.  She just had her 2nd grand mal this week, but the side effects are horrible. She has been extremely moody, irritable, almost hostile, which is not like her at all. She is a very happy girl, she does have mild autism, but is never grumpy or fussy. She now constantly says nobody loves her, complains and growls about everything, etc. This is not a gradual &quot;teenager&quot; mood, it has happened suddenly and severely. I was unaware that some things she has complained about could be side effects till reading reviews on here (leg/bone pain was the most surprising, she has complained of this for about 1 1/2 months, and I see others have this, too). Very unhappy with Keppra, and am getting her off of it before the seizures increase and the terrible mood/depression gets worse!
Convulsive Seizures	Black Diamonds, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/7/2011 12:14:00 AM	One of the most hideous drug I had ever been on which is also on my Anti-Epileptic drug list. While Primary and other Specialists never understood why the Epileptologist kept titrating the dosage all the way up to 3000 mg daily when first experiencing side-effects at 1250 mg daily is not understood.Out of extreme fairness:Keppra is a wonder drug for some and a &quot;nightmare from hell&quot; to others. It is a coin toss and the only way to know is to try it and bail out as soon as you experience the side-effects, if your Neurologist or Epileplogist refuses after giving it some time for it does take the body some time to adapt aka &quot;honeymoon phase&quot; there is a time to say &quot;when&quot;. Speak up, your General, Primay or Family Doctor and if you have other Specialists, tell them as well; the more the merrier and get off of it. The sooner the better.

On Keppra, there were also some daytime breakthrough seizures. Side effects were awful-headaches, mood swings, angry episodes. Even after stopping Keppra the angry moods and headaches have continued, and a horrible new symptom appeared: following nighttime seizures there is terrible anger and yelling as part of the seizure...plus terrible feeling of fear and dread. Almost like a nightmare on top of the seizure. I blame Keppra. It should be taken off the market NOW. Don't take this stuff. Ever.

The first and only drug I have ever used is Keppra, and it has been phenomenal. There are a few side effects such as mood swings, but they subside after a while. These side effects are so miniscule compared to me busting my front tooth out and going through thousands of dollars for surgeries for an implant. I have been taking Keppra for years now and have not had one seizure, not even a twitch. Hope this helps.

Additional Medication for Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy	 Female  (Caregiver) 	4	3	1	Female		4/22/2011 5:43:19 PM	My sixteen year old daughter began having seizures again after being seizure free for five years. Doctors prescribed this new drug due to minimal side effects.Keppra worked for controlling her seizures but it made her nauseous, lethargic, depressed with suicidal thoughts. I had to constantly watch her as she said that she wanted to kill herself. She laid around, slept and lost interest in everything she used to love; swim, music, etc. I had to follow her around in fear these suicidal thoughts might be played out. After four days, waiting for her body to adjust, she was taken off of it. She is now on Topamax and is doing well on that. I would not recommend Keppra to anyone after experiencing it with my daughter!!!

As good as you can get for having to take seizure medicine.   I have noticed and increase in depression; however, if I watch my diet, depression eases up.  However, someone needs to lobby for lower Keppra prices since people who take keppra are at risk if they take the generic

Started taking 1000mg six weeks ago.  First two weeks remarkable improvement- no migraines; then the side effects kicked in.  Severe flu-like headaches, extreme depression, anger, and a feeling like I'm not in my body but trapped in it at the same time.  Migraines returned two weeks ago.  Not sleeping well and waking with stabbing pain in head.  My neurologist tells me to continue taking Keppra and reassures me that side effects will subside.  I don't know how long I should wait out this misery? Poor results and unbearable side effects with other anti-seizure drugs in the past.  During the first 2 weeks on Keppra I thought this was the miracle drug for me; now I feel there is no hope.

The real kicker was the anger,anxiety and desire to hurt myself or others. That was not me at all!!! Luckily looking at a pic of my 3yr old prevented anything foolish. I would not recommend Keppra unless you have an extremely understanding family / workplace that is willing to see a different person in your skin. With time it may have been acceptable, but I truly believe I would not have made it to see. wish me luck with topomax. Thanks for listening

Had tried numerous other medications previously without success. Have no issues anymore with things that triggered my seizures, such as a subdural hematoma from a serious head injury, tiredness, anxiety, stress, and over-exercising (cardiovascularly). Started drinking alcohol again, albeit fairly moderately, in May 2010 after an 8 year break thereof.

Made me very tired at times, plus I now can't afford to pay $200.00 a month for the Vimpat.  Doc is weening me off of that and putting me on Lamotrigine.  The Keppra works great though.  Haven't had a seizure since going to a higher dosage.

Have been on this drug for over 4 years due to a brain tumor, that was causing focal seizures.  I noticed my hair thinning, so I asked my neurologist if I could try something different.  I can't remember what he gave me, but it made me dizzy and I fell on my face and messed it up. As a female that lives alone, I knew that the new drug wouldn't work. I went back on the Keppra, because it works.  I am now looking into a real hair wig.  It's a bummer, but I don't want to try anything else because I know it's working.

I do not get as many hours sleep as I did before taking it and therefore take a sleeping pill in order to go to sleep.  Usually get about average 5 hours per night now.

Simple Partial Seizures	Plato, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	1/6/2011 1:06:20 PM	I have the subject seizures because at age 16 I was in a car wreck and had sever damage to my frontal lobes.  (Now with our wars and IEDs, doctors know more about the cause of seizures).I tried other drugs and my doctor has me on 500 mg of Keppra.  I d not have any seizures, but whenever I try to decrease the dosage, I seem to start allover again and I have to become aclimated to Keppra again.  I have the same side-effects: losing hair, strange modes, missing memory, and real strange sensations that are hard to describe.  I've noticed some woman use the term aura..maybe that is for women?I'll admit, even though I told my employer what drug I was on, sometimes due to stress, I'd make reasonable demands of my employees, and when they argued, I'd lose my composure.  I was let go by my company after 7 years.I'd advise people to try Keppra and if it has undesirable results, talk with your doctor and try other medicines.  In the past I could get anywhere from 5-25 small seizures in a day.  They are terribly exhausting and almost anything is better.

Within two wks it triggered severe manic episode, insomnia, MIGRAINES, confusion. He wouldn't adjust the dose, just said,too bad, stop it.  My physician agreed that it had been used successfully for bipolar but not for me and he too said, stop it. My heart breaks when I read that people are having to pay $400-$1000 for this Rx when they must have it. I'm on disability and Medicare paid for mine. I feel blessed to have had at least a chance for some relief from weekly severe migraines and uncontrollable bipolar disorder. Out of desperation, I'm still trying to take a lower dose every two or three days. Hopefully, some day there will be an effective preventative or treatment for migraines and/or bipoloar.

The seizures are controlled, but child began having shakiness &amp; twitching after starting meds. Also, severe mood changes, concentration/memory loss after starting this med. Moods are improved when taking 50 mg vitamin B6 supplement with med. Do others experience the shakiness/twitching with this med.?

I have had one tonic-clonic seizure while on the med. I just started having seizures this year, 4 of them. I was initially put on Dilantin but couldn't tolerate it. Ease of use? Sure, it's easy to swallow a pill. However, since I started taking Keppra, I have had numerous infections requiring antibiotics with no other cause for a lowered immune system found. I am depressed and anxious, constantly sleepy and lethargic. I detest it (and my neuro) so much that I took matters in my own hands (don't try this at home) and tapered my dosage down to half what I'm supposed to be taking. My GP ran a blood test and my levels are still in the therapeutic range. I would be a complete zombie or worse if I was taking the full dosage. I am now waiting 3 months to see a new neuro and I hope he changes my med!

Convulsive Seizures	Jim, 65-74 Male  (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	65-74	12/7/2010 7:38:45 PM	Beginning in 1993 I began experiencing pedimal sezures. Over the course of these years I saw several doctors and underwent tests without defining what was causing these seizures. In 2004 and 2005 I had two grandmal seizures. I was placed on Keppra beginning with a dose of 500 mg twice a day.  As my body adjusted to the medicine I began to experience periodic symptoms of the pedimal onset.  The doctors began increasing the Keppra dosage.  I am now up to 2500 mg daily, but have been experiencing drowziness, diziness and intense bone pain.  The drowziness and diziness is acceptable, but the bone pain is sometimes very severe.  I also have arthritus and am sucessfully taking Glocosmine and Condroiten twice a day.  The bone pain that I am experiencing is not associated with any joint pain, but is in the major leg bones.

He turned into a good loving kid, to someone I thought was possessed. He raged, throwing things and himself, kicking biting, then the next minute he was laughing, then crying. It was like he had bipolar times five. I would not rcommend this drug to any children and quite frankly feel that the drug should be pulled from the shel and the makers of the drug should resign!

So far, this medication is not helping the lingering nerve pain which can be excrutiating. I've been on this medication for over a month now. I started out with 1/2 a 500mg tablet which knocked me for a loop. (I'm extremely sensitive to most medications and started out slow.) I've worked my way up to a whole tablet per my doctor's orders. I am still having side effects such as being extremely light headed. I feel like I'm &quot;out in left field&quot; somewhere. I could never take two of these tablets per day and function. Drive? No way! So far, no agressive behavior, just depression which is nothing these days. When you're in pain 24/7, you tend to be depressed. My doctor is going to have to find me something else to take. This medication just isn't working for me, unfortunately. I am allergic to two other medications that I tried for my PHN nerve pain, so I just hope there is something out there that will work because Keppra isn't working for me for PHN.

Makes me sleep all the time, very emotional, anxiety attacks, sleeplessness (early in the morning). But they gave me Dilantin at the hospital in an IV when I had my last GM seizure, and that made me sick right away.  I was taking Lamictal, but the doctor recommended this.  I took Depakote for about a week, but started having diarhea and pains in my right side below my lungs. I wanna switch back to Lamictal, I was on it for about 7 months and had no side effects (my girlfriend said I had mood swings, but I didn't notice. I do notice them now on Keppra). No seizures to report, but I have them at night, so I don't always know. I wish I could have my old pre epilepsy life back.  I wouldn't even try drinking alcohol now, I get anxiety when I'm due to take it, up cycles after taking Keppra, and then about 3 hours later I crash and mostly take naps.  Whatever works, but I wish I could have a normal life again.

It was the worst stuff I ever had. While taking it I was lucky to be able to stay awake 3 or 4 hours at a time, and it made me a total friggin idiot. My memory still hasn't come back after my last seizure and I swear it is becasue of all the keppra they forced me to take in the hospital both IV and oral. I thought nuerontin was bad but this stuff is a thousand times worse. if you can get your docotr to give you something else do so as soon as possible.

I have only been on this drug 2 weeks now as a substitute for phenytoin. I am taking 750mg. every 12 hours along with 180 mg.phenobarbital every day. I feel very sleepy during the day when I am up and I can not get a good nights sleep,usually 4 hours to 5 hours. I have had 2 mild seizures in 2 weeks and hopefully once my body adjusts to this,I'll be back to normal. I am just so happy to be off Phenytoin as I hardly ever had any good blood results while taking this. I was once treated for Dilantin toxicity because of this and other times my level was so low I suffered Grand Mal seizures. My Dr. said he'll have me seizure free within a year and driving..lol,I will not get behind the wheel of a car ever again. I have enough problems,why should I give other people problems. Hopefully my Nuero Dr. is right in what he is doing. Now this med is the generic for Keppra

I understand but im going nuts.Im gonna give the medicine its chance to work but ive been running a high fever up to 105!Ive been tired all the time, add the seizures in with blackouts and throwing up, thats me! Ive had mood swings, my blood sugar dropped significantly to where my pcp said i could have hypoglycemia. Oh did I mention I cant remember much anymore. I have to write down everything ive done or my symptoms that arent me, and what times i took my meds and blood pressure.I believe Keppra is a good medication but read the side effects on here as soon as you get home or ask your pcp because my doctor didnt tell me anything nor did the pill bottle and i even asked the pharmacist who was unable to answer my questions on the medication.

Convulsive Seizures	Kevin, 0-2 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	3	Male	0-2	8/28/2010 11:36:54 PM	We started giving the medication to our 2+ year old son after 2 seizures with 15 hours, per the emergency room doctor. This was after we say our pediatrician that morning from the seizure in the middle of the night. Now our son has mood swings after giving him his morning dosage of Levetiracet he will within an hour start to become aggressive, agitated, irritated and moody (crying hard). He seems to not want to listen either and just is getting out of control now. He was not like this before even if he going through the terrible 2's. Does anyone have any suggestions as to maybe a vitamin to help offset this as we are ready to have him stop taking the medication as it was believed the seizures were caused by a fever he had due to a slight cold. He may have had a Febrile Seizure due to the MMRV but he definitely had a fever the first time at 1 year old...If anyone can point us to more information or email me directly at felts.kevin@gmail.com it would be greatly appreciated.

It took two weeks to switch meds and during that time I did not drive or do much.  Once I got adjusted everything was so much better.  I have been taking Keppra for over 3 years without a seizure and the mental fogginess is almost all gone.  Of course some of that could be due to age!

She was crying as if she was hurt and scared. She would not eat or sleep. And when she does fall asleep it is next to impossible to wake her up. I stopped giving her the Keppra and two days later she was having the seizures again but she was not moody to the point of hurting her self. BE CAREFUL WHEN TALKING THIS MEDICINE.

Simple Partial Seizures	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	25-34	7/6/2010 3:10:13 AM	25yr old male, x2 Grand Mal over 6 months, 4-5 simple partial seizures daily. No previous history. Have been on Keppra for around 4 weeks now (Currently on 500mg x 2). I was on Lamictal for about a month (50mg x 2), however i had a reaction to the sun (possibly photosensitivity) which showed up as a rash where in contact with light...take in mind that the sunlight was VERY strong and the rash wasn't really major, just like a heat rash. Keppra so far has been absolutely fine. I'm tired, but then my girlfriend is also tired and she's not taking any meds! I have simple partial seizures every day (up to 4-5 a day) which involves me losing my speech for about 5-10 seconds and a general &quot;weird&quot; feeling. Since on Keppra, i have noticed a weaking of my simple partials (they built up to a definite start and finish point, the ends are now much more blurred). All's looking positive...we'll see!
Simple Partial Seizures	gizmo, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	7/4/2010 11:36:36 AM	Had a subdural hematoma (SBH); experienced about 2 seizures a day following surgery.  Started taking keppra 500mg, 2x/day and seizures completely stopped about 10 days after taking the medicine.  Took time for the drug to start working - was not immediate; my neurologist apparently did not know this as they wanted to increase my dose but my PCP did.  Slept 12+ hrs a day first two weeks or so on keppra then after sleeping has gradually become normal.  Had slight difficulties reading out load, memory issues and loss of patience (temper). Also had minor issues relating to physical cooridnation, physical (not mental) stamina and difficulty thinking/reasoning skills but maybe some of this is due to the SBH rather than the keppra.  After 6 months was told they may try to gradually wean me off the drug as they do not want me to stop taking keppra cold-turkey. If I resume having seizures will return to the dose and try again in another 6 months.  If this does not work I may need to take keppra for the rest of my life. Was told keppra is one of the best drugs for seizures but it is expensive (~$50/month). Overall my PCP believes keppra is good for me as the seizures are completely under control with no major issues. Whole experience has come by a surprise, very slow and challenging.  Frustrated by some of the medical care. Do NOT be shy to get a 2nd opinion and switch to a dr you are comfortable with.

He had me taking 1750mg twice daily and now it's up to 2000mg twice daily. I'm already taking Tegratol 800mg in the am and 600mg in the pm. I feel drained 95% of the time. I feel nervous all the time (in fear that I'm going to have a seizure.) I can't be on feet to much, because the connective tissue around ankles hurts to bad. I just feel terrible. And, I still have seizures.

Convulsive Seizures	WGHart, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	6/17/2010 4:25:10 PM	I've been taking Keppra generic for 2 months now and have had NO Seizures or even a feeling of an episode... It's been amazing so far with this!! I have had some trouble sleeping with a little hair loss as well. I am also noticing over the last couple of weeks that my legs and calves...even my feet are painful and somewhat tingling with spasms at times. Not sure if it is circulation or what?? Either way, I am dealing with the pain in my legs with Aleeve but once it wears off.. the pain seems to return...Will continue with this with the hopes that these side effects will go away...I'll give it a little more time 4 now... The benefit of NO seizures is better than the slight pain right now. We'll See??!!?? My best to the rest of you with harder situations than mine...

Six days after Iwas taken off the drug, I had the first of five seizures, three in one day which landed me in the hospital for 13 days, eight of which I spent in the rehab hospital relearning to walk with my impaired leg and use my impaired left arm.  The last two seizures occurred when I was in ther hospital.

Simple Partial Seizures	brenda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	5/29/2010 7:09:22 AM	Keppra does it's job in one way but as for the side effects it was better for me to not take this medication. keppra did improve the seizures but also gave me a new life in hell. I took this drug for 3 months and begged to be taken off it. Between a life of sleeping, being dosey, depressed, losing balance, and falling only to break bones I could not take it any longer. I am a happier person being off Keppra and will never take this medication again.
Simple Partial Seizures	islandboy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	5/28/2010 10:16:15 PM	Diagnosed w/ pyschomotor seizures @ 37 yrs old. Started out on Tegretol w/ limited results. Through the years have taken aux drugs...Lamictal, Topomax, Neurontin. These had bad side effects &amp; my episodes were occurring anywhere between 4-10 per night. Daytime was controlled, but felt extremely tired during the day. I wonder how I kept my job and managed to live a normal life. Then came Keppra about 12 years ago &amp; the other drugs were taken away. I have been seizure-free for this entire period on Keppra alone. I can't say enough about how wonderful it has been for me. I do feel tired and want to sleep. My wife thinks I have a hair trigger temper. My lifestyle has changed drastically with retirement (I'm now 63)yielding no workplace stress. In addition to enjoying life, I exercise about 2 hours a day. Bottom line, we are all different in the way meds affect us and it can be a long, grueling journey to find the right regimen. I also believe lifestyle can play a part in the therapy.

Simple Partial Seizures	Madge, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4		45-54	5/28/2010 11:19:40 AM	i had my first seizure at 36 yrs old at a wedding, then 42 yrs old and 4 weeks ago at 46 years old on the way to work...i did not get them often so i thought..in taking keppra i can see the difference of how the other drugs were not always working for me....numbness in my hands while sleeping..i thought i slept the wrong way the night before, no sleep at all at times thought it was work stress, my eyes would blink very fast thought they were just tired....the keppra has made me see a difference..so far no fast eye blinking, numbness and able to concentrate much better at the office..and always take your blood tests even if you feel great..part of these seizures were my fault.. i should have watched myself more closely...now i do so, i feel good with the keppra, i sleep fantastic, no quick eye blinking anymore...Keppra makes me a little tired but that's about it. hopefully it'll work for you guys too!!!!

Simple Partial Seizures	theinric, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	5/10/2010 3:20:42 PM	I got horribly dizzy, and I have never been dizzy before.  I fainted (I believe from anemia) and the doctor put me on this medicine.  The side effects were so bad (dizzy, anxious) that I stopped, but that was bad too.  Because then I had an unexplained panic attack at work. I became extremely claustrophobic and worried that because of my dizziness, I couldn't walk down the stairs.  I had to go outside.  Also, I experienced memory lapses and alot of constipation.  This is a bad drug.  Someone wanted to know about auras during her period.  That's exactly what happened to me.  I was on my period, I became anemic, I saw auras and fainted.  Damn I am mad they put me on this because it has caused more problems than it solved and it's difficult to get off once they put you on!!!!  They are screwing with my head!

No issues whatsoever - previously had been on oxcarbazepine which helped with reducing seizures, but still had break throughs.  Since switching to Keppra (went generic about a year ago), completely seizure-free.

A couple of weeks later I found myself snapping at my son for little things. Then one morning I woke up wishing I didn't have to get out of bed, and the thought briefly crossed my mind that I really didn't need to wake up at all...It got worse from there. My doctor switched me to Topamax as quickly as he could.

I was also on prozac at the time for depression. After taking keppre for a few weeks nad decreasing the prozac, I experienced a psychotic event-Vietnam flash-back. I never had a psychotic event before and I had been on dialantin for 40 years. How do I understand this? I'm now off keppre.

She recently had a brain tumor removed so the Dr. is weanning her off this med and Lamictal.Keppra has caused her many episodes of mood swings and a total different person.  I am looking forward to have her completely removed from Keppra, she is now going through depression and very emotional I hope we can remove her altogether very soon. It's been very hard on everyone in the household to deal with. It did help her seizures but gave her a total different personality!
Simple Partial Seizures	sheftali52, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	3	Male	65-74	4/28/2010 1:18:59 AM	My 67 year old husband had a massive couple of seizures for the very first time one month ago and was put on 1000 mg of keppra twice a day.  Since then he's had no seizures, but has had no appetite, naps three times a day, and sleeps about two hours longer each night.  He's also extremely constipated, somewhat more irritable, and seems to be in a foggy state of mind more than before.  He had a stroke two years ago, which affected his mood quite a bit, and is also on quite a few medications in addition to keppra (for COPD, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation.  He's most depressed about not being able to drive for six months (state law).  All in all, the constipation, moodiness, lack of appetite, and lethargy seem a small price to pay for him to avoid seizures, but I'm hoping the keppra dose can be adjusted eventually to minimize these side effects.  
Other	CLove87, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	4/28/2010 12:53:32 AM	Im 23 years old, I was born with a condition called Mesial Temporal Lobe Atrophy with Reactive Lymphiod Hyperplasia. This causes me to have seizures daily and even in my sleep. I have tried some differant seizure meds to try and control my seizures, these included Dilantin, Lamictal as well as a few others. I was severly alergic to the other seizure meds and had to be taken off them completly. Sadly I was told there was no more meds I could try becouse of my sevear reactions. I started seeing a new Neurologist and he put me on Keppra, he started me off on a low dose and every two weeks moved it up. Im now taking 2000 mg a day. Im gona have to get the dose higher because im steal having to many seizures but im just so thankfull I can take Keppra at all. The side affects I have had are mood changes and I find if I take it with food my stomich does not get upset when I take it. keppra has made a hudge impact for the better on my life. Before I had so many seizures I could not do much of anything, even trying to wash dishes or do laundry was very hard to try and get done. Basically my life just consited of constant siezures with no releaf. I would recomend Keppra especially if you have tried other seizure meds and have pore or no luck with them. I am allergic to many other things besides seizure meds wich sadly include pain meds so the horrible seizure headaches I get no help and im on my own with those. Long story short...keppra is very expensive but there is no price on life and im just thankful to have one :0)Good Luck to all those who suffer from seizures, keep your faith in God and Jesus no matter what lifes throws your way they are always there to help you through it. 
Convulsive Seizures	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	35-44	4/27/2010 4:24:45 AM	I have been using keppra for 2 years...however, my first medication I used was Dilantin then changed to Tegretol then changed to Depakote(which changed me to a zombee)then I began using Keppra....to control my Gran Mal seizures. I like Keppra the best because I could finaly think clearly to make quick decisions and Keppra has less side efffects. However, Keppra is tough to start because of dizzyness which lasted about 1 month then my dizzyness dissapeared. I do become moody at times but atleast I do not have deppression and lack of concentration that Tegretol and Dilatin causes. I do at times have small petite seizures(similar to head rushes)...I   should combine another anti-seizure medication but afraid to because of side effects..I hope this information helps someone.

Other	Retired Teacher, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/16/2010 11:45:02 PM	In 2001, I had brain surgery, a left temporal lobectomy and amygdalohippocampectomy for complex partial seizures that could not be controlled with all of the anti-convulsant drugs used.  After the surgery, I took only Keppra, 500 mg/twice a day, even though it is supposed to be used as an adjunct drug, and never had another seizure.  So, in November 2009, since EEGs had been normal for the last two years, I began gradual withdrawal from Keppra over a period of eight weeks.  As of April 2010, I continue to be seizure-free.  With seizures and without, I worked as a special ed teacher for 32 years.
Simple Partial Seizures	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	4/16/2010 9:53:56 PM	When I first started taking Keppra, it was because I stared having more seizures, and I thought it would be for a brief time. Now ten (10) years later I still use it.Keppra at 500 mgs (to me) is too thick, when I took it (1000 x 2 daily) I had to have plenty of water or I'd choke. Keppra was a second medication &amp; Dilantin was the first. When they finally came out with a generic my body said no thanks. On one of my doctor visits, he asked me to think about surgery so that I wouldn't have to take medication &amp; if I have to continue to take both medications I might do it. Besides medication for seizures I have to take medication for high blood pressure &amp; chlorestol.

Convulsive Seizures	Kerri, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	2/25/2010 7:06:11 PM	Keppra as add on to Epilim did have elicit reduction in severe refractory seizure activity for 16.5yo. Challenging Behaviour with occaisional rage episodes increased more than 300% in 7 weeks - in frequency, extended time duration and the intensity of violent outbursts including major damage to house and assault (family and police). I believe this med should not be considered for prescription for patients in the presence of any noted aggressive, Oppositional or Challenging behaviour.

It does not work as well as the Keppra. I have had two seizures since being on this medication and I have gran mal seizures. I have been taking this since 2004. I find it very ineffective.

Other	Tammy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	2/13/2010 4:39:51 PM	I find this med to cause anger, depression, anxiety, and drowsiness. I do not like the way I feel on this med, but I like the fact that I  haven't had a seizure since I started taking it. Because of the seizures, I have had my license to drive suspended, which results in my not being able to get to work. I have not worked but 2 1/2 weeks in the last 5 months. And SSI won't disable me because I have to have these seizures more than once a month for 3 months, regardless of treatment. So I am stuck.
Convulsive Seizures	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	2/12/2010 12:28:18 AM	Would definitely recommend this drug if needed.Had two, what MDs called, T-C seizures (Both started with aura, then convulsions and combativeness, ending about an hour later with drug interdiction and a kiss from my wife). The first was in 2005. The next in May 2009. Started 1000 mg after 09 seizure. No seizures sense although I had one aura episode.  I rested in dark quiet room and aura went away with no seizure. Boss and staff says I am more irritable. Wife says I zone out every now and then (i.e. disengage in conversations with friends). As long as I am aware of it I can control these effects.  On advise from Neurologist, I have not had an alcoholic drink since August. Just found a new Neurologist that says drink every now and then is okay (Wine with dinner or shot with friends). Needless to say I like this Doc better.  Good luck!

She hasn't had any seizures in the 2 years she's been taking the medicine.  She does have a very difficult time with learning/memory/moodiness/anger etc...but we don't know if that is caused by the meds or the epilepsy.  She is now on 350mg. twice a day.

I went back to the good doctor and the seizures have now stopped again. What is wrong with the doctors thinking I am crazy?  I do not show the gray area in my brain and have the seizures in my sleep. Thank God for a wonderful doctor that knows what she is doing. I cannot live with out Keppra

By the end I was almost on the full recommended dosage for the drug.  I had seizures every 1-3 months.The side effects were terrible.  I gained and retained 30 pounds quickly while on Keppra (so much so that I have stretch marks.)  I suffered from depression and  extreme anxiety attacks.  I was moody and zombie-like; my fiance, friends and family felt as though they did not know me anymore.  I always felt sick (tired, dull, depressed and anxious) with little relief. I felt as if I didn't even know myself.  I am STILL coming off Keppra slowly (since it is such a powerful drug) but I am feeling like a new person since tapering off to less than half to dosage.  I am so excited to get my life and dreams and personality back when I am completely off this drug!  I have been seizure free for 5 months now that I have begun taking Lamictal and tapering off Kappra.  I cannot emphasize enough how much this drug affected my mind and emotions adversely.  I can't believe the difference.  I will NEVER recommend this because of my terrible experiences.  Luckily I now have the chance to be myself again!

I have no side effects from it, although I did feel tired and moody the first 10 days or so while I adjusted to it. I feel more awake now, have lost the 40 pounds I gained on Depakote, and was able to become pregnant because it is safe for mothers. In addition, long term side effects are minimal and no more monthly blood tests. No seizures at all. I am thrilled!

She takes 1000mg a day, a light dose according to doctor, and it really seems to work. She's 120lbs. She has had no seizures since starting the medicine. The doctor chose Keppra, because she said it has the least side effects for teenage girls. When my daughter first started taking it, it wiped her out and bothered her stomach some, the symptoms she described, sounded kind of like a hangover. Once up to dose for a couple of months, that went away. I really hope our experience continues to be this positive. I appreciate the rarity of having a medicine do exactly what its supposed to, so far so good (knock on wood). My daughter has been very good about taking the Keppra. I guess the threat of having a seizure is a strong motivator. I'm lucky that way too I guess, as many teenagers have trouble remembering their medication. Now if she could just remember to take her house key with her on a more regular basis....

I initially tried tegretol and when that did not work, my doctor prescribed tegretol + keppra. When that seemed to work, I was only given Keppra. For almost 3 years, I have not had a seizure.HOWEVER, I have noticed that my memory is NOT like it should be for a 21-year-old. I take my medicine, and 1 minute later I forget even taking it. I am an engineering major, and I am very nervous to work, as I have forgotten much of what I learned, probably more than the average student. I do not recommend this medicine, and it's difficult to get away from, especially since it has (knock on wood) eliminated my seizures. 
Convulsive Seizures	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/14/2010 8:41:17 PM	After having 2 grand mal seizures for the first time at the age of 43 I was diagnosed with epilepsy. Initially I was prescribed Depakote which caused excessive weight gain. I then tried Lamictal which I was allergic to. I now take Keppra and I recently switched to Keppra XR so now I only take the medication one time a day at night. I haven't had any more grand mal seizures since the first 2 although my EEG remains abnormal. This med works great for me and is very easy to take. I don't really notice any side effects - maybe just a little more tired. I am an RN and have been very satisfied with the medication.
Convulsive Seizures	25-34 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/10/2010 6:18:24 PM	My sister was first diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 3. After her first grand mal seizure, she was put on depakote &amp; reacted rather well considering all things. However, 15+ years later, after her original doctor had retiried, she began having break-thru seizures &amp; her new doctor subscribed her to Keppra. Shortly after taking this, she became completely psychotic, talking to only people in her imagination, never eating, and eventually wandering off into the woods during a snow storm with no shoes. The way she remembers this is something like out of a trippy movie or someone on LSD. I heavily advise anyone from taking this drug.. even after 2 years of being off Keppra, she still suffers psychotic episodes from time to time. The doctor said it was a 1% chance she would have a &quot;psychotic episode&quot;.. i find it hard to believe that she was such a rare percentage.  
Convulsive Seizures	crossroads, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	45-54	1/9/2010 3:18:34 PM	I am 52 yrs old. I have a very high I.Q. and have found that this drug has caused my memeory to drop dramatically. My job requires me to be alert. I cannot endorse this for myself because of the decreased alertness that it has for me. I take 1000mg daily. I was on dilatin since I was 15 yrs old. After recently finding out the side affects of dilatin my doctor suggested using this drug. I feel that he did this because of (as he put it) a sales pitch. I do not think a physician should ask you to use a drug just because of his or her interaction with a drug company. I sleep for at least 2 hours after taking this drug. Just to let you know I have not had a episode for at least 7 yrs. I did have a time when I was not taking any medication back in the 1980s and 1990s and had no episodes for 12 years. I think other options are out there. Diet and what you eat can help. Check with others to see if that has helped. This is only my opinion and may not work for everyone. But because the government and drug companies are entertwined I find that other ways to treat my condition will not be looked at. So now I am at a crossroads on what drug will be the best choice for me along with my diet. If amyone else out there has a suggestion let me know.
Simple Partial Seizures	colrful, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	35-44	1/7/2010 8:54:52 PM	After having the WORST side-effects you can imagine on Topamax I was put onto Keppra.  I take 3000mg daily (+ 20mg frisium - not prescibed in USA, 200mg epilum, and 400mg lamictal daily).  I have found I am now relying on Keppra such that if I miss or am late taking a dose, it is guaranteed that my epilepsy will play up; a prob I've never had b4.  Although I still get moody and sometimes have thoughts of suicide it is nothing compared with Topamax.  However, if I drink alcohol while taking Keppra I tend to get violent.  While I've never experienced side-effects from any other meds except Topamax (and I've been on many over the last 30yrs), Keppra does have minor side-effects with me but nothing compared with Topamax.  While each person is different - it is reasonably effective for me if taken on time.  My mother didn't want me taking this drug due to many of the negative comments - all of us are different and not all of us experience the same effects.  I reccmmend trying it - but do be aware of changes in character and stop taking it if it has adverse effects.

I've never thought of suicide in my life, but everytime I'm angry (which is a LOT now) I get so angry that I don't care if my actions result in someone hurting me or if what I do kills me. I hate this, I'd rather have siezures than this, and it's not easing up!

I am pregnant and have had no fetal side effects so far (i'm 31 weeks) The problem i am having with this drug is all anxiety related. I have massive bouts of restless leg while trying to sleep, and about 1/2 hour after taking each dose i become hostile, axious, tempermental, and extremely irritable until my next dosage is due, then the process starts all over again. This all began when my 100mg dosage was upped to 1500 mg daily because my seizures were persistant....However, i believe this is because i was placed on this drug when a different drug was needed. Being pregnany my new neuro will not allow me to switch med's until i deliver but he is very concerned with my side effects and see's me every time i see my OB. He has recommended i do not breast feed so that i can emmedietly begin treatment for my grand mal's. I reviewed this drug because I absolutely DESPISE the side effects i am having. Also, my sex drive has become non existant since taking this drug but i can not say that isnt pergnancy related, even though my last 2 pregnancies contributed to a more active sex drive....Guess i'll gind out soon

I convulsed at work (a hospital).  I have more sleep seizures then anything else.  I have ticks in the night.  So much of my convulsion was for the simple fact of a lack of sleep.  But this has happened to me for a few years.  Finally they spotted my abnormal brain waves through a sleep deprived EEG.  Regular EEG was coming back fine.  Also helped to convulse in front of a doctor and several nurses.  Sleeping is great for me now.  I have experienced irritability.  Man, I never knew I could be so mean.  Epilepsy runs in my family.  I started taking two flintstone vitamins once a day and it has been fine.  I have experienced aches in the morning. Other than that..this drug has worked fine.

Finally after 20 years of simple seizures I progressed to tonic-clonic (grand mal) and I found a new doctor recommended by the ER staff and he put me on 1500 mg. Keppra XR. Some hair thinning early in the treatment but that could also be to the quick weight loss (20 lbs. in 3 months), sometimes sleepy for a short time in the afternoon and that's about it. Occassionally, if I feel like a seizure might be coming on as a precaution I take another (750 mg.) and I'm back on track. Don't want to risk anything. I'm very pleased with the effects and my heart goes out to those who have bad treatment side effects, especially the babies. How do they explain if they don't have the vocabulary..&quot;mom, I feel like I'm on this really really bad-sick drunk&quot;. So for me, Keppra XR has been my silver bullet so far. It's been 9 months and I'm so excited that I finally found the help I've needed for a very long time.

Her hands turn blue from falling down to the sides of her wheelchair. She gets little bite marks in her hair. She is already total care and I don't want her to be a zombie. She would be better off not living.

My neurologist to this day has yet to diagnose me, however, I do know that the only types of seizures I had before getting treated were grand mals. The first and only drug I've been on has been Keppra. Upon starting Keppra, I had two seizures which were very mild and lasted maybe a minute and a half at most. Since then I haven't had any occurances again. I guess my body just needed to get used to the medicine, but here I am, 5 and a half years later and have been seizure free since. I haven't noticed any side effects that are too bad. The only thing I caution is memory. Sometimes I forget whether I took my pill or not. Overall, Keppra has worked miracles for me and I would definitely reccomend it to other epileptic patients.P.s.-I noticed a post earlier about a girl who had depression on it? I'm no doctor but I honestly think she's getting a pre-disposed dispostion mixed up with Keppra. I haven't known ANYONE to have depression due to it. Just thought I'd throw that one out there.

Simple Partial Seizures	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	12/15/2009 5:22:27 PM	I was diagnosed with Epilepsy after waking up on the floor of a Las Vegas casino. This medication has by far had the least side effects on me. Other medications I've tried have resulted in crippling migraine episodes, audio and visual hallucinations, vivid and sometimes violent dreams, fatigue, lack of concentration, mood swings etc...I've noticed with Keppra that I am at times tired, but the decreased frequency of partial and grand mal seizures is a welcome change. The drug does not eliminate my vulnerability to seizures completely, but it greatly reduces the chances of them occurring. When Im close to my threshold I do tend to get agitated though, but I think this has more to do with the stress of thinking I may have another grand mal than anything. I would recommend trying this if other anti-consultants have too many bad side effects or are ineffective.

When I first went on Keppra, I tripped out and acted as though I was very high and in a very bad mood. B Vitamins helped that, but my PSAT scores have substantially dropped from last year(99th percentile to 85th.) and I got rather bad SAT scores as well compared to what I expected(1600 and a 5 on the essay.). I'm borderlining on failing all my classes, and all that has changed is the Keppra. It's nice not to have daily seizures, but it's not worth it. I miss my brilliance. A lot. I miss being able to understand math and write proofs. Sure, it's nice not to seize. It's nice not to have migraines constantly(still have them quite often though). But it's really not nice to go from a straight A student with no effort(While having daily seizures!) to a student that struggles to pass her classes without seizures. Being able to drive is not worth this.

They put him on Keppra it was working out fine for him until just a couple of days ago. After being on this medication for 3 months he starting having a severe allergic reaction. His whole body starting get sores on it and it started out by looking like an ant bite or something then started spreading over his body like wildfire. They took him off of it and sent me home with a diastat kit to use on him until we can get him to children's hospital. So this is just to let you other parents know if you see anyting unusual on your child please don't wait it could be a reaction to the Keppra. The ER DR said it was staph and the next day to him to his pediatrician and it was infact an allergic reaction.

I was on my period at the time and was losing clots of blood for most of the day, which also happened to be the last day of my cycle, normally; and then I collapsed at work. I was trembling, couldn't stand, and was freezing cold. That was after less than a week of taking the medicine. I stopped taking the medicine immediately and then contacted my doctor after the holidays.

And I got my life back. That was a life changing part of my life and it feels great. There's that relief of safety and security of doing normal activities. That other people think it is funny, but to me, I can't discribe the feeling. I think, If no other medicine works the doctor's should try this medication, because it can help the patient get their life back. It did for me!!!!!!

My Dr. would remove this medication without the DVM request. Is the DVM a medical responsibility to my driving after one two minute brain seizure 6 months ago. Nothing since has occured.  My daily is 250 mg once a day.

Both of whom have had multiple febrile seizures. The smallest of the two has had absent seizures off and on. Their neurologist has prescribed them keppra and since then their seizures have stopped completly. Instead of worrrying about how many seizures they will have when they're sick we now just worry about usual things parents worry about when their children are ill. The only side effects that came with Keppra was drowsiness which isnt a problem anymore now that theyve been on it for awhile.

I was 16 when I started keppra. I take 750 mg in the morning and 1500 in the evening, it's the only medication i've ever been on. It has effectively controlled my seizures, its been over three years seizure free. The down side is the side effects, Im always tired and now I suffer from extreme anxiety and panic attacts. memory loss is another down side.

I take 1000mg 2x daily. I also am very tired forget things all the time I have to ask if I have done something. Also very moody on this drug, I never was that way before.Hard to remember things that happened in the past. Although the side affects of Keppra are way better than the break through seizures and the alergic recations of the other drugs!!!! I think my family can see that I'm a very different person on this med. but in some ways it is better.

I have always taken 2000 mg in the morning and 2000 mg at night. Beginning six years ago, I have had consistent feelings of extreme tiredness**, dizziness, and memory loss. This is hard for many to understand because I am a healthy, 20 year old woman. Has anyone experienced such extreme similar side effects? and, if so, how do you handle them? **I have tried the &quot;B-12&quot; remedy for tiredness and it hasn't worked well.

She is up to 250mg twice a day and her mood swings are awful.  She is very emotional and totally belligerent.  The worse thing is she is just about to finish 2&#189; years treatment for leukaemia and her hair is falling out again as a result of the Keppra.  I am weaning her off it now and just going to see what happens.

He is taking 3750 mg a day, and has had 6 seizures. While on this medication I noticed a BIG change in his moods and personality. We found out the best way to combat this is to take Vitamin B6 and B12 supplements early in the morning. Some days are better than others but he has changed so much since the start of this treatment. I would definitely say that this should be used as a last resort only, as in his case. And please be VERY informed and prepared before starting. Do your research and ask lots of questions, especialy if there are young children living in your home.

This medicine was prescribed to me during my junior year in high school, and although it started off normal, it did not reduce the amount of seizures I was having.  I was taking 3000 mg of Keppra a day (that's no typo, folks!).  By about my fourth month taking the medicine (probably second month completely weaned onto the medicine), I started experiencing one horrible serious side effect of this medicine -- depression.  This went unnoticed for about four more months until my neurologist forced me to go to a psychologist and started weaning me off the Keppra (after realizing I was experiencing those feelings due to the medicine).  That time period was probably the scariest experience during my life, and I really don't want others to have the same -- especially children.  I'm so grateful that I was able to SURVIVE it.

After 3 days, his moods started changing from a fun, sweet 1 year old to an angry, aggressive little boy. He was hitting and biting himself and others, and we couldn't get him to hold still for anything. He was yelling at everyone and acted like he was unaware of his actions. Please watch out for any abnormal side effects. It can be very scary and dangerous.

Started Keppra, and is now on 3000mg with 300mg of Lamictal.  She has been 1 year seizure free.  She did not have issues other than tired during the first 3 months.  Taking anti seizure meds you don't escape without issues.  When you read other peoples review take with a grain of salt.  this med worked with my daughter.  I did have her put on Lamictal after a year, that is when she was able to go one year seizure free.

In a very short time period, I began experiencing abnormal thoughts.  It was very scary since this is completely out of character to me.  I'm eager for the remaining medication to leave my system, so this stops.  I would not recommend this medication to others.

Other	exhausted, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	10/2/2009 9:26:15 AM	At first it was ok. But as I continued using it I began having problems with depression issues with this medication. I started at a low dose but am now up to 1000 mg, twice daily. I feel that it is not mixing well with my protriptoline that the Dr put me on after I started the Keppra. I have felt worse, and I Try explaining to the Dr, but I'm only the patient. But, sometimes the patient understands more what the body is feeling the Dr. The reason for going on the Keppra is because I have Paresthesias in my left leg, and have gone through 3 back surgeries, and I am 33 years old and am not able to work, and have been dealing with depression. But, I feel this medication is making it worse (Keppra), and I feel, that the protriptoline, is the wrong medicine for me also. Also, to mention I am on oxycodone 10/325 2x daily, fentanyl patch 25, topamax, flexeril 10mg 3x daily, water pills and potassium 3x daily because my potassium bottoms out so. But, since I started on the Keppra I have had problems but the Drs. said it has nothing to do with it. They say it's not from Keppra that caused my depression. But, I was on all these other meds before I started the Keppra, except the protriptoline. Which I started 3 months after the Keppra. So I still feel it's the Keppra that has started my issues. I was on the other stuff for over a year before I started the Keppra.
Simple Partial Seizures	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	25-34	10/1/2009 12:49:36 PM	I have been taking Keppra for over 3months now, at first I felt the side effects intensely, drowsy, dopey, and irritable.  I told my doctor this he lowered my dose and slowly brought me up to a higher dose and slowly got me off the dilantin.  I don't feel the side effects as much now, I learned to exercise regularly helps with the irritability and drinking lots of water.  The doctor told me he needed to increase my dose again until we get my seizures under control.  Since I started on meds I have not had a grand mal, but I still have partial complex seizures a couple times a week, hopefully Keppra will help maintain these seizures with out drugging me up too much.
Other	tblade81, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/27/2009 8:39:01 PM	I have 2 large tumors on my brain and this was the first medication the doctor prescribed to avoid any kind of seizures that the tumors may trigger. Apparently, my boyfriend was woken up in the middle of the night when I had a panic attack and gave me one. I say &quot;apparently&quot; because I don't remember the 24-30 hours after that. Apparently I was a total b**ch to him and everyone around IF I was awake. I slept though most of that time after the pill took effect. According to the script for it, I was to take one of them in the morning and one before bed. There was only ONE taken that night and they were 'only' 750mg. The doctor I saw at the hospital that gave me the script for it had told me that it was the only thing available that would work. Turns how, it was just the one that was most expensive that they would get more money for. They called in a script for Phenytoin which is generic for Dilantin and I have had NO problems with it.

Started seeing a new doctor 3 years ago he put me on Keppra removing Dilantin and Tegratol XR removing Phenetek. We did a slow change over to prevent a seizure as in the past. I take 750mg twice a day. I have had no issues to speak of. I actually excercize more and have more energy than in the past. My heart goes out to those of you that have a hard time with this medication.

First time I ever suffered from schizophrenia!Side effects: at first, constantly tired, and saying things I shouldnt - putting my foot into my mouth. As dosage increased so did the side effects: Full outright conversations with myself at home as well as work, suffering paranoia - as soon as I would get home run literally to hide under the bedcovers from my husband and children, bad memory retention and severe mood and behavior changes - unkind and harsh actions, more often than not, malicious and outright vindictive acts!Seizures began when I was 24 and 20+ years later after various medications, levels, even surgery; with little to no impact I finally found something that would work and so thrilled to flush it down the drain.
Simple Partial Seizures	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	4	1	Female	35-44	9/18/2009 4:40:18 PM	My son was taking Trileptal for seizures which basically turned him into a zombie.  We then started to switch to Keppra.  As the dosage increased, it seemed to be doing a great job stopping the seizures but the side effects were horrible.  He would become belligerent, aggressive, express thoughts of suicide (he was only 10 years old at the time) and then kind of go bezerk.  I would hold on to him until he snapped out of it.  Finally, after running *through* our back screen door, we convinced the doctor to switch medications.  Once he stopped taking it, he was much better.  I recommend being very carefule about this drug.  It may work for you but it may not.  Be extremely careful of the side effects.  If you notice any major mood changes, I would contact your doctor immediately and tell them you want to change medications.  It's not something to mess around with.

I was taking Lamictal.. however, the side effects were unbearable (anxiety, fear, depression)so here I am. I cant say that I am pleased with Keppra. Yes, so far it has controlled my seizures BUT.....I do experience &quot;aura&quot; I am exhausted all of the time, I experience muscle cramps,confusion and yes once in awhile sadness. To be honest I feel like I am walking around in someone elses body. Almost like I have to stop and say &quot;who am I?&quot; Where did that fun, energetic person go?? It is not as bad (for me) as lamictal was. I do manage to keep my head up and keep going. My Dr. prescribed celexa for me as well (to help with the sadness)however, I am afraid to take it. All of us whom have seizures our whole lives know what its like to take so many pills a day and to keep adding more medication to your body is a scary thing! Who knows what the side effects would be when mixing antidepressants and anticonvulsants. If anyone can give me any insight that would be great! My husband and I are trying to have a baby so the less meds I am on, the better. I would love to get it over with and return to Carbatrol.....I had no side effects with that med and it was wonderful. I only wish I could take it during pregnancy!! Would love any advice anyone has to give. Take care and good luck to all of you!

I started on Dilantin at 350mg a day and found out I have Osteoporosis.  I highly recommend if you are taking any seizure medication to get a bone scan!  I switched from Dilantin to Keppra two years ago and my side effects are not as bad as they were on Dilantin.  However, I do go through mood swings and there are days when I just cannot get off the couch.  I feel exhausted pretty much all the time but fight my way through it.  But there are also times where I cannot sleep.  Is this normal?  Does everyone else have these symptoms?  I had a blockage behind my right temporal lobe and had brain surgery at the age of 21.  Thankfully I came out of the surgery just fine and am grateful to be alive.  Keppra keeps me seizure free and really most of the seizure medications have side effects that go along with it.  I guess it's just all part of it.  God Bless to all of you and hang in there!Lisa

Seizures can be partial or Grand mal. He has been on Keppra for over 4 years, and has had excellent results. Seizures are very rare,usually partial, and we have not experienced any serious side affects. However, my son is almost 13, and on a 500mg. dose, which is on the low side for his size. The generic drug, Levetiracetam, is now on the market, and our insurance has switched us to it. So far so good, but our Dr. said the active ingredient in the generic version can vary up to 25%! Good luck to you all.

Simple Partial Seizures	7-12 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Female	7-12	7/7/2009 9:40:59 AM	My daughter was prescribed this drug to take in addition to 300mg of Zonegran. Her seizures are ones that are very hard to control. She had a VNS implanted in Sept. 2007 and takes the medications in addition to the VNS therapy and has responded well. She still continues to have seizures, most often daily episodes but overall I would say that she has done well on this drug. She started out on smaller doses and gradually increased to 1500 as of yesterday. I havent noticed any behavorial issues but she is also Autistic and severely delayed so I couldnt safely attribute her &quot;quirkness&quot; to the drug. I havent notice any hair loss issues either. She isnt depressed, moody or tired. Very active little girl, sweet and loving. I have noticed though after being on the new higher doses in the past that she seems to become immune to it and then we have to go up again. Not sure if it is just her being as her father is the same way when he takes a certain dose of something for an extended period of time or if its the Keppra.Just keep an eye on your loved one that is taking this drug as with any medication and if they begin to exhibit strange behaviors then consult your doctor.I would have to say overall we are very happy with this medication.

Now they claim Dilantin (one that's been around for years) causes liver damage and bone loss.  So Keppra process through the kidneys and now in another 50 years they'll be saying, &quot;It's bad for you because it damages your kidneys.&quot;  Be careful taking this drug because the mood swings are truly a nightmare unless your hitting the peak and you love everyone, but watch for the valleys because they come to as well as the rage!  Should be illegal to give out this drug.

This drug is so dangerous!!! My own family members hid this medicine from me for a couple of days because of the mood swings and changes I was experiencing! I can't even tell you how horrible it is to have to go through such effects! Not to mention getting off of it when you don't even have it to ween off is harder! Headaches are horrible! I couldn't even notice the behavior until off it but I was told that I was like a angry aggressive outraged zombie!!I will never take it again and would rather suffer the seizures and practice living around as less stress as possible. This drug will eventually drive someone to either homicide or suicide if givin to the wrong person!!!! Take it away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have been taking Keppra for around 5yrs now, but it seems like I was like that with the other meds. I have partial seizures and they say it's on the right temporal lobe, and I don't know if that could be the cause with the desire part. I have always been an active physically fit guy and never had a problem with the women and the glory days, but now the desire is shot and I would rather go to bed; things do work just absolutely no desire. I'm just curious if anyone else feels the same way with the meds, or is it because of the partials. I have felt this way since my early 30's.

I had seizures(felt to me like recollecting a dream and then passing out and waking up just fine with no memory loss or confusion or anything as long as I didn't hit my head on something) at a frequency of about 1-2 a year for a couple years but no one witnessed the events. About a year ago I began having them quite often and after one was witnessed I spent some time in the hospital and my docs put me on Keppra 1000mg twice daily. I am still very athletic and in excellent health but now I feel tired often, less motivated, disconnected, can't concentrate as well, and often depressed. It is a bit different for me as I have always been the opposite of all those things. No physical side effects though and I haven't had a single seizure while on it yet. My heart goes out to all that suffer much more than I do or ever did from seizure disorders and the medications for them. Stay strong yall! There is a plan for you, stick around for those who love you!

Work has been a challenge especiall working in DEA compliance, with my memory, I'll stop my pitty party...One thing I have noticed I had to keep increasing my dose overtime. I'm a 200lb person, but now I'm taking 2000mg Keppra in the morning with a 100 Lamictal, then in the evening. I get a little moody and depressed at times, but press on...Most of the time I just go on with my day and don't put too much thought into it to stay strong...We're fighters and will persevere...God Bless!

He woke up one morning and he leg started jerking and he was not responsive. His eyes were fixed up to the ceiling. Brought him to E.R and said it might be nothing and to come back if he had anymore. 2 hours later he had a Grand Mal, called 911 and he was hopspitalized put on a EEG and was diagnosed with Infant Generalized Epilepsy. Doc said he might out grow it by the time he was 3. He doesn't have partial like everyone else does which kind of concerns me. He has been on it for 4 days and all ready he is irritable and has trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. So far he hasn't had any seizures. Right now he is taking .5 Ml and by the 27th he will be on 1.5 Ml. I am very scared to find out what side effects might arise by then since he is on such a low dose now.

I have been on the medication almost a month now. I still feel tired and am very anxious. I am going to talk to the doctor tomorrow. I also am having some increased depression. Unsure if this is due to not being able to drive for 6 months in my state or the medication. Best of luck to everyone.

She could not track even a short conversation and cried a lot.  She is back on dilantin and after 2 months still has a dibilitating intention tremor and &quot;zombies&quot; out frequently, but she can talk in unslerred speech and track a conservation. She has a pacemaker and the cardiologist says she must now go through several tests to determine if her heart has been effected by the medication.

Convulsive Seizures	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/27/2009 12:45:45 AM	This drug is a miracle.  I am a 28-year-old female who has been on Keppra 500mg 2x a day for ~4 years.  I began having severe grand mal seizures (out of the blue) at age 22, and might have 1-2 seizures a week or not have one for 2 months.  Other medications like dilatin or topamax had unacceptable side effects, so we tried keppra instead.  I have not had a seizure since I started Keppra over four years ago.Side effects were few - the fatigue at the beginning has worn off since adjusting to the medication (took a couple of months), and I did not experience any other side effects.  Regular exercise and a good diet also help - I have not experienced any depression or mood swings unless I lapse in my workout schedule.  I have not experienced any weight gain or hair loss; conversely, I've dropped ~25 lbs in the time I've been on Keppra.
Other	Damballah, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/26/2009 9:32:19 PM	My husband was put on this drug after a seizure while on dialysis sent him to the hospital.  He became hostile, had, and still has serious arm tremors; hallucinations, loss of memory, difficulty walking, difficulty speaking for many months after I forced the Dr. to take him off this drug.  NO ONE SHOULD TAKE THIS DRUG!  We are still coping with the side effects, i.e. serious arm tremors, which he NEVER had before taking this drug!  He was on this drug from April until July of 2008, when I put him BACK in the hospital, because he couldn't remember how to give himself insulin, and was seeing &quot;the popcorn man&quot; on the ceiling.  I demanded, as my husband's health proxy, that the Dr. and hospital pull him off this drug immediately. They did and informed me that this was a seizure drug, and he did NOT have seizures.  This is a VERY dangerous drug. WHO MAKES THIS DRUG????? Again, no one should ever take this drug!  Will someone please let me know who makes this drug?

I take 500mg twice a day. I know that not all medicines work for all people and but I have not had a seizure since taking Keppra (over two years now). At first I did feel sleepy/tired but that feeling went away and I do not experience any side effects. While the cost is very high, it has been worth it for me.
Simple Partial Seizures	Kazichelle, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	4/25/2009 12:36:25 AM	My husband was put on this &quot;drug&quot; while in the hospital. He was prescribed Keppra because he was having brain seizures. Let me tell you. This drug should be taken off of the market according to the hospital. His personality changed so rapidly and violently that he had to be restrained in his hospital bed. He started having tremors of the arms and legs and physically assaulted me and one of the nurses on duty. He had hallucinations and tore the IV out of his arms because he thought that they were spiders crawling up his arms. All the medical staff said that it was because of the Keppra.His Neurologist said that all of his patients have reacted this way with Keppra. My question was why he used my husband as a test subject when knowing what this medication would and could do.Every single nurse and/or medical professional I have talked with about Keppra has said the same thing. Do Not Take It!He had no other medications that could have attributed to this reaction, so please if you do need to use this medication, use it with supervision and care.My husband is normally a very shy, quite loving individual and this medication turned him into a raving maniac.

I feel like I am swimming in my own head.  I have lost 30 lbs since I have Jan 09.  I think that this has helped with my seizures since starting them in I have only had a few in Jan.  If I take my meds at the exact same time every day I am fine.  I have noticed that I am not sleeping at all and I am MOODY.  I am anxious. I also am losing my hair it is just thinning out.

Simple Partial Seizures	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/22/2009 10:21:32 AM	The only reason thus far that I have rated Keppra 1 star is because I have just started taking this medication. I have been prescribed 500 mg 2x day. My concern is mood changes as well as other side effects I have read about. I am currently switching from Lamictal to Keppra. I found that with Lamictal, I experience mood swings and depression. It was/is quite difficult for me to sleep at night...even though I am exhausted. I originally was prescribed carbatrol and it was wonderful. I didnt experience any aura or have any side effects from it. As a matter of fact I have been seizure free for about 4 years and counting. The main reason I am switching meds is because my husband and I would like to have a baby. That being said, I understand Keppra and Lamictal are pretty much the best choices when trying to conceive. Seeing how I have not had luck with Lamictal, I am wondering if anyone has had a child when taking Keppra. Of course my major concern is having a healthy child, but what I also have to take in effect are the side effects..can I handle them especially if I am pregnant? I suppose only time will tell.Can anyone help me on this matter???

Other	ashrae87, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	4/16/2009 4:17:46 PM	I am a college student and it's important to me that my medication doesn't leave me to impaired.  When I first started taking this medication, and everytime the dose is increased, I have some mild side-effects.  It makes me tired and moody for a week or two and then I am fine.  I still have really thick long hair.  It never thinned out on this medicine.  I do notice that I feel dehydrated and drink more water now.  If I take my medicine late or miss a dose I feel dizzy and sick for a little while, but it gets better after I take my pills... Also, my doctor said that I could drink a little on the keppra as long as I don't drink to much.  I wouldn't go over three drinks on this.  If you do drink on it you will want to drink plenty of water or you will have a serious headache.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.

I start using Kappra I was having bad side affects.  I was having neck pains, very bad headaches and mood swings. I beleave Keppra weakened the wall of my blood vessels in my brain which cause a aneurysm. I went to the emergency room Nov 2008 with a very bad headache and senitive eyes.  They did another MRI and CTA scan and found I had a aneurysm 2-3 mm.  I had a MRI in August 2008 and had no sign of a aneurysm until I start taking Keppra.  Since Nov 2008 I was taken off Keppra and I had another MRI Feb 2009 and found I no longer have an Aneurysm. I feel this is a very dangerous drug.  Please pay attention to the side effect and do not disgard any symptoms and listen to your body.

During the first 2 months I did have 2 siezures, but that was probably due to the fact that I just took the pills at random as well as an adjustment to the medication. Since May of 2008 I have not had a siezure. I also had gotten pregnant during that time and have now had a very healthy and happy baby boy who will be 4 weeks old on March 11th 2009. I am very satisfied with this medication and it has worked! Hope this information can help some one!

During that year I was on dilantin and dosage adjustments were made. I was medically discharged and after leaving I still would have a seizure once or twice a year until 2004. Keppra was given as an assistive to my dilantin and I have not had a seizure since. I am on 400mg of dilantin and 1000mg of keppra a day split up into morning and evening doses. My liver levels have been good and so has my blood levels. My daughter just had a seizure this weekend and has now been diagnosed with the same disorder. She has been placed on keppra only so we will see how it goes.

Simple Partial Seizures	G$ , 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	35-44	2/26/2009 3:58:58 PM	I have been on Keppra for a long time(10to12years) and I still have seizures. Maybe 1 or two a week.  The type that when the seizure occurs when you can't spit out what you want to say and become very disoriented and want to sit or lay down.  It can last anywhere from 10 or 15 seconds upto a minute or so. Keppra has'nt been as effective as was when first prescribed.  It's as if the body or system has built a tolerance or a shield if you will, to prevent the meds from kicking in upon arrival of the seizure.  I can feel when it is going to happen or just before it happens, but still can't mentally stop it from occuring as weird as it may seem.  Keppra sometimes will still help, but not like it used to even taken in with partner  Lamictal.  It came make me become extremely moody, tired, and suffer loss of appetite.  I have lost weight and suffered that darn hair loss issue.  I guess these would be classified as complex partial though when first diagnosed at age 20 these seizures caused me to blackout and fall floorbound.  This, however, has not happened in years.  I don't know if it's the Keppra or Lamictal or a combo.  I was much worse however, attitude and behavior wise, when on tegretol and carbatrol.  In the long run it has made my lifestyle better I guess as opposed to when first diagnosed with epilepsy.  I don't know what is worse,  the meds not always working effectively or not knowing why or how this condition came about.  I have no family history of the condition and have never suffered any head trauma injuries. All EEG's and MRI's negative and no sugar problems either.  Somewhat satisfied with Keppra.  Good Luck to everyone out there we're all in this together no matter what we're classified with.

That may work for your husbands also. I still am extremely tired- but it is better. My memory is completely shot- You may notice that too. My husband has just gotten used to me asking him the same thing over and over! I really think the memory problems people have with this is from being SO tired. I also started taking Lexapro 10 mg with the Keppra to bring me out of a funk I felt I was sliding in to. I feel that too, has helped me alot. Please be patient with your hubby. This drug makes you feel like you are sleep walking a lot of the time. Hopefully, it will work itself out for you. IT WILL TAKE AWHILE. Good news is, that I have not had a seizure for 3 years!! Good Luck!! I will be starting the generic form in about a week and I am scared to death! Wish me luck!! 
Simple Partial Seizures	lakelover1, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	1/29/2009 2:06:44 PM	I siddenly started having these episodes that I had no idea what was causing them.  I would get light headed and have a strange sensation starting in my stomach and eventually ending up in my head they got progressively more frequent but symptoms never changed unless it was the time of day.  I went to my medical doctor, he sent me to a neurologist who seemed to know what was going on but with my medical background I wasn't satisfied that I woud begin having these for no reason.  I then requested a cardiac workup and wore a holtor monitor, had an echocardiatram, an mri,ekg, you name it I had it.  Once I started reluctantly on the Keppra it took about two weeks to completely take these symptoms away, guess the neurologist was right after all but why? was my question.  I am 61 years old and all of a sudden I start having these episodes.  This runs in my family but at a much younger age (childhold or teenage) and something brought it on.  I now have them down to one or two a day and the strangest thing is that I have them after dinner when I sit down to watch TV etc.  This is still strange to me, did I mention that I saw another neurologist just to confirm it?  Well I did and he said the same thing so I guess I will learn to live with these - I started having the episodes in August and started the medication around October, after all of the tests so I guess I will take them the rest of my life, it sure beats having those episodes which I believe would have gotten worse over time.

I was put on phenobarbital then.  When I was 18 I was seizure free and wasn't taking any medications.  Then at age 23 I had 2 grand mal seizures in one day.  I was hospitalized for these ones.  It ended up I was pregnant and the pregnancy brought them on.  I'm 35 now and have been taking dilantin and phenytek for the grand mals.  I've had about 10 grand mal seizures since I was 23.  Medicines seemed to be working.  Then I was at the doctor's office with my grandmother and I had a partial seizure.  Her doctor called my neurologist and told him what had happened.  I went to see my neuro and he put me on the keppra.  Ever since then I've been good with it.  As long as I remember to take it I don't have any of the partial seizures.  But if I miss just one dose I will have one.  I never knew until reading these comments that anger was one of the side effects.  I have noticed that I do get more irratated with people than I used to.  I guess I know why now.  I am always tired too and I've been taking keppra for about 2 years now.  I would much rather be angry and tired than have any more of those seizures.  It's terrible to lose time, not know where you are, who's around you, what you were doing, etc.  The benefits definitely outweigh the side effects  in my opinion.

It did make me depressed and exhausted at all different times of the day.I do get irritable and I do feel violent at times but I know that those are simple side effects compared with what some other medications have.About a year ago my doctor told me it was stress that was causing them to happen so frequently.I have worked to quit stressing out so badly and this medicine has worked wonders. i've been without seizures for almost a year now and although my memory isn't quite so good anymore I believe its worth it compared to the horrors I went through.By the way I have a variety of seizures but have been officially diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.  I experience tonic clonic seizures when stressed, especially upon waking and during sleep, if i've gone to bed stressed.

He doesn't have to take it! My body now tingles, a horrible feeling. I've had a sore throat since I started taking it.  I was on a higher dose and then it felt like my throat was closing.I am always sleepy and, since I started taking it, the world went from watching color TV to returning to watching black and white. I can't explain that. I get easily agitated. This is just not me anymore.  I've tried about 4 or 5 other anti-seizure.  I've had everything from bone loss to hair loss and speech problems.  Sure the seizures are stopped by all of these, but at what cost...?  I absolutely take my meds., but certainly somebody could come up with something without all the side-effects.

It has given me back my life. Without it I studder and I did have one grand mal seizure. The speech problem was a symptom of milder seizures. I take 1000 mg twice a day and live a very normal life as long as I take the keppra.  I am thankful that I found this medication and again, it gave me a normal life.... I have no side affects from Keppra. I did try TOPAMAX and it caused severe short term memory loss.  I could not tolerate it. Epilepsy is in my family.  I first had symptoms at age 16.

Simple Partial Seizures	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/4/2008 8:01:18 PM	I had my first (and only) grand-mal seizure this past June.  I had seen several doctors over the years because I would experience changes in my sense of taste and smell and the doctors never had any idea what it was.   Unfortunately it turned out to be epilepsy because I was also suffering from forced thoughts that were like a daydream(I never told anyone about this because I was ashamed, but I had no idea they were seizures).  So initially my neurologist prescribed Topamax and it was the WORST medication!  I couldn't concentrate at work and the tingling in my arms and legs was unbearable.  He changed my medication to Keppra and I have not had any problems.  I am so happy that he changed my meds because I cannot imagine living my life the way I felt when I was on Topamax because I could not focus on anything and I just didn't feel right.  My advice to anyone is that even though it is scary when you are newly diagnosed with this condition, there are medications out there where you can be free of side-effects.  I was hesitant to switch meds, but it was definitely the best decision I could have made! Good luck everyone!
Simple Partial Seizures	Jams, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/2/2008 11:25:32 PM	At age 30, I was recently diagnosed with a seizure disorder that I first experienced at about age 4.  After inconclusive testing at that young age, I didn't have another seizure until age 18, but have since had one every approximately 3 years.  I finally saw a neurologist about a month ago, and after an MRI and EEG, he prescribed Keppra, 400mg 2x/day.  The first week or so was not fun - I was very emotional, tired, and sometimes experienced dizziness and vertigo.  But, about 4 weeks into treatment, the negative side effects have subsided and I feel physically ok.  One strange thing that I will ask my doctor about tomorrow, my usually very regular menstrual cycle is nearly 2 weeks late right now, though I am certainly not pregnant.  Regardless, I am happy with the medication thus far, though I will not know how effective it truly is for me for some time, as my seizures were so few and far between anyway...
Simple Partial Seizures	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/2/2008 1:01:31 AM	I have only been on Keppra for a week along with my dilantin.  I am in the process of coming off dilantin due to bone loss  and gum inflamation.  I do feel tired quit but am concerned about what will happen to me when I completely come off of dilantin in another week.  Dilantin has controlled my seizures for 15 years.  I am already  scatter brained at times and don't need any more help.  I will pray for those who are dealing with much worse side effects than me and hope you find the right meds to help you have a joyful life.

They say that it is do dangerous for them to give me any type of treatment for these.

We're discontinuing it as soon as we can.

Folks we all have to realize some meds affect us all differently. July'07 I had a hemorrhagic stroke accompanied by a grand mal seizure. Mind you I had never suffered any kind of seizures prior. The doctors determined the stroke was brought on by hypertension and with my choosing to have the ability to sexually satisfy my wife, as the blood pressure meds tend to bring on ED, I had stopped the meds all together. I drank alcohol abundantly and smoked on occasion. Aug'08 I experienced one more onset seizure and the doctors now have me on 460mg. phenytoin along with 1000mg. keppra. I have experienced some restless sleeping and the difficulty of forming some sentencing. These side effects may infact be the results of the seizure as opposed to the keppra. At any rate I have been taking this med for only 5 weeks, and I feel great aside from the restless sleep. Now mind you, I have been known for my articulating and public speaking abilities. But the opportunity to live without the seizures far outweighs these side effects. I have found that regular exercise, even simply walking, and a proper diet can make a drastic change. Try taking care of yourself before relying on the meds all the time. I am hoping to be off keppra within the next year or so. Those of you suffering from long term epilepsy, I can only wish you the best and may God Bless all.

My left eye has been droopy for over a year now.  The pain above my left (and sometimes right) eye and my temple(s) become so bad at times, I can't think straight.  My left cheek becomes numb a great deal and today, I felt as if I had been to the dentist as my left eye down to my lip felt numb.Anyone out there have any words of wisdom or advice???Thanks,SheilaThe doctor has changed the dosage a few times and thinks that is what happened today.  I don't beleive that it has to do with that.  But what do I know?!?

I use it twice daily in addition to another anti seizure medication.  The side effects are difficult at times.  The medication is expensive, but the trade off for the quality of life now verses the quality of life before Keppra is worth taking the medication.

Simple Partial Seizures	jaciladybug, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	9/25/2008 3:38:40 AM	I have had three severe seizures, where I don't remember what happened, and then one time, I lost all muscle control, and my eyes went back in my head, and I could not hold my head up. I could not walk, etc. The very first seizure I had, I was in the shower in the middle of the night, (my husband works thirds) and I thought someone was coming after me, I remember getting in the corner of the shower, and the next thing I remember is I was laying on the couch, naked, hearing water running, and didn't even remember of being in the shower. I slowly got up, went looking for where the water was coming from, the shower curtain was down, water was everywhere, and I do not remember how I got out of the shower, how I got bruises all over my legs, unless I tried to go upstairs, and fell (we have no stairway rails), but since then I have been so scared. Then the second one was where I lost all muscle control. Now that I know I was having seizures, I figure that is why I was jumping all the time in bed. At one time, I thought I was going to jump completely out of bed. I thought it was my muscle relaxing. My eyes still go blurry, double vision, etc. I really don't know what the symptons are, because this is new to me. They do not know why I am having them. I am 55 years old, and am in poor health. This just added to it.

I have become a &quot;monster&quot; in the last 2 months, very moody, thoughts of suicice. I have thought I was depressed until I have read that others have had the same issues and reviewing the side affects. I physically attacked my 23 year old son (I thought it was provoked though). THis website is how I found out about he allergy to the Tegretol. I have only had 2 seizure which were 4 months apart. I would rather risk that than continue to be the person I have become of late. I would recommend this, but if any out of the normal side effects start then contact your MD and insist he/she listens to you.

The doctor told me it would be very common to have mood changes/depression for a couple of weeks.  Well with each day it got worse and he talked about suicide.

Once taken off the medication in two weeks he was perfectly fine again.

I love Keppra so far. 
Convulsive Seizures		3	5	3			6/22/2008 5:25:11 AM	I honestly am not sure how I feel about the medication thus far. I have noticed a few side effects such as los of appetite and unlike many other reviews I've read, I haven't felt drowsy; in fact, I've had trouble getting to sleep at night. As it is I'm writing this review at 2:30 in the morning. I was previously on Lamictal which didn't help me in the least and I generally have a grand mal seizure every 6 weeks or so. I've only been in the this medication 3 weeks and so far I've remained seizure free, but I suppose I wont really know for another month. I guess I'll keep you posted then.

My neurologist prescribed Trileptal, which made me dizzy and didn't really control my seizures, even after several dosage increases.  He added Keppra about 18 months ago, and I haven't had any seizures since.  About 8 months ago, I stopped taking the Trileptal and still haven't had any seizures.  I slept much better after adding Keppra, and had only about a week of side effects (irritability).  I've been very happy with it, but it still makes me feel a little foggy and slow (but not nearly as much as trileptal did).
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/8/2008 8:35:04 PM	***Day 2 on Keppra and I am plesantly surprised to report that other than needing a little extra time to get out of bed in the morning, I have had not a single reaction to the switch to Keppra. I've been cold turkey off of Trileptal for 48 hours now and luckily, I've had no breakthrough seizures and I wouldn't even know I made the switch because there are no signs of anything different with Keppra.  I know depression, agression and a list of other non-desireable sysmptoms can begin soon but so far so good! As for my hives, it's too soon to know if they'll go away after stopping the Trileptal, I should know in a couple more days if they clear up, they were probably caused by the Trileptal. Anyway, the keppra hasn't bothered me a bit, yet!
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/7/2008 2:17:05 AM	After reading all these comments, I am nervous to begin Keppra tomorrow. I have complex partial seizures and I've been very happy on Trileptal for over a year but I have a hiddeous case of hives that have lasted nearly 6 weeks. My doctor thinks it's only a slight possiblity that I develeped hives so far into my taking Trileptal but we are changing meds to see what happens. I'll be starting Keppra in the morning, hoping I don't go nuts on my family and friends like many of these posts are mentioning. I will post my progress because I do know that it is helpful to read about others experiences on these meds.  Although, out of a million drug users, you'd get a million different responses to the drug.  So, if my journey helps someone else, then fine....at least you can be entertained by my &quot;experiment&quot;.  I was on Lamictal and I thought I was going to die after 2 weeks, my head was in so much pain...switched to Trileptal and felt fine.  We'll see what happens tomorrow! 
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	35-44	6/4/2008 9:31:33 AM	I have been taking Keppra prophylactically before having a benign brain tumor removed in a few weeks (the surgery can cause seizures).  The medication has made me a bit sleepy, seems to interfere with my hand-eye coordination, and caused some constipation.  The adverse events seem to last for about 3-4 days after I increase the dose then abate.  As long as I don't develop post-op seizures, it will be worth taking this medication.

She could never remember what she did in school or the day or what she was doing due to her being very confused from the seizures. Her neurologist started her on Keppra it took about a month total for the seizures to slow to a stop but since then she has been seizure free for almost a year now. I do have to say though the first month was very rough. She would cry for no reason or a lot more than normal she was moody and  complained of body aches but I have to say almost all of the side effects are non existent now. She mostly complains of a stomach ache about an hour after taking her medicine, but a stomach ache compared to everything she has accomplished since starting the medicine is nothing. She has focus and is no longer confused through out the day. Since being on Keppra it took her two months to learn how to read. I do agree on the cost though lucky I have insurance now, but it scares me to think that just one month supply is almost 400 dollars and you can't just stop taking the medicine even if insurance goes bye-bye.

Depakote caused me to get a life-threatening case of pancreatitis (so BE CAREFUL!); Lamictal caused bruising and migraines; Topamax &amp; Tegretol didn't work; et cetera. Many of them made me lose/gain weight and lose hair. I thought all hope was lost until they put me on Keppra. I've not lost any hair; my appetite/weight is fine; the drowsiness has mostly worn off. I don't think it's caused much of a personality change--in fact, I feel better than I have in years, almost as good as I felt before I was diagnosed with epilepsy! I would advise anyone to try it, but as with ANY anti-epileptic drug, keep a journal, watch for side effects, and tell your doctor if you have side effects. ALL drugs cause side effects. You have to be your own advocate and decide with your doctor if the benefits outweigh the risks. In my case, Keppra has been WONDERFUL. I do wish it wasn't so expensive, though! It's like an extra car payment every month!  I hope there is a plan to come up with a less expensive, generic version, or that healthcare in this country gets better... but I won't be holding my breath on that! :o)  Good luck to everyone and let's hope for more research, better meds, and maybe even a cure!

MY SYMPTOMS MOODY, FATIGUED, ACHY JOINTS, BACK PAIN, VERY UNHAPPY. ALSO THIS MEDICINE IS EXCRETED THROUGH YOUR KIDNEYS. IT IS GOOD TO DRINK LOTS OF WATER OR SO IVE HEARD.my epilepsy is so mild i think taking this medicine is worse on me than not taking it, but im scared to stop it too suddenly. im slowly weaning myself off. if the dr doesnt want me to, but ive gotta do something. it is affecting my life.

Simple Partial Seizures	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	4/8/2008 5:14:04 PM	The left side of my body kept acting up on me. I went to see my neuro doc and he put me on Keppra 500mg 2X's a day. I was VERY tired for the first month and my symptoms were not gone. He upped my dose to 750mg 2X's a day and the side effects were minimal. I sleep more, but it is better then the seizures. The downfall is that the medication is very expensive. With insurance I pay $111.00 every month. Again, worth it if I am seizure free. The only other side effect I have had is moodiness. I am now on Lexapro and it seems to be helping.

My body goes thru phases where my seizures become uncontrollable even with the use of medication. I tried 5 different drugs until my new neurologist put me on keppra 1000mgs 2x per day. Yes, the side effects at first sucked.Dizziness,fatigue,and just being CRANKY.The side effects soon subsided and now I have been seizure free for 3 years! I still get auras from time to time around my monthly cycle however, I feel alert with no grand mal seizures! This has been the BEST drug I have tried yet!
Simple Partial Seizures	yazzy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	4/6/2008 12:18:38 PM	My doctor started me on Keppra because I do want to become pregnant someday- not sure when, and because i was gaining weight and having irregular periods. He said it is better for females and also compared to Depakote that I was taking before. I was just hospitalized last week because I had 4 seizures at home and 1 in the ER and that was in one day. I normally don't have that many seizures (normally 1 seizure in like forever) but I think because I was changing meds and there wasn't enough of both meds in my system was why I had that awful experience. Anyway, when I first took Keppra I didn't feel anything- no dizziness or feeling like i'm crazy or anything, but i think it's because there wasn't enough of it in my body... after i was hospitalized and my doctor increased the dosage from 1000mg to 1500mg daily, i am feeling really weird... everything seems very confusing and i do feel like i'm going crazy. i am quite dizzy and i tend to say what's on my mind more frequently. i have lost almost 25lbs since last week-- not sure if it's due to the hospitalization or the medication, i'm not eating as much as i used to..i also used to have cysts in my ovaries which caused my to have periods that lasted forever. it stopped after taking birth control but came back after 2 months. however, since about 2/3 days ago my period has stopped; also not sure why... maybe the cysts have gone away. will see what happens next month... and i'm still waiting for my dizziness and feeling like i'm going psycho to go away...hopefully soon!!! i need my life back! i don't feel depressed or anything... just weird... and  i also experienced some memory loss-- like i can't remember even the simplest things... and yes, that is depressing... i really hope it's just for a while until my body gets used to it... will comment back after a few weeks when the side effects are hopefully gone...

It stopped the partials but I experienced mania side effects. Went from 1500 a day to 1000 and mania got better but still was impatient and moody. My doctor said such side effects were mainly seen in adolescents and teens. I am dropping off it and going to move to lamictal. A little research and I discovered Keppra is related to the nootropics or brain enhancers. Also its active ingredient is removed by the renal system so if you are compromised in kidney function at all it may be more potent. For me it looks like a medicine whose active ingredeant is metabolized by the liver like dilatin and lamictal may be better. And lamictal is noted as a mood stabilizer and is also used for bi-polar disorder.

And until about a 1 1/2 ago I thought I was having auras all the time.  Well I had one of my &quot;auras&quot; while I was at the doctor's office the one day.  He told me I was having Complex Partial Seizures, not auras.  He put me on Keppra, and it works wonders!  I don't have my &quot;auras&quot; anymore, unless I forget to take the Keppra.  I do find that I am tired all the time though.  And I have some mood swings, but like so many other people say on here, the effectiveness out ways the side effects.  Plus, it is very expensive, and my insurance won't pay for it.

At first, I was disapointed with the side effects..fatigue,weekness,dizziness,moody...etc.  However, the side effects has stopped.  I have not felt this good for 15 years. My old medications Tegretol and Dilantin caused many problems such as acne, rashes, memory loss, concentration problems,inflamed gums,and bruises. All these side effects has stopped. I do have problems with sleeping but over all &quot;I am myself&quot; once again. It's pretty scary changing medications but it is worth it in the end! good luck to others

It made him very aggitated with sudden bursts of anger for small reasons.  It also made him dizzy about a half an hour after taking the drug, it made him tired and sleepless. His seizures were unaffected by Keppra.  He has been off of Keppra for three days and he is getting back to his old loving self.  He is now trying Phenobarbital....hopefully it will stop his two or three a month partial seizures.

I've never really been &quot;seizure free&quot;, but in recent years almost all of my seizures occur when I'm sleeping. Yet different neurologists, in their attempt to totally eliminate the seizures, have tried a variety of different drugs and dosages. I was having terrible trouble with the shaking caused by Depakote, so he recently started me on Keppra. Havn't noticed any of the predicted side effects, but I still have seizures  every night when I fall asleep. The main side effect seems to be I have terrible trouble falling asleep at nights. Is this a side effect of Keppra or a condition that will pass after I've been on it for a longer period?

I was born with epilepsy(absence or petit mals), but wasnt diagnosed with it untill I was 18-19 yrs of age. at the age of 16 I was in a car accident that caused me to have grand mals. So now I have 2 kinds of epilepsy. I have been on anywhere from 9-12 different types of meds. I hate it! most of them made me lose my hair and gain weight and become very sleepy. my social life has crumbled. My licence has been taken away and i have few friends.(at least I have my 2 kids) i just got on Keppra I take 1-500mg dose aday. It was more , but it made my moods change and alot more hair loss, not including the weight gain. I was on TOPAMAX for 7-8 yrs. I was taken off because it caused kidney stones. Now i have to get my 2nd lipotripsy to have them removed. I am also on ZARONTIN. Its the best thing to help control my grand mals, but every 4-6 yrs My drs. keep changeing my meds, thats when I have the big seizures. My body has taken a toll and I hate it! So far so good with the keppra. we will see what happens.

My Dr. put me on it because he was afraid I would have seizures. After being on 500mg morning and 500mg at night for about 5 months he was able to reduce it to 500mg every night.  A few days ago I had a partial seizure so he increased my dose to what it was originally.  Since increasing my dose the only side effect I seem to have is a little bit of dizziness but I know that it will stop after I have been on it for a week or so.  I would rather be on this medication then take a chance of having a severe seizure because something like that could cause more brain injury and I am very lucky that I recovered as well as I have.  When my injury originally happened I bled out of my left ear and I was sent to Barrows in Phoenix, Az and spent 3 weeks in intensive care in an induced coma with drains in my head to relieve the pressure in my brain and then was released after improving to a rehibilation hospital for another 3 weeks and then was released and recovered very well and was able to drive again and return to work.

His mood swings, irrational behavior, anxiety, anger are out of control and are ruining our lives.  He is seeing a different Dr to find out what is going on.  The seizures were bad, but this is almost worse.  Please try to seek help for the side effects.  We were told to take B12 for the mood swings and no blood tests have been done since he's been on it.  Be very careful about drinking beer with this med, because it seems to intensify all of the side effects.

It made me drowsy for the first couple weeks and each time I increased, but after I got used to it I feel great!  No weight gain as with older medications like depakote (awful!)  Just stick with it to find the right dosage and wait for side effects to go away after about 2 weeks.

Convulsive Seizures	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	35-44	2/1/2008 11:48:01 AM	I take Keppra 500mg 3 X's a day. Its effects are pretty good at preventing seizures, however the side effects are beginning to be bothersome. Although it is not so dun to talk about: the keppra has a very musky smell through the urine. Other side effects are fatigue, drowsiness, times of chronic fatigue syndrome, and nausea.  I continue to take this medicine because for now, the effectiveness of the drug on the prevention of seizures is greater than the side effects.   My advice to anyone on a daily regimen of Keppra is to make sure that your doctor test for any signs of liver damage at least every 90 days.  My overall rating of this drug from 1-10 with 1-not effective and 10 being super effective is about 7.5.  Just make sure you and your doctor arrive at the correct dosage for your particular illness.

Since I have started this med 8 months ago, I have had a gradual decline in functioning of my right hand and arm.  The right arm returned to a stiff bent position.  My right leg also gradually returned to dragging as if I had another stroke.  The arm and leg symptoms all occurred 16 yrs ago as a result of my stroke.  I received therapy back then to restore function to those limbs, but it had gradually worsened since starting this med. I have been working with my neurologist to pinpoint the cause of these symptoms, but I truly feel it is a result of this med.

The Tegretol alone was not working and she had many breakthrough seizures, especially when sick. She has a virus now and has had no seizures. I do however notice mood swings with her now, which is concerning, but you have to weigh out the benefits and they are worth it.

We had to pay $1,000.00 for three months supply. We had to put it on our charge card as we also have many many other RXs for my wife and myself. No generic is available and we think this is price gouging to charge this much for a life or death drug.

Removed, but auras/seizures continued.On various meds never controlled. Recently taken off of dilantin which I had been on for 20 years. Now on Keppra 500 twice a day, Gabitril and Lamictal. No seizures unless I'm late taking meds, but occasional auras. Side effects awful and have not improved. Cognative problems.Dizziness and loss of concentration. Loss of appetite, extreme fatigue. No desire to do anything which could be depression with the combination of anti-seizure medications. Sleepy/tired all the time. No problem with anger.

I take 5000mgs a day.  Makes me very lethargic most of the time.  I see someone else said B6 might help?  Also wondering if anyone elses Doctors have ever said they could reduce the amount they take, down the road of course.  When I asked my Doctor about it, he said that there is dead matter in the brain from treatments, however the body will eventually absorb. Unfortunately, this can take years according to him.  Has anybody out there been able to reduce the amount of Keppra you take?  I did read you can't just stop taking it but can you ween yourself down a little, I'm just looking to have a little more energy back down the road.  I know getting off kilter can really throw you.  I just had another medical procedure done and could not stay exactly on schedule(off by approx. 3 hours} plus what ever drug they gave me for the procedure really messed me up for a couple days.  I had a couple seizure like symptoms, like I was going to go into one, wow haven't felt like that for awhile.  So any words of wisdom I would appreciate?Oh ya, my diagnosis was an inoperable Oligoastrocytoma.  Operating would cause brain damage.  I did have an initial Biopsy.Thank you,Dazed &amp; Confused

I have had a few break thru seizures, but my dosage was increased and I've been seizure free for over a month now. The only real side effects that I've had were severe mood swings and being tired ALL the time. In the beginning, I also felt a little disoriented, but it passed after the first 4-6 weeks. It has also lowered my blood pressure. This medication has been a blessing to me so far. My only caution is be careful if you're prescribed certain types of Antibiotics. I had a severe reaction last month and had a convulsive seizure. It's not very common, but just my luck;-)

I wasn't diagnosed until I was 16, by then I was having Gran Mal siezures and if doctors knew more when I was 10 I probably would have been kept at Petite Mal....For Years I took Dilantin and Tegretol and a couple others I can not recall, then found neurontin, but the weight gain was realy bad so I was put on Depakote and Tegretol, then just Depakote and Imitrix(migraines)and then my Neurologist offered the possibility of 1 medication, Keppra, I have been on it for 6+ years and have few if any side effects compared to the others, I also stay hydrated and eat properly, no visits to MacDonalds or the other fast food joints and listen to my neurologist.

Simple Partial Seizures	SRJeff, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	35-44	11/4/2007 2:26:46 AM	Had no idea why I started having seizures a few years ago, but after being on Dilantin (which made the world feel about 5 mph) prescribed by my regular doc, I saw a neurologist who switched me to Keppra.Whatever you do, do not miss doses - I had a few whoppers in an hour back in September after having run out of it and waiting for my paycheck.  The stuff is ridiculously expensive, but I think UCB's patent should be expiring fairly soon, so if you don't have a Rx formulary benefit/insurance, generic levetiracetam will hopefully be available stateside soon.  It works, wonderfully, even.

Other than the occasional anger flair ups at the most mundane situations, and the restlessness in th e middle of the night, and insomnia, I've had no adverse reaction.  It is certainly better than living in the constant fog I had been under for over 30 years with Dilantin which still allowed 2-4 seizures to occur per year.  I suspect that the anger flair ups will subside once my body adjusts and the proper dosage is worked out. I am presently taking 750mg twice daily as opposed to 400mg daily of Dilantin.

Simple Partial Seizures	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	10/26/2007 3:24:49 AM	Started taking three months ago. So far, no seizures (I'd only had one before the first, though) Initial side effects were brutal: I slept two + hours every day and felt drugged and exhausted all the time. Now feel great and back to a normal sleeping regimen, sleep changes adjusted over two-three weeks as predicted. I do find sometimes I feel VERY awake at night and get a burst of energy for a couple hours, which is not like me. Am not a night person. Wake up feeling fine and energized, though, even with less sleep. Alcohol definitely is a caution: one drink with Keppra is a whole party in my brain. Two drinks = what used to feel like 4-5 drinks for me. (You are supposed to avoid alcohol with this medication,though, so I can't blame it.) I actually feel BETTER than before I took it, if a little altered and a teeny bit manic (I was high energy before, now it all just feels a little more intense/energized/revved up). Good luck to you with this med.
Additional Medication for Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy		5	5	5			10/16/2007 10:08:46 PM	I have been taking Lamictal for years until I mentioned Keppra to my doctor. It is supposed to cause depression, among other side effects but I have no problems so far.  I am being taken off of Lamictal and am very pleased with the lack of trouble with this medication. I am eager to be off Lamictial completely. While Lamictal worked for years, Keppra seems to be the drug of choice for me now.
