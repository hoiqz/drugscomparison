While at first it seemed to work, the fungus quickly returned as the weather warmed and my feet sweated more. There is no generic available and it's no more effective than generic econazole.

They ruled out ring worm and other infections. I have licked my lips and I feel so sick and light headed. I am calling posion control.

Fortunately he has been providing me with samples. (this medication is very expensive). There has been some improvement, but at a very slow rate. I haven't experienced any side effects, but find the progress to be way too slow!

Medication easy to apply and after a few days, skin was drying out with some flaking, but redness still remained. After 12 days, dry skin had some areas where it was splitting causing tenderness and soreness. The doctor noted it may take 2 months of use for complete healing and to apply a moistureizer between uses. Was hoping for faster results and better progress. Jury still out if this will work, With perscription card, $40 a tube, without, $140! Tube lasted about 2 weeks.

I noticed redness and inflamation on my toes after use. Upon returning to my MD, I was told that this was not caused by the cream. Shortly after, I started to experience tingling up my calfs, and went to the E.R. where Heperin was started to rule out blood clots. When I informed the hospital that I had used this cream, they stated that it may be a side effect from the cream. Please be aware if you experience these symptoms, that it could be caused by ertaczo.

The tube is used up and very exoensive and I would like to know if there is an OTC ointment/cream which can complete the job
