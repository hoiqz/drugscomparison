I started taking .75mg doses of Cabergoline twice each week.  I tolerated the drug very well for 2 years... had some dry eyes, a little dizziness but not much more.  In the past 6 months I have developed some lupis type symptoms.  Dry eyes, headaches, on my fingers &amp; toes I am getting white &amp; blue patches with some red spots that have a little burning sensation... ruptured capillaries.  I have some shortness of breath and some itchyness on my gums.  Going to see the Endo Doc in a few weeks to see if cutting back on the dosage is wize.

My pituitary tumor is completely gone with this medication. The only complaint I have is that I feel tired all of the time and drinking alcohol with this medication really intensifies the effect of the alcohol.

Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	2/20/2012 5:29:43 PM	I have just begun taking Cabergoline, 1st dose of 0.25mg (1/2 tab.) this past Friday. I was diagnosed with a Macro Prolactinoma back in 2007 and have been taking Bromocriptine (Parlodel) ever since with great success; my Prolactin is normal and the tumor has shrunk to half it's original size. However, recently a new Endocrinologist I was referred to wanted me to try Cabergoline, said it was &quot;newer, better, faster, targeted to the tumor, less side effects&quot; etc. Made it sound like a miracle silver bullet for Pituitary Tumors. Well, since that first dose 4 days ago I have been experiencing dizziness, major nausea, extreme fatigue, acid stomach no matter what I eat, increased bathroom trips, dismal mood swings, mind fog/difficulty concentrating, shaky and sweaty (esp. at night). Basically, I feel awful! From what I read in these reviews this sounds, with a few exceptions, like everyone else's experiences to some degree or other. Personally, this is not worth it at all. Since fertility is not an issue for me there is no other reason I can see to stay on this drug when the other one I was taking was working just fine without this extreme level of side effects. I really do wish this drug had been easier to tolerate, but I guess each person reacts differently. Good luck to anyone who tries it.         
Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	2/1/2012 1:11:59 AM	I started out with headaches and no sex drive. I went to the doctor and had some tests done. Winds up that my prolactin level was 600&gt;. Had an MRI done. Found a 16mm pituitary tumor. Started taking cabergoline. 3 weeks later had another MRI. The tumor decreased significantly within weeks. As far as my sex drive is concerned, well I feel like I've hit puberty again. So far it has worked great, besides feeling dizzy sometimes.

Been on it for 12 yrs and only had to increase from 1 tab 2x a week to 2 tabs 2x a week.  the only problem i have with it is that I can't take my Migriane medication (shots) within 24 hours of taking this medication because of the interaction it has.

My levels were about 75. Within the first few months I noticed that the tenderness in my breasts subsided greatly and my periods were more regular. But now it seems that it may have plateaued? I can tell my periods/hormone levels are similar to before starting this med. Worried that the levels are getting worse or not responding to the dosage anymore

I have been taking cabergonline for about 3 years off and on. I was putting on weight prior to being diagnosed. When I was taking it consistently, my prolactin levels decreased drastically and my headaches were not as bad.My tumor did decrease I have not been able to dropped the weight(just inches), although I've been working out, intensely, twice a day for about 6 months. I stopped taking the meds in Dec of 2010. My headaches have intensified. I began taking the the med again in March and my headaches still persist and are intense. I am also noticing a change in my vision. I had lasik about 2 years ago. I am not sure if it was the medication or not. I do notice the increased tiredness and mood changes.

Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3		45-54	7/29/2010 1:08:06 PM	Blood work showed elevated prolactin levels, and MRI confirmed a micro adenoma on the pituitary gland.  I took my first dose yesterday, .25 mg 2x a week - will be following up with an endo. doc.  I woke up with a runny nose, sore throat today but worse than that I am so tired, can barely keep my eyes open at work, I am so dizzy and light headed, foggy brain, making the job difficult, and when I walk I feel like a drunk weaving back and forth.  Do these symptoms pass as my body gets used to this medication?

My prolactin level was 77. After taking Cabergoline for about 2 months now, my prolactin level is back to 0 and my period is now regular.  I'm on a very low dose, 1/4 of a pill twice a week. I haven't really noticed any bad side effects.  Sometimes I'll have a transient wave of dizziness, but it passes after a few minutes.  I take it before going to bed, so I haven't noticed any nausea.  Worked great for me!
Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood		4	5	4			7/16/2010 2:11:36 PM	After a long journey in figuring out why my periods stopped, it was finally discovered that I had a mircroadenoma. I began taking Cabergoline in January 2010.  I've definitely experienced fatigue, dizziness...and more recently, what can only be compared to vertigo. Both times I was driving on the freeway, when I suddenly was overcome with a feeling of anxiety/tunnel vision. After looking at the Mayo Clinic's website, I saw that vertigo is a side effect. Anyone else experience this??

Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	Registered Nurse, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	7/9/2010 3:08:46 PM	I was diagnosed with my pit. tumor when I was 18. I was given Dostinex (Cabergoline)to take twice a week by mouth. I was also put on birth control to help regulate my periods. I never had surgery to have my pit. tumor removed. After taking the Cabergoline for about a year, I got tired of the way it made me feel; even though, it caused my prolactin levels to return to normal. So, I stopped taking it. My prolactin levels are checked about every 6 months and they are still normal even without medication. I had gained weight also before being diagnosed. After I lost some of that weight, I began to have regular periods on my own without the birth control. I then gainned some of the weight back and began having problems with my period again. So now I am back on the birth control, hopefully until I can lose weight. My gynecologist told me that when you are overweight it can also cause irregular periods. Anyway, I hope that eventually I can lose enough weight, have regular periods on my own, maintain my normal prolactin levels and have a baby! I am looking to get married soon and start my own family, but as for now I will continue to not use the Cabergoline.

It seems since I've been on this medicine, that I have had some  oral issues and I'm not sure if it is just coincidence.

Recently, my periods would not stop and I became anemic. My ob/gyn referred me to an endocrinologist. The endocrinologist sent me for a MRI of my brain and discovered a tumor on my pituatary gland less than 5mm. The endocrinologist prescribed 1/2 of pill of Cabergoline 2x weekly. I just took my 3rd dose. I take it with a glass of milk before bedtime. My period is now regulated. This time it came on for only 7 days and I have not experienced any  bad side effects.

My prolactin levels went down and I thought I was cured, but in 2009 my symptoms returned. I am now taking cabergoline 1/2 pill 2x a week. Side effects are tolerable.  My concern is becoming pregnant and if you are able to concieve, what are the risks of the medicaion to the fetus and are thre any long term affects to the baby after birth?

Went to endo and started on med, 1/2pill 2x wk, got my &quot;lady&quot; the very next day. Had some nausea, dizziness and headaches but no more bothersome than before my surgery. I got tired more often and had to stop my &quot;margarita/spa treatments&quot; due to not knowing how alcohol would affect me or the meds. I took the meds for about five months but unfortunately wasnt able to return to the dr to follow up, and ended up off meds for about four months. The symptoms returned and now I am back on the meds. Its been three wks now, and still no &quot;Aunt Flo&quot;, this time however, I don't mind that part. The only other issues are that I have gained weight and my mind seems foggy or not as sharp and forgetfull. I am trying really hard to excercise my mind and body and try to get back to the old me. Oh yeah, one BIG problem was the decreased sex drive..still working on that. My moods swing up and down but this time around I'm following up on my apppointments and hopefully, I will be back on my game soon.
Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/18/2010 6:20:21 PM	I'm a migraine sufferer and started having migraines more frequently (roughly 5 a week) I had had a migraine about everyday for 2 weeks went to the emergency room for relief.  I had never had a CT so the ER Dr ordered one, showed a mass on my pituitary, they then did an MRI which confirmed the CT scan I had a tumor about the size of a walnut, prolactin levels came back at 1446.  Started on Cabergoline .25 mg 2 times a week, within 8 weeks, my level was down to 103 and the tumor had shrunk nearly in 1/2.  Very pleased with this medication.  Scheduled for another MRI in July.  Very blessed because I was told if it went much longer I would have probably lost my eyesight because of the tumor.

My tumor was 12mm and my prolactin level was 450+. I've been on Cabergoline for the last two years and my levels are around 3 - 5 and my tumor has shrunk to 8mm. I've experienced nausea, weight gain, and tiredness but decreased my dosage to 1/2 a pill twice weekly (which I take at night) and take a multivitamin. It's helped with some of the symptoms. I'm now pregnant and off the med but under close doctor supervision. There is a chance the tumor will return now that I'm off the med and I will be unable to breastfeed as I will return to the med immediately after childbirth. But I'm grateful I now to even have the opportunity to live a somewhat normal life. Hang in there those of you who are just starting out.

I was diagnosed in 1996.  I started treatment with Parlodel (Bromcriptine) for almost 10 years.  I had an unusual side effect (stuffed nose) and switched to Cabergoline.  Seems to work fine as my Prolactin level is close to normal range (21).  I take 1.5 tabs twice weekly.  I've had several MRIs and the microadenoma doesn't seem to grow or to go away. Have not noticed significant side effects from the drug.

No period since. I didn't really care because it was nice not having a period, until my hubby and I wanted to try to have kids. Prolactin levels were very high (over 200) and I've been taking this medicine for about 6 months, now taking 2 pills a week. I saw the doctor after 3 months and prolactin level was just over 20, doctor wants it to be under 3. I go back this week to have it retaken. I can definitely notice that I am having some hormonal changes, I am getting some mild acne (which I have never had), gained 15 pounds in 2 months, and I feel unusually cranky. I can handle all these things if it results in me getting pregnant!!!

Before taking it my level was at 58 and when I saw my dr 2 weeks ago it was at 9. It does at times make me sick to my stomach so I take it right before I go to sleep. My only complaint is how expensive it is.

I also had a strong urge to go shopping for shoes! (Just kidding). She ordered an MRI of my pituitary which was negative for any tumor. She put me on Cabergoline and my prolactic level was soon less than 1 and my testosterone was well within the normal range. The lump in my nipple has also disappeared. I'm not sure if I will have to take this medication indefinitely or not. I haven't had any side effects. I always take it before bed. Good luck.

Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	Arnold James, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/29/2008 9:57:54 AM	My diagnosis is idiopathic hyperprolactinmea (sp?) Which means we don't know why (idiopathic) you have a high prolactin level (hyperprolactinmea). I had side effects from high prolactin level.  zero sex drive, tired all the time, moody, etc. Doc did hormone panel test. Prolactin cancels out testosterone. So, became sterile within a month of the side effects.  Doc sent me to endocrinologist for MRI. No tumor. Still taking this for just over 1 year. No longer sterile, in fact testost. went way up like an 18 year old for about 2 mths. then leveled off to normal. only a trace of prolactin now. Still no tumor on MRI. Could be from using Rrogaine according to my fiance and her research. Endocrinologist said that I could have a tumor just to small to see on MRI. It could stay that way forever or suddenly grow. My understanding though is that this medication reverses the effects of the high prolactin level but does not TREAT the tumor to shrink or stop growth, that is all up to the tumor. Many people have this &amp; don't know until autopsy after dying from something else. Live their whole life w/it just no serious effects so no tests. A good book to read is by Ken Baker. He had his removed, in his 20s and is married with two children. Others complain about being tired but I didn't notice but I'm a hyper person. I have had nothing but good from this medication.
Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	10/8/2008 11:47:41 AM	Didn't have a period for a year, had a 6 mm pituitary tumor, and my prolactin levels were elevated to around 100. Within 1 month after starting a very small dose of cabergoline, my prolactin levels went down to 12, and I started ovulating. The only side effect I can notice is feeling a little groggy the morning after taking the pill. It's been great!

Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/25/2008 9:26:53 PM	After over 2 years of infertility treatments, my new doctor did an MRI and found I had a pituitary tumor (microadenoma). Many people don't realize that increased prolactin levels can cause you not to ovulate, and therefore, you can't get pregnant. I was misdiagnosed as having polycystic ovarian syndrome for 8 years. I didn't have increased milk production, so this was never considered by my other doctors. I've been on the medicine for about 5 months now (1 pill twice a week). I just found out I'm 4 weeks pregnant! After 6 years of trying and even using Clomid (fertility meds), this medicine solved my problems in just a few months. :)As a side note, I never had any issues with dizziness or fatigue. I would always take my medicine after a meal or before I went to sleep.

The medicine has brought my level down from a 161 to a 12 in a  year's time.  Waiting for an MRI to see how the tumor looks.

Other	Renee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	1/30/2008 10:12:42 AM	I have been taking this for about 6 years now - I'm up to 1 pill 3x a week. I started producing breast milk for no reason (never been pregnant). Found out I have a pituitary brain tumor which is causing the high levels of prolactin. Started out at a much lower dose but the tumor has not stopped growing. The meds have stopped the milk production though. The meds made me sick to my stomach at first but after about a month, my body adjusted and now they usually don't bother me unless I haven't eaten.To the post from 1/23 - I would see an endrocrinologist specialist and be checked for a pituitary tumor (MRI).

This medicine is beginning to decrease my prolactin levels. I do feel tired when taking this medicine, but glad I am, as it is uncomfortable to have uwanted breast milk that is not needed. I find it unusual that I have high prolactin levels, I haven't had any children yet. My doctor doesn't know why either. Can anyone help me answer this? 
Increased Levels of Prolactin in the Blood	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	1/18/2008 2:06:00 PM	I started taking Cabergoline at the end of December and had dizziness and headaches.  I found that if I drank a full glass of milk with the medicine I was great the next day.  I go back to the DR in a week to see if the medicine lower my level or not.
