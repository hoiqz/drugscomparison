Rheumatoid Arthritis	bjjohnson,  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	2			8/24/2012 7:40:15 PM	I have been on Remicade for almost 5 years now. I get an IV once a month and it doesn't last 2 weeks now. I have been on a high dose of methotrexate and now my mouth is dry and very sore and my hair is falling out. My Dr has had to put me on Leucovorin Calcium(which is a type of folic acid) after my methotrexate injection, plus a prescription folic acid tablet every day. I have been reading the side effects of Remicade IV and I see now that they are showing up. Like: urinary tract infections after each IV, I get the chills all of the time, my throat and sinus are irritated all of the time, I am constantly tired,and a lot of joint pain. It looks like I am going to have to talk to my doctor. The only problem is Remicade is the only Iv that also controls my Pustlar Psorisis. Maybe something new is out there. Has anyone heard? I am sick and tired of being sick and tired!

Rheumatoid Arthritis	55-64 Male  (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	55-64	8/21/2012 3:50:44 PM	I am not sure about Remicade. I get relief for about 30 days then symptons are back. My doseage has just been increased. So I will see. Just had my second infusion of the higher dose. Infused every two months. Am sure that self injectibles didn't improve my symptons.

After my first treatment I could see improvements and I haven't lost any blood.  I did have a side effect of chest pain after the first infusion. But, now I don't have any side effects, just feel worn out and tired the day of my infusion and a few days afterwards.  But, this drug saved my life and I haven't felt this good in 3 years!  My uncle is also on it for Crohn's and he's been on it for 10 years and he said it is a life saver, he has never felt better!  It greatly improved my condition. I wonder how long I will need to be on it? I hope not forever.
Severe Ulcerative Colitis	budman, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/4/2012 2:53:51 PM	Very effective.  Life is somewhat back to normal.  Side effects are extreme sensitivity to the sun.  I get hive like rashes that last for approx. two weeks.  Itching...  SPF 50 to 100 eliminates this problem.  I also seem to have more minor joint stiffness.  It comes from prolonged sitting or inactivity.  Don't know whether it's related to the drug or age.  I also have noticible hair loss.  Again, don't know if its age related or drug.  I was always told that I would never go bald.  All in all, well worth it for the peace of mind I now have.

Went to a rheumatologist today for severe RA like symptoms. They are baffled as this is also used to treat RA. I am convinced this is caused by the Remicade. Never had anything like this in 50 years. Excruationg pain from neck to feet. No more infusions for me. Would rather have my colon out-hope damage is not permanent.

My last dose 5 days ago was double strength and I am still weakened. I have tried 2 doses in 1 week, still nothing but pain and sickness. My skin seems to be worse and arthritis is not better. One more shot in 2 weeks , if no change I am done with it.

Unfortunately I ended up being one of the &quot;few patients&quot; according to the labels for the meds who had a bad allergic reaction and therefore had to discontinue use.  *There was a downside to it that I believe someone else mentioned on here with having RA symptoms with no RA with Remicade and they started occurring 2 months before I had the allergic reaction.  I had pain in literally EVERY joint and it was horrible.  Other than the side effect and the allergic reaction though, the medication has been the only thing to work for me so far and I've been on roughly 8 different meds for the disease in the past 3 years.  I would recommend trying it if your doctor recommends it, but watch out for the joint pain.

Other than a pretty bad allegeric reaction each time, this med is great. My weight stays steady and i have had only minor flare ups that don't amount to before i started the drug. I have found cancer centers offer this drug cheaper than hospitals(codeing differently) and has saved me tens of thousands of dollars. Although my treatments take about 8 hours, its still better than the disease flare ups and problems. Remicade really works for me!!!!!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Kehoban, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	65-74	5/29/2012 11:10:39 PM	Having been on Enbrel sure-click injections for a year with good results, stopped only because of the cost I started with Remicade infusions at my Dr's. office.  I had 2 infusions without any symptoms of any kind but hadn't noticed any improvement in stiffness or painful joints.  Ready to have my 3rd injection I came down with hives and serious itching on my arms, legs and hands. The Dr. took me off this drug and I had to go back on Prednisone to clear up the itching and inflammation.  I am now on a new drug, Actemra and have had 1 infusion.  I have not had any side effects so far but it has not kicked in yet with releaving pain and stiffness.  I am also on decreasing doses of Prednisone, started at 25mg. After 2 days the Prednisone had started reducing the inflammation and pain which on a 1-10 level was about a 12!  After 7 days on Prednisone I was painfree and the pain level was about a 1-2!  I am now down to 20mg of Prednisone daily and continue to do well. I will be taking my 2nd injection of Actemra in 2 weeks but the Prednisone is what's keeping me feeling like a human being.  When I was on Enbrel injections they also had me taking Methotrexate which I finally refused to take any more because it left me so breathless I couldn't even go up and down stairs or walk to the mailbox without having to sit down and rest afterwards.  Once I quit the Methotrexate and was just on the Enbrel I felt like a new person.  AGAIN I only quit taking the Enbrel injections because of the cost. I had NO side effects with the drug, not even soreness at the site of my shots.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Sycamore, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	5/15/2012 10:50:57 PM	I started on Remicade 1 year ago and it saved my life.  I told my rheumatologist he saved my life.  Before Remicade I was on Humira and it did nothing for me.  My right elbow would not bend beyond a 90 degree angle.  Both of my knees, right and left shoulder, and left wrist were swollen and painful.  It was similar to being stretched out on a rack where they tighten the screws each day and slowly pull you apart.  At least that is what it felt like.  After just one treatment on Remicade I had almost full motion in my elbow and most of the pain was gone.  The pain has slowly crept back into my life, but nothing like it was before Remicade.  I do not know what I would have done or would do without it right now.  I am also investigating dietary changes, as I have heard this may help quite a bit.

It has been a wonder drug for us.

Very good results in reducing pain and flare-ups in my hands and fingers. It seems I have developed a little more coughing. Don't know if its a side effect. I'm taking methotrexate with the remicade.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	hopeful, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	65-74	5/6/2012 6:00:10 PM	I had double knee injections before receiving to help with fluid &amp; movement &amp; thought the relief I felt was due to the Remicade, but it turns out it was from the steroid used in the knee injections. The &quot;good&quot; feeling started to wear off in 3 days &amp; now I am having difficulty breathing &amp; feel like I have an elephant sitting on my chest with a sometimes rapid &amp; irrigular heartbeat.  I don't like the feeling of my chest hurting so bad.  This was what I was afraid of!

Get some night sweats around 8th week before next treatment, then feel great.  Very very tired at passed 55, and recently got energy back with B-12 6000mg sublingual, which aged, crohn's and IBD patients often find helpful.  Some issues with skin basal cells as grew up in the sun and had problems before remicade, which seems to have exacerbated face and neck basal cells growth.  Combination of recent b-12 use and last remicade treatment made for great feeling.

Am steroid dependent now, have been on them for 2 years and always flare when I try to get off. Have had 2 infusions &amp; the 2 biggest problems that I think are related to Remicade are forgetfullness and constant sweating. If it doesn't get any worse, I will be OK. Am trying to wean off steroids so we will see. Have had UC for about 15 years. Tired of living my life around it. If this doesn't work, I am ready to have my colon out and get on with my life! Quality of life-it's a good thing!Oh, I have also noticed my other meds (and pain meds) don't work like they used to - at all! am still on methotrexate too.

He now itches all the time, has a fungus throughout his body which breaks through his skin, has lost a great deal of weight and his legs and feet are swollen to the point that he can not wear shoes. The Drs. do not have a clue as to what is happening to him.  PLEASE DO NOT USE!!! The risks are not worth it!!

However I have been having uncontrolled hypertension since I have been on it and the doctor cannot seem to figure out if it is a side effect of remicade or a mixture of meds. If anyone else is having this problem please post.

Crohn's Disease	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	3/25/2012 10:08:29 PM	I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease 8 years ago, and for the first 6 I struggled with finding a balance of meds to maintain remission. I had symptoms many days out of the week, and nothing really made me feel good. Once my doctor put me on Remicade 2 years ago, I got my life back. For the first time since I was diagnosed, I can go through the day without worrying about whether there's a bathroom nearby, or whether pain is going to interfere with my life. Recently, the Remicade has been wearing off a after 6 weeks, and I've been having symptoms, so my dose has been increased. With the increased dose, I'm back to feeling like a normal person! This drug has saved my life!! 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	LadyDeathWolfe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	3/15/2012 2:31:24 PM	First treatment worked in two days. Significant swelling was gone as well as there being little to no pain most of the time. Second treatment with even better results.  Third treatment had to be postponed so it was longer in between doses and I got stiff and had pain again. Got better after I got it again.  On the flipside to this great drug, I was getting the 4th infusion and developed an allergic reaction.  Worked the best but can't be on it any more.

Within three months my skin was the clearest it hab been in 50 years with effusions @ 8 week intervals. After three years the interval had to be reduced to 6 weeks and dosage increased. It's been another year and the positive affect lasts only about three weeks. I will see a Rhumatologist in a couple days and plans are to increase dosage. I'm 77 and have had psoriasis since returning from Korea at age 18. My treatment has been at the VA at White River Jct., VT.

No more pain, and he has gained all his weight back and more. No side effects and he feels great. He'll be going to college next year but will be continuing the Remicade every 8 weeks.
Severe Ulcerative Colitis	Del, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	2/14/2012 12:40:51 PM	I am a 53 year-old female with Ulcerative Colitis for 28 years. Over the years I have tried every drug on the market none worked very well. I started with a severe episode in October during which I lost 15 pounds, no energy feeling miserable. I started on Remicade in January and have had 2 treatments so far. I felt so much better after the first treatment I could not believe it. Now after my second treatment I am still doing good but I have noticed a rash on my chest that I have not had in the past. I am wondering if this could be realted to the Remicade. I am contacting my GI doc. Good luck to everyone out there, this is a challenging disease!

I have chronic pain, but most days it is manageable! Life is good!  
Severe Ulcerative Colitis	Steve, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	12/22/2011 5:53:53 PM	I have had UC for about 10 years, and the usual meds had kept it under control until about 15 months ago. Nothing worked. My doc recommended Remicade and like others I had almost immediate and almost miraculous positive results.  I am not 100% symptom free, but 90-95% better after a total of 3 infusions.  I am very glad that I took this step. No side effects that I am aware of.  Try it if nothing else is working!!
Severe Ulcerative Colitis	armussel, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Male	55-64	12/17/2011 3:16:46 PM	I have had periodic (6) bouts of severe ulcerative colitis over the last 12 years. Severe inflammation 4 years ago resulted in the colon being completely closed off and a partial colorectomy. It took years to realize a causal connection to carrageenan, a red seaweed food additive, in the diet. While I've tried to avoid it, avoidance tends to fail while travelling, carrageenan is ubiquitous in the food system (many processed dairy products, soups, packaged candy,etc.) Search for carrageenan and colon cancer / UC. After travelling in Sept. another bout of UC, hospitalization twice and Remicade. Now a fourth infusion. Yes it works to quell UC.... But now have major spinal and joint pain, minor rashes and some unusual headaches. As a tennis player the joint pain is a stopper. Will it be a coin toss - colorectomy &amp; wear a poo bag or be an inactive near-cripple? Sound like a lose/lose choice ?! May be. FDA has carrageenan grandfathered and most folks have no idea what it is or the relationship. It is even being used in baby formula today! It is used to induce colon cancer in laboratory animals. Good luck to all.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	12/13/2011 9:42:25 AM	This has been very effective with my Erythema Nodosum. Although I have been a little concerned with some almost death issues that some friends that have had. I have had great results, but so did they, but these side effects came shortly after they begin to use the drug. I have been on it for about 3 yrs, and it keeps my noduals/pain under control. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	12/11/2011 7:27:37 AM	It is the best medication so far. My feet went numb &amp; tingling and hut so much that I could not even sleep with a sheet touching them. I had a nerve test (the test proved ther was no nerve damage. The Dr. is not sure if it is the medication or not, but I increased my B12 and now I can sleep at night with a blanket,and my feet are not numb.

I had sore joints and a little rash the first two months. Now I have no side effects at all. Overall,it works great and the possible side effects are nothing compared to being on prednisone for a long period of time. It's absolutly worth a try.

Glad to get off steroids!I wish it didn't take so long. I hate taking time off from work.Another bad thing is I worry about long term effects. I know have a rash on chest with red spots some filled with pus. I went to my GI last week. He didn't have an answer. I know have an appt. with my M.D. Has anyone had this happen? I've been on Remicade for 2 years. I have not done anything different.  Asacol 400mg 8 tablets daily. BP Meds. Daily Vitamin.

Been fighting that for almost 2 years now. If you have Psoriasis this is supposed be a wonder drug, if you dont have it you might get it.

He can barely climb the stairs.  He spent 5 hours in the ER to get tests run to rule out other possible causes.  So far, Remicade is the culprit.

My doctors have taken me off of the infusion til I clear up. Not sure if I want to go back on it. I've been recommended not to. The infections are painful, embarrassing and uncomfortable....

My Dr. knows what I have, my complete medical history, yet, I was told this will help your A.S. or  Crohn's disease,if you have it or IBS, no one is sure, so this will work if you have something, I have yellowing color in my face which I have not had before, I have small blister and itching, real sharp pains in my right eye, I am not sure if I should just stop taking any medicine or just take what ever comes my way.

I was switched to Embril. Another infection, seven day hospital stay to debreid my left foot. Six weeks later another hospital stay of nine day and aftercare for a month. The last time I lost my Big toe. I knew that all the new biologics warn about infection but I'll never take another. My results have been reported to the FDA.

It has worked very well for me although I have noticed feeling achy and tired afterward plus the &quot;blues&quot;. I am very concerned about the long term risks and have started seeing a nurse/nutrionist who put me on probiotics, liquid calcium (because of all the prednisone), Vit. D drops and digestive enzymes. We will work towards quitting the IVs with Dr consent, hopefully. She plans on doing a lot of other testing yet, I have just begun, but she has helped many people with colitis. Drs are great but finally after 11 yrs, I am ready to try something a little different.

This drug is wonderful and has given me back my life.  I was having a severe flare that hospitalization hadn't fixed and I had been on steroids so long I was a risk of becoming addicted.  I had been very hesitant to go on Remicade because of all of the potential side effects but I was so miserable I had to do something.  I have never regretted it.  I still have some fears about the side effects (which I have never had) and the fear of what I will do if it ever stops working but for now I am just happy to be in remission. I would definately recommend Remicade to anyone who has tried everything else.

I was covered with Psoriasis over 80% of entire body (literally scalp to toes) &amp; it spread into joints in form of PSArthritis-which pretty much crippled me &amp; Remicade is the only drug that has helped clear my skin (down to about 15% of body)&amp; allowed me to exercise my joints &amp; live somewhat normally in as little as 3 months. Only downfall, Plateau effect after couple years of monthly treatments; but, regardless, I definitely Recommend this drug...

Crohn's Disease	bertramlover, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/23/2011 10:46:32 PM	I have had Crohns Disease since 1971, yes 40 years. I had two resections, once in 1972 and once in 1985. In 72 they said have a nice life as medicine and knowledge was limited back then. In 1985 I had surgery and received medications azulphadine, prednisone when flare ups occurred.  Fast forward to 2009 with no health insurance and medical care for a number of years and after suffering for years, I became ill enough to almost die, and the doctor says a few more months of neglecting myself and that may have been the result. Well I started receiving Remicade treatments on and had no side effects. By the end of 2010, I felt the best I had since, well ever.  Of course then came the snag, the insurance company did not want to pay for the treatment. Thus the battle began and after five months of no treatments, the insurance company puts me on Humira, which I started receiving 6/2011. After two treatments, side effects and the feeling by myself and the doctor that the Humira is not working, we are making efforts to get back on Remicade. My doctor said it may be too late as Remicade may not now work because of the work of the antibodies from being off it for so long. I hope this is not the case as a long time sufferer of Crohns disease, I want to feel ther freedom this medicine had done for me last year.

I always have to take benadryl to keep the itching minimized.  The last infusion was rather bothersome and I was possibly already sick at the time, as I was hospitalized for 11 days due to pneumonia a couple of weeks after... My doctor is not sure if Remicade played a roll in it, but has decided not to put me back on it.  I will miss my 2 hour infusion visits with the nurse I have come to know... but wont miss any reactions...

Oral and genital ulcers started healing several days after the first infusion and all gone after second infusion.  Arthritis in hands, hips, knees, and ankles is still here, but not as bad.  Hope that the joint pain subsides after the 3rd infusion.  It's giving me my life back.

I am in more pain now than I was with Crohn's.  I will not take another Remicade treatment, regardless of what the doctors say. I also think the cost of the treatments are absurd.  It is more cost effective to have surgery than it is to take Remicade.
Severe Psoriasis that is Resistant to Treatment	britash12, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	5/17/2011 11:03:48 PM	I have been on remicade for 4 - 5 years now. At first it was wonderful. I was fighting psoriasis for 10 years before starting remicade. I did PUVA light therapy, tanning beds, laser light treatments every cream and ointment know to man and even embrel which worked for about a year then stopped working and methotrxate which my dr stopped because or long term harmful side effects. However the remicade still has me 99 % clear(just a little on my elbows) BUT My joint and muscle pain are getting worse. For a long time it was non-exisistent but now it is hard somedays to even get out of bed. I dont understand what is happening. My family dr does not like remicade because of the side effects and possible long term damage it can do but to me and my dermatologist it was a miracle up until this point Im torn on what to do at this point. Deal with the muscle and joint pain until I cant stand to move at all and be completely itchy, scaley and scabby free OR stop the medicine and wear long sleeves and a hat for the rest of my life because my skin wants to rot off my body ! has anyone else had this type of history with the med.  The pain started about 6 months ago ( 3 treatment ago ) Up until that piont it was great!

The best part is that the girgling is gone and I have 2 instead of 8 bm a day now.  I get a kind of restless leg syndrome in the middle of the infusion that lasts about 10 minutes.  I just usually get up and walk around and it seems to subside.  I have itched more lately on my arms, prb from Remicade.  My white blood cell counts have dropped to 2.0 when 3.5-10 is normal.  I'm a little concerned about it since I'm suppose to go tomorrow for another injection.  I will call the doctor before I go to be sure he wants me to go forward with the infusion.  I just had bloodwork done this morning that will hopefully give a better result to my white blood cell count.  The great news is that my red blood cell count went up from a 7.0 to a 10.5 on the first dose of Remicade.  I feel great now.  If you are hesitating to take this drug.... DON'T!!  It will change your daily life.

When it's effective for you, it works really great. Recently, I've been finding that the Remicade is wearing off about 5 weeks after my infusion. Spoke with my doctor and we reduced the interval between infusions to 7 weeks. However, it looks like the Remicade is starting to wear off sooner still. Due for my next infusion in 2 weeks, so we'll see how long I last after my next treatment. I'm also on Pentasa and 6mp.

Placed on 6mp, Pentasa and Prednisone. Had a colon resection November 2004. 6 months after surgery I was back to the way I was prior to surgery. 6mp and Pentasa did not keep me in remission. Placed on Remicade 12/2008. Remicade did wonders for my Crohns. So now I take Remicade q 7 weeks, 6mp and Pentasa. Well in the last year I have started suffering with headaches, joint pain, muscle pain and no energy. Meeting with my doctor Thursday to talk about coming off Remicade. The side effects have been sever. Prior to the side effects Remicade was a GOD send. 
Crohn's Disease Maintenance of Remission	slugger, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male		4/16/2011 5:46:16 PM	I did have severe Crohn's before Remicade. The Remicade treatments have worked well.  I get treatments only as needed, which is about twice a year.  I think Remicade is being overused at every 2 months.  You can develop a resistance or allergy.  The manufacturer is way over-recommending its use.  Try seeing how you do on as needed treatments.

Worked great but expensive so switched to Humira 1 month ago.  Having side effects I don't understand.  I miss Remicade!  I took it for granted!  Might go back on it...
Crohn's Disease	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	3/15/2011 6:18:24 PM	I started taking this treatment about two years ago. At first,I had no problems, other than severe fatigue. As time went on, I started having continuing yeast infections. I have seen several doctors and although I have some kind of infection from vaginal to my female outside areas, my belly, naval and bottom,  no one can figure out what it is, or what is causing it much less figure out how to treat it. Most agree that I should continue the treatments even though the directions clearing state continuing treatment while infected can be dangerous. I wonder if doctors get some kind of kickback for prescribing this medicine.

Crohn's Disease	Destiny, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	13-18	3/6/2011 7:59:19 AM	My 13 year old daughter has been on remicade since diagnosed 3 years ago. Altho she has to have it every 4 weeks, that concerns me. Im concerned for her mental health, as she has been dealing with severe depression. Drs say this is not related, but she's not the same kid. She also still has trouble with joint pain. Overall I am satisfied, but to the point of concern, as to what this med is doing to her body.
Crohn's Disease Maintenance of Remission	patter, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	3/2/2011 2:05:20 AM	I have been on Remicade for Crohns disease and arthritis for over two years. I was scared to be on an I.V. medication but with persuasion from my doctor, I decided to give it a try. I have been on Prednisone for 18 years to treat the symptoms of Crohns and arthritis and my doctor wanted me to get off of it completely. Since taking Remicade, like many others, my life is amazingly better. I can go to the health club and LIFT WEIGHTS !!! I have not been able to lift weights for 15 years due to arthritis. The tiredness many people complain of after the treatments are from the allergy medecine -Benadryl that they put in the I.V. to prevent an allergic reaction. As far as severe infections, I havent experienced any. I do try to avoid sick people and crowded areas congested with coughing people. I do my christmas shopping at night when its slow. If the cashier coughs, I tell her/him I'm on chemotherapy and usually they back up and are very respectful not to infect me. i've learned to cope, everybody has something to deal with.

Crohn's Disease Maintenance of Remission	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/1/2011 8:53:23 AM	During treatments my hand on my IV arm gets cold but think it's just from the meds because it's gone shortly after my treatment ends. Besides that, I have no side effects. Remicade is my miracle drug! It has made a HUGE difference in my remission process...
Crohn's Disease	RichReg05, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	35-44	3/1/2011 4:10:02 AM	I was prescribed Remicade after several other medications for Crohn's Disease failed to control my symptoms. Having been hospitalized numerous times, over the course of almost five years, for severe anemia, blood transfusions &amp; dehydration, I was hoping that Remicade would be the drug to help get me into remission. After four infusions, there is no change in my condition. I'm continuing to deal with extreme pain, constant diarrhea (usually bloody), nausea and incontenence. However, I did tollerate the infusions rather well. The only side effects I experienced were fatigue and hair loss. Remicade did not work for me, but I've talked to several other CD patients at the infusion center where I go, and they've told me that Remicade has turned their lives around. I wish it would have done for me what it did for them. My doctor says since there is no reason for me to be on Remicade, she has prescribed Tysabri. I begin that medication next week. Wish me luck!
Crohn's Disease	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	55-64	2/19/2011 4:57:12 PM	After successful use in 2002, had more treatment 2009-10.  Immediate avderse reaction requiring steroid and anti-histamine pre-treatment each session. Treatments stopped after #7.  New Crohn's activity then observed at previously clean site. Low energy and muscle loss in seven months since treatments ended.  Patients should take side effects warnings seriously.
Crohn's Disease	jrogers, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/8/2011 5:31:43 PM	I have been receiving Remicade due to Crohn's Disease for over 6 years now. It has really given me my life back. Nothing else I tried worked for me. Remicade has been a lifesaver. I sometimes get severe headaches the day of transfusion. I also recently developed hand excemza and I believe it is due to long term use of Remicade. While it is not very fun it is a small price to pay for a drug that allows me to live a normal life. I was also able to get pregnant and have a perfectly healthy baby while taking Remicade as well. I am able to live my life without even thinking about Crohn's Disease anymore. 
Severe Ulcerative Colitis	Linesider65, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	1/25/2011 3:51:40 PM	I am 45 and have had UC for around 20 years, it started getting much worse a couple years ago regardless of treatment (prednisone, lialda etc.) I have been on Remicade for almost a year and it seems to be working very well. At first I would have no symptoms at all between treatments which are every 8 weeks, however lately it doesnt seem to control as long and my symptom return a week or two before treatment...overall though life is much better and I recommend it if other options fail.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Pathfinder, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	45-54	1/14/2011 12:18:20 PM	Since going on Remicade the bottoms of my feet have gone numb (about 2 months).My doctor does not know if this could be caused by the drug and I am concerned, my next treatment I am going from a dose of 300 to 500 and this could make my foot problem worse. Has anyone else experienced something like this, if so does it go away?

Crohn's Disease	intelligentsista41, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	35-44	1/6/2011 5:13:47 AM	I was finally diagnosed with Crohn's in Nov. 2010 which was my second visit to ER that year.  None of the other drugs seemed to help so doc switched me to Remicade.  Just started infusions-Jan. 5th(reason for low effectiveness score).  I was a little tired after the treatment and had a slight headache.  I was wondering if anyone had experienced trouble sleeping after getting an infusion.  I took a nap when I got home at around 11am for about two hours.  It's now 5am and I can't get to sleep.
Crohn's Disease	melodymrh, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	1/5/2011 6:11:26 PM	I ended up in the hospital with swollen Lymph Nodes in the Lungs, this is called Sarcoidosis - can only be treated with Steroids.  I was in the hospital for 7 days.  Doctors feel the Remicade was the cause, Chest X ray in September 2010 clear.  On NOvember 3, taken by ambulance to Hospital, couldn't breath, X ray showed black spots, swollen Lymph nodes.  Looked like the x ray belong to someone else and not the same one from September.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	1/1/2011 1:19:04 PM	I have taken Remicade (lowest dose)for RA over 5 years, I have also taken Methotrexate 15mg per wk for 6 years.  I take 600mg Ibuprofen once or twice a day, depending on how I feel.I had one reaction to Remicade about 6 months ago, one large hive on my arm that itched,  otherwise I hardly noticed it.  I now take an anti histamine 5 days before my infusion, and 2 days afterward and have not had any problem since.  Remicade has done well for me, the attempt to control RA with just Methotrexate did not work, I could not walk.  Now, I returned a problem with my 8 week liver panel.  This could be caused by any of the 3 drugs I take, as I understand it, I will be tested again soon and will see what might have to change.

Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	Hypnotic1, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	45-54	12/27/2010 5:19:15 PM	I have taken every treatment known for Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis, some with good effect and some with none. I've done great with Remicade. Cleared my skin in about 2-4 weeks enough that I could go out in shorts without embarrassment, but best of all it gave me almost full mobility from my Arthritis which was disabling when I started Remicade. Effectiveness wore off after about 18 months, but a switch to every 4 weeks instead of every 8 weeks got me back to 95% clear and 95% mobility with only minor pain in my feet and hands. I'm seeing slightly less results with Remicade after almost 4 years on it, but it's still the best treatment for my PA and Psoriasis that I've ever been on with the fewest side effects.

I was fully observed by two nurses and a doctor during the episodes, which all occurred in a hospital. I kept on saying, but it worked, something finally worked, however, this drug surely is not for me.

I have tried various oral drugs over this time and experienced yearly or at times multiple flare ups per year. I decided to try Remicaid about a year ago. I have had great results and not experienced any flare ups. It is worth the minor inconvenience to receive a 2.5 hour infusion every 6-8 weeks.

I can not take MTX and I have a bllod disorder so I can not take anti inflammatories.  I have had both knees totally replaced and am on Remicade now.  Went from 8 weeks apart to 6 weeks and 7 viles.  I am functioning but still in pains.  Working is becoming harder sitting behind a desk 8 hrs a day.  Some days can't get around.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	LibraryGal, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	10/1/2010 8:52:35 PM	I was diagnosed with RA 3 years ago and started on MTX and remicade right away.  The remicade has been a miracle.  I take Tylenol with the remicade to reduce side effects.  Was off remicade last summer due to a MRSA infection and the RA pain and swelling came right back.  Only problem is the remicade is starting to be not as effective as it used to be.  Now I have it every 4 weeks and I'm at the max dose.  Dr says at some point I'll have to try a different biologic.

I tried everything from asacol to high doses of prednisone. I recieved my first dose of remicade and felt better within days. I have since recieved one more infusion and i can honestly say this is a miracle drug. It has worked wonders in only a few doses. I definatly recomend this for anyone that needs it.
Other	MrsPete, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	9/23/2010 1:07:54 PM	In my case (I have AS with recurrent Uveitis), this medicine had more negative side effects than benefits.  I had several infections including cellulitis and pneumonia and was on different antibiotics for a long time.  I am a mom and I work in a hospital, so I need my immune system, even if it doesn't work quite right.It did help my back pain and totally smacked down my recurrent uveitis, but to me it's just not worth it.  I was exhausted and just felt overall bad all the time, but especially the week after the infusion.  My sister has taken it for Crohn's for several years and it has been a complete lifesaver for her, and she's had no problems.  For me, not a good drug.(Side note: why is Ankylosing Spondylitis not an option??)
Crohn's Disease	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/12/2010 11:00:34 PM	After learning I was allergic to Imuran (developed pancreatitis), started Remicade infusion every 6 weeks in 2005. This drug has truly given me my life back - but man, am I glad I have good insurance because it is uber-expensive! It was funny to read someone else here say that they liked taking a day off every 6 weeks to do it - I don't know what everyone else's life is like but the &quot;reduce stress&quot; advice wasn't an option for me...and this gives me a chance to take a day to concentrate on me for a change.

Its not severe,used to be 7-10 trips to bathroom but now down to 4-7.I think that what has helped me is a good diet which no one has written about in their reviews.I was tested to see if i am gluten intolerant/Celiac and it came back negative but those tests are usually wrong like in my case.i am severally gluten sensitive and I started a gluten free diet (8weeks) which helped but now I am following a strict Specific Carbohydrate Diet.Its hard at first but rewarding.been on it for the past 4weeks with great results but flare up happened when i went off it traveling out of the country and ate gluten so i am combining remicade temporarily with this diet until i am in full remission.Good luck to all. Try the diet as it works very well and has been very effective to many with CD, Chrons, and UC.I will update after my infusion.

I was in a wheelchair before I saw an arthritis dr. I have been taking 10 mg.X day of prednisone. I am now taking 10 tablets/wk of methotrexate.  I had my first infusion of remicade and will get another next week.  Right away I was able to stop taking prednisone to mask my symptoms as my symptoms all but disappeared.  I'm still stiff after sitting awhile and my feet bother me a lot, but I have no pain in my wrists, fingers and knees. Remicade is working for me.  So far I have had no side effects.

In some places I have scratched so much I drew blood.  After first infusion I had headaches.  Humera didn't really work ... helped for about 3-4 months and methotrexate made my hair fall out.  Trying to find a drug that I don't have a severe reaction to.  Now, I'm still on prednisone, diflusinal,&amp; liflunimide.  Combined with my other pills that I take for my bi-polar and my vitamins I'm sooo pilled out.

I was left with a cough that has never gone away. Most time I just cough up some clear junk but every few weeks it been gross. I've had many treatments of antibiotics, it gets clear again for awhile but then the infection is back. A year or so back my doc changed me from Methotrexate to Lefluenomine and within a number of months I started get sick and my symptons starting returning. I stopped the Lefluenomine when my doc wouldn't let me have my Remicade infusion and have been miserable like I was be before the Remicade. Now he wants me to try Actemra but it will cost around $250 dollars a month because AVMED is making pay a 20% copay. But reading this web page now has me worried that what I thought was just a cough is serious infection. I have some big decision to make. For 2 years, Remicade gave me back my life.

Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	Kacky, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	7/22/2010 6:30:19 PM	I believe I have had psoriatic arthritis for 12 years but it became unbearable only a year ago. I had several misdiagnoses including gout, tendinitis, t.m. jaw, carpal tunnel, and localized swelling. By the time I got the diagnosis of P. A., I was in pretty rough shape. Morning stiffness was lasting all day. I walked like a penguin. My joints were all visibly swollen. I couldn't climb stairs or carry anything in my hands. It felt like I was walking on broken glass all the time. I couldn't get up out of a chair by myself. No change after 6 months of methotrexate. When Remicade was finally added, there was no change for 2 months, and alll of a sudden I realized I was jumping up out of my chair to answer the phone. The limping stopped. I could hold my own glass while getting a drink of water. Now after 4 months, I have some swelling in my hands and ankles, and the ankles are tender and weak. I did develop spurs on my shoulder. But I am walking and doing my exercises and I would say I am 90 percent cured. I'll take it! Now, we must band together and do something about the cost, so that everyone who needs this med can have it.
Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/13/2010 9:49:23 AM	Remicade is the only drug that helped my psoriasic arthritis and helped my skin clear up. I am extremely happy with the drug and wouldn't know what to do without it. Other drugs such as Enbrel &amp; Humira did not help me. My doctor and I experimented over the years until finally she put me in Remicade which is a life saver. Infusuions every eight weeks isn't bad.

Around the holidays I was busy and cancelled my treatment. I was feeling good so didn't go back for another one. Seven months later I had a terrible flare up an went to my GI. He told me it was to long and I could not go back on this med because I was have serious side effects. I'm waiting to go on Humira now and just pray it works as weel.

I have been using Remicade for over 8 yrs. This medication has given me my life back. My side effects have changed over the years- with fatigue being #1. Fatigue sets in immediately upon receiving IV, and dissipates by the 6th wk. I still continue to have minor symptoms of Lupus lasting for several weeks after infusion. My treatments are every 6-8 weeks. This drug weakens your immune system! I work in a hospital and must take extra precautions to not get sick. Any illness seems to last longer due to the weak immune system. The effects of the treatments are not as instantly felt as they once were. Relief arrives a few days after treatment for Rheumatoid. Crohns relief is (still!) almost immediate.I have not taken steroids in almost 7 years.I am not taking any maintenance meds.I last reviewed this medication in '08- and and still continue to be amazed at its effectiveness.
Crohn's Disease	ashley87, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/16/2010 3:52:08 PM	I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in October of 2009 and started Remicade infusions in February after other medicines didn't cut it.  I have only had one flare up since I began the treatments, and it was a very mild one.  I believe the benefits outweigh the risks with this medication.  
Crohn's Disease	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	6/14/2010 12:00:12 AM	When I was diagnosed with Crohns I was put straight on Remicade. Since then I haven't had a flare up. It worked wonders. However my joints hurt/get hurt alot more. Im a college athlete and have noticed huge problems in my joints healing from injuries. Starting to think Remicade isn't worth it anymore.
Crohn's Disease	Anonymous, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	6/7/2010 1:53:15 PM	I've had Crohon's since I was 11 (I'm 16 now) and had literally tried everything, but nothing worked. I was lucky if I could go 3 months without a flare. Then, about 2 years ago, I was started on Remicade and I was amazed with the results. I go every 5 weeks and have rarely had a flare since. Besides the fatigue and spotting around the time I'm due for another dose, I have no other symptoms. I don't have those painful stomach cramps that used to consume me. The treatment is a bit lengthy, but if you're a student like me, just bring schoolwork or a book to read.

My psoriasis cleared up for the first time since I was 16.....now, I'm in severe pain with the &quot;stocking effect&quot; neuropathy on my ankles and feet and my hands are numb.  I'm searching for answers to whether this is caused by Remicade.  I developed  ITP from using Embril.  The ITP (low blood platelets) is in remission after 2 years.

I stopped taking the Enbrel after 7 months as it was no longer relieving joint pains.  I have had two infusions so far, and do notice improvement in my most painful joint (shoulder).  My rheumy prescribed a dose pack of steroids, which I took after my 1st infusion. Receiving these drugs together, I was hoping for more improvement, but I will take what I can get.  My arm has markedly improved range of motion, although it is not back to normal. My legs are still stiff, and I still need to shuffle my feet when I walk.  I go back for my third infusion next month, and thereafter infusions will be every 6-8 weeks.  I sure am hopeful this treatment will improve my quality of life.

Been taking Asacol and Imuran.  Have not seen any benefit from Remicade even after doubling the dosage.    I also have RA, for which I take a weekly injection of Methotrexate.  Haven't seen much improvement with the RA either. Very discouraging ~ especially after reading how it has helped so many others.

I woke up one morning almost unable to walk due to severe pain in my ankles. Within a couple of weeks the pain had spread to nearly all of my joints. I could not even turn a doorknob with one hand...I had to use both hands.  Remicade has saved my life.  It has allowed me to again be active with my kids.  And thats what was one of my main concerns. I've experienced no side effects.  I get treatments every 8 weeks &amp; I still experience minimal joint stiffness from time to time between treatments.  If you have Arthritis, this drug can give you your life back.

It literally changed my life and I am so thankful for it! I have not had a flare up since starting the treatment, and I never had any side effects. It just makes me tired afterwards, so i suggest taking the day off of work when you do get the treatment.

I did read the reviews on that drug, and to compare, i've read the reviews on the Remicade. the Remicade sounds much better than the Cimszia. Has anybody herd of, or taken Cimszia? I think some of these drugs are worse than the disease itself. Please write if you can. I have not yet tried any of these.

Itdid not put the Crohns in remission, but it reduced the arthritis, fistuals and fissures.  But after 8 infusions, i developed a senstivity to it and now cannot be infused. I went on to try Humira for two infusion...no help at all. Now I am miserable.  I have navel fistuals and anal fissure which I am using steroid suppostories...yuck!

Started after struggling with steroid dependence and sever side effects from other drugs. Has been in total remission since after the first few treatments. However, I am increasingly concerned about how long the effectiveness will last and about the potential for serious long-term side effects. Best thing for now is that it has allowed my son to grow normally during these important preteen years.

The first one with no problem, however the second one he had difficulty breathing and they had to stop the iv. They give him benadryl and continued the treatment. The third one they gave him benadryl before it but, five minutes into the treatment his throat swelled almost shut and he experinced severe nausea and his face and neck was blood red and hot to the touch!!  They want him to try it again and he is fighting the drs on trying it again!! He said he would rather go blind than have to try it again.

For me, it is a quality of life issue.  Yes, there may be side effects which fortunately I have not had but I am willing to take the risks and be a contributing member of society than being someone with debilitating pain and depressed.

Infusions worked great for about 8 months, no severe pain as long as I didn't overdue. Had to stop the arava due to liver test. Then pain &amp; swelling started to come back one joint at a time each taking turns, medication was increased 100 each session for the next the next 3 infusions, the last two infusions only lasted about 30 days, then had some real serious pain till the next infusion.Doubled up on Prednisone.Now only 5 mg prednisone a day BUT Muscle pain, swelling, weakness and just plain tired. Not what I had hoped for

I thought this was the best drug ever invented, until i started having terrible joint pain, rashes all over my body, and to top it off the doctor still can't figure out what is wrong with me. He wants me to keep taking this drug. I think having my colon out would be better than all the side effects i'm going through. I've never felt so down before in my life. I wish i would have looked into this drug before taking it. If you are thinking of taking it DON'T. If you are on it now GET OFF. This drug does more harm than good.

I thought this was a wonderful thing at first. But after reading about all the side effects I'm very hesitant to keep up on the treatments. I ersonally have't had any side effects other than sore joints after the infusions, it lasts for about three days. Very painful. Not as bad as the 20-25 trips to the bathroom a day was but not very fun.I'm tryiny to get off it since my flare up has subsided quite well and as soon as I can do it I will stop the treatments.

I have very few side effects &amp; am off prednisone &amp; have lost over 30 lbs since stopping the steroids. I won't say that I don't worry about long term usage and side effects, but, for now I am living a full and active life without pain.

He was having several problems with flaring and after several doses of prednisone (I hate) he was then prescribed the Remicade.  His first transfusion gave immediate results.  He was no longer in pain and said, &quot;I feel like a million bucks!&quot;  I was nervous about the drug, especially since he was on 6-mp along with taking the Remicade.  But, he has been in remission since being on the drug with no side effects.  What a relief!

My Dr. explained I needed to take something that would stop the crippling effects of arthritis not only the pain.  So far very effective except for the week when I rec'd an antibotic for a cold.

I have received 2 doses of it so far. I have had some adverse side effects including joint pain, headaches and a rash that went away with a topical cream from the doctor.  These side effect, came and went only after 3 days. It was manageable compared to UC. I would recommend this to someone with UC.

I, personally would NEVER use it due to the fact that it can and will cause serious infection (or at least weaken the immune system enough).  In 2007, January, My mother was hospitalized, after having several major infections and the Dr not stopping the meds.  She was in septic shock and I had 4 people as well as her physician at 11pm ask me if I knew what her final wishes were.  Somehow she managed to pull through after several days in the ICU.  Needless to say, she no longer has that physician (not the one that called me)and I am a very greatful person to still have my mom.  PLEASE, if you begin to get even SMALL infections, PLEASE consider stopping the use of this medicine.  I dont want another family to go through what I did.  I know there is a great risk with the med and mom and I both spoke about them.  Yes, the results of the Remicade helped her but in the same breath, almost killed her.  Or at least the &quot;physician&quot; that was treating her that didnt stop it immediately.  Just BE CAREFUL.

At first everything was great, no issues. Minor side effects or reactions like frequent sore throats and joint aches for a couple days following infusion. This past year alone however I have had to have my tonsils removed, and my gallbladder taken out. I also was just diagnosed with CML. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. I am certain it was caused from the Remicade and am researching it now. Needless to say I was pulled off of it immediately. I now have to deal with my Colitis and Cancer.

I have a very normal life again. Receiving an infusion every other month is a small price to pay for my health.  The only issue that I have is that 3-4 weeks after an infusion, I start getting severe joint pain.  But my colitis is fine, so I will not complain.

Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	1/16/2010 10:27:58 PM	I've been  on Remicaid and Methotrexate for my Psoriatic Arthritis for almost 10 years now.  I've only had to increase my rate/dosage twice.  I've never experienced any kind of allergic reactions and never need premeds.  I get tired after infusions, but a nap solves that.  I am overall more susceptable to infections (UTIs, sinus infections, etc), so I have to be as careful as possible -- wash my hands all the time.  My joint swelling is very controlled, but I do start to feel it close to infusion time.  I know when I'm needing my bionic juice.  ;-)  Remicaid makes living with arthritis as painless as possible and helps me to function as much as possible.  It game me my life back.  I recall a time (at 30 years old) when I couldn't use the stairs.  Now, I can run, jump, squat, etc.  My hands show some disformity, as most arthritics' do, but all symptoms are under control.  I do worry about developing a tolerance...and then what do I do?  There are not a lot of other options.  I have also been lucky enough to have all of my infusions fully covered by insurance.  I think it helps to have doctors advocate for you.  Otherwise, the infusions are very costly.  Good luck to everyone out there!-Tracy (38), St. Louis, MO

My co-workers don't know I have RA unless I tell them.  I do experience a slight headache right after treatment - the only time I need tylenol.  I did get a non-melanoma skin cancer that I think was related, so now I get skin checked every year.  But I'd do it all over again in exchange for the mobility.  I've had to increase the dosage and change from every 8 weeks to every 7.  My biggest fear is that is stops being effective some day.  It's a miracle drug.

I had to have reconstruction of 1 foot and was diagnosed. The Remicade gave me instant relief and psoriasis I had for 16yrs cleared after only one month of treatment and have remained clear for 8 yrs. My joint damage at first stopped completely but due to a hurricane I missed 6months of treatment and did revert a little with the joints and My eyes began to be affected (blue sclera). After returning to regular remicade infusions, I am again feeling much better and my eyes have not gotten worse. I recomend this medication big time
Crohn's Disease	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	1/1/2010 6:21:23 PM	I was misdiagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis 12 years ago.  This year I was correctly diagnosed with Crohns.  I had my first Remicade IV treatment and 7 days later broke out with SEVERE HIVES.  I ended up in the ER and on steriods to control the hives.  No more Remicade for me that is for sure!

This is the only medication that has completely healed the uveitis in my eye. It has made my joints much less swollen, my stiffness is minimal and I can do more for a lot longer. I have had nausea and some headaches that were taken care of with Tylenol. Whoever came up with this drug is a genious. I forget I have arthritis (AS) and I have hope again.  Let's hope it lasts.

After the 4th one I started feeling better. Not needing Tylenol as often and less stiffness and swelling. Some all over itching, and especially on arms. Seems to be under skin on arms? Slight headache and extreme fatigue on night of treatmentPain, swelling, and stiffness was returning after only 4-5 weeks. This drug is well worth the side effects so far!

While Remicade hasn't helped my bowel condition a lot, it has been a miracle cure for alleviating all back pain I used to suffer.  Prior to treatment, my back pain was severe and affected my sleep.  Since going on treatment, I have never had any back pain whatsoever.  It really is a miracle drug for me and I highly recommend it.  I haven't had any negative reactions and the side effects are minimal for me - only a little fatigue.  The only downside to Remicade is its immunosuppresant nature.  You have to be careful with infections.  I work outdoors with the public all day long in the field of public safety and I've never had any complications or infections.

I have zero side affects and have now been on Remicade for almost a year. I'm very lucky that remicade is available for me.

I was against this at first because of the potential side effects. So far so good. The medication seems to keep the inflamation down more so than the methotrexate did, and we have been able to ween her off of the several eyedrops she had been on for the last 1 1/2yrs. which caused a cataract. I am not sure how long she will be on Remicade but as far as I can see she is showing no worrysome side effects. She is as rambunctious, happy and healthy as any other 4yr old I have seen. Hope this helps out any other parents who might have a concern starting this medication.  
Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	esteib, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	10/5/2009 4:04:29 PM	About two years ago, I went on Remicade and had absolutely no problem.  I loved it!  Unfortunately, about two weeks ago I got my first dose in about 1 1/2 years.  This is when it turned ugly.  I woke up about a week later with hives all over my body and was in the hospital a day later for the weekend.  I was diagnosed with Serum's Sickness.  My joints are beyond swollen right now and the simplest tasks, such as walking, are beyond inscrutiating.  I am a teacher and I have been put on bed rest for the next four days, which is not the best for my profession.  I am very disappointed with this drug and would rather have psoriasis than deal with this pain again.

It worked great - I was symptom-free until last summer when I suddenly developed a blistering rash all over my body.  It was pus-filled flat blisters that would burst and then form again.  I was also very fatigued to the point of faintness.  I was taken off Remicade and was treated with a skin cream by a dermatologist.  She said that it was a rare reaction to the Remicade.  Now I am back on 6MP - it works pretty well, but I miss the Remicade.  I still have scars where the rash was on my legs that may never go away.

This medication has literally released the chains that bound me. Once I was hospitalized because my Immune System was so low it couldn't fight off Pneumonia, that was my only downfall, because I was taken off of it for a year and boy did my body feel it. I am now up to 600mg every 6 weeks. I had to stop Methotrexate, because that was causingtoo many side effects and I couldn't handle it. The first Rheumayologist I had said that at age 35, he hadn't seen R.A. attack someone so young so hard, he didn't even know if the Remicade would even help me. After 3 months of treatments starting at 300mg, the MD was amazed at how quickly the inflammation started to regress. It's now a little over 7 yrs. and I honestly believe I am in remission. Aside from occasional flare-ups, I feel, not 100%, pretty darn close though. Thank God, the knowledge and skill God gave the Rheumatologists.

The side effects for her have been unable to loose weight, redness of skin and scares from cuts easily, she also has flu like symptoms after each teatment for a day or two but she says its worth it.  She has treatment every 8 weeks and it has given her a sence of normal in her life.

I am a mother of 3 and a wife. All I want is to be able to go places with my family and be around to see them grow up. As of today I am not feeling any relief and I really don't know what to expect. Is this medicine that bad or that good? Either way I am scared and I just want my life back!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	tish, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	9/1/2009 6:30:25 PM	I went to this site after researching drugs for osteoporosis.  The users of those drugs had awful tales to tell &amp; I was (am) fearful about starting any of them.  I decided to see what people had to say about Remicade, thinking perhaps many complained about this drug too but I'd never checked out reviews before I consented to start it.  Remicade definitely had more happy users!  I have had arthritis for 54 years &amp; been on many meds/treatments during that time.  I had immediate relief from Enbrel which I began around 2001, but when I retired could no longer afford it.  Switched to Remicade (covered through Medicare) &amp; receive 300 units every 6 weeks.  No side effects thus far - been on it since July 2007.  Wish I could be as optimistic about the osteoporosis choices

The back pain was gone by the third infusion, and hasn't come back.  I am working full time, raising my three kids, and having a &quot;normal&quot; life for the first time in years.  I did have to finallly get a port as my veins gave up after two and a half years.  Other than that, this has been a wonder drug for me, with no noticeable side effects. I've had no serious infections and my healing time is only somewhat delayed.  Definitely worth taking this drug.

This last outbreak has been going on for a year now, with nothing helping or slowing it down. I have had 4 treatments so far, they make me go crazy and I hate getting them, but my symptoms are getting better. I know have strep throat and going downhill quick.

Crohn's Disease	Heidi, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	8/28/2009 10:32:49 PM	I've been diagnosed with Crohn's Disease 4 years ago, and I have just finished my 3rd treatment of Remicade.  Seems to help.  I have not had any flare-ups since I started, and I can eat pretty much anything I want now without worrying how I'm going to feel later.  The only thing I've been experiencing lately is fatigue and muscle and joint weakness. Very fustrating, 'cause I'm only 24 and sometimes I feel like I'm 80!  I hate not having any energy!  I don't know if Remicade is the cause of this but after reading all the other reviews, I'm not so sure that Remicade isn't the problem.  Beware, weigh the pros and cons before starting the treatment.  It might make the Crohn's symptoms go away, but then you might end up getting other side affects (fatigue and tiredness,joint and muscle pain etc.) and that will open another can of worms.

I feel like my energy is back to almost normal and all of my joints have responded really well to treatment. One of my knees has not responded well to treatment and it was the joint mosdt affected by the disease. I guess it is the damage that I am left with due to being on less severe medications. I am all for this treatment except there is no information on long term use of the med. I am of child bearing age and am unsure as to how this will affect my ability to conceive and carry a child. I of course have to be off the medication for 3-6 months before I can even think about getting pregnant. Hopefully it all goes well!

And now, I have been diagnosed with AML, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, which my doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital have said they are certain was brought on and caused by the use of Remicade. Frankly, if I could turn back time, I'd rather have found another way to deal with my ulcerative colitis than to now have to be in a fight for my life with leukemia. I just finished one round of chemo, and face more, and have lost my hair, and have little energy and an uncertain future. What good is a medicine when the side effects are worse than the original disease? If this is recommended to you, say NO WAY!
Severe Ulcerative Colitis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/11/2009 4:36:04 PM	I was diagnosed with UC in Feb/2009 but was sick since Nov/08.  My GI tried every medication possible including steroids (plus a 2 week stay in the hospital) but we just could not get it under control. After the first infusion, the bleeding stopped.  I had a colonoscopy after the 2nd infusion &amp; the doctor says my UC is completely under control.  I am still having issues but we believe it is becuase of the prednisone.  I do feel &quot;strange&quot; after my infusion, mainly lathargic &amp; tired &amp; ususually a headache but I normally feel fine the next day or so after.  Overall I think it is a great drug from what I have experienced.

I'm still taking Methotrexate and Steroids. Some of the swelling has come down in my joints.  Can't wait for the full effect to work, so I can enjoy life to the fullest.

It absolutely, positively gave me my life back.  I have been on Remicade for 8 years now.  No one I know would ever suspect I have severe arthritis.  I run, ride a bike, swim, hike, anything and everything physical.  My life started at 50.  The nurse told me it could be up to 3 weeks before I felt improvement, but from my very first treatment I felt relief I had not felt in many, many years.  I thought maybe the instant relief was in my head but over the years I've heard others tell the same story.  I hope I never develop any side effects that would result in me having to stop treatments because I honestly don't know how I'd cope.  It's worth every second I spend in the infusion center letting that drip run.

During that year the drug seemed to work miracles; I was finally hungry, my diarrhea wasn't nearly as bad as normal. But then during one of my treatments I started to feel &quot;funny&quot;. Turns out I was having an allergic reaction which caused my throat to start swelling and making me unable to breathe. This happened during my next two treatments, needless to say I'm no longer getting the infusions. It's a difficult situation because this is a very effective drug, yet it causes so many problems in the patient. Do your homework before choosing to start this treatment.

Within the first few minutes I had an awful reaction &amp; passed out. In Aug.2001 I began having difficulty breathing &amp; excessive coughing. After many tests my Dr. now believes I contracted a fungal infection from the medication. I would like to caution others to do their research &amp; weight the pro's &amp; con's prior to having the treatment. There has recently been an FDA warning put on this drug.

I do have UC-related arthritis (non-Rheumatoid) that is helped somewhat by the Remicade infusions, although I find that Celebrex works to keep the remainder of the symptoms in check between infusions.  Other than the inconvenience of having to go to the hospital every 8 weeks, I have had virtually no problems with the infusions.  Mild chest tightness the first time which went away quickly.  Since then I have had low blood pressure sometimes and other times no symptoms at all.  I get up after my infusion and carry on with my day as usual (although I try to avoid strenuous activity for the remainder of the day).  Sometimes I feel a little fatigued for a couple of days but who knows if it's due to the infusion or just life in general!?!  Overall, I am happy with how Remicade has kept my symptoms in check.

Prednisone seems not to be effective this time.  He also takes Imuran, Azathioprene, Sulfazine, &amp; probiotics.  Dr. wants to start him on Remicade IV.  All of the comments on here have been helpful, but I have mixed feelings about starting him on this because of his age.  I'm scared &amp; wish I had this condition &amp; not him.

It's definitely a miracle drug as far as arthritis and gastrointestinal pains.

He had complained of side effects to treatment doctors and staff, but they assured him there wasn't a problem. He was in a lot of pain for several weeks before he died. So, my advice is to make sure to be tested often for these infections if you choose to try this treatment.

One week after my next to last infussion I got sick and Doctor pushed it off as the flue as my son at home was sick. One week after my last infussion I got deathly sick went to ER with very limited kidney function and severe joint pain. After stopping Remicade now for 3 months my kidney function is almost back to normal however my joint pain is still severe and blood test shows 3 markers for Lupis is positive. GI doctor says remicade cant be the problem but bone and joint Dr whom the GI dr sent me to says he cant prove it but he is almost positive Remicade is the problem. Make sure your liver is tested before Remicade and during the treatment unlike my dr did

I do go back this week for a treatment and I am hopeful it helps clear up the psoriasis as my skin was clear for the first time in 6 years.Can not say the arthritis is better as I have been o pain meds for my surgery. I will get back when I have a better understanding if this treatment works for me. Thanks for listening.

While on remicade I have been treated for an infection on my heart and also have had brain surgery to remove a growth.  The doctors think this is all from my Crohn's Disease.  Anyone else have anything like this happen?     Thanks, John

I went in the hospital 3 days earlier after being bed sick for 3 months. Once diagnossed they put me on Remicade, as I did not want steriods.  Remicade was a miracle immediately, the next day I could use my legs again, I walked.  I was eating 2 days latter.  I had a little bumb after leaving the hospital and was back in for another week as the Treatment did not last the 2 weeks it should have, had another treatment in the hospital again.  Since then I have been sticking with my 8 week treatments and feeling great, I am back to normal and feel no effects from the drug.  Remicade has given me my life back.

Crohn's Disease	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	5/3/2009 4:53:53 PM	I have been getting Remicade every 8 weeks for about 8yrs.  Started when I was in college.  It was great at controling the systoms of Crohn's.  I was able to have 2 very healthy babies, and could continue &quot;living&quot; my life the way I wanted to.  However, like many of you I have been dealing with continous infections, especially in the Sinus areas.  I have now been diagnosed with MRSA for the 2nd time in the last 2yrs. and have had 3-4 surgeries to &quot;get rid&quot; of the infections.  The last being a Mastoid bone (behind the ear) having to be drilled out.So, Remicade was great for treating Crohn's but the long term effects are life changing.

For at least 21 weeks, he has suffered a SEVERE side effect of the treatment. (Sebborheic Dermititis) Finally after months of going nuts trying to cure the problem and 4 doctors, we finally know his Severe Sebborheic Dermititis which worsens, is caused by the Remicade treatment. The treatment worked, but the severe side effects, my son is currently suffering from resulted in stopping the Remicade (last week) and waiting out the final treatment to start seeing improvements. The side effects caused his head to itch, bleed, severe dandruff, and form a scaly scalp and caused a hard white to yellow crust on roots and hair loss. He could wash hair at bedtime and wake with matted crusty ooze on the back of his head. Wearing anything other than white or grey showed the dandruff within seconds. He also had patches of dry skin near nose and eye developing.

But the side effects I got in returned was way worse then the intial disease itself. I've been on remi for 7 months, first month was fine after that I started getting horrible joint pains (sporadic)-fever-nausea-no energy-hair loss-and blood in my urine. I was told for 6 months that these were not signs or symptoms of remicade. I finally had blood work done - come to find out,I now been told I have RA and Lupus. Specialist told me that &quot;if they go away, then it was remicade. If they don't, then it's not. How convienent! Does Patient History have anything to do with a diagnosis? Just seems to me-if these were issues I naturally had I wouldn't of gone straight into debilitating.  There would of been a progressing pain. Like my husband said, remicade helps so many people-so what's wrong with sacrificing a few? (Maybe cause people work hard to get where they are in life, last thing they need is a &quot;miracle drug&quot; that trashes everything.

My symptoms were relieved within the first 3 months--although I still have flares-ups, they are managable. The first 4 years I had the infusions at the hospital, then my health coverage approved at home infusions--much better !! The drug has put me in &quot;clinical remission, being asymtopatic&quot; which means the disease is still progressing but I am symptom free, for the most part. Some dislikes: I too, got severe headaches for 2 or 3 days after infusion, now I am treated with Xanax the weekend of my treatment and I don't get the headaches.  I also get the chills &amp; heat flashes during the infusion but it is just the drug, it goes away. Also, I have gained 60 pounds since I started (I really don't like this) BUT the benefits outweigh my dislikes. I have my life back.

He was never denied SSDI because of the severity of his disease. He tried alternative treatments, such as pednisone, methotrexate, NSAIDS etc, just to name a few. Within the first few treatments of Remicade, my husband showed significant improvement. He has had well over 50 treatments, and is walking!! Personally, Remicade is a miracle drug! I am a Registered Nurse and have come across many people with arthritis in my time. But to this day, I swear by Remicade, and have even recommended it to my own family members and friends.

My psoriasis started at age 17 and became life changing by the age of 33. The before the first treatment, I could not sleep due to the psoriasis and psoriatic Arthritis. The affects of the medication for my skin and joints have been almost immediate after my first treatment. The joint pains was reduced so quickly for me, it allowed me to sleep well for the first-time in months

Enough pain that I couled not even pick up my 26 pound son.  After getting 50mg of benydryl before I get the treatment, I had no problmes since.  I would recommend this treatment, esp. if you have a pharmacy benefit per person per year.  You can still get your medications and be &quot;normal&quot; again.

I was a steroid failure and had 3 bowel resections, a perforation and peritonitis and nearly died. Then came Remicade. It is a miracle drug. I took it from the first day it was on the market and it has been about 10 years now. I went off the drug during pregnancy and after my daughter was born, resumed taking it but became severely allergic to it. For the 2 years following, I had to slow the infusion to run at 10cc per hour, approx 14 hours to infuse rather than the usual 2-3 hours. I now pre-medicate with Benadryl, Salumedrol/Saulucortex and  Tylenol and I am back to the usual 2-3 hours every 8-10 weeks. This drug gave me my life back.

Could do things I wasn't able to do for awhile like open bottles, crawl on my knees.  But due to scheduling missed a session and when I was able to be scheduled again, I had an immediate allergic reaction w hives.  Tried two more times with pre &amp; post antihistamines but still had minor reactions -- very disappointing.  It even cleared up a little psoriasis I had which was a grea surprise.  Now am trying Rituxan which is a 5 hour infusion -- requires a full day off work.  No real benefit compared to what I experience with Remicade.  I hope they develop new versions that allow me to go back and try again.

Given the remarkable improvement in my arthritis (I have regained fully the ability to make fists with both hands, one nodule is fading, marked lessening of stiffness, almost total absence of pain), I feel it's a miracle drug and worth every penny it costs my insurance company.

Crohn's Disease	 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	5	4	4	Male		3/3/2009 12:31:07 AM	My 39-year old male patient was started on Remicade IV last October 2008, being administered once every 2 months.  He has recently developed pain just below both groins, both knees and both ankles.  In none of these areas has there been any obvious swelling or skin changes.  Regional lymph nodes in the neck, axillae or groins are not palpably enlarged.  He currently has a desk job for a construction company and his work essentially is that of checking correctness of building plans.  The Crohn's disease was a recent occurrence and so far imaging examinations have not revealed any signs of fistula formation.  His weight has been maintained about 160 lbs (height 5' 8&quot;).He resides in a city whose population is more than 5x of our own place.  We have a limited family practice, with another physician on staff and have a strictly office-type of practice.  The doctors supervising his Remicade treatment are in the patient's own city, some 45 miles north of ours.  As such we have no direct contact with the specialists and have no official reports on the status of the Crohn's disease other than the fact that the patient commutes to his workplace, about 60 miles each way and he works full-time.

I hope this works for you as well as it has worked for me. God Bless.

I still worry in the long run if the drug will have any serious side effects when he becomes a man and has children. It looks like he will be on it for at least a year or two.

I tried the Remicade theapy on two separate occasions.  At the time, the Remicade was ineffective in stablilizing my flare-ups (with and without steriods and sulfates).  I was extremely disappointed and upset because this seemed like the last possible option short of surgery.  I also tried the encort, but suffered severe side effects and had to discontinue.  Since having bowel surgery, my Crohns has been manageable.  I have not taken any steroids in 6 years.  I was diagnosed wtih Crohn over26 years ago.

I am in comeplete remission. Noticed a huge change after first infusion. I have had some rashes,headaches and some joint pain but compared to 20+ bathroom trips a day...this is a walk in the park. Thank God for good doctors and health insurance.

I have tryed Orencia for 5 infusions and have since ended up in a wheel chair. Orencia had no effect on my RA.I have tryed every other drug available.

So far it has helped my flares and I feel better overall.  However, I do experience some weird symptoms like severe chills and extreme tiredness while taking my infusion.  I am hoping to be able to stop taking it since I think I am in remission

We were hopeful, but M.D. wants her off if for a couple of months.  The pain is so severe the only thing that has stopped the pain was a morphine injection in the ER.

We had been taking the generic Colozal for a year.  At first we took the non generic and after we started on generic my son said he didn't think it was working and I didn't believe he could tell.  We kept taking it though and I believe that is what put us in this situation. So be aware of the generic vs non generic.  He was hospitalized for 10 days for bowel rest and being an active teen 25 to 30 runs to the bathroom doesn't get it.  He lost 30 lbs and still after 2weeks being out of hostital we were still the same. Dr. started us on Emuran ( it takes 1 to 2 months to work)  so still 30 plus bathroom daily and trying to go to school and wear diapers and playing football.  No one understands and coaches don't either. People think you are all better cause you have been in the hospital. 1 week on Emuran and it sent us to ER.  We had Pancrititis so 3 more days in hospital.  The last day in and Dr. discussed Remicade with us, it is last option before removing colon.  We started treatment and all symptoms were gone.  We will get our 4th treatmeat in about 4 weeks and hope that we last for the 8 weeks.  It has been a wonderful drug for us even though it takes 3 to 4 hours to get it.  We are just having to learn to miss some school. The Dr. has now taken us off our daily med of Lilada and we are weaning down on the steriod and hope to see us just do the Remicade. I never new that a RX could cost 14 gran.  My eyes have been opened and I  am so thankful that this medication is available.

After the first treatment, the results started to show after just a few days.  Now two weeks later and just after receiving my second treatment, I am almost totally free of the plaques.

No symptoms for 9 months! I get Remicade every 8 weeks. It's a pain to go all the way to San Francisco, but it's worth the drive. That's where my doctor is. Not sure how long I'll have to have the treatments. Has anyone stopped taking it once they are in remission? Or do you take it forever to keep the flare-ups away? In response to other postings, I also have noticed that I feel &quot;blue.&quot; It's not explainable because I have a good life and my health is good. (now)I just don't feel happy and can't explain it. Glad to hear I'm not the only one.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Nicole, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	12/30/2008 10:09:53 AM	I have one aunt who take this for RA. She had 3 treatments, and she thought it was a miracle drug. But, she ended up with pneumonia. A few days in the hospital and she ended up on life support. They found yeast in her lungs, and believed it to be from the remicade treatments. She is still on life support. My other aunt is in the hospital for pneumonia from the remicade. So, it does weaken the immune system. Just be careful. If you feel like you are getting sick at all. Go straight to the hospital.

I am however looking into switching over to Humira because my once every eight week infusions take three days out of me energy wise and injections would save me that time. The treatment is however different for everyone, and whole heartedly I recommend it.

I had no side effects after the first treatment but had cripaling pain in my joints after the second and third treatments and ended up in the ER after the third with a temp of 103.8. Has anyone else had problems with severe joint pain? The pain is in my knees, ankles, wrists, hands, and elbows--so bad that I cant walk, pick up certain objects, or even unscrew the top off of my water bottle. This lasts for about a week after treatments.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	55-64	12/14/2008 4:08:11 AM	I had a reaction when the very first treatment.  I am given Benadryl and predisone before receiving the IV and I hadn't had any more problems,  I do have a rash on my legs which I feel may be from the resukt of the remicade.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Charlie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/12/2008 1:07:42 PM	before using remicade I had a hard time getting out of a chair and doing any of my daily things in and around the house.  After starting the remicade I can do things I haven't been able to do in years.  My family and friends noticed the change in me within the 8 weeks after starting the remicade infusions. And i started at a health club to strenghten my muscles and I believe that has helped me with my range of motion and the ability to move around with ease.

First treatment was wonderful, and I thought I had found a miracle drug. After 2nd treatment developed rash that could not be explained and GI/ remicade folks could not help.Four months later has been diagnosed as staff. I have had strep throat 2 x in a month and had awful yeast infections all over my body. after 3rd treatment my body stopped responding to the medication so I am back to square one, yet worst...my body will not respond to antibiotics and they wan to remove the colon. Please look into all othe4r options before starting this med!!!!

I saw it as last resort and did not want to face the reality of my situation with crohn's. I have been on remicade for 10 months. My best description, it has been a miracle for me. I was rarely able to leave home, could not eat fruit, vegetables and many items in any form. I could not work. I was in pain daily and lived in the bathroom. When I could sleep I lay in a fetal postion as I tried to get past the discomfort that was overpowering my body. Today I can keep up with a freelance writer's career and go to watch my friend's children for a few hours after school. I am able to eat an entire apple again. I have delighted in eating pomegranate fruit lately. A year ago I stood in front of my refrigerator and nearly broke down because I could not eat a wedge of apple without becoming painfully sick. Can you imagine, crying over a apple? I know the risks and I am fully aware of the condition I was in. Remicade was the correct decision for me. I'm so very thankful that it is available. I have quality of life for awhile longer.

I get very pukey sick for the day of and day after treatment, but it's worth it considering how bad I was before.  The largest side effect was that made me healthy again and my bad eatting habits that I developed while sick caused me to gain 100 lbs after starting the treatment.

Prednizone made me gain weight, Arava gave me diarrhea.  Remicade has been awesome.  Occasional bronchitis during winter seasons, but no other issues.  I am on the lowest dose every 8 weeks.  My biggest complaint is having to sit in the Dr. office for the 2 hours, but that's better than not being able to get off the bed.  I have tried all kinds of fasting, diet manipulation...nothing else worked.  Guess I will be on this drug for life.

I would rather have a little itch now and then than to not be able to walk or use my hands.  I had taken the remicade every 6 weeks with methylprednisolone for the entire time, but the remicade has started to wear off a week earlier. So now I was increased another vial of remicade and put on a drug called Azulifidine which I take one pill a day and that seems to be working. It has only been 30 days on the new drug, but we will see how its going in another month.  I tried methotrexate, but that was awful after 1 week I started losing clobs of hair, so that was a no go for me!  I also have IBS, so some of these drugs are pretty bad for me, this one I am on now is like the 4th one to try!  Good luck, you will find something eventually.  But the Remicade is a god send, I just hope it doesn't make me ammune to it!

After a six month UC flare-up it was the only thing that worked for me. I had been on asacol, 6mp and steroids for 5 months with no relief. This had been my worst flare up in 6 years with diarhhea 20+ times daily, a 25 pound weight loss and the inability to leave my house at all. The very next day after sarting Remicade, my diarhhea stopped! And a few days after that the bleeding stopped. I started eating and all of my symptoms went away in a matter of weeks. That was six months ago. I get a treatment every 8 weeks and will do so forever if I have to. I have my life back! I can take care of my children and do everything I couldn't six months ago. I don't understand why every GI doctor isn't telling their patients with severe cases of Uc about this drug. I feel great and I'm living again!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/7/2008 10:31:46 PM	I took my 5th infusion of Remicade today. I do get premedicated with 50mg Benadryl iv and 125mg Solumedrol iv, I also get my Methotrexate dose iv on infusion day. I did develop severe hives/rash/itching during first infusion (hence the premedications). It works well for me, it doesn't quite last the 8 weeks between treatments. I usually see it wearing off at about 6 weeks but not yet ready to increase frequency. I had already tried Humira even at weekly injections but it eventually stopped working, I hope that doesn't happen with the Remicade. I do have a headache and difficulty sleeping the night of the infusion but I really believe this is a side effect of the iv Solumedrol and not the Remicade. I say this because when I used to get FREQUENT joint injections I had the same reaction. I have not had to have even one joint injection on the Remicade and was still needing them on weekly Humira. I still manage to work Mon, Wed, and Fri as a nurse and I do not believe I could without the remicade infusions. So far it has been a blessing for me Best of luck to you all.

At 71 I've been through many major illnesses (cancer of breast and thyroid, myasthenia gravis and too many others to write) and am on oxygen and use a nebulizer several times a day. Nothing (including childbirth) caused me as much pain as the RA did. My first treatment was last month and within 3 days I was pain free.  Pain started to come back after about 3 1/2 weeks, worsening each day.  I'm in SO much pain again, with the usual horrors of RA affecting my quality of life. Will have another does of Remicade in 1 1/2 weeks (6 weeks after the first one) and am hoping it works as well but longer than the first one.

Honestly it seems worse since starting the IV's. So now i will have another round of invasive testing to see if the Crohns' is starting remission or still very active. The Drug leaves me feeling very groogy and dazed for 1-2 days after treatment. The iv meds leave my arm sore and bruised for 2-4 days. I have met people who say Remicaide has changed their lives not me.

Started for joint pain related to Crohn's disease.  It worked wonders for me at first.  Infusions were wearing off after about 6 weeks, so my doctor changed the time from 8 weeks to 6.  It helped a little.  After my last infusion, I had an allergic reaction (lots of itching, constricted throat, and minor trouble breathing).  Having symptoms of Crohn's again and such severe joint pain that I need Percocet several nights a week.  My energy level in in the toilet.  This is frustrating because this drug used to work so well for me.  Now I'd do anything to get it out of my system as fast as possible.

Wish the infusion didnt take so long, tho, it is very tiring to sit for three hours. They need to work on that.

Severe Ulcerative Colitis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	9/4/2008 12:26:34 PM	Have had UC for 22 years...with last flare up was hospitalized and started Remicade infusions.  Have had 2 with great response to treatment however, I have experienced intense headaches, joint aches and get tired easily. I've also noticed my mood in general is sort of sad or &quot;the blues&quot; which is totally out of my character as I'm normally very happy and up-beat.  Has anyone noticed &quot;feeling down&quot; with this med? I'm concerned as I go for third treatment soon.

I was up all night going to the tiloet &amp; became very anemic from the blood loss.  I had my first treatment a week ago and already there has been a noticable improvement.  I didn't love the idea of taking it---but am very happy I did!  Hurray for remicade!

I now have numbness/tingling in my hands and feet, joint pain in my wrists, headachs, and occasional sever fatigue. I see the Doc in a few days. Hope I can continue taking it as it has done wonders controlling the chrones.

We have had several treatments of Remicade and are fortunate that it has worked.  There has been some inconsistency with the amount of time that the dosage lasts but we are in the 5-week range at this point.  We have had some 3 weeks and some last 7 weeks.  We have not been able to stretch them to 8 although we are hopeful that we will as we continue.  He is 11 now and is not hindered in his activities.  When the Remicade runs it course, the downturn is sudden so we have to monitor him closely and shorten the time between injections as needed.  I would absolutely recommend it before considering a J-pouch, especially for a child of this age.

I had  period of flares that brought on a new condition called Reactive Arthritis and nothing was working.  The Remicade has helped my regain my life, but I worry about some of the side effects and my future ability have children.  I've also noticed depression seems to be one of the side effects and I have tried to stop the antidepressant, but things just go back down hill again.  I wonder if I will have to take all the drugs for the rest of my life.  Anyone have any similar experiences?
Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	LuLu, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	7/29/2008 10:42:42 PM	I have not started treatment yet, but I had to answer the questions to get my concerns posted.  SORRY!  I cheated. I have read the reviews on the Web MD site associated with psoriatic arthritis and to be honest it is a little frightening.  I am scheduled to begin treatment on remicade Aug. 6th.  The 6 reviews I read commented that they were in more pain and the psoriasis was much worse after treatment.  I am really scared.  Can anyone out there offer any advice?? One person mentioned that Doctor's recommend this treatment because they make a lot of money from this this type of treatment.  Is this really true??  I do not want to take something that is not necessary, but I also do not want holes in my bones resulting from the psoriatic arthritis.  I do not know what to do.  Please respond.

The side effects that I have had are severe headaches, nausea, dirreaha but has aggravated the Reynaud's and increased sweating. I have seen a marked improvement in my RA as I am able to have more activity and I have more function in my hands.

Then the pain came back full force esp. my right hip and all the way down my leg matter what med's or patches I use I cannot be pain free. I am considering not continuing my treatment.And it is very expensive $18,000 so far.
Severe Psoriasis that is Resistant to Treatment	Jim H, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	7/11/2008 4:07:52 PM	I have nail psoriasis and very little if any skin psoriasis.  I have had 5 infusions so far.  There has been significant improvement in my nails, however, my fingernails are doing much better than my toenails and my thumbnails, which seem to take longer to respond to the Remicade.  The Remicade definitely makes me more susceptible to infections.  Before beginning the Remicade treatments, I was rarely sick.  In the six months or so that I have taken the Remicade, I have had three infections.  Two of the infections were urinary track infections, which I have never had in my life before now and I have no idea how I got them.  Also, even when taking powerful antibiotics such as Levaquin 750 mg, it seems like it takes longer to get over the infections that it did before I started the Remicade.

At the start of my fifth year, I had a severe allergic reaction to the infusion and had to discontinue.  I switched to Orencia for 8 months with terrible results.I've now switched to Humira with high hopes.

Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	monkeymama, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	6/28/2008 2:57:44 PM	I went to the Dr. because I had arthritis from Psoriasis. He insisted I try Remicade. I was waiting tables and carrying heavy objects on a daily basis. I didn't notice very much effectiveness in my RA, but the Psoriasis started to clear up and then disappeared, so I was happy. After taking this drug for 6 mos., it wore off abetween treatments and I had a severe flare-up with incredible pain. Since then, the treatment wears off in exactly 4 wks., leaving me MUCH worse than I ever was before I started taking it. I can't grasp objects, lift a cup or walk on some days. The pain is so bad I asked the Dr. for Vicodin. I can hardly function at work or otherwise. I am in a flare-up now and am thinking of riding it out and just being on Prednisone for a while. I can't stand being so dependent on a drug that is this incredibly expensive, and then doesn't work anyway. I feel very sorry for people who don't have insurance.I also feel my Dr. has been ignoring my complaints because he makes so much money off of this course of treatment. He keeps telling me to try it one more time.. I am also thinking of switching doctors.This may work for those w/very severe symptoms, but you should think twice if your pain is not that bad (like mine was) and/or you only have moderate Psoriasis. The flare-ups are too painful, and as for me, I don't know if I can get back to where I was before the treatment.

I haven't spoken to my MD yet-but the pain is still as bad if not worse. I find taking Darvocet works best for me.I want to get better today!I just have to be patient (no pun intended) I do feel myself getting very tired in the afternoon and having to nap-I have no ambition and feeling more depressed.Don't know if this is from the remicade or not..

Had no reactions after the first treatment, rash on my arms after the 2nd and 3rd, and now after my fourth treatment I am having numbess in my legs. (localized to my left thigh and right knee) and the pain has come back almost at full force. Going to see the doctor wednesday, to see where it goes. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	5/4/2008 4:42:35 PM	This treatment had the opposite effect and seemed to cause a &quot;speed up&quot; in the disease.A waste of my financial resourses.I was hoping for a different result.Because of a reaction in the middle of my last infusion(5th),the DR. decided this treatment had to be terminated.

Crohn's Disease	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	5/2/2008 1:49:46 AM	I was on Remicade for at least three years.   I did go into remission with my Crohn's for about one year.  I continued the infusions every 8 weeks (instead of 6) as a maintainance therapy.  I was given 2 Tylenol by mouth, Benadryl, Phenergan, and Solymedarol(sp?) (steriod) as pre-meds through my IV prior to receiving Remicade.  The pre-meds were very helpful to aleviate the itching, nausia and headaches I would get from Remicade.  I also found it very helpful when the nurses would slow down the rate of speed the infusion was being administered.  Due to changes in health insurance coverage I have decided to give Humira a try for financial reasons.  I had my first four pen injections today.  I found it to be very painful.  I will follow some of the tips I have read on WebMD in 2 weeks when I have to have 2 more.  I had a friend who is a nuse give them to me.  Because the shots burn so bad I am not sure if I will ever be able to inject myself.  She suggest I try to see if I can get a RX for a vial to inject with a syringe instead of using the pen.  I may be going back to Remicade if Humira doesn't work out.  Good luck to you in your treatment!

Once, around my back and under my arm second, in my head.  Mydoctor seems to think the remicade has something to do with this.  However, I have been on Remicade for going on ten years now so I am unsure with my doctor's opinion but I am considering changes to my medications and not take the remicade.

I've had a couple of times that I had a long break between IVs (I get it every six weeks) and cannot believe how quickly I go downhill.I did have to delay some surgery until almost time to get the Remicade due to its affct on my immune system.  The surgeon wanted by system to be strong as possible prior to surgery.  Then the rheumatoligist made me wait until fully healed before restarting.I tried not taking Benadryl prior to the IV but started itching. So now I just take 2 Benadryl prior to the IV.I generally get a movie and sleep while it is playing on my laptop.

I had good results within a few weeks of the first treatment, and have not had a relapse since then.  This stuff is a miracle for me. Sitting in a chair for 2 to 3 hours every other month isn't too bad - I bring some reading or work.

Now however my last 2 treatments have not gone well. After 15 minutes into the threatment I experienced difficulyt breathing, increased blood pressure(180/120)tightness in chest and sharp pain in chest through to my back and shoulder. I fear I will have to stop taking remicade and will end up back were I was walking with a cain and use of my wheel chair again. The cardio Drs say that my heart is fine and this is all a reaction to the remicade.

His levels have not changed and now we found out it is the kind of drug you have to be weaned off and it might be the cause of our child o/t and p/t issues,due to the fact of a small chance for neaurgolic damage, that we were not told about until today, after 3 years and I do not see that posted in the warning signs.

Remicade worked wonders for the crohn's, but it caused drug induced &quot;lupus&quot; on the rest of my body. And I truly  thought that I was dying because the pain was so bad.  I am now on &quot;humira&quot; and so far it is working.

The medicine worked great for me until I had to stop for a few months due to a change in insurance. The treatment is very expensive at about $5000.00 every six weeks. When I restarted treatment 8 days later I ended up in the hospital for three days with severe muscle pain and fever.  I could not move to scratch my face and could barely open my mouth. Scary experience. looking to make a switch to Humira after that experience.

The evening after my second infusion, I had a fever and the chills and nausea.  My joints feel a little better, but these side effects are very difficult.  My doctor wants me to try it 1 more time to see what happens.  I hope it works, and I can continue with it, as I am running out of options.

Several days in the hospital confirmed that my heart is fine, however I have severe fibrosis on both lungs. I went from an active 66 year old man to one requiring oxygen 24 hrs a day...overnight.  Dr. is planning to continue with remicade and will re-introduce the methotrexate which they stopped I first became sick.  What caused the accute fibrosis...the Rheumatoid arthritis, the methotrexate or the remicade... We'll never know, will we?
Crohn's Disease	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	5	Male	19-24	1/4/2008 4:09:46 PM	Before being on Remicade i took steriods which totally messed my whole body up, like most of CD and UC patients. Still under those i was cramping and using the restroom alot. After the first treatments i felt tremendously better. The only downside is the three hour sit a the Dr. every 8 weeks. Thats not too bad since i was used to being at the Dr. Office. I was diagnosed in 2003 with UC, 6 months later i had a colectomy followed by a reversal of my ileostomy. After all my surgeries were over i thought i was ok but started cramping and bleeding again. I now have Crohns but Remicade has been amazing and i am now enrolled in school taking 21 hours and working as a construction manager 3 days a week. Remicade works.

I am not a fan of IV drugs due to the fact that my veins are shot from steroids, so now I have a port-a-cath, but it's still worth it! I truly believe I have my life back thanks to Remicade!! Don't put it off if you are thinking about trying it.

Crohn's Disease with Fistulas Developing in Intestines	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female		11/25/2007 7:20:35 PM	I went on Remicade after a developed a peri-anal fistula (yeah, scary) that would not close up with any other drug. Remicade completely healed my fistula within a week!! My Crohn's caused me to have severe cramping and constant diarrhea. My cramping is gone, but I still have diarrhea 2-8 times a week. But I don't think that's bad for moderate Crohn's disease. The only issue I have with the Remicade is that it makes me exhausted the day of treatment. Also, I have to be on the leukemia drug 6-MP and that knocks my immune system down. I get sick easily. Overall, Remicade is a miracle drug.
