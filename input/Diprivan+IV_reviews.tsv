General Anesthesia	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	1/19/2010 2:45:28 PM	Used as general anesthesia for routine colonoscopy.  Unlike other drugs (Verset) this one did not cause me nausea.  The effects wore off more quickly than Verset--a much more comfortable experience.  However, I experienced considerable pain upon injection (about 20 seconds), even with Lidocaine (typically recommended, as this side effect is well-known).

For those unaware.. this is the EXACT drug that killed Michael Jackson. All research I have done on this medication is NOT good. Numerous &quot;bad&quot; reviews and older patients end up with more serious effects or even death!!

Upon opening the sternum there was bleeding and a large clot in the anterior wall of the RV, additional sutures stopped the bleeding. I was in a coma (Diprivan) and on a respirater for 13 days. (In the hospital for 20 days with 1 week at a rehabilitation facility. When I became mostly myself again it was though I had no muscles in my body. Also, I couldn't feel my hands, fingers, legs or feet, which made walking and holding anything very difficult. I still am having some confusion and memory problems either due to blood loss or the Diprivan, which no-one will tell me. I had the surgery January 9, 2008. I am sure my problems are caused by prolonged usage. I personally will never go through this surgery again. I have written this information in the hopes that it helps other people, Doctors and the drug company.
