Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	colleenh76, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	3/29/2011 7:30:31 PM	I was prescribed this and clarithromycin (Biaxin) for a sinus infection.  The first few days I felt great.  Had tons of energy and felt very clear headed and was able to think so much better.  I did experience dry mouth which is to be expected.  Also learned to take many hours before bed due to insomnia.  Unfortunately on day 6 of both meds I started experiencing sever lack of energy and crazy dreams.  My energy level was so low I would seep all night and take a nap and still feel like I couldn't get out of bed. I was unable to work on day 7 &amp; 8 so much that after a few hours at work had to go home.  Returned to the doc on day 8 due to the lack of energy and was told to stop taking the clarithromycin and the fexofendaine D.  I'm not sure which med made me so tired but I dont think I will be taking either again even though my sinus infection is better.

It works well, on a scale of 1 to 10 I would say about an 8 for helping me with the problems mentioned. The only question I have does it cause constipation?

Other	Allergy sufferer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	8/16/2010 8:00:27 AM	My doctor switched me from Allegra-D to this generic substitute April 2010. I suffer from allergies 365 days a year. Since the switch I have had no relief from allergies.  The sneezing, water eyes, coughing etc. get worse as the day progresses. My nasal passeges are sore from blowing my nose so much and the headaches are horrible.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	Carole, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	45-54	12/6/2009 1:44:01 PM	After taking Allegra D for the past several years, I find this to be a poor substitute.  I'm allergic 12 months of the year and went from feeling great to feeling &quot;doped up&quot; and not alert.  As the day progresses so does the sneezing and having to blow my nose.  I would rather get a second job in order to pay for the real thing -  Allegra D, instead of the generic substitute of Fexofenadine PSE.
