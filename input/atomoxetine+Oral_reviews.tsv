Plus I became addicted to Vyvanse and had to be put in the hospital for detox.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	11/14/2011 5:52:16 AM	I only gave effectiveness 2 stars b/c although it worked in calming our son down, it calmed him down so much that he was like a little zombie walking around. He showed absolutely no emotion or interest in anything. He did nothing but lay on the couch for hours, unmoving and silent. He eventually started to complain of serious stomach pain. It was his first day on this new medication as we were trying a different alternative to Concerta. We immediately stopped this medication and he is now back to his usual happy and fun loving self. His ADHD is a struggle but we would gladly work with his ADHD rather than the empty little boy we had for that day. I would not recommend this at all.

Although it did make me a slight bit hyper, I can focus more. The come down of this pill is horrible though. I had a headache for about 20mins and had to take ibuprophen. Its only my first day but this med is comparable to adderall and vyvanse and gives me the same effect. We'll see how everything goes for now. I am on 25 mg for 3 days then increase to 25 mg 2 times a day for a total of 50 mg daily. Crossing my fingers.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	3	Female	19-24	5/3/2011 6:40:20 PM	this medication is supposed to work within 3 months, until then i was told i had to stick out depression, exhaustion, suicidal thoughts and laziness. i was promised control, focus, no more anxiety and the release of dopamine and serotonin. i did miss days in between each refill of 100 mg because my doctor disappears but it has been 3 months and still exhausted depressed and unmotivated. i threw away 3 months and a semester. laid in bed sulking, i would hate to just give that up without this drug giving me a miracle. i hope it shows up soon.

Then my peditrician put me on Metadate 10mg. That wasn't working so she put me on the 20mg but that made me depressed in the afternoons so i was taken off meds completely. This year, as I entered my senior year of high school and after having a difficult junior year, i wanted to go back on medications. So i was given the Strattera starter kit and it's worked well so far. And i am concentrating a lot better in school.

I also had very severe mood swings in just that one week and sort of changed the relationships with my friends in a negative way....

Results were extremely positive. I found that my mind ceased to wander, tasks at work were much easier to complete and my mind was no longer all over the place. I did have to up my dosage to 80 mg to keep the medication from wearing off. Strattera does suppress my appetite, makes me a bit drowsy, but overall I'm very pleased.

This is the first medication we have tried after the diet, exercise, ect. have failed. The doctor started her at 18mg and I was amazed by the second day. I had a new child. But the fourth day she went up to 40mg and things did a 180. Stomach pains, nausea, her temper, everything sky rocketed. So overall not satisfied.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	TD, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	19-24	4/5/2010 12:59:27 PM	I am 21 years old and was diagnosed with add about one month ago. I have areal hard time staying focused, geting things done, and concentrating. I am also restless all of the time, and have been my whole life. My docter perscribed me 80mg of strattera. It made me feel sick, tired, and extremely drugged. I thought that the side effects would go away after about 3 weeks, insted I only seemed to feel tired all the time, and seemed to feel bad about myself, and sad. I have never felt like that before and stopped taking the medicine. My doc said he wanted me to try this because I made it through life this far without stimulants. I am very dissatisfied with this drug and would never recomend it to anyone. I have another appointment coming up next week, and look forward to trying something else. I wonder if anyone else has had these problems please reply

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	searching, 25-34 Male  (Patient) 	2	5	3	Male	25-34	11/23/2009 6:44:19 PM	I am a 25 year old grad student who was just diagnosed with ADD mostly inattentive along side a read/writing disorder. I have been taking sterrtra for about 2 and a half months. Add sympotomsI find sterrta does nothing for my add. but it was amazing for a co-insideing anxiety problem I was having. I feel better and am happier more of the time. I walk taller and keep my head up, and dont get soical anxiety to the same degree as i used to. This was a dramatic change and i noticed it within the first few weeks. sterrtra was originally tested to be an antidepresent, so suprise. side effectsfirst few days felt funny. my doctor started at 10 mg and slowly bounced it up to 40. at each increase i would feel wosey for a few days - nothing major, if you take the med with food it helps.my suggetions if you have anxiety and other sleep stuff that the stimulants might make worse, stertta might be a good place to start. my doctor and i are still looking for something to to deal with the add part. you might want to start on a saturday morning so you have a few days before school or work.

It has helped my mood more than it has helped my ADD-ness.  I'm at 100mg daily.  I take it in the morning with breakfast.  It helped me lose over 40 pounds (I needed to lose 60!) and I have kept the weight off.  The weight-loss also improved my mood and self-esteem and energy levels.  I recommend starting this drug on a weekend, or whenever you have &quot;spare&quot; time to feel dizzy and nauseous, which is how I felt for the first couple of weeks (but the first and second day were especially rough).  At this point, after 2 years, I feel no nausea and no dizziness and really can't &quot;feel&quot; that I'm on any medication, except that I am no longer sad all the time.  I'm very upbeat and able to cope with everything better, emotionally anyway...not coping well with clutter control or with time management issues still, which is where the frustrated husband part comes into play.  I can tell my ADD is still there big time...I'm bouncing my leg up and down as I type this, chewing gum, looking around...procrastinating doing my work...but hey, I'm in a GREAT mood!  I love Straterra.  It's the best thing that's ever happened to me and I only wish I'd had access to it thirty years ago.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	3	Male	19-24	9/27/2009 6:52:33 AM	The good news is: unlike some of the stories I hear from my peers (I am a 20-something male with longstanding ADHD and I've long taken stimulants in addition to Strattera), I DO NOT get side effects.  No weird sexual issues or drowsiness, etc.  I take 120 mg which is like the maximal dose, and I will say this much: it will be much easier to &quot;stomach&quot; when Lilly finally is off patent and Strattera is generically available.  I think the noradranergic chemical nature of the medicine helps my anxiety/depressive symptoms more noticeably than the ADHD fare, but the benefit is quite mild.  Quite expensive, but more efficacy than Wellbutrin or an SSRI or any other ADHD &quot;stimulant-alternative.&quot;  2.9 out of 5 stars.

I started taking this medication 2.5 months ago.  I started with 40mg and worked my way up to 100mg.  Starting in the morning, with no food, at 40mg, was like a bomb going off in my stomach.  The heartburn did not go away until around 1-2pm.  I started to take it after food, which help at the lower doses, but when I got to 100mg the heartburn was constant.  My concentration levels were better, and my personality was slightly there.  Creating or understanding humor was difficult.  Sex drive was fair. Sleep was short.  I got off the medication, due to the side effects.  The heartburn did not go away, even when I used 24hr heartburn medicine.  Going to try something different.

He has been taking 60mg daily for 1 1/2 years with great results. At first we had problems with iritability and weightloss, both have which resolved. The only problem we have now is that he gets tired of taking it everyday, so now we are working on behavior modification to hopefully wean him off the strattera in the next 2 years prior to him starting junior high.

She has only been on for about 6 weeks but it has helped her remember what she has read.  She has trouble going to sleep and is sleepy in the morning.  She has also lost her appetite and lost weight but she was overweight.  The weight loss has actually brought up her self esteem which is an added benefit.  We may need to get the dose lowered to help with her sleeplessness and tiredness. 
Other	7-12 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	5	2	Female	7-12	5/17/2009 2:25:18 AM	My 10 yr old grandson was given this med for 6 mos for ADD. Did help him in school but only at 60 mg and only when taken in the AM which ended up making him sick and vomit at school - also panicky. He had more self esteem in school but was not himself at all. Tired, unemotional but with outbursts of anger &amp; tears and feeling like everyone was ganging up on him over small things. He also developed a strange jaw movement and picked at his forarms till they had sores for a while. Blood pressure and heartrate elevated some. He had to go on asthma meds (had a predisposition to asthma) during this period so I wonder - asthma seems to be better now! He had episodes of really scary breathing during his sleep. Had a bit of trouble for two days going off the med but is now my sweet, loving boy once more - running and playing again which he was NOT doing anymore on Strattera! Find another way people, if at all possible!

I was about to stop, then the third day it was a miracle.  I had no idea I could ever think so clearly and all my anxiety, which I didn't even realize was such an issue with me, disappeared.I pray that the effects remain this good, as I've read many negative reports, as well as many good ones too.It's changed my life.

It took over a month to see any results. However, I did receive a message one time from his teacher asking what had changed with my son, that he had been more focused than she had ever seen him.

He constantly complained that his eyes would do crazy things when he shut them and that made it hard for him to get decent sleep. We immediatley took him off the medication and the dizziness stopped.

It really changed me. I found it a lot harder to be cool and calm in the social atmosphere. It was really hard to focus quickly, I felt dopey and slow around people. So I decided to switch me to a much lower dose of 10 mg. - Personality is back, and I feel a lot wittier then I used to be. Its easy to focus, and I get all A's and B's in school.

It is working well for her. She is able to focus on tasks w/out getting bored or discouraged within a short period of time. Her sleep was interrupted at first, but we now give 2 doses/day. One at 7am and one at 7pm and she is doing fine. Thank you for giving us another option and keeping her personality intact!

We both read it to understand what he would be experiencing.  It didn't work for him but it has been wonderful for me at 35.  I can focus and complete tasks without being distracted by something else.  I did have tiredness, and some tingling/numbness at times during the first 2 weeks.  I have now been on it for 6 weeks and can't imagine not taking it.  I definitely notice if I take it late.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	4			2/4/2008 8:11:25 PM	My daughter is 8 and has been diagnosed with ADHD.  So far so good with the 25mg, it does make her very tired, so she must take it in the evening, which is a good thing because it helps her wind down.  She is als on on 7.5mg of Adderall to help with the focus in school.  I think the combination of the two seems to be working well for her.

He was bieggining to be pegged as a &quot;problem child&quot; in school, always in trouble for things I knew, as his mother, he couldn't control. After disscussion with his Dr., we put him on a nightly dose of 25mg. This showed immediate results.  After 2 weeks of meds I noticed a relaps in his behavior, but not as bad as before the meds. We then began to give him an additional 10mg in the a.m. before school. Realizing thais drug was intended for a 24 hr dose, we gave this a try with good results. I think a split in dosage should be recommended for children that cannot make it through the day. The 25mg dose did make him tired, that is why it is given at night. I wanted him to remain functionable during the day. The 10mg given during the day give him just enough to calm him to the point of being able to work with him without him being disruptive.  By evening (around 6pm) I can see a behavior change, I can tell he is tired, but yet his energy and overstimulated mind starts to fight. By 7pm I give the 25mg and we are able to shut down and ease into bed by 8pm with minimal difficulties.  He still has his moments at school, but I feel no child is capable of perfection, and &quot;moments&quot; are to be expected. Especially from a child with ADHD. Thank you to the makers of this product. You have made my childs life alot more closer to the normal life of a child and have saved his self esteem.My 13yr yr old son also takes this med for what seemed to be lack of motivetion. He is on a lower split dose of 10mg morning and night. He hase gone from failing grades up to avererage and above grades. His abilitiy to comprehend what he is reading and to stay focused has improved signifigantly. Even his teachers see the change. I only hope we didn't catch him too late with a diagnoses. He is less argumentitive at home, more cooperative with chores, and seems to be a bit more org
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	robinm, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	1/10/2008 7:10:12 PM	I was on Strattera for 3 weeks. The first week I took 40mg then increased the dosage to 80mg. After week one I developed numbness in my lips and fingers and toes.  My physician said the side effects would probably go away and to keep taking the medication. By the end of the third week the side effects had become much more severe. My heart was racing and my resting pulse rate was 110. Oddly, my blood pressure was within normal range, however it is normally very low.  I developed urinary incontinence.  I could not even feel it when I realized I was wet! How embarrassing and scary. At this point I was numb all over and felt very very weird and dizzy.  That was when I came off of the drug and it has been about 6 weeks and I am just now getting the feeling back.  The incontinence stopped shortly after stopping treatment. My lips are still a little bit numb but seem to be getting better!

Other	Alarock , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	11/9/2007 10:22:37 AM	I am 26 years old and was diagnosed with ADD when I was 12. I chose not to take medication for it at that time. Recently I became curious; wondering if I had tried medication that maybe it would have significantly helped my concentration and attention. At my last Doctors visit I was prescribed strattera in hopes that it would work for me. I lasted about 1 week, choosing to discontinue the medication due to the fact that it made me feel agitated. It also made me feel less creative. It did however, seem to help me with retaining my concentration while moving from one task to another and helped me from &quot;zoning out&quot; so much. The bottom line is that the negatives outweighed the positives. Each individual is different and in my case this just wasn't right for me.

He was tried on almost all stimulates and was so far behind last year because we keep changing his meds because they did not work he was always in a depressed state.  So they stopped ADHD meds altogether and started on Risperdal for mood disorder and then started him on this med and he is doing so much better in school and in the home environment.
