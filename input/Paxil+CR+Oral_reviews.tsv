But i ran out for two days and on the third I had a seizure.  A 4 minute one.  Never had any before ever but im also taking Chantix to quit smoking and that is one of thier side effects.  
Panic Disorder	molly, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	5	4	Female	45-54	6/2/2012 10:58:17 AM	I have not had any problems with Paxil CR.  Finally no off the wall anxiety or panic attacks.  I did however need to take regular Paxil for a while and that was not as good.  Major weight gain from that and I really did not like it.  The CR makes all the difference and they offer generic now.  My only complaint is loss of interest in sex.

It either will or it won't and there's no way to know before actually trying it. However, I hope what you take from this review is evidence that it can work and if you haven't had success with other things, you should try it with consultation with a doctor.I have moderate depression and anxiety. I took Paxil for four months and it was the first time in fourteen years that I actually felt good. I was happy. I weaned myself off of it after four months because at the time I didn't want to take it if I didn't know it was necessary. I didn't experience any of the horrific withdrawal symptoms that are possible. For four months I felt happy even without the drug and then the anxiety crept back in and then the depression sympotoms returned as well. I'm now back on it and although I've only been on it for a short while, I am already feeling better than without it. The only thing that lowered my satisfaction was that I have nausea and slight jitteriness in the beginning, but that goes away within a week so it's not that big of a deal. 
Panic Disorder	destin2beme, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/26/2012 7:27:53 AM	I stated the reason for taking paxil is panic disorder, which is true for the reason I am taking it now.  But I was first put on it 14 years ago after I had my twins via c-section. I developed post-pardon depression. I had been trying to have a baby for so long, and to have two healthy babies followed by such depression was so disheartening for me.  I agreed to the Paxil  only because I was told it would not make me drowsy. I had known of other medications that take up to two weeks to &quot;get in your system&quot; well and stop the sedated feeling. As a new mother, I was unwilling to take a chance that I would be too sleepy to take care of my twins.  Paxil worked excellent for me.  Within a few weeks I was back to my happy self.  I took Paxil for a few months then stopped without having to ween off.  Six years later I asked my OB to give it back to me as soon as I gave birth to my third child and once again three years later after giving birth to my fourth baby.  I never experienced depression like I did with my twins. For the most part I have been emotionally healthy my whole life. Last October events in my life piled up and I started having anxiety attacks. I started Paxil once again, I would say it took about 8 weeks before I was completely free of anxiety attacks.  With my PPD I only stayed on Paxil for a few months and was able to stop with no problems and no side effects while taking it. At the moment I have no side effects, I am free of anxiety and depression. Over the years I had become moody with anger outburst, and they have become few as well.  Paxil has worked wonders for me.  I am very sensitive to sedation- children's liquid allergy medication can put me to sleep fast, So I am grateful Paxil did not cause me to feel sleepy all the time like some other depression medications. I saw where someone said they do not sleep well at night, and neither do I, but that has been a life long issue for me.  I will stay on paxil for awhile.  It has helped me.

At first it worked great. Now I always feel tired. I'm never hungry, therefore I have lost weight. My vision has gotten worse and I bruise very easily. I recently decided to stop taking it. Now I am having severe withdrawls! The withdrawls almost make me want to start the rx again, unfortunately.

I was on 25mg paxil CR for almost 10 years.  It saved my life.  A few months ago it stopped working (as effectively)  I was having break threw anxiety attacts.  I went to a walk in clinic (GP) and he put me on Cipralex 10mg, then 15mg, then 20mg.  I was sicker than a dog!! Every side effect there was I had.  I tried to stick it out for 3 weeks on the 20mg but I was a ready for the hug me coat.  I have now gone back to 12.5mg paxil CR and I am hoping it kicks in quick.  I am sure I will have to go back up to 25mg and then maybe even higher.  I don't mind the weight gain if it gives me my life back.  GAD's effects everyone in my family which is not right! I so wish I didn't have to be on drugs but this seems to be a hereditary problem my emmediate family. (father, brother, aunts and cousins)  Right now I am living off clonozapam (1mg twice a day) to help me get rid of the anxiety while I am leveling out on the paxil again.  Fingers are crossed that it won't take to long and I don't get addicted to the clonazapam.  Since I was normal at one time, i am dreaming for that day to come again.

Crying at the drop of a hat and being just plain &quot;crazy&quot; sometimes, after starting this medication I feel &quot;normal&quot;.  It has helped so tremdously!!  I have a few side effects, but the alternative is not who I want to ever be again.  I was never one for meds, but suffering 30 yrs with depression and anxiety I feel so at peace with my decision.

This combination has worked better than anything else. I have been battling with being bipolar since I was a child due to family trauma, but I never was diagnosed until my late 30's. It seems like it isn't working well anymore and I have gained 35 lbs. I think I will talk with my dr. and see if there may be some other type of meds that I can take instead, because the extra weight is causing me to have health problems.

I had the worse withdrawl it was horrible I thought I was going to die, I couldnt talk all I could do was shake and chatter my teeth, I ended up going to the E.R and all they wanted to do was accuse me of being a junkie of paxil, saying &quot;were not giving you more&quot; I kept trying to tell them I had a whole bottle at home that I took myself off and I was having withdrawls but they didnt belive me, they treated me so horrible. I will never return to the E.R. or tell anyone to try paxil. It was the most horrible thing in my life getting off of it.I was very dizzy, puking alot,I couldnt keep my balance I feel off my deck and hit my face.I couldnt MOVE seriously! It should be taken off the market as far as Im concerned.

Paxil made it simply disappear within 2 weeks. I was amazed and it changed my life for the better.2 years later I decided I was ready to go off. There were 2 side effects I did not like: 1) weight gain. I am a very athletic person and despite 4-5 5 mile runs a week and careful eating I had packed on 10 pounds and 2) the general &quot;mellow&quot; feeling. I had enough of that.Warning: this is a very hard drug to get off! The withdrawal effects are very strong. I was only on 10mg and it was 4-5 days of hell! head zaps constantly, dry mouth and nausea. Now I am fine and the depression has not returned: I run as soon as I feel it coming on and cut out the wine that I LOVED on Paxil.In a nutshell this is a very effective antidepressant but it is addictive (no matter what your Dr says) AND you will gain weight.

I got off of it because I slept a whole month away. Withdrawl symptoms include dizziness, a zapping of the brain/ears, heart palpitations, hallucinations, the feeling of being cold, shaking, the feeling that skin burns, shortness of breath, INSANE dreams, and dreamy, strange feelings, blurred vision, muscle aches, joint aches, headaches, Insomnia, general unwell feeling, diarreha, facial pimples, extreme dry mouth, night sweats...it is awful. I got off Paxil CR two weeks ago, and I am still withdrawing. Help, doctors! How long will this last. The only thing different in my case and others is that I did not gain weight. Now that I am off, I want to eat, eat, eat...another symptom of this hell called withdrawl.

I started it knowing it was a temporary situation and it helped me immensely. I didn't have the trouble sleeping that some did while on Paxil. It helped me to be on a more even keel while I figured out what the problem was. I stepped myself down with the help of my pharmacist and Dr and stopped it altogether.  Now I am having trouble sleeping and my thoughts are back to being chaotic.  Don't want to go back on the Paxil but I may have no choice.

Panic Disorder	Alex Winchester , 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Male	19-24	6/7/2011 10:08:28 PM	I took 20mg daily for four years. It provided an almost immediate calming effect that tamped down any anxiety spike I felt; the depression also soon subsided. However, I did gain about 25lbs and constantly had the munchies. In my experience it was too effective; eventually my body was &quot;fighting&quot; the doped up feeling and I felt lazy and passive, &quot;Getting off&quot; was also EXTREMELY difficult, and the depression soon returned. But remember, everyone reacts to different medications in different ways.

It has taken my anxiety down so much that I am able to do things and not be so terrified.  The main problem that I have with it is that I have gained about 20 or more pounds since I have been taking it.  I have always been small to average size and now I weigh 145 and feel very over weight and miserable.  I am going to change to Wellbutrin or some other type of Anxiety med that does not have the weight gain issues.  I have read good things about Wellbutrin so I will try it. Hope poeple reading this can figure out what is best for them!

I have found it to be the only drug that can help me with my anxiety and panic attacks. I feel very good while on it, no real side effects after the forst few weeks other than the weight gain, which is the ONLY reason I ever tried to go off of it. The withdrawl can be difficult if not done very slowly. I have finally achieved a sympton free withdrawl from this drug with patience and careful diet and sleep. I have tried everything to lose weight on Paxil, but it just doesn't work. I have gained over 20 lbs. So, if the benefits are better than a few pounds, stick with it. I tried other drugs and had such severe side effects and feelings like I was loosing my mind that it makes me realize I would rather feel happy with a little extra weight than miserable and skinny.

I was on it for about 6 yrs. and found I was unable to get off it.  The claims were they were not habit forming, I can assure everyone - It is almost impossible to get off them.  I have never been so sick - I was actually in a fetal position for days - I thought I would die, not to mention the electric shocks through my head !  I am finally off Paxil, but had to go to other drugs.  After 12 years now, I am STILL on antidepressants.  There is just NO WAY to get off them once you start taking them.  Paxil is the worst !  Weight gain, sexual side effects, sleep problems.

Biggest and worse side effect. I gained alot of weight. The first 6 months, I could not get the food in my mouth fast enough and everything was delictable. After 6 months, it leveled off, but still at alot. Weaned myself off during a few months and the weight dropped off accordingly. I stopped crying while on it, laughed more.  But, would avoid if needed again because of the weigh gain.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Lindsey, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	2/7/2011 8:18:58 PM	I have been taking Paxil for almost a year and have mixed feelings about it. Though I have noticed that it helps with my anxiety and depression, it hasn't been a dramatic help, and I have felt extremely tired, hungry, and just plain unmotivated. Also, I have gained 40 pounds. Granted, I'm not sure whether all of this is because of Paxil or because of outside stressors, but this is what I 'do' know. Since beginning Paxil I have felt tired and constantly hungry, I have horrible nightmares, and when I try to go off of it I feel nauseous, panicky, and sweaty. Today, I went to see a psychologist to try and figure out where to go from here and she told me that she hasn't used Paxil in years because of its adverse effects. Her specific words were &quot;in 17 years I have only met one person on Paxil who didn't experience significant weight gain.&quot; I wish my doctor would have told me this before starting me on Paxil, but this is apparently not something widely advertised. Now I'm left feeling like the little good Paxil did me has been canceled out by the horrible feelings I have about my weight and lack of confidence.

Paxil is strong stuff while you need it and after you don't.

My issues though with this drug is that I am drowsy all the time and very spacey and my appetite has decreased to an all time low. I want to be happy but not spacey, I hope maybe after using this drug for a little while longer the symptoms would go away. I want to literally find the Happy Medium, so I hope I can either get there with this drug or find something else that is right for me.

I got very depressed and suicidal when I got divorced. My doctor put me on a few different anti-depressents. I took Lexapro, Effexor, then finally Paxil CR. Paxil CR works great. I feel great, no side effects, no more depression or anxiety. Meds work differnt for different people, but if your anti depressent is not working, you should deff try Paxil CR.

But I have had the most horrible side effects and I didn't get them right away, I am in my third month of taking it and I am so dizzy everyday that it has become unbearable and you can't just stop taking this drug. When I did try to stop it, even on the first day I was so horribly dizzy even more so than when I do take it.... I was miserable. I experience brain BUZZES and it feels like I cannot properly control the movement of my head or eyes. I wouldn't recommend it. But as for all medication to treat depression it has different affects on different people.

He also diagnosed me with a mild case of OCD. I was put on 20mg (now 30mg) of this drug and it has worked out really great for me. The side effects that I have dealt with the most were extreme fatigue (I take this before bed, still tired), extreme heartburn, and worst of all - loss of sexual drive. I feel better emotionally and do not have the panic attacks anymore, so for now it is worth it. I haven't decided yet if I will try another medication. The side effects right now can be dealt with, although they are a pain.

The problem is after 10 years, I can't seem to get off of this med.  I have been 'bridged' with Wellbutrin but feeling 'vague' and 'bitchy'.  Not sure what to do now?  go back to paxil???

Did have a few side effects at first but after I adjusted it has worked great. I hardly ever have panic attacks and if I do the symptoms are not as pronoun as they were with out the Paxil. I have congenital heart disease and Paxil CR is the best anti-anxitey medication to be on.

I would never have let my doctor put me on this if she had told me how bad I would feel if I decided not to take it anymore. Bit it did work for the depression.

It does little to alleviate depression and should never, ever be prescribed for anyone with a bipolar disorder. When I was taken off the drug cold turkey in March 2002, I went into a horrific withdrawal, which at that time, my doctor and other doctors denied would happen. I went through a nightmare of nearly six weeks with little or no sleep and remember every waking moment. I nearly had a psychotic break. Eventually, I was hospitalized, after begging and pleading with my well-meaning but misguided doctor that I need SOMETHING. The side effects of sudden withdrawal of Paxil for me were extreme insomnia, a feeling of being magnetically pulled into the ground, unbelievable anxiety, feelings of electrical zaps in my head and body, and feelings of unreality, or being out of my body. It was a living hell. I was eventually put on very low doses of Klonopin, Topamax and Seroquel and slowly came back to &quot;normal.&quot; It is eight years later and this is the best I have felt in many, many years. I think this stuff has been banned in the UK, hasn't it?

Overall, it's worth taking.

Finally, found a Psychatrist who was willing to experiment.  I am now on Lithium CR, Paxil (generic), Wellbutrin (generic) and Aderall XR.  The Paxil led to a reduced libido (which I rather welcomed) and to delayed climax (also welcomed).  I've tried getting off of it, but besides becoming depressed I had lines in my vision.My son and daughter both use it.  My daughter uses for social anxiety.  My son for depression.

It did it's job well, but as with most drugs it has its side effects.  One is gaining weight and the loss of sex drive. It also is hard to get off of. I am at the point now where I would like to be off of it but like many others have found it is not an easy drug to withdraw from. I get the jolts,  bad muscle &amp; joint aches, plus become very irritable whenever I stop taking it for a few days. It was interesting to me to read some of these same symptoms experienced by many on this website. I could never quite put a name to what many call the 'jolts' but I know just what you are talking about.All the same everyone is different and we react differently to drugs. I am very thankful for how paxil helped me be free of my panic attacks. I don't want to have to take it for life but living isn't very good if you are struggling with severe anxiety or depression. Sometimes we have to pick the lesser of two evils.

Panic Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	3/5/2010 11:33:58 PM	Spent half my life on this drug.  Excellent satisfaction with the exception of no sex drive and sleeping a lot.  Severe issues when going off the drug - depressed,high sex drive, crying fits.  Stuck through the 3 weeks from hell and now take Ativan sublingual for the occasional panic attack.  Drug was necessary to get my life back. 20 mg daily was perfect.  High doses 30-40mg start my breasts leaking milk.  A bizarre side effect. Take if for at least a month before giving up on it.  Off the drug, everyday is a challenge to cope with the stress of living but carrying Ativan with me gives me the security of something to help me in case of unexpected attack happens.

Gained about 15 pounds over that time period, tired most of the day and would have to go to bed very early every night. Symptoms were less noticeable but still there all the time- on the higher dose. Lost ability to feel a range of emotions- including happiness; ironically this resolved a couple weeks after stopping the drug. Would not take again.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	sonicpen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	2/9/2010 1:09:25 AM	I took Paxil for a year when I was 20 years old, and it did not work at all. My social anxiety was still severe, it made my depression worse and I started to cut myself. CBT worked like a charm, this medication didn't.

It works for getting rid of panic attacks and helps with anger but I personally have a fadded feeling i know whats going on but takes a while to have an emotion about anything. When i was taken off it for a week i went threw serious withdraw i had panic attacks and couldnt sleep.

Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	2/4/2010 8:01:11 PM	My doctor put me on 20 mg of Paxil as a teen when I was having panic attacks because of the stress of living in an abusive family.Paxil stopped the panic effectively. But it changed my personality. I felt blunted, which helped me tolerate the abusive situation, but it robbed me of the core of my humanity. I couldn't feel emotions as strongly. And I couldn't get excited about anything. Also, if I failed to take it consistently, I went through nightmarish withdrawals. At the time, it was not considered addictive and came with no warning.Six years later, I decided I had to stop taking it. I didn't like how it made me. And I got tired of always worrying about obtaining another prescription.Getting off this medicine was the worst experience I've ever had. Please take this seriously. The withdrawals are worse than you can even imagine. I have experienced both paxil withdrawal and heroin withdrawal, and I would consider the paxil withdrawal the worse of the two. Heroin withdrawal hurts, but paxil withdrawal hurts and causes you to doubt your sanity.But worst of all, more than the withdrawals I experienced, was that after I stopped taking paxil, I became myself again, and literally felt as if I had woken up in the middle of someone else's life. And all the issues I once had and had buried thanks to the medication presented themselves all over again. My problems never went away, Paxil just made me more successful at ignoring them. My sense of shame is terrible. I can't understand why I made the choices I made when I was on that medicine. I failed to protect myself. I hurt those close to me because I didn't understand the emotional pain I could cause other people. It was horrible finally facing the reality of what my life had become.In short, Paxil will make you feel better, if your life is unbearable because of anxiety. But it comes with a cost. It changes you. And it's horribly and undeniably addictive. I can't believe I was told this drug was 'safe'

I was sick once while I was on it and puked it up for two days in a row.  I started to shake, could not stop puking, I was dizzy and was hearing things and just felt crazy in my head.  My head was buzzing. It was horrible. I then tried to go off it awhile later and started cutting in in half and then tried to skip a day and even that made me sick.

I did experience withdrawal symptoms (dizziness, lighthead) when I was out for five days, but I plan on staying on this long term, sice I can't imagine living a decent life without it.

I had taken it after an accident, but was on so many other meds couldn't recall if it worked or not.It worked for a very short period and we kept having to increase doses. I have terrible withdrawls if i miss a dose. And most recentley i think it is the CAUSE of my hypomanic episodes. I am weaning off as we speak and have been taking it for almost 3 years consecutivley

Many antidepressants don't address anxiety (as either a cause or side effect of the depression). My only complaint is the sexual side effect of difficulty climaxing and a lower libido in general.

I have been off it 2 times and its always because other people make me feel bad for takeing it. They call it a crutch or act like I get high on it. My symptoms always return with out Paxil. And I have to go threw all that suffering for nothing. I will take paxil all my life and be happy I have it the alternitive for me is killing myself.

Whenever I missed a dose, I would have terrible nightmares where I knew I was dreaming but I couldn't wake myself up. They happened for a month while I was coming off of the paxil and after being off of it for a month I was really irritable and anxious all of the time. I feel like I need to go back on it but I hate to be dependent on a drug like Paxil. The nightmares were not worth it for me and affected my sleep and my whole day.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	chacowoo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	1/5/2010 2:11:23 AM	I have been on this drug for well pretty much since it's inception.  I have severe PTSD and live with chronic pain from a cervical disc disease.  My doc is wanting to get me off paxil and onto another, I was taking 60 mgs/day. I am coming down at 10 mgs a wk and it is not good. Crying, despair, lonliness. I am going through a wicked time trying to wean off and then     start on another med claimed to be better suited for my depression, anxiety and panic attacks.  I've just read the stmts on the new drug and I am worried. Right now coming off the paxil is being &quot;helped&quot; with xanax.  I am scared and in a lot of physical pain and reluctant to change.  My hubby is doing the best he can with my crying bouts, crazy talk, and anger issues.  Say a prayer for me as I try to get off Paxil and onto this new drug. I'm scared

I started paxil along with hydroxine for break through. all though the paxil works it has trouble side effects if i forget a dose. I feel jittery and tinglely in my mouth and hand. but over all it i am happy with the paxil

Got on Zoloft but I had too many side effects. I gave up on all meds for many years and believed nothing could possibly help me. Recently  my doctor put me on Welbutrin. I reluctantly gave it a try. Its incredible how great this one worked,and I dont even have any side effects. If certain antidepressants havent helped you, try another type. When you come across the right one for you, your whole life will get better(mine did in ways I never imagined). This has undoubtedly been the best thing that ever happened to me.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	So disappointed, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	12/24/2009 5:22:14 AM	I took this for high aniety which when coupled w/depression made things really bad for me. I was getting counseling to learn how to better cope, etc. It worked, stopping extreme anxiety. I stoppedtaking the RX, esp. after holidays, big events.  I resumed it approx. a yr. later.This time, I had BAD stomach pain, cramping.So bad I had worsened anxiety to point of sleeping poorly, miserable during the day too, even though I was still in counseling.I'd only changed my meds and intake by taking this RX again.  I'll  n e v e r resume taking it. Taking a major or minor antacid nullifies my nutrition absorption. Not worth it.  My doc and psych said to stop too.

Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/24/2009 12:54:03 PM	After having panic attacks as early as 8 years old, I was prescribed Paxil at the age of 14 by my physician. I then started therapy when I was 19. I am almost 25, and I am starting to be weaned off of it. I am surprised at how little side effects I am experiencing. I know many people who have taken this drug and it has NOT worked for them, or they tell me they feel like they are drunk. However, this drug changed my life. I never thought I would ever be able to leave my house or get a driver's license or go to college or live life as a normal kid. My panic attacks terrified me to the point that I never left my mother's side and my family had a tough time dealing with the problems that came with the panic disorder. My life is normal because of therapy and Paxil. It has worked for me for a little over ten years. I am very pleased with how Paxil has helped me.

I was the type of person who would worry about what other people would think but,after taking Paxil I am 110% better!!!! I want other people to not be ashamed to take something that is going to help them so much and give them a quality of life again!!! I believe that the good lord puts medicine on this earth for certain reasons and we should never be ashamed.

I can't get off of it or I feel all jittery but this pill changed my life without changing the person that I am. No more overwhelming fear of passing out or feeling like my body is disconnected from my brain. I feel whole and very alert on Paxil. My only complaint is that it is difficult for me to get a deep sleep that my body really needs. Paxil gave me my life back and took many unreasonable fears away. I never feel like I need to slip out of the room or feel fidgety anymore. 
Panic Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	11/15/2009 7:44:06 PM	My panic attacks were unmanageable and crippling. I finally confided in my doctor and he started me on 20 mg. After a month, the attacks were less but still present and I was told to take it to 40 mg a day. I have to say I am pleased. My attack are less than 5 every six month and not severe. My mood is improved. Granted, it does induce dreams but it is such a small price to pay for sleep and relief from panic attacks. I can honestly say I would recommend its use. Keep in mind, we are all different and receptor sites in brains vary as well, so it may not work for you but there are other meds out there. Keep on trying them until you find the right one. I opposed the use of xanax and other narcotics as I am a recover drug addict of 20 years.

I was managing these anxieties pretty well, but it was a thorn in my side that I could not get rid of them for good. When my father died a year ago (we did NOT have a good realtionship) a few of the MAJOR anxieties he instilled in me came back with a vengeance.  My husband takes a small dose of Paxil for his anxiety about public speaking in front of large groups, so I tried his dose.  It has worked amazingly!  My anxieties have been dealt with and I'm ready to go off Paxil after 3 months.  I am weaning myself off, and also adding daily doses of St. John's Wort to help with the transistion. (St. John's Wort is an herbal anti-depressant not officially prescribed by doctors.  The reason being, it has not been approved by the FDA to do what it claims to do because Pharmacy Companies cannot make a profit off of a natural-occuring herb, so they do not bother conducting FDA tests.  My Sister's Husband is an ER doctor and he takes St John's Wort for his mild depression.)I came here to see if anyone else is experiencing what I call 'very mild electricity' running through your head/brain.  And yes, you are.  Apparently it occurs when it's time to wean yourself off.  I'm not worried, I have a strong disposition, and I know these 'shocks' will eventually go away (a week or so?)So thank you for posting your experiences here.  Much obliged.
Other	Barb, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	11/10/2009 5:56:57 AM	After having a stroke I began to cry for no reason!  My GP suggested paxil (I now take the generic) and have had great results EXCEPT I cannot cry.  It is wierd but there are no tears, no way I have to &quot;let go&quot; ofmy sad emotions.  We recently had a death in the family and I am sure the family thought I was cold hearted as there was no tears.  Others were wiping tears and I just stood there.  BUT before paxil I would just be reading a book or talking to my husband and I would cry FOR NO REASON.  I have never tried to go off of paxil in the 6 years after my stroke but it is my goal to do just that.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	10/31/2009 5:11:46 PM	No drastic initial side effects but over a 6 month period approximately 30 lb weight gain and random feelings of dizziness.  Going off of the medication is VERY difficult with brain sizzles, dizziness, and anger. 
Panic Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	10/30/2009 11:47:27 PM	Seven years ago Paxil &quot;gave me my life back.&quot;  Today I feel like a slave to it.  I have tried three times to go off of it but the side effects are too severe to bear.  Had I known this was the case I never would have taken it.  I suggest anyone considering it either try Prozac or Zoloft.  Or better yet see a nutritionist who can help you with supplements like Tryptophan, GABA and L-Thianine.

This medication is a life saver and when I went off one year, no zapping whats so ever.Anxiety and Insomnia returned and I went back on 20mg a day. Back to normal in two days. My Doc said he will never take me off again. I agree.

I resent the day the GP prescribed it and I had the prescription filled - after 4 years and 1 failed attempt at coming off them I tried again....I wish I had been better informed about the withdrawal symptoms - the brain zaps were so bad that I lost 4 weeks of my life and a relationship in the process.  IT IS AN EVIL DRUG - THE DRUG COMPANY KNOWS ABOUT THE SIDE EFFECTS, BUT OF COURSE, WITHOUT THEM NO ONE WOULD TAKE IT... IT IS ADDICTIVE, NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE TELLS YOU.  After 2 years off of the drug, I still have brain zaps -my depression is ingrained and considered to be untreatable.  I went on Paxil because I was grieving the loss of my mother.  I wish I had never, ever started.  This drug has damaged me forever.  Try ANYTHING else but this - don't believe the clinical trials - they are manipulated to tell us what we want to know.. not how it is.  PAXIL RUINED BY EMOTIONS, MY INTERATCTIONS WITH OTHERS... AND IT RUINED ME!!  I now suffer with anxiety (which I didn't have before - and I know I will never be the same..

It brought me out of a very, very severe depression -- it doesn't get any more severe than what I had.  It brought me out within a week or so.  The worst side effect is that now when I try to go off it (I've tried cold turkey and weaning) I get EXTREMELY ANGRY.  I was never an angry person at all before; never.  I have horrible, horrible feelings of violence and depression.  For that reason I would never have started taking this medication in the first place.  If I would have known that was going to happen, I would have asked my doctor for something else.  Now I cannot go off it.  On the positive side, though, it does keep me out of depression, and I am basically a happy person.  It nearly eliminates sex drive, though.  Occaisionally (about once every six months, and only for a few minutes) I get restless leg syndrome.  It hasn't changed my dreams or nightmares at all.

However, the side effects are serious (majordecrease in libido, problems emoting)  and I have been unable to stop using it. The side effects/withdrawl is practically unbearable. I get the electric zaps, the trailed vision, hearing going in and out, panic which nearly led to a collision, nightmares.  I would not recommend this drug to another user, there are many types of SSRIs on the market. I will be trying to ramp down and try another.

Since reducing the dose, i am having some adverse side effects, i.e., stomach upset, hives which scare me, wicked dreams!!! Sweats!!!! but all in all i keep going on trying not to dwell on the negative!!! you have to!!! Or you'll go crazy!!!! Want to get off this med completely, hopefully soon!!!

Let me warn you, paxil withdrawal is painful. I had severe stomach pains and diahrea for almost a week. Be warned.

Paxil does help with severe panic attacks. I don't think it's good for treating major depression. I will tell you that this drug makes you sleep way too much. When I worked full-time, I was able to stay up because I had something to do, now that I'am out of work, it makes me sleep all day if I don't have any plans. I do plan on changing meds soon I hope this help.

I have tried over 17 different SSRI's and it is the only one I absolutely do not encourage to anyone, for any use. It has the most side effects and severest withdrawl symptoms in this class of drugs. There are far better options and a plethora of them on the market. Please, if your Dr. prescribes this, take it as directed or even better, get a second opinion and a different Dr. 
Major Depressive Disorder	jamb4, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	10/9/2009 12:59:22 PM	I've apparently suffered from depression for close to 30 years but was given different diagnoses i.e. PTSD, dissociative disorder. I would be put on Prozac or Paxil and feel back to &quot;normal&quot; while on the medication and then would be weaned off. The normalcy gradually disappeared and I'd be hospitalized again. In hindsight I think the problem was exacerbated by working in violent, high crime neighborhoods (I'm a paramedic). In 2008 I contacted my doctor and told her I realized I was suffering from depression all those years. I started seeing her for an episode 10 years prior which again was resolved by Paxil. I managed to make it until last year due to a change in my position at work. When I had my epiphany and realized the problem has been going on since I was in college, I requested to stay on the drug. 10mg works fine for me. After 2 weeks I noticed my mood improve and after 2 months felt I was back to what my &quot;normal&quot; is. The downside is I'm getting way too much rem sleep now with recurring dreams. I'm trying to work through that problem, but feel it's a small price to pay for getting my life back!

Although this med did initially help me with panic &amp; depression, I virtually became a zombie devoid of all emotions.  I did some research and found out all the horrible things about this drug and started weaning off.  Weaning off is not easy.  Regardless of what what is said by doctors and pharmacists this drug is addictive and hell to get off of.

Also, i didnt sleep for days at a time either, and gained 20 pounds, witch is a lot for me because i am naturally thin.  My butt got soo big! Then to make it worse when i tried to get off it constant dizziness, weakness, basic flu like symptoms.  I hate my doctor for not telling me about any of this! i think he just picked some random thing of the list! Now i have a new doctor and i am about to try Prozac...any advice?

Im worried my doctor wont give me a refill one day and I feel like if that happens I might die or somthing. Its crazy stuff. But other than running out and feeling awfull when I do. It really helps my panics in stores and in public.

Doctors tried many drugs then about 10 years ago started Paxil.  I changed almost overnight!  20 mg makes me hyper and 10 mg doesn't work well.  I am on 15 mg every day and live an absolutely wonderful, &quot;normal&quot; life.  No panic, I travel, work, everything!  The only side effects for me is a very large weight gain with great difficulty getting any off and no sex drive whatsoever. I am 59, single and loving that fact so this doesn't matter.  The trade off is well worth it.  Fabulous medication.  I will take it for the rest of my life gladly.
Other	Mrs. J, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	55-64	9/17/2009 4:03:44 AM	I was put on paxil/diovan to control migraines. The combination worked. I was using name brand Paxil. When I wanted to get off of the paxil, it was horrible. There is no getting off of it. I have switched to a good generic brand, but even the withdrawl symptoms are still terrible. I was NEVER emotionally unstable, before being put on this stuff. If I had of known the end results...I would have suffered the horrible migraines instead.

Very Important to taper off this medication and never miss a dose.

At first I noticed a huge improvement in concentration and began to feel happier.  However, after about 6 mths I began to gain weight (alot of it!!)  I ended up trying to go off of it.  THIS IS A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!!  It took me four yrs to completely stop without feeling sick.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  It worked, but going off of it is hell!!!!

I first had Paxil 15 years ago when going through my divorce. About two weeks into treatment, I felt like a butterfly coming out of a cocoon. I stopped after a year. Last year, I started Paxil again for depression/dysthymia. Again, it has worked wonderfully...only this time, I have had a weight gain. The first time, I lost close to 45 pounds. This time, I have gained almost 50 pounds! My doctor is suggesting I try Zoloft but I am not sure I want to give up the good that has come from the Paxil. I feel alive. I have hope. I see colors more clearly. It has literally changed my life.
Other	Tom, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Male	55-64	8/20/2009 4:32:28 AM	General Anxiety Disorder.  That is what the doctor diagnosed.  Let's try Paxil!  Worked wonders.  No problems getting started.  Real mental problem was a rage disorder.  Paxil makes me much easier to live with.  I am much calmer and happier.  So is my wife. The drug works great.  Now, the down side.  Gained 40 pounds and lost all sex drive.  Through a special diet and lots of work, I lost 50 lbs.  Trouble is, I found them again.  I decided to just stop the medicine so I could lose the weight again. Can not do it.  I am one of those people who suffer debilitating side effects when trying to quit.  Please research this medicine before you begin taking it.  I have to resume taking Paxil until next summer when I can try to figure out how to escape its clutches.  I am suffering from: migrane type headaches that Tylenol won't touch, dizziness that prevents me from driving, brain zaps that make me question my sanity, fits of crying for no reason, and a general disconect from myself.  Unless you are ok with potentially having to go through the hell of withdrawl, try another drug that you have researched, and you feel comfortable taking. For me, the option has become take Paxil, work out for two and a half hours a day and watch what and how much I eat.  Life could be a lot worse for me.  I could be the guy screaming obsenities at you through my open car window because you changed lanes without signaling.

Made me kind of sleepy so he reduced it to 10mg daily. Guess I'm okay: don't feel like punching anyone now. No noticeable reaction unless I stop taking it. On the third day, the world moves around me. My policeman son told me not to drive, that if I were stopped for anything, I would probably be jailed for intoxication.

I developed SEVERE nosebleeds, my head pounded, I got migraines, I felt as though I was on another planet, I HATED IT. Just after 3 days of taking it.I went back, and tried 6 more. NONE were effective. Wellbutrin made me MORE depressed, Prozac did NOTHING, Zyprexa, an antipsychotic I found out, just made me want to sleep all the time, and finally Zoloft. Thank GOD for Zoloft. Treats my anxiety, depression, etc. Some swear by Paxil and the others. I say, &quot;BE CAREFUL&quot;.

It has been wonderful feeling &quot;even tempered&quot; all day.  I've always been a mild mannered person until menopause hit.  The Paxil helps to take the edge off, not to mention the hot flashes have subsided substantially.  The only side effect I have is &quot;wild dreams&quot; even sleep walking and talking.  I also have gained about 10 pounds as well.  I'm guessing if I pick up the exercise, maybe I could get that 10 lbs. off .

Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	8/11/2009 10:16:50 PM	I am a 24 year old young woman weening myself off of Paxil CR 25 mg. I have no other choice but to stop taking my Paxil because the state of Florida will not help me get any type of health insurance, (I am also an insulin dependent type I diabetic...anyway...I am experiencing horrofic side effects including: &quot;electric shocks: through my brain, panic attacks, extreme nausea, diareah(sp?), lonliness, and sudden outbursts of anger or uncontrollable crying. This drup is extremely dangerous. It works well while you take it, but should you ever choose to go off it...hold on to your ass. Look up &quot;Paxil Withdrawal Symptoms&quot; on Google.com...you will be shocked. Take care of yourselves, and PLEASE stay away from Paxil, find an alternative with your doctor, PLEASE! God Bless.

My synthroid medicine was elevated however in that time frame.  However, 2 weeks after being on 20 mgs I felt my symptoms (anxiety) coming back.  Does anyone know how long it takes for 30 mgs to work again?

In 4 months time I gained 40 pounds (120 to a 160).  The Paxil does it's job and I feel awesome on it! My dosage was upped to 40mg, and feel even better.  However, in two weeks time I gained 12 pounds.  I have gained a total of 72 pounds 8 months, almost 10 pounds a month, and although the medication is great I CANNOT handle this excess weight on my small frame.  I now am trying diet pills (prescribed) to help curve the weight gain and so far no success.  Three weeks of being on the diet meds. is when I gained another 12 pounds.I have gained massive weight but the drug works great with my major depression and mood disorder and the combining with 300mg of wellbutrin, the two work great 2gether.  Not all will gain the weight, but I have and I am NOT happy at all about it and looking for an alternative to the Paxil.

It was a miracle to me it. It gave me back my SANITY, literally. Took it for 4 yrs. It really was God sent. But, of course it did decrease my sexuall drive and made it very hard for me to climax. I have not considered this much of a problem considering how much it has helped me. But recently Ive started a really great relationship(was single for 4 yrs).So Ive tapered off paxil (for only a few day as directed by my Dr) then started welbutrin. THIS HAS BEEN TORTURE!!! I dont think that my Dr had me taper from the paxil for enough time. Anyway, it has been horrible. I have absolute migraine headaches so bad that I cant see straight.Dizziness so bad that I cant get out of bed. I have the jolts or shocks that go through my whole body. This is called Electric Shock Syndrome-its a known effect of withdrawel--Yeah its really great!!Then of course Im emotional on top of all that. I cant eat b/c im nauseaous. Im missing time from work which I cant afford. Paxil was an absolute miracle-but stopping it is a nightmare!!! So my advice is to just weigh the risks and the benifits.

I used to smoke marijuana alot and now recently quit. I had very bad anexiety and depression for the longest time. I was a single mother at are 16. I didn't realize something was wrong with me till my daughter hit puberty at age 10 she's now 13. I knew I couldn't smoke pot anymore. I smoked every chance I could when I'd get off work til the time I went to bed. I was severely depressed raising her alone and watching her get her periods,breasts(Are bigger than mine)and teenage atitude. I tried Prozac and gained 9 pounds in one month so I quit although I felt happy I couldn't control my wanting to eat up carbs and sweets and comfort food. I went from 136 pounds to 160 in two months. I then took wellbutrin and woke up in the middle of the night with cold sweats and couldn't go back to sleep. I now take Paxil and only side effect so far is insomnia. I feel more in control of my focus and don't want to eat as much as when I was on prozac. I was still smoking weed on prozac now I quit and don't feel like I need to smoke too.

Panic Disorder	Tiffany 2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	7/24/2009 9:30:11 PM	I had to discontinue this drug because I wanted to get pregnant and I miss it dearly! Starting it and stopping it, I experienced weird muscle twitches for about three weeks, but otherwise, I took it for 3 years with great success.  Helped depression too.  I had previously tried Buspar, propranolol, and Xanax, and this worked the best for me.  If I could go back on it and take it for the rest of my life, I would.  It was the only time I have ever felt &quot;normal.&quot;  Now, without anxiety meds, I have panic attacks about 2x a day and experience mild depression.  Maybe when I am no longer trying to get pregnant, I will return to it.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	lynnd, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	7/24/2009 6:21:57 AM	I have been on Paxil for 10 years, for anxiety disorder.  At first it worked great but now that my bodies use to it I feel it does not work at all.  I get suicidal/Angry/Irritable after missing one dose so it's very important to not forget to take them.  I also experience heavy sweating, siezures and tremors.  I would not recommend taking this medication to anyone because the side effects are horrible.  I wish I had seeked therapy instead of just taking this medication. It is very hard to get off, I would have to be in some kinda of medical facility suprised to get off this medication because I've tried on my own at home and it was not good for me or my family.  I was in a horible mood, my head pounded my visioned blurred and I felt like killing myself and taking my anger out on anyone even loved ones. I ended up locking myself in my room and staying in bed for a week as I restabilized myself on the medication

My dr. told me the symptoms and said that she would have to take a close eye on me since i was so young. When i took paxil my jaw wouldnt stop shivering like i was cold or something and i was kinda mean, i didnt eat as much, i stayed to myself i didnt want to leave my room basically....she had told me to tell  her about the symptoms that i was having and got really pissy with me and referred me to a councler and a psychiatrist.

I was fine for 9 years, then I started with the brain zapping, the shaking, the nausea, etc. I weaned myself off it, and am glad I did. Paxil is an evil, foul drug that should be restricted to last resort cases.

I have been on Paxil CR for a year. A car accident in 2007 caused severe anxiety attacks. I started on 25 mg &amp; took them up until a week ago. Overall, they got rid of my attacks, but if I missed a dose, or didn't take it at the same time everyday I would get a jolting or zapping sensation from my head &amp; down to my neck &amp; arms. I am now trying to ween myself off of them &amp; now on 12.5 mg. The weening process is horrible!! I have no energy, headaches, &amp; worse of all, the jolting &amp; zapping like pains down my neck &amp; arms! I can't even turn my head without the zapping! Paxil overall worked, but the side effects of coming off this drug outweigh its performance. It's not worth it! I do not prefer for anyone to take this drug!

I have always had some moodiness and at times that would be difficult to hide. I also had a fear of driving on the freeway which was my only way to get to work. I finally decided to try paxil and it has been very good for me. I can drive on the freeway and my mood is much more consistent. My sex drive is lower but over time it has improved. I am tired, but I exercise everyday for an hour and sometimes two. Overall I am pleased with this medication. I would love to not take anything, but I am afraid of my anxiety attacks and how that will affect my quality of life.

But, after several weeks, I started having warm fuzzy sensations on my head (left or right side), flushing down my neck, which lasts for about 2-3 seconds and then nothing. I appears all of a sudden, out of the blue and it's freaking me out. I've seen my doctor three times about this (I will see a neurologist next month), I am taking Zoloft now (50 mg per day), I can feel a slight difference, but not much. I had all the tests done and they all came out perfect. I still think it was from stopping the Paxil. If this is a side effect from stopping this pill, then I think they should take it out from the market. All these symptoms are making me feel like there is something really wrong with me and that I'm going to die very soon and no one will ever now what the heck is wrong with me. This is horrible what I'm going through, I never had this before stopping this Paxil pill.

I started taking it for PTSD from the recommendation of my psychologist.  I was on it for about 6 months and my panic attacks grew worse, I had extreme debilitating headaches, thoughts of violence to myself and others, and many other side effects.  I stopped taking this med against the advise of the professionals and I made a conscious decision to change my thinking and behaiviour.  I took almost a year after stopping this med before the brain shocks and feeling the room moving after I turned my head to go away.  I would not reccomend this to anyone, but I guess it works for some.

Panic Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	6/16/2009 1:01:15 AM	I started taking Paxil last August for severe anxiety and panic attacks that landed me in the psych. hospital for a week. I now take 25mg every day at 3pm. It seems to keep me on an even keel during the afternoon and evening, but it does NOT help me sleep! I seem to have a reverse reaction to most drugs that supposedly cause drowsiness, including Benadryl; they hype me up and disrupt my sleep so much I have become almost nocturnal! I have never tried to go off Paxil, so cannot speak to the weaning process (by the way, that is how the word is spelled: &quot;weaning,&quot; not &quot;weening&quot;). I do know you should NEVER try to reduce or change your dosage of any &quot;head med&quot; without talking to your doctor. In addition, you should not take any herbal supplements or OTC drugs without checking for bad interactions. I find that my pharmacist knows more and is easier to contact than my docs. Best wishes for all of you with anxiety/panic/depression issues; just making it day to day is a victory!
Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/15/2009 1:58:37 AM	This drug has relieved much of my anxiety, paranoia and ruminating negative thoughts. I wish I had started taking this med. earlier in my life. The only side affect I have noticed is an increase in urination when I increased my dose to 40 mg.

My biggest side effect was Dry mouth, which in turn led to gumline cavities and a lot of dental work. Biotene products help this. Paxil was a life changing drug for me.

Im finally able to get out of bed before noon.  I also lost 15 lbs. after stopping this.  I think these drugs become ineffective after so long.  Also, if you dont wean yourself off VERY VERY slowly the withdrawl effects are horrible.

It really helped control my irritability and nervous feeling.  However I have gained 10 lbs and have a harder time reaching orgasm.  The weight gain is because while I can control my moods much better I have a much harder time controlling my food intake.

Started out at 10 mg per day and now taking 30 mg per day.  The dose has increased over time as the lower dose seemed to cease it's effect.  I have to say this drug does wonders, almost too much.  In that it almost numbs your emotions (inability to cry or react emotionally) and nothing seems to effect you - that probably should! And in my case there was absolutely no sexual desire, and constipation, weight gain too.  BUT the worst is when you try to get off it! I have tried many times, lowering the dose in small mg increments until I could stop it completely.  By the 3rd day of lowering the dose I was ready to rip some ones face off, crying over the smallest thing, couldn't sleep, had excessive hot flashes, sweating and a very queasy stomach for like three days of no paxil at all.  I would have never taken it had I known it would effect me in all these ways!!  When it's good it's almost TOO good, and when you want off, it's HORRIBLE!  Make sure your loved ones understand that getting off this drug will have bad effects and to try to be patient and understanding until it is completely out of your system.  It took me almost two weeks to feel good again after stopping it!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	lil redhead, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	5/25/2009 5:43:18 PM	I've been using Paxil for over two years and a supplemental dose of Klonopin at 1/2 grain which is minimal.  The Paxil treats the underlying chemical disorder (seritonin level) and the Klonopin treats the symptoms.  I read a lot of reviews and am amazed that people would want to go off this medication if it helps them.  Yes, weight control can be an issue, but TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR for heaven's sake.  DON'T try to get off the medication by yourself.  I don't plan to get off Paxil anytime soon.  I'm 64, am 5'1&quot; and weigh 128lbs.  I go to the gym often and watch what I eat (most of the time).  I did lose weight a couple of months ago because I lost my dad.  Stress causes me to stop eating.  I regained it a little.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/5/2009 12:29:34 AM	My doctor had me on a rather high dose of this medication: 60mg daily. This medication made me suicidal. I had never had such intense feelings of absolute pain prior to taking Paxil, nor have I since I stopped using the medication. I took the medication for a period of time spanning three, horrible years. It was extremely difficult to stop using as I experienced agonizing physical side effects of withdrawal.

For some it may not work, but for the ones it does,it is a great med for my disorder. I in my own opinion, if your doctor suggests you try, please give it a chance....I sincerely hope you have the results that i did     Donna  somerset,kentucky
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	chip, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Male	25-34	4/26/2009 12:33:29 AM	I have been on the brand name Paxil called Pexeva for over 3 months.  Initially, it made me very shaky and slightly nauseous.  I felt better mentally.  However, it completely killed my sex drive and made it extremely difficult to orgasm.  It also causes night sweats every single night.  I wake up with my clothes and sheets soaked every night.  I'm switching to Wellbutrin because of the sexual side effects with Pexeva.

I didn't last five days--it made my incredibly dizzy and lightheaded, which thus brought on more anxiety leading to full blown panic attacks.  I'm sure it works well for many people, but for me it was almost worse than the panic disorder itself.  My doctor switched me back to Ativan, which I've been taking ever since with much success.

Used it for a few months about 2 years ago.  I now use generic Paxil (paroxetine).  However, if your insurance covers this kind of drug, I would highly recommend CR, as it has noticeable benefits over non-time release paroxetine... more of a consistent good feeling during the day...

Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	4/16/2009 2:58:05 PM	As I am writing this I am in the process of coming off the Paxil. It is very hard and I wish I knew when I started taking it how hard it would be to come off. If you are considering taking this drug please consider alternatives. I was taking 25mg and started every other day dosage. I was sick for about the first week and felt pretty good the second week. At the end of the second week I started having jolting/surges in my head. That has continued for about a week now and I am miserable. I also went down to 12.5 mg every other day and I am horribable sick again. It is important to have a support system around you during this time because it is not easy at all. I never would have started taking this medication if I knew how hard it would be to come off. It is like being addicted to a street drug. It wil be worth it when I am off completely.

Plus it is very hard to reach orgasm and I never had that problem before.  I have been on this drug a long time and to me, the benefits have been worth it even with the negative effects.

Getting off the stuff has made her more depressed and angry than ever before. Getting off this stuff might be as bad as some street drugs. Be sure that if you are about to start taking it that Paxil has long term effects that may never go away  even if you stop. And if and when you stop, you will put yourself and your loved ones thru Hell.

Paxil has been very effective for me.  No longer am I afraid of social interaction, I actually prefer it.   My depression is always in the background.  I do not think any drug can make this go away. It's just how I'm wired.  Paxil does make a difference in regards to my depression.  I don't know how I could function without it.

I have cut down from 30 mg a day to l0 and will go off it today entirely. Will continue to take the clonazapam instead.I felt that the 30 mgs was much too much and it was creating anxiety rather than limiting it.Will see my Dr. in May and will explain to him what I have done.I am not satisfied with this med. I can see no reason for being onboth clonazapan and paroxetine(37 mg). I cut down the dosage from 30 to l0 and now will stop taking it entirely. Will see my Dr. again in May and will discuss this with him.

My Dr. added paxil a few yrs. ago, after I lost my appitite, and went down to 95 lbs. Didn't help with that (sorry folks), so I went off it. Thought I'd die. Was so tired, I wanted to crawl around the house. Went back on, and in 5 days, felt like I'd been reborn. Stuck with it ever since. Do have the loss of sexual desire, but I'm 61 so slowing down is not a problem. My friend slept through a whole vacation when she went off of it, told her of my experience, she went back on and called a week later and said &quot;You saved my life!!&quot;  I know from experience that it takes patience to get the right pill, or right combonation of pills for your condition, alot of up's and downs. Everyone is different, and a pill that works for one doesn't always work for another. All the trial and errors are worth it once you feel like a real human being again. Although I'm still a skinny minnie (again, sorry), I'm a happy and productive one!!! Don't give up, work with a good Dr. and with alittle luck, you can be too. S.M. Ohio

I am on very low dosage (10mg) for anxiety and panic disorder.  The first week was tough for me because I can not stand taking medications.  But once I got past the worry of how it was going to affect me, I was fine.  I feel better than I have in a long time.  So this med is great for me so far.  I have read all of the posts and warnings about coming off of it and I feel that if you follow doctors orders when coming off of any medication you will do fine.

And you have to be taken off this med slowly very slowly under a dr.supervision!!!Seizures can happen if you stop on your own!!!Ive been on this med for a long time and i do know that weight gain is an issue but if you watch what you are eating just like with any other med. youll be fine.Most of these things go away in time.Give it a chance...There is no miracle out there!!!

The star rating says it all as it pertains to the treatment. THIS POST, addresses the weight gain issue of some users.I have NOT gained any weight on Paxil. That's not to say that if I didn't realize what was happening, I'd be bigger than a house by now.For whatever reason, Paxil' beneficial effect turns off the &quot;I'm full&quot; button in your head. For me, I could eat until I exploded and not feel full. This must go along with the sedative/calming or (la-la-la who-cares) effect of this group of drugs). The weight gain is YOUR responsibility. Establish portion sizes and STICK WITH IT!! No 2nd's!! (That will be just the next step before 3rd's, ect.) When you wake up at night, AND YOU WILL, do not raid the pantry for chips, cookies, ect. This is the area to consentrate on.Meals are now VISUAL BASED since you'll have a hard time getting the &quot;full&quot; feeling any more. Hope this helps! PS: If you ever say to yourself &quot;this one small amount of ???? at 3AM won't hurt&quot;, you need to re-read this post.

Major Depressive Disorder	jade, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	2/28/2009 3:31:08 AM	I am taking Paxil for depression.  I took Celexa for 6 years with very positive results but it stopped working.  I tried a number of other anti-depressents but I either had a number of side effects or they didn't work.  I have been on Paxil for about 5 weeks.  Initially I was very tired but this has passed.  The only ongoing side effect is the inability to orgasm. Hopefully this will pass.  If not I am not sure what I will do.  My doctor has suggested Viagra..  Apparently this has helped some women with this side effect.I am feeling like myself again and don't want to chage medications. Other then the sexual side effect this has been a great medication. Any suggestions?

Lower doses are for depression, higher doses are for panic. It seemed to make me manic for the first 8 months until they significantly increased the dose. I still have to take lorazipam before holidays and during stressfull events. Can never visit inlaws though. Still nauseated off and on for days.

Lost job in 2008 after working with same physicians for 16 years and 35+ in the Medical Field. Times were very tough for me, especially being alone with little to no family left and no job. Paxil has helped me continue on with life without even knowing that I take it.  No side effects of any kind, and it seemed like only a few days after taking my first dose that I felt better...Thanks!

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female		2/21/2009 3:14:10 PM	I started taking this medication when I was fourteen, and by sixteen I'd gained at least 20lbs- I know it wasn't my eating habits that caused the gain because I calorie-counted, and was generally eating less than the recommended amount. It did dramatically change my life for the better though- I was much happier, calmer, and much more in control of my emotions. The worst side effect I experienced besides the weight gain was the withdrawl symptoms I experienced. If I skipped a day or was a few hours late in taking the next day's dose, I would get dizzy and clammy and feel as though electric shocks were running through my body. I decided to go off the meds completely before going off to college, so my doctor gave me an extremely low dose to ween me off. Even when I was taking only 5 mg, as soon as I went off of it cold turkey I got the withdrawl symptoms. I finally had to wait until summer to go off of it completely, so that I could stay in bed until it was all over with. I did it, but I ended up being in bed for about three weeks due to the withdrawl symptoms. I felt like a heroin addict or something.  Still, although coming off was hard, I think for the most part it was worth it, because my quality of life was much better with the medication. I'm currently taking nothing for my anxiety, but because the drugs allowed me to know what it felt like to be in control, I am managing on my own and doing pretty well. I know I wouldn't be here if it weren't for paxil cr.

I had to up the dosage but once we got the right dose it has been very effective. The only side effect I've experienced is complete loss of sexual desire (not so good for husband). Unfortunatly this is the only medication that has helped, I've tried everything from zoloft to prozac to xanax, etc.

I was starving all the time, even woke up in middle of night to eat. After stopping the drug, lost all the weight quickly. Wellbutrin XL 150mg combined with Lexapro 10mg is a much better option. 
Major Depressive Disorder	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/9/2009 8:09:35 PM	I have been taking Paxil for 8 yrs.Both parents were very sick and I couldn't imagine losing them. The only way I can describe how I felt is to say it was like my heart had dropped to my feet,(depression) and such a feeling of fear overcame me,I cried all the time. It was horrible.When I started taking Paxil I stopped crying so easily and the anxiety left and I finally had control over my emotions.I did try Zoloft because I had heard you didn't put on weight with that but all my previous problems came back even worst than before. I am back on Paxil and feeling great! So what if i'm a little on the heavy side, I would rather be chubby than have all the emotional problems I had without the Paxil.By the way both my Parents have passed now and though I miss them so much I have handled everything very well

Even everyday life,work,personal relationships,I could never feel at ease. I would tense up so much that I could not even look at a person without my eyes watering my mind going blank.  It was awful. Since taking Paxil my life has changed so much. I truly believe that this drug has greatly improved the quality of my life.

It had helped me get through the depression I had been feeling. Going off it is a different story though. You feel like your head is exploding with electric shocks and dizziness. I even slowly decreased the dosage over a period of 2 weeks, which I think wasn't long enough. Please talk to your doctor if you are thinking of going off this drug. The effects from going off it so soon like I did are very scary, you feel as if you have no control over your balance or feeling like powerful electrical jolts run through your head every time I turn my head to look at something. But like I said, it did work for me during the time I needed it.

I became more uninhibited to the point I was doing sexual behaviors as a female I would not have before.  I almost had an affair and fough awful with my husband throwing an object at him whereupon my husband called the cops.  Very uncool stituation.  Paxil is known to make some people uninhibited. Also, when I stopped taking it, I felt like I was coming off a strange LSD drug .....headache , just strange

The Paxil has relieved those feelings.  A more positive benefit than most others is the change in my eating habits.  I tend to eat when I am anxious and depressed and since I no longer have those feelings, I am better able to control my food.  I have lost 10 lbs and feel fantastic.  My family and friends have notice a great change in me and any side effects are worth it.

As another review stated, this saved my life and allowed me to have a life! I've continued to benefit from  Paxil since then due to a hormonal imbalance.  All of my hormonal symptoms have dramatically changed.  Of course every body/person is different, but MY experience for the last 12+ years has been very good.  I know my husband would agree!  
Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/13/2009 11:25:31 PM	1st of all I read all the reviews and just laugh, all meds work differently for EVERYBODY. It will work for some and not for others. This med gave me my life back! I was suffering from panic attacks so bad I couldnt do a single thing without having an attack. Ive been on the med for around 4 yrs. I never liked the idea of taking pills but once I started on 10mg I up'd my dose to 20 mg and have been on that since. I have about 2 weeks where I had to be off the med and it wasnt the greatest but was doable. Just made me feel lightheaded and dizzy. but in all reality I would much rather feel that then another panic attack ever. So basically if this is a med that can work for you I say go for it. it was a miracle for me.

However, I did make the mistake of forgetting to take the pill (by error) for 5-7 days.  Make sure you take your medication - EVERY day! To miss an extended amount of doses after taking it for quite a while is very unhealthy and causes an extreme amount of side affects, such as dizziness, nausea, etc. Make sure you take every dose, like your doctor tells you to do.

It made me actually feel human again, which is saying a lot for such a small dosage.  IT IS ADDICTING however, and the withdrawal is excruciating. Avoid this drug if at all possible and go with a simpler anti-depressant with a shorter half-life inside your body.

It took 3 weeks to take effect. It took away all anxiety and slept very well. Only side effect was decrease sexual interest, but delayed orgasm. (a benefit for me)Stopped taking after several months and anxiety attacks came back. Increased dosage to 40 mg and vowed to never go off again, it really helped me with no anxiety or running thoughts. I had a very intense business and kept me stress free for years. I stopped again (was missing dosages and stop refills) and no side effects and was able to keep same level for 6 months. Anxiety started again recently and started paxil 40 mg with still some anxiety and sleepless nights. I had to take lorazapam to take edge off and help sleep. Will make appt with doctor to see if increase needed in paxil to get original effectiveness.

Major Depressive Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/29/2008 10:27:44 PM	I started taking this medication at 13 for depression and anxiety. It worked really well for me. The littlest things would get under my skin and I dealt with a lot of anger. It helped calm me down and really did improve the quality of my life. I was on it for 6 years and was off it for 8 months recently, but stress and anxiety about things has come back, so I've started taking it again. The only bad thing I've came across are the withdrawal symptoms (headaches, tiredness, loss of appetite) I felt when I'd accidentally not take it during those 6 years, but getting off of it was actually really easy for me. Other than withdrawals, I've had a good experience with this prescription.

Although I was on a low dose (20 mg) I found it relieved my anxieties - I felt comfortable meeting new people, comfortable with myself, I could sleep well, etc. The only reason I got off of it is because of the dangers of taking it while pregnant, such as pulminary disorders. The withdrawal syptoms were so bad that I had to take a week off of work. It's scary to be something that makes you so dependent that you get such severe withdrawal syptoms.

My heart used to pound through my chest for the most rediculous reasons. Side effects are very manageable for me. I wish further research can be done for the weight gain issue. Although my weight is stable, it's only because I've realized that Paxil turns off the satiation effect. I've learned to visualize volume and NOT EVER wait for the &quot;full&quot; feeling. It doesn't happen!! (Literally) Watch what you eat!

Panic Disorder	Rita, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	12/18/2008 9:38:34 AM	I took Paxil for 5 years and in those 5 years did not have one panic attack. In fact I was feeling so good I come off of it during the summer with the help of my doctor. I did good for 3 months and now the attacks are back. Paxil does not work for everyone, you have to find a drug that works for you and there are many out there! Coming off the drug has to be as slow as going on and you will be fine. I stopped taking it to see if my problem was just a once off thing 5 years ago. I have now proven that is not the case and need to take it long term. My advice is to take as little as possibe where it's working but not making you tired or disinterested in everyday things.

Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	12/16/2008 2:37:13 PM	I have been on Paroxatine CR for a few months now.  I have tried Lexapro, but I didn't like that one because it made me extra sleepy and I still had some issues with depression.  The Lexapro did help with my anxiety though.  Pretty much immediately after going on Paroxatine CR, my anxiety disappeared and I became for even keeled (ie. less moodiness and temper flares over silly things like slow drivers).  It took about a month before I felt the full benefit for my depression, but I do feel a lot better now.  It does make me sleep well at night, but I don't seem to be sleepy during the day.  Lexapro made me too tired at work.

I started on 5 mg regular paxil once daily, and are currently on 25mg paxil cr twice daily.  Lifesaver is all I can say.My disorders are depression, anxiety, panic, ocd, and posttraumatic.  This has been my wonder drug.  Please be advised, sometimes a concoction of meds may be necessary to treat so many disorders.  My concoctions is Paxil CR, Wellbutrin CR, and nortriptyline.

I resent the day my doctor prescribes me paxil. I should have informed myself more about this pill. This paxilmakes life miserable. This is a very addictive and a non-stop taking medicine. I have tried several times to stop taking this medicine butits impossible. If there is any people who have been prescribes this paxil please take my advise dont take it or you wont be able to stop. It is a BAD medicine.
Panic Disorder	Bobareebop, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	12/13/2008 1:08:01 AM	This medicine has been a miracle cure for me.  My doctor did advise me that it would take about 30 days of continuous ingestion to achieve full effects. Although I did suffer intermittent panic episodes after beginning treatment with Paxil, they diminished over the initial 30 days.Since then I have not experienced any panic attacks. That is truly a blessing. However, one major side effect of this and similar antidepressants is excessive sweating under physical exertion. That sucks, but compared to having the panic attacks it's a no-brainer. I'll take the sweat any day.And that's from a 6-year active-duty Army Field Artillery veteran from the 1970's.

Other than that you feel great so it is a trade off.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	12/11/2008 12:23:10 PM	Paxil made me very tired, but took away my depression and anxiety within a week. I did notice a kind of &quot;numbness&quot; concerning my emotions. Did't get upset or cry or even laugh a whole lot. But I did feel like a different person. It took away my &quot;social anxiety&quot; and I was able to see my problems from a different perpective. Normal things that use to bug me about people didn't bother me anymore. Which was good, but I felt wasn't &quot;real&quot; I had to slowly wean off it. You can't just stop it or you become very irritable. So I went down to 10 mg and was able to quit. I was on it for about 2 years.

Major Depressive Disorder	Jodee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	12/6/2008 3:27:05 AM	I am now 41 years old. I've been on Paxil for about 15yrs. It worked wonders for me as long as I didn't run out or skip doses. I did actually get off for about 2 yrs. I didn't mean to, I just would forget to take them, then cut back on my doses due to cost and then finally just quit. I didn't have any side affects at that time. Very Strange. I got back on due to some increased anxiety with a bad situation. If I skip one night's dose, I feel great the next day. (Probably too great) But, if I skip 2 doses, It's the beginning of horrible. Skip 3 doses, you can experience &quot;Brain Shivers&quot; or a wavy feeling in your head. Electrical shock feelings going through your head, arms and even hands. Severe anger that consumes you. Crying, Paranoia, etc etc. Don't skip doses!! If you decide to try getting off. Wean yourself very very slowly. Even over months. Slowly decreasing your dose. Of course with the help of your doctor. However, they seem to want to go too fast. I didn't gain weight. Of course I'm one who can go up and down 5 to 10 lbs. easily. It's easier for me to take my pill at night before bed (around the same time) so I'm not tired during the day. the increased happiness or quality of life can give you the energy to exercise more often if needed. Paxil takes 2 to 3 weeks for it to get into your system before you know if will work for you. Sleepiness will usually go away. I felt a relief within the first day of taking it.  Not for everybody I'm sure but it put me back on track.  Good luck to everyone dealing with depression and anxiety.

I spent years reading self-help books and two years of therapy. Three weeks on Paxil after 10 years of depression and the results are astounding. Gone is the anxiety; gone is the depression. I still act and think normally. I am not brainwashed. I am not numb. This is the real me... the me before the depression started. Please, do not hesitate to take it.

No miracle cure,but nothing is. I am very happy with this treatment.

They aren't that bad. So it truly helped me off and on over 15 years. The past ten years I was on it, uncontrollable crying and self dislike started due to the fact it no longer worked. At this point I am trying to find proper meds to get me back to living. God Speed!

I liked that it worked, but didn't like the side affect of insomnia and nightmares.  When I first took it, I swear I felt it kick in right away.  The nightmares are what made me switch to celexa.  Which I like except it makes me sleepy so I can't take it during the day.  Has to be before bed.  But I can finally sleep again!!!!

Immediately after beginning with it my skin started to break out with cystic acne. No one related the Paxil to it. I now have scars everywhere:  face, arms, back, chest - everywhere. After 2 suicide attempts, my meds were changed. No more Paxil. My skin cleared up overnight! This drug is dangerous and caused me more harm than good.

Every side effect multiplied by 1000 for about 2 weeks each time I cut my dosage. Good luck! Paxil free 1 week... side effects still occuring by the way...

It's absolutley brutal. I went two days once and was twitching , and headache and delayed in reactions. It's a terrible feeling. But the good far outways the bad for me .

In the beginning it actually did relax me and I felt it really helped. Now for the last few months, all I do is sleep. I sleep on average 12 hours per day (including my 4 hour daily naps). No wonder weight gain is a side effect. Many times I just eat and sleep which was very unusual for me. Now I am thinking of getting off this medication. Always too tired, sleepy, and unmotivated to do anything.

I am what my doctor calls a lifer. I have had many bouts with depression, anxiety and panic disorders. I can honestly say that I have found the drug for me that enables me to feel normal, (if there is such a thing). No highs, no lows, not anxiety and no panic attacks. But it does have one draw back. Miss a pill and your brain will certainly let you know about it. This drug, after being on it for a long time, is very hard to withdraw from. Awful, awful side effects. I don't like having to rely on medication to function normally, but I am thankful that it works for me. I get a little nervous knowing what I will go through if my pharmacist runs out of it and I have to wait a day before taking my dose which is 20mgs. I put my perscription renewal request in 4 days prior so that scenario doesn't come to play. Lots of luck to all of you who suffer from an anxiety disorder. I know, it's awful.

I was considering to stop it by the end of the year but after reviews I'm really afraid.....I think I'll just stay with a good thing. As far as side effects, I think if your on different meds you would feel  mix emotions...I gain weight but I can't blame paxil, it was my eating habits that were to blame! I have taken complete control lost 71 lbs. and feeling great! I wish all of you on paxil a happy tomorrow...

I feel normal and it really addressed my anger issues. WARNING: DONT TRY TO GO COLD TURKEY IF YOU DECIDE TO GET OFF OF IT!. My scrip ran out while I was away and was off of it for about four days. I got the &quot;jolts&quot;! Basically, I would get a flash of an electrical sensation through my arms legs and mouth. This would happen randomly. It was freaky. As soon as I got back on them, I was fine.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/11/2008 1:30:18 PM	I've only been using Paxil for 2 weeks to help severe depression caused by Interferon treatment. It's been like a miracle. Once I learned to take it at night and sleep through the loopiness, I found that I don't feel sedated, and I have normal reactions to every day things, and no more suicidal crazy thoughts that come out of nowhere. The drug interactions scare me, though.

I tell everybody who is having any kind of anxiety or depression to get on this and stay on it because it WILL help! Alot of people are scared to take anything because they are scared of what others will think but what they dont realize is their body isnt getting them enough serotonin and you need a little help to get back their quality of life

After about a year, I thought that I had accepted my diagnosis and I stopped taking it.  After a few days my husband noticed I was always crying again.  So I started it up again and the crying stopped. My husband and I both see a definite improvement for me with this drug.

It was getting so bad to the point where I couldn't go out and do my daily activities such as going to the gym/guitar/school etc. I started off taking 20 mg of paxil which my father gave to me. (He's been on it for about 10 years now and he told me it really saved him after he was suffering from like symptoms) Paxil has made me feel 100% better with zero side effects so far, and hope it keeps up this way. Life is great!!!

Major Depressive Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/2/2008 7:59:53 PM	I tryed Welbutrin first which was starting to work and I noticed the 'real me' coming back only to be struck with a sever allergy to it.  The Dr. recommended I try paxil next and I noticed my anxiety lifted within the first week! The depression took a little longer but was evident it was happening.  I had just about every side effect mentioned including headache, dizzy, sweating and hot flashes but the worst was the diareha. It has gotten better but never gone away.  with all of that I still think taking this medicine is the right choice for me.  i am functioning again, I have many more days of feeling like my old self, and my husband has his wife back.  My Dr. wants to try weaning in six months time and I will try, but if i can't do it i would gladly stay on it for as long as needed because it's the difference between living and existing.  I chose life and being a part of it!Before my depression hit I had always been a happy energetic person.  The past three years of my life have been filled with stressful situations (lost job due to company closure, 3 surprise deaths of loved ones my own age and 3 major surgeries etc). I waited too long to try something because of a fear of drugs and addiction but decided I would take insulin if needed...

Everything was on complete autopilot.  I had zero drive and ambition to go out and do things.  The only good thing was my girlfriend was 2000 miles away so I really didn't mind the lack of sex drive at the time.

The slow release of it is the best ever. The other Paxil went into my system to fast and would&quot;wear off&quot;. I am so grateful to my doctor for recommending this drug. I am not level and have very few bipolar episodes. The only draw back is it does make me sleepy and it is not effective for PMS. I have to take Xanax in addition to Paxil for that tiem of month

I have stopped off and on atleast 10 times.  When I try to get off of it, I feel like I am dying and would rather die than get off.  I hate my Dr. for ever putting me on this pill.  At first I was uncomfortable not feeling and just going through the day to day with out any feeling, but then when that wore off I was left being tired all the time and having to medicate the sleepiness.  I have slept up to 3 days straight.  I could still sleep.  I have missed several days of work for trying to get off the meds.  I am even more sad and confused now.  If you can never take this medication, it is not very helpful.  I loved it and now I can't live without it.  I am severely depressed, but I can't stop taking it. It is the only medication that I can afford.

Still have some overwhelming days, but feel much stronger, emotionally, and have energy that did not exist before treatment.  The only bad side effect experienced has been unbelievable inability to control excessive sweating, that was not present before treatment.  Otherwise, would recommend discussing treatment with Paxil for depression and/or anxiety with your doctor.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	Kim, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	9/16/2008 1:40:31 PM	WARNING!!!!! I am a 45 year old female that has been on Paxil, Paroxetine for about 20 years. Although the medication caused weight gain, which to a woman is very stressful I continued to take it for my anxiety and depression. I was told many years ago by a therapist who wanted me to try a different medication that I had to wean off of the paxil. I did not notice any side affects because I immediatly started the new med and then with in a couple of weeks due to a reaction from the new med was put back onto the paxil. Long story short, I recently have tried to go off of the paxil. About 3-4 weeks ago now. Since I have weaned off, I am experiencing debilitating side affects. If it weren't for starting a new medication for a different issue that can not be mixed with Paxil, I would go back onto it. I feel awful!! My head feels woozy, and my lips are tingly. All my limbs feel numb and tingly. When I move my head, I get these weird feelings of electrical shock in my brain. I have a headache most of the time and have had extreme mood swings. I have no energy. I have been trying to find a source to get more information on this, but it has been very difficult. At no time did the doctors tell me when I went on this medication that it would make me so ill going off of it. It has been almost over a month and I still feel horrible. I just want to let all of you know who are planning to go onto it. I do not know why the doctors do not express how bad the withdrawl is. If I had known, I would have asked to try something else or taking short breaks off of it. Please be careful taking this med and take care of yourselves.

Only bad thing it does make me groggy most of the day but still to me its worth it and its not so bad that i dont want to do anything.
Other	45-54 Female 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/13/2008 5:10:12 PM	Paxil is the difference between doing things again and not. I have found it to be highly effective in combination with BuSpar, in my case. It's a wonder drug - and my happy pill!

Instead of helping me feel any better it made me incredibly drowsy during the day, turning school into a chore. It caused fatigue and an even worse melancholy; I was glad to be rid of it.

I feel absolutely no better, and if anything, I feel worse; tired, dull headache, I think I know my body, but she insists it will help.  I just wanted to know if one can take &quot;too much&quot; dosage of Paxil.  Thank you so much

It made me not feel any emotions which in turn I was lazy and didn't care about responsibilities, and lost feeling for previous passions. I believe anxiety is good for me at times now. It helps me take care of my duties in life. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	8/28/2008 12:44:53 AM	Paxil.  I had severe test anxiety in college and a doctor prescribed paxil to me.  The paxil made me feel like I had not a care in the world.  I didn't get as happy as I used to and I didn't even care to cry.  I was just living.  I didn't even care about tests anymore.  I was on paxil for about a year and tried to taper off the drug.  It was like going through de-tox.  I had absolutely no sex drive anymore.  I believe paxil has had a negative effect on me still.  I do not recommend this drug to anyone with test anxiety or panic attacks unless your condition is depression.  Keep in mind you may loose your sexual drive completely.

The Paxil CR I took after and trial and error thing doctors tried me on after I was diagnoised with Major Depression AND Generalized Anxiety 12 years ago.  Nothing else but Paxil CR worked for me.  I've always been on the highest doseage - 37.5.  You take it only ONCE A DAY.  I was SSSOOO GLAD YESTERDAY to just been told Paxil CR is back on the market.  Filling the perscription now, my pharmacy is giving me the generitc version Paxil ER.  I'm HOPING AND PREYING it works as well as the non generic name.  I'd be very upset if it doesn't.  I don't know the changes it had from being of the shelves due to medical reasons, but I hope it works on me THE SAME WAY it did before that time.  I was born with SEVERE Cerebral Palsy, so right from birth my brain is wired differently than any other.  Lets knock on wood!

It helped immediately and gave me my life back.  I have gained weight on the medication but this is normal from what I understand.  Don't increase your dosage above 20 mg (pink)  I tried 3o at my worst times and began having severe side effects including lacatation.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	ashleyme, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/8/2008 9:27:33 PM	Im a Registered Nurse and began taking Paxil about a year ago after I had dealt with several deaths in the family. I would get panic attacks at the hospital so often, that I finally got some help for it. Eventually my MD put me on Paxil and it has worked wonders for me since. Ive seen people complaining about the negative side effects of the drug, but overall in my experience I feel the benefits definately outweigh the drawbacks. Which I think is a very important thing to consider when it comes to  taking any medication. It bothers me when people gripe about the fact that they never would have gone on the drug had they known about the negative side effects. I feel that it is their responsibilty to be informed with any drug they put in their bodies. And its a major cop-out when they feign ignorance after the fact.

Before that, I was taking Lexapro 10 mg which worked very well. The only reason I decided to switch was because Lexapro was very expensive and Paxil is much cheaper. I've noticed my anxiety has also gone down significantly. The only gripe I have is that I have had a slight headache  since switching to Paxil....my sex drive also seems to have improved slightly...

My sex drive is still great but not satisfying.  But I do and still do see a difference in my moods.  I like it.  It worked this long for me so I think I will stick with it.

My temper seems worse, and my husband says I am a bit more irritable. I am very scared because I just have an &quot;unwell feeling&quot;, never had this type of thing before the paxil, I have very little energy and am usually a very high energy person any help from anyone with the same symptoms would be GREATLY appreciated!!!
Panic Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/23/2008 1:34:54 AM	I have been on Paxil for about 10 years.  It has changed my life.  I suffered from anxity since I was very young.  I was always afraid to take medication.  I finally gave in after having breast cancer and being hit by a car all around the same time.  It worked very well for me.  First I started with 10 mg and I felt very good for a while.  Then my symptoms started to return, so I went on 20 mg.  I really felt very very good for a while.  Now I am in menopause and a bad marriage and a difficult job and I am extremely depressed.   Yes, depressed on an antidepressant.  I don't know if I should raise me dose again, or switch meds, since I gained alot of weight already.  I wonder if your body metabolizes the medicine as we get older and you get used to the meds and require an increase or a change.  Does anyone know.  Any advice on what I should do? My panic attacts are about 95% gone.  I really need to do something about my depression.  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	13-18	7/22/2008 12:34:18 PM	I started Paxil CR in May and now it's the end of July. I felt relief with my anxiety not long after starting the medication. It makes me feel balanced now. I'm 18 years old, but concerned because this has affected my relationship with my boyfriend in the short time I've been on it. I want to sleep every spare time I get. I don't really feel like having sex anymore. I EAT EAT EAT. It's crazy. Everyday I'll crave ice cream or anything sweet and rich. I haven't gained weight yet, but I feel I might start to within the next few months of staying on Paxil CR. I worry about coming off of it in the future. This medicine is working for me, but I'm not happy with these side affects... I plan to stay on it for at least a year to see if my side affects subside.

I started taking the Brand Paxil and it definitely curbed repeated anxiety attacks. About a month agoI switched to the generic at the same dosage. I have noticed that I have been lethargic, lack of energy, nauseated, and have had frequent headaches since the swith to generic. I asked my doctor if I could swith back to the brand. Instead he lowered my dosage on the generic from 25mg to 12.5 mg. Has anybody else had these problems when switching from brand name to generic? If so what did you do and how is it working? I appreciate any feedback.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	cornmeal,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Female		7/18/2008 2:55:32 AM	My husband began taking the drug to help sleep at night due to the anxiety he was having.  He started out feeling very nauseated and had to come home from work, so he lessened his dose which helped with the sickness.  Later that week he seemed to be very quiet and withdrawn from me but I thought it was due to all the work he had.  He did tell me that it helped him to sleep but that he woke up feeling fuzzy.  A few days later I noticed an increase in anger, irritability and insensitivity.  He seems to not care about anything he says and is very blunt.  (He is already a little cold-hearted but never to this extreme).  He is a very laid back kind of guy, but on the meds he is just a total jerk.  I feel as though he has changed for the worse.  The only reason he doesnt see it is because he wants to continue to sleep good and does not think he is suffering from side effects.  It got so bad after he had been on it a week that he asked me to move out of the house.  I know that he does not know about the withdwalls of this medicine.  I fear that he will not listen to me and we will end up in a divorce because of Paxil.  How sad is that!!! I want my husband back to normal and I hate this medicine.

I have also made lifestyle changes (exercising, better diet, more rest, no caffeine). The only complaint that I have is that I feel as if I am in a fog most of the time. Just tired and sort of lightheaded. I guess this is better than a full blown attack. I wished a had more energy, but the fact is I stay pretty fatigued.

I began taking it because I was having anxiety attacks, as well as depression and PTSD.  The medication helped because it made me feel at ease, more relaxed, not so tense, or anxious.  The problem was during the times I forgot to take the medication or I ran out of medication I would go into uncontrollable mood swings.  When I tried to get off the medication I went into withdrawal and I ended up in the emergency room.  I am so afraid of getting back on medications because of the side affects that now I deal with the anxiety attacks as they come.

I suffered with it until I was properly diagnosed in my late 30's. Life was very difficult for a long time. After trying everything else, such as herbal remedies, vitamins, etc.. exercise, talk therapy, etc, with little success, I finally gave in and tried many different antidpressants and tranquilizers. This was not easy either. I went through alot of side effects that affected my work, personal life, everything.. but I knew I had to keep searching..because I knew that I had an imbalance that needed to be treated with the correct medicine and that I needed to see a therapist who among other things could closely monitor the drug reaction, this is very important, you must see a doctor on a regular basis and be aware of and communicate any feelings, emotions, that you have that are questionable. After much trial and error I have finally settled on paxil. I started with 15 mg. and am now up to 60 mg. (my doctor calls it a &quot;therapeutic dose&quot;). I feel better with the higher dose. It has helped with my peri-menopause symptoms,  anxiety and bipolar depression. I will take it as long as it continues working, along with continuation of exercise, proper diet, etc..which is very important because one of the side effects for me was weight gain.I would suggest trying this medication if you need to, however, if you decide to go off of it, remember, you must wean off of it very gradually and be monitored by a doctor, there are intense withdrawal symptoms that can be difficult if you don't stop properly. Remember to communicate with your doctor at all times. I wish you well.

Paxil definitely contributed to a decrease in the anxiety that I experience.  I would note however, that I also learned how to cope with anxiety through other non-medication treatment.  Medication for mental health issues should also be used in addition to therapy.  Paxil is not a cure, but an aide to help you cope.  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	6/17/2008 3:15:54 PM	paxil was not for me. i took it for about a year for anxiety and it did nothing but turn me into a zombie. i wasn't happy, i wasn't sad i was NOTHING. it did however work as a good tool to help me learn how to deal with the anxiety. even when i was on the paxil i couldn't handle a job or dealing with people. being a housewife is much better for me since i don't have to deal with people. being on the paxil i learned how to control my anxiety and i no longer call my husband at work multiple times a day.

Panic Disorder		5	5	5			6/9/2008 4:22:29 PM	I have been taking this medication for the last 5 years.  This is a life saver for me.  The only side effects is some weight gain and the sex drive is &quot;in the trash&quot;.  I have worked with my husband on the sex drive part, thanks for his understand.  When I miss a dose I wake up with the night sweats, very noticeable mood swings.  Overall this is the one for me...

I developed an anxiety disorder after decompresstion surgery on the back of my neck.  Nothing bothered me qand I rarely cried which was unusual foe me.  Bad part was increased weight of at least 40 pds and zero sex drive and ability to have an orgasm.  I am now slowly going off through drs. suppervision.  It is rough, I am very angry andd irratated.  Actually reading comments on this web sight has helped.  Paxill has been great but now I would like to try life without it. Want to see it I can loose the weight and being on 12mg I can already feel the sex drive coming back.  But on the other hand I have been crying and irritable.  I am going to go off completly and see how things go.

I see a big difference in the a.m. until I take Paxil. This week I went to a psychiatrist about family stress, and she lowered Paxil to 30 a day and added klonopin .25 2x a day. She said Paxil sometimes increases anxiety.

I have not had any side effects and it controls my bipolar wonderfully. I have never tried to stop taking it and won't until it stops working for me.

It was the only SSRI that had a clinical effect.  Am not currently experiencing side effects except if I forget to take it.  Any deviation in dosage or schedule causes severe discontinuation syndrome.  Also developed mild serotonin syndrome when escalating dose.

In addition, I have gained 10 lbs.I was switched to Paxil after having been on Prozac since the birth of my 7yr.old. Prozac was helpful but had become ineffective. I am now trying Wellbutrin XR. However, the side effects of discontinuing the Paxil ( and possibly the Prozac) have been one of the worst experiences of my life! I feel as if I have an electric current running thru my body with this &quot;echo&quot; sensation following my movements. Also, I have chills and then I will sweat excessively.It's been a nightmare!!My Dr. assures me that this is  common and will improve but, I'm on day six and these sympoms have intensified.In short,if you're thinking of beginning this drug.. DON'T,RUN!!!! Any improvement to your mood will be completely sabotaged when you try to discontinue use.

I have gone off of it 6 different times. Each time I went off Paxil, I lost the 40 lbs I had gained. However, I fell right back into depression with in 1 to 2 months. For the last 6 years, I have not messed a dose and have gained 100 lbs. My Doctor is trying to get me to change meds.  I am very scared. However, I need to do something about my weight.
Panic Disorder	25-34 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4		25-34	5/23/2008 6:59:26 AM	In the beginning I was afraid of everything in sight.  It was a nightmare going through panic disorder.  I felt like I was having a heart attack.  I have been on Paxil for years and it works wonderfully.  Without Paxil I don't know where I would be.  2 months ago I tried not to take it beacuse I was ready to try having a baby and OH MY GOD!  What a nightmare.  I got all my symptoms back.....heart palpitations, shaking, lack of sleep and appetite, angry and scared and the whole nine yards.  Overall, Paxil works for me and I am satisfied with it.  I am myself again &quot;Happy Go Lucky&quot;!  
Major Depressive Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	5/22/2008 9:52:08 PM	I loved Paxil for the first few years, it was the first anti-depressant I was put on as a teenager. When I got pregnant and decided to get off, I thought I was going to die! The &quot;zaps&quot; that eveyone talks about were so bad! The stomache aches, the head aches, it all was so similar to what I have heard herion withdrawl is like. One minute your sweating the next freezing. It was horrible. It works if you plan on staying on it forever , but I don't know how safe that is either.
Panic Disorder		4	4	3			5/21/2008 5:40:39 PM	Started taking it to control my panic attacks.  Worked well, but gained 18 pounds, despite more dieting and exercise than I've done in my life.  Am currently weaning off; withdrawal is really weird; feels like electrical shocks going thru me; dizzy; nauseated; easily irritated.  Hoping it doesn't last much longer.
Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/16/2008 11:00:31 PM	I was very happy when I started the medication.  I performed well in my job and in my social life again.  We decided we wanted a baby, so I went off of it.  Talk about withdrawl!  It was the WORST time.  What ever those &quot;zaps&quot; were that felt like an electrical current running through your body were horrible.  It took me well over a month to get &quot;weaned&quot; off the medication.  I was literally splitting a pill into fourths.  Never again.  It was not worth the withdrawl.  I have been on Lexapro since 2005 and I am pretty happy with it.  I think I may be getting too used to it; I've traded clinical depression and panic/anxiety disorder for numbness, ZERO sex drive, weight gain, and vertigo if I miss my dose time.  Oh well - I guess it's just a trade-off.

Wanted to stay in bedroom, eat, hide from the world, and kill myself. A new shrink freaked when he found I was on it. He refuses to prescribe it. He put me on LAMICTAL. I feel great. I get out of the house a lot. I want to live not die. For the first time I feel normal and happy.

Look out there see what other medication you can take for any Condition.  Paxil has so many bad side effects, that you almost need more meds. to take care of those side effects.  Take it from me please. 6years and I am still on it and will still be for 1more year until all the side effects will most likely be gone like that most likely.  It never helped, no weight gain, no sex, no happy times,  Just please if just one of you out there read this just read into everything there is to know about this drug.  Because it can kill you

Panic Disorder		1	5	1			5/6/2008 6:53:51 PM	My daughter starting using paxil when she was 10 years old. It was effective for about 2 years then she started having anxiety again and when we tried to increase the dose she was having too many side disturbing side effects. We tried to get her off paxil but we were unsuccessful.  She is 14 now and we have stopped the paxil and started her on effexor xr a couple days ago because she missed a whole quarter of school because of her anxiety. I would honestly not recommend paxil to any child with anxiety.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	PaxilBad, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/6/2008 6:09:03 PM	Paxil nearly ruined my life and my health!  Beware!  While taking it I had no short term memory -I couldn't remember something someone told me for more than 5 seconds, literally, and had to have signs in my house to remind me the last time I fed my dogs, etc. - and couldn't stay awake which cost me my job and my house.  Caused an inability to pee and intestinal bleeding and mucous colitis and significant weight loss - which could have to do with not remembering when I ate last and sleeping any time I wasn't at work.  Withdrawal took 6 weeks where I couldn't work-I was sick and dizzy and had the shakes the whole time.  I tried several times to get off and finally had to move back in with my parents for the duration of the withdrawal because I couldn't work.  I wish I had known about the side effects and how hard it would be to get off before I took it and had not allowed the doc to convince me to continue even after I begged her to take me off of it one week into treatment.  Paxil is evil.

It made me feel WORSE!! My anxiety was at its peak while I was on it. I only took it for 3-4 days and had to call it quits. There was no way I could continue taking it in hopes it would get better once my body adjusted to it. I was having panic attacks while driving in my comfort zone! No help at all...I have now been on Zoloft for several years now with awesome results.

Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	45-54	4/29/2008 2:36:07 PM	I took paxil for twelve years.  I began taking it due to depression.  Looking back, I believe that this depression was more due to a bad marriage, than a physical disorder. I was less aggressive on Paxil, but also less effective.  One doctor described it as being in a big overstuffed chair with a bowl full of M&amp;Ms.  That really is not far off.  I gained weight on Paxil and ultimately went through two divorces on Paxil.  One thing that I have read here that was very true for me was the extreme side effects of coming off of Paxil.  I attempted it several times, but was only able to do it successfully during a period where I was able to work from home over the internet and not have to show up for work daily and interact with people.  I experienced wild mood swings, nausea, excessive ear ringing, and worst of all, it was like my eye balls were connected to some sort of brain shock device.  Every time my eyes moved (you would be amazed at how often your eyes move without you even knowing it) I experienced what I can only describe as something of an electrical shock behind my eyes.  This lasted for at least three weeks and very nearly drove me to suicide ...  three long weeks of wondering if the withdrawal symptoms would ever go away. Once things settled down physically, I found that I had a fairly serious anger problem that I guess the Paxil had masked all those years.  I am working through the anger and making progress, but wonder just how different my life would have been had I been more 'present' for those twelve years.  Note that the ratings above really don't talk about the kind of side effects, and the withdrawals I have described, so the ratings  are pretty positive.  I guess the best advice I can give someone considering Paxil is that as long as you stay on it, I suppose you won't mind, but if you ever plan on re-joining the world sometime in the future, seriously consider an alternative to Paxil.

No one tells you of the horror of Paxil withdrawal, even when you wean off of it VERY gradually.  I had 3 weeks of hell, with nausea, diarrhea, nightmares, being hot and then cold, very restless, drastic mood swings, sleepless, headaches, buzzing in my ears, heart palpitations, extreme fatigue, and so much more.  There have been lawsuits against Glaxo-Smith Kline (maker of Paxil), and over 657,000 websites related to Paxil withdrawal, and its difficulty.  Please DO NOT TAKE PAXIL!!!

It has saved my life and I finally feel normal.  I'm able to cope with everyday life without feeling like i'm having a heart attack.  I am able to have normal conversations with co workers or strangers without feeling like my mouth is going to crack from being so dry.  I have tried to stop taking it several times with very bad results.  I guess I will have to take it for the rest of my life if I want to remain &quot;Normal&quot;.  Side effects: Severe withdrawal symtoms including rage and severe depression when I tried to stop taking it.  When I'm on it the only real side effect is trouble achieving orgasm, which my wife benefits from(LOL) My only concern is possibly having to take meds for the rest of my life.

It has kept me on an even scale for a while now, until my dr. suddenly refused to reill my prescription and now I'm falling apart and having thoughts of sucide, so what am I do do now?  Drug works well while you're on it, but doc knows better than to suddenly stop giving drug to patient.  Why would he chance doing that?  How can I report him?

Bipolar Depression		1	1	1			4/3/2008 8:07:39 PM	Taking Paxil was the worse experience in my life.  Stopping it was almost as bad.  It did not help at all and I hallucinated twice (this was not typical for me).  I also gained a lot of weight and walked around in a stupor, was unable to motivate and had no sex drive whatsoever.  When I quit, I was sick for two weeks.  Please don't take it unless you have no other options.  By the way, I fired the doctor who prescribed this drug without warning me of the side effects.  God bless you.

Paxil's is only 1.8% MORE effective than a PLACEBO!! NOT WORTH TAKING!

Panic Disorder	Broadway55, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/28/2008 9:59:43 AM	With having GAD and panic attacks, Ive have tried a few other SSRI's but to no avail. I started Paxil and within a week I noticed a great change! I no longer had that pit in my stomach and I just felt calm and happy! The only downside was that I gained 24 pds. I have been panic attack free for over a year and am slowly weaning off the Paxil. The only thing I notice is a wave of dizziness occasionally. I belief that the right drug is out there for everyone. It just takes time to find it.

I did not notice a marked improvement in my depressive symptoms, and it made me gain 30 pounds.  I took it for many years before I realized it really wasn't helping my depression.  I also have chronic pain from injuries suffered in a car accident in 2003.  I broke one of my ribs, my lower back/lumbar spine basically has no discs left, and I ended up having my C5-C7 discs in my neck fused, discs removed, and I now have a 5-inch titanium plate, six screws, and cadaver bone holding my neck together. Upon advice from my psychiatrist, I switched to Cymbalta, and it has done wonders to alleviate my chronic back pain as well as my depression with no sexual side effects.  I have been on Cymbalta since 2004, and I am very happy with it.

Along with the fun came bad consequences, however, when he got arrested for traffic violations and theft.

I recently passed out and had a seizure. Prior to passing out I had ringing in my ears and I felt extremely nauseous/diarea.  My roommate heard me hit the floor and I had already turned blue w/ very low BP and pulse.  I was taken to the hospital and refered to cardiologist. Tests at hospital didn't show any abnormalities.  Subsequently, the cardiologist saw me and didn't think it was a syncope problem but a seizure and that I needed to stop Paxil and refered me to a nuerologist.  I am 28 y.o. female in good health but I do smoke.  What do you think?? I have passed out before - maybe 3 or 4 times in my life - and I wasn't taking Paxil.

I was first given Seranol, then diazepam. Both of those medications made me &quot;roller coaster&quot; as the medication took effect and then wore off. Paroxetine has made all of the difference in the world! My wife says I'm more like my old self now. The only side effect I notice is the inability to maintain an erection, but the benefits far outweigh the side effect to the point that I wouldn't stop taking it. I simply cannot explain how well I feel when I take this medication!
Bipolar Depression	Sannie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	45-54	3/4/2008 5:02:57 PM	It definately has been good at lifting my depression, but that does not mean that I haven't had relapses. It seems to increase my appetite, especially for sweets and higher fat foods. I gained 10 lbs.,        2 months after taking it. I am on 30 mg.daily.  I also take 1200 mg. of lithium. I need to question my psychiatrist as to why I don't go off the paxil at the times when I am not severely depressed. I am on both medications at all times.  I have experienced hypomania at times.  The psychiatrist does not take me off paxil when this happens.  Also, the paxil has not helped my sex life.  I seem to have little or no sex drive. This has put a strain on my marriage.  My husband feels rejected by me.
Major Depressive Disorder		1	1	1			3/2/2008 9:31:28 PM	I wish i could have checked all of the above for a bunch of those criteria. This medicine does make me feel better but i am horribly addicted to this drug. As a former cocaine addict, and a former smoker, I tell you this drug is the most addictive thing I have ever put into my body. I attemped to quit this drug twice and i have violent physical reactions. I got fired from a job because I puked so much in the bathroom I passed out and was therfore neglecting my charges. I could go on, but i'll simply tell you this may help temporarily but overall my experiece has been horrifying

My doctor keeps telling me that it's &quot;not the Paxil that actually makes you gain weight, its the increase desire for carbs...but YOU have to make those choices.&quot;I am tracking everything I eat and am not succeeding

I feel normal.  I feel like myself.  Living without anxiety, panic and depression is amazing and Paxil is the only reason why I have my life back and under control.  I have gained a good 20lbs, but I'd rather be fat and happy then skinny and scared.

Initially, I had some dizziness, but it soon went away.  It worked wonders for me - more so for the anxiety, but the OCD was totally manageable.  Some wieght gain, but exercise and watching what you eat will help that and yes, your sex drive does diminish.  You have to weigh the benefits of helping your anxiety against your sex life.  It doesn't totally diminish it, just makes it hard to orgasm.  Have patience.  :)  The only big side effect I had was I was sleepy alot.  I never took naps before, but suddenly did.  Not a bad thing, but I talked to my doctor (who I trust completely) and he put me on Paxil CR 20mg.  That did it.  It's been a year and now I am trying to ween off it.  2 weeks of Paxil CR 12.5 mg just ended and now I am doing Paxil CR 12.5 every other day for 2 weeks.  Right now is the only time I've truly felt the effects of weening - a little dizziness, unfocused a bit.  No nightmares, but vivd dreams make me tired in the morning.  I feel a bit of my anxiety reurning, but manageable.  The best is that my sexdrive is returning and my motivation.  It's weird to feel the rush of emotions coming back.  I hope the side effects of weening end, I'm hopeful.  Bttom line - I'm very glad I took Paxil because it gave me my life back.

I was calm and the stress just completely went away. One side effect though-my sex drive went through the roof. I felt like a teenager and couldn't get enough sex. My wife didn't complain either, since I could last for literal hours. After about 7 years, my body chemistry must have changed and I started to lose energy, so I switched to Zoloft. The sex drive issue settled down after about 6 months.
Major Depressive Disorder	Dixie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	2/9/2008 9:37:19 AM	Can't remember how long I have been on it but my last 2 visits to the dr...he wants me to go off it.....at first I didn't think I could but the one side effect gaining weight has put on at least 50#'s and it really annoys my husband!? So one day I decided I should follow my dr's advise and wean myself off. Its been about 2 wks now. First I lost my job and I almost lost my husband....but I am feeling much better thanks goodness! I cry a lot again like I did before but its subsiding and I've always been emotional!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	2/8/2008 4:33:13 PM	Paxil was prescribed to me after a series of panic attacks that really freaked me out one summer.  I would have these episodes where I had chest tightness, shallow breathing, and major clostrophobia in certain situations.  I couldn't cry during these episodes too, which was really weird.  The worst episodes were in the car, strangely.  After starting on the drug I have come to find out that I was perhaps experiencing depression too, because my overall outlook is worlds better than before.  A bit of weight gain and loss in sex drive is worth not having those scary panic attacks.  Your body eventually adjusts to having the drug in your system and you can adjust your diet accordingly to maintain or lose weight, if you try. Of course you should not drink when you are taking this drug, but if you do, be ready for some of the panic to creep back the next day.  Talk to you doc about supplying you with a fast-acting backup - you might need it in a pinch
Panic Disorder	Lulu, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	2/8/2008 1:26:46 PM	Paxil did work for me. It did get rid of my panic attacks. Had I known of the side effects, I probably would not have taken it. It is a horrible drug to get off of. After 10 years of being on it, I have a significant problem with my weight and no sex drive. I am now into finishing my 3rd week of weening off. I have 3 more weeks of cutting down. I cut back from 20 ml to 15ml for two weeks then another cutback to 10ml for two weeks then finally 5ml for the final two weeks. Talk to your Doctor at length before you begin this drug. Make sure you get your doctors advice when going off.
Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	2/6/2008 9:12:10 AM	I have been on paxil for 8 days and I am in a constant state of panic. I have been to the ER three times in five days from severe panic attacks including chest pain. I don't know if it is because the medication is making me nervous and panicky or if it is all just because of my panic attacks. I am going to the doctor again to get a second opinion on whether I should remain on Paxil, or try another medication. It's just good to know I am not alone.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	2/2/2008 10:31:16 PM	I started on a dose of 20mg. The Dr. started me out with a small dose to see how I did with it. It worked well, but it was a bit much for me. I found myself getting lethargic so I stopped taking it. Big mistake. If you read the other reviews, most people feel really bad after stopping abruptly. I felt depression set in and it was aweful. The professionals say get off the drug slowly. I cringed when I read a prior reviewer's statement that they slowly weened themselves off 40mg over a period of two weeks! Only two weeks? May as well have done it cold turkey. I am no Doctor or Pharamacist, but trust me when I say you'll need at least 8 weeks - maybe more if you're on a high strength. Needless to say, I am now only taking 10mg. It is right for me and I couldn't be happier. It does bring some people's lives back!

It was pretty new on the market when I tried it.  At that point, it was the alternative to prozac which was always in the news.  I didn't want any part of that!  I've had excellent results with this  medication.  It gave me life!  I was a mess before starting (depressed and anxious) and had been that way for about 12 years, but within 2 weeks I started to feel &quot;normal&quot;.   I was concerned about being on the medication when I got pregnant for my second son, but he is 4 years old and completely normal.  I had tried to go off the medication a few years prior to my pregnancy and I also experienced withdrawal type symptoms.  I was decreasing the amount I was taking over a few weeks.  I reached a certain point and it was not possible to go any further.  I don't mind taking it because it allows me to be &quot;normal&quot;.  It would be nice not to have to depend on it, but it beats the alternative.  I just pray they never stop manufacturing it! Just like a diabetic that takes insulin to live, I take Paxil to live.  I don't think we should feel bad about that.  If a diabetic stops their insulin, they will have serious problems.  The same is true for us. I think we should be glad that we have medications available to us.  Sure it would be nice not to take them, but sometimes that's not possible.

We plan to have a baby sometime and will cross that bridge when I get to it. Paxil has saved me from myself
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/21/2008 2:09:23 PM	Was prescribed PaxilCR 25mg. four years ago, and it has worked great. I am very centered, and my moods aren't all over the place. Doctor has stated several times that should I decide to stop taking this medication, a person needs to be weaned off of it, over a long period of time, to avoid withdrawal. I had nausea the first couple of weeks after starting this medication, but otherwise, NO problems. 
Major Depressive Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	1/19/2008 3:00:34 PM	Paxil does work, but after 3 years I decided to quit. I had gain close to 40 pounds (dieted and excersised but the weight kept coming) and decided I had to do something. Paxil has terrible withdrawl syndroms, anyone who has taken it will agree. It took me 2 weeks to come off it. I went very slowly, reducing my doseage a little bit each day. I was on 40mg when I quit. I can't stress enough to anyone who wants to quit, GO SLOWLY!!!, or you'll end up in the ER. 
Panic Disorder	no more paxil for me, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/19/2008 12:49:46 AM	I was put on the drug in 2005 for nervous breakdown due to stress, and anxiety. The medicine made me feel &quot;crazy&quot;, constant yawning, and I would grit my teeth all of the time, not to mention that the medicine would overload in my system and cause me trips to the ER thinking I was dying only to find out that I had developed a panic disorder while on the medication. I had to constantly change the dosage I was taking to regulate it in my system and while on the medication I showed no emotion about anything regardless how serious it was. We decided to start trying for a baby and I had to wean myself off of the medicine, I had severe panic attacks, horrible nighmares and irritability, hell I was down right unstable with my moods. It took awhile for it to come out of my system. The HUGE thing not all doctors tell you is that you can have withdrawl symptoms off and on for up to 2 years after stopping this medication. I would not recommend this to anyone. I still have the anxiety and panic disorder but am dealing with it on my own. This is sooooo much better that the medicine. Good luck if you do try it but I for one would not encourage it at all.

Paxil has worked faily well.

I then was informed by a nurse freind that Paxil Cr was one of the most dangerous drugs to stop &quot;cold turkey&quot;. I went back on it and felt( Better) &quot;normal&quot; within a few days. I hate being on this drug. It has me feeling like i am on Crack or Meth or Heroin. It has me. Help   
Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	1/16/2008 11:30:11 PM	Due to warnings about paxil and pregnancy, i have tried to ween myself off of paxil. if i do not take it for 3 or more days, i feel drunk, cannot concentrate, cannot walk straight , and overall cannot function. this drug should not be taken due to it being habit forming, unless you want to be addicted to it for the rest of your life. it is very effective for panic disorder and the makers claim it is not habit forming... IT IS!!!!  i have taken it for 7 years and i cannot live without it now. i wish there was something else i could have taken that was not habit forming. the makers claim it is not habit forming, but i have withdrawals and cannot function without it. what do you call that?! without it i dont have panic attacks, but without it i cant function!

Other	lac, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/12/2008 10:33:38 PM	 started on this drug because of my moods. Those around me noticed a difference in my general attitude and well-being. I used this throughout my pregnancy without any adverse effects. My doctor informed me it was better to take the drug if it was necessary for depression than to risk untreated depression's side-effects. I gave birth to a heathly, beautiful daughter, who is extremely intelligent.

The side effects at first bad, headaches, upset stomach.  They have gone away and I am now feeling a lot better.  The welbturin made me feel more depressed.  Notice want to eat more, just have to be more careful and watch your calorie intake while taking this drug to not gain the weight.

Have been on and off since.  Works very well for IBS and panic disorder.  My only problem now is the 40lb weight gain. Yes, it is an adjustment going on and off the meds, be patient and keep in touch with your doctor.  Not all meds work the same in all people, if this doesn't work, try another antidepressant.  Just don't give up:)

Major Depressive Disorder		1	4	1			1/1/2008 11:35:56 PM	Absolute nightmare. Worst drug ever (I've tried 10+). Became increasingly more depressed as dose increased to theraputic level. Side effects included night sweats, horrible nightmares, dizziness, shakiness, headaches... the list goes on. Withdrawal was horrific (had to stop working, driving), but paled in comparison to being on medication itself... at least then I knew it was going to be over soon.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	12/27/2007 10:32:23 PM	Used Paxil for treatment of generalized anxiety for several years.  Very pleased with the effect on anxiety and overall mood, but completely eliminated my desire for sex so I recently stopped.  Side effects from stopping treatment were terrible.  Talk to your doctor before stopping treatment and be prepared for about a week of hell (dizziness, nausea, vomiting, irritability).  I'd like to keep taking it, but I'd like to get pregnant again!  Also, definitely can't take it if you are or plan to get pregnant.  I had one miscarriage early in treatment that I attribute to Paxil.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	12/21/2007 7:53:26 PM	I have been taking Paxil CR for over a year now.  It worked well at first, but the past few months it just stopped working the way it was.  I had to change medications and when I stopped taking it I had severe drug withdrawls for a month, and I'm still experiencing it.  My doctor just told me that PAXIL CR is the hardest medication to stop because of the severe withdrawls (i.e. fainting, nausea, shaking, headaches).

My wife was going to divorce me because of my behavior.  It wasn't till she found a web site with other people having the same problem that I believed her.  Since I've gone off the drug I am back to my happy go lucky self and we never fight.  Be careful you don't know this is happening to you.  You believe your right no matter what. This is a side effect that they really don't talk about.

Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	12/11/2007 10:59:12 PM	The Paxil worked alright for me, but not well.  After about a year of tinkering w/ the dose my doc and I decided to try something else (pretty common experience w/ depression).  I've been on 4 different antidepressants in the past decade and have NEVER had the awful experience I had with Paxil once we decided to stop it.  For weeks I was dizzy (to the point where I could not drive and sometimes even had trouble walking), confused, fuzzy; I felt like I had the flu for a week, as well, but without the vomitting.  I also experienced something like &quot;rebound depression&quot; and, had I not been so physically exhausted, would have had potential suicide risk.  It was really, really bad...Ultimately, my doctor decided to put me back to the initial levels and tapered me down much more slowly, over a few months.  I'd been on 30 mg/day, so we did 2 weeks of 25 mg, 2 weeks of 20 mg, 2 weeks of 15 mg...it seemed to take forever, and I was dizzy and &quot;foggy&quot; the whole time, but at least I was safe.For me, Paxil was SUCH a bad experience, not because it never worked particularly well (as I well know, most antidepressants don't seem to work on most people), but because the trial-and-error involved in treating depression led to such a low point.  Imipramine, Wellbutrin, and Effexor (the one that ultimately worked for me and which I've been on for 5 years now) had nothing like this.  I have heard similar stories from friends and I know that there are lawsuits pending against the manufacturers of Paxil...just google it, there are horror stories galore.  On the other hand, though, I know it can really help some people, too.  I would just be very aware of how you're reacting to the medication when changing doses and be very communicative with your doctor.  Good luck!

The withdrawal for it is horrible...vertigo for weeks afterwards, insomnia, feeling sick all the time.  The worst was the nightmares.  When I was finally able to sleep a little, I would dream of hurting and killing things, wake up in sweat and not realize if it was real or fake.  I would never take this drug again.

It was way too expensive, so I switched to this... right before the switch, my job was so horrible I would have anxiety and IBS all the time... the paxil worked really well... the only problems I've had with it is when I ran out of my prescription for the weekend and my dr.'s office couldn't call it in until the weekend was over... I have really bad vertigo and nightmares, waking up at least 15 times a night... I was also extremely horny, which means it must decrease my sex drive normally... I may check out about going back to zoloft, but not looking forward to the withdrawal symptoms...

Well, I was always tired, and felt sick to my stomach that I didnt want to eat! I did work out and it was so embarrasing because I sweated sooo much.  It was embarrasing. I would be sweating while walking in the mall!  Trust me, that isn't very attractive, lol.  I was pretty bitcy on it, noticed that I was becoming &quot;outgoing&quot; and &quot;speaking my mind&quot; but I was quite verbal in a negative way. Tried to achieve orgasm was IMPOSSIBLE. So, with me being a sexual person, I am getting off the Paxil and my doc will put me on Lexapro. He says if that doesn't work, he'll put me on Wellbutrin. I think when people gain weight on antidepressents it because they start feeling good again and if you associate with feeling good by eating, well, heck yah you are going to gain a ton of weight. Especially carbs - cards is the feel good food. Paxil made me not hungry at all. I just like sex more than not being hungry, lol. And being all sweaty, well, that has to go to.  Also, on Paxil CR, my teeth would chatter. WEIRD?  Also, I am known as a bitchy person before Paxil and the Paxil did nothing to change that part, if anything, it aggravated me more.

I had been on Celexa (great med) for many years but had developed a tolerance. Therefore my doctor  perscriped Paxil which caused my anxiety to get very intense plus I would shake and be befuddled.  Enough is enough, I am as we speak quitting, cold turkey.  So far, nauseousness, headache, dizziness, sleepiness.  Lets hope I don't go crazy.

I can be around people and large crowds without going into panic mode. But I am hearing some similar things about this pill from different people I speak too. It is actually kind of scareing me.

I felt for the first few years that it was helping although my husband tells me now that it wasn't helping as much as I thought.  I found out that there is an average weight gain of 20 lbs. a year- which I absolutely gained. I didn't have too many problems going off the drug but it might be because I took my doctor's advice and took a week off work.  I did want to sleep a lot.  I had minor stomach upsets, body aches and headache.  A friend who had only been on it for 2 months had much more severe reactions- the same as mine but more severe and vomiting.  My new doctor thinks it should be off the market.  Knowing what I know now, and that there are other drugs that are likely just as effective without the side effects- I agree with him.

My dreams are extremely vivid.  Every time I try to get off the drug my parents say, &quot;you need it&quot; and I listen and take it anyway.  But I probably should switch because my depression is like a pimple waiting to pop...ready to explode.  I have taken the drug since I was THIRTEEN and now I'm TWENTY TWO.  I read about alcohol cravings people were having and mine sometimes gets that way but WebMD doesn't have anything on the subject when you search for it, maybe they're having a few too many lunches with the medicine pushing lobbyist jerks.

It was very hard to come off Paxil. Lots of dizziness, numbness of my face, confusion, and spaciness. It wasn't fun, especially when I was pregnant. My doctor put me on Zoloft which was very easy to come off. Mid way through my pregnancy I decided to be medfree. I was off of all Meds until my child turned one. Now I'm on Lexapro which works great and my doctor said that it should be easy to come off of when I decide to quit taking it.

It is important not to immediately stop taking the medication. I had a lapse in my persecriptions for 3 days and the withdrawl side-effects required me to stay home from work.

This medication was extremely helpful.  I was very happy with the drug. I felt my anxiety slipping away, along with my dark thoughts as I reached my third week.  I was also impressed on how I felt when I went into public!!  There was a big difference on how I felt and what I thought.  I no longer cared if people were talking about me.  I did not even give that a real thought.  The two side effects it had for me was a stepping down of sexual desire and activity.  The first month the mediacation actually imrpoved my sexual experiences.  That declined after that.  I have recently found out though that your Dr. will prescribe Viagra for that purpose. The second was a &quot;couch potato&quot; effect.  My spare time was spent laying around on the couch.  I did not care for this, but I was enjoying the peace in my thoughts.  The were no longer depressing or anxious. I was not compulsive nor obsessive about my home, job, or life in general.  It really helped me by far.  I have since stopped using the mediacation.  It has been over a year.  I am soon going back on it.  I do not like using any medication for too long.  I will not become an addict to the euphoria I experienced, but the oliday season and winter are coming soon and I like how this works for me during those times. 
Disorder characterized by Stiff, Tender &amp;amp; Painful Muscles	Carol, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	10/14/2007 1:49:53 AM	I started this drug approx. 10 yrs. ago for fibromyalgia, anxiety &amp; depression when I had a very stressful job. Since I retired and don't have the same stress, I feel that the Paxil actually makes me sleepy,depressed and &quot;drugged&quot; feeling. So I decided to discontinue it.  However, I've had extreme difficulty doing so. After 6 wks off of it, my fibromyalgia has returned, I have rapid heart beat, elevated BP &amp; I get easily angered and upset. At times I almost feel psychotic! I had been told by many people that getting off this medication was very difficult and they were right.

I wanted to 'fight' everyone who talked to me! It caused me great distress knowing what it was doing to me and causing me to talk nasty and making me a horrible person. I stopped taking it and felt much better. I was rx'd a diff drug with much better results.

I lost 10 pounds within a month. I took it 4 years and stopped. I am now back on it as the panic attacks and anxiety were back. It's really helped me stay grounded while under therapy and learning to cope.

Discuss with your doctor.  I once decided just to stop and after two days became very depressed and suicidal.  Scary.

This medication saved me. I had gone into a state of depression and severe panic due to lack of finding any relief before I found paxil. The only down side is weight gain. I put on about 20 lbs for no reason and am generally slim.

If I hadn't started taking it over 11 years ago, I believe that I wouldn't be here now. I am so amazed that something so tiny could do so much.

Now I take 40mg at night and 30mg in the morning. I still do not feel like it is working, but I have only been on it for 2 months. Side effect wise, I have been experiencing extreme day-time drowsyness.

I've been breaking my back to work off the weight but it is very stubborn and won't come off unless I reduce or stop the medication; which also has it's side effects.  I wish SK would introduce &quot;Paxil Light&quot; so that some of us that use this medication can stay relative slim.

Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction		3	5	4			9/28/2007 11:59:50 AM	I started on paxil in `01 and had only minimal problems like not being able to pee when on 40mg. I now take 10 mg a day and I am doing fine, but I still need a boost to get out in life.
Major Depressive Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/22/2007 10:22:10 AM	This medicain really worked, but after about 3 days I had a seizer, I quit taking it. On the 3rd day I was having involuntary muscle spasms when I went to bed that night, similer to the &quot;falling&quot; feeling when most people get when they first gp to sleepI was fully awake when these spasms started. A few hours later (about 3 or 4) I had a seizer. So if these muscle spasms start,seek medical attention. This could be a sign of an onset for a seizer.

However, it is *very* difficult to withdraw from and I am still on it after 6 years.  I think withdrawal should be done under the care and watchful eye of a physician who specializes in withdrawing medications.

It has eliminated my depression. I still have occasional episodes of anxiety. Sexual drive has been somewhat decreased as well.
