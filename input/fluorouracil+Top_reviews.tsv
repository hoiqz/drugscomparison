Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	25-34	8/8/2012 1:14:00 AM	Severe headaches 25 minutes after applying product to entire face. Pain cause lack of attention and sense of dizziness. It took 5 to 6 hours for headaches to cease.Rx was for application of Efudex twice a day for 5 weeks. Rx was revised to include and immediate halt to application due to complaints. Nurse insisted I could not be experiencing symptoms as the treatment is topical and not systemic, though the literature does very clearly indicate treatment can be systemic with topical application. Doctor did not follow up, so I am unable to give his assessment of my experience.

Scaling and burning of the areas being treated is occuring. The treatment seems to be working based on other experiences I have read about.  
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	gemini, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female		2/17/2012 10:01:23 AM	Prescribed for  2 red patches of suspected keratosis on end of nose (couldn't be in a worse or more obvious place). Applied twice a day for 10 days, then 10 days off before starting a second 10 day twice a day application treatment.  Can't see any difference yet but seeing the specialist in one month's time for analysis. Going to Spain next week and worried about how to protect nose if sun comes out.
Roughened Red Patches of Skin due to Sun Exposure	TDL, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	1/21/2012 6:50:34 PM	I'm in week three (two of fluorouracil, now Prutect to moisten and heal).  It's as everyone described, but not as bad.  It's slightly itchy and I can't wait until I can wash my face again without pain, but totally bearable.  I've been in numerous social situations (work, dinner out, board meetings, shopping, new Pilates class) without problem.  I was afraid children would scream and run at a glimpse of my fact.  Never happened.  So don't let the minor downsides keep you from doing this, if you need it.
Roughened Red Patches of Skin due to Sun Exposure	Dan, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	1/14/2012 11:26:47 AM	Used 3 times over past year over various parts of scalp and face. Dose twice daily for 21 days. Week one there is very little impact. The effects escalate rapidly beginning day 11. Redness and blistering becomes noticeable. The pain peaks by day 13 and remains high until around day 17. Over the counter pain relief helps. Pain on the cheek area is the worst. Itchiness starts around day 17 (scalp is the worst) as does the scaling. Skin begins to clear up around day 18. Continued application over healing skin doesn't cause new inflammation; however, I believe that some areas take longer for treatment to be effective so I've always done the full 21 days.
Carcinoma In Situ of the Glans Penis	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	65-74	1/6/2012 11:30:00 AM	I had to discontinue after 10 days, as the my scrotum had swollen as was oozing some clear material right through the sac.

It has not been painful for me other than a sting here or there.

I am using it on my chest.  I look like a battle field with a map of bloody veins all over my middle chest and hallow of my neck.  I feel like pins and needles at all times, burning and itching too.  I have not slept in two weeks.  This is my first day after my two week time of applying the cream, I am hoping the pain stops, I am so dry and cracking in that area if I move too much it will bleed.  I wish my doctor had given me more information about what was going to happen and what I can do to help myself.  I am miserable.  I don't know if I am supposed to expose it or cover it up.  I wear turtle necks to work so I don't scare anybody. I still have sudden waves of pain in the area. I wish I could find more information about what you are supposed to do while you are on this treatment.

Some discomfort from itching and looks like the arm has exploded with blotches and scabs. 1 more week and then I'm stopping for awhile to evaluate results.  Suggest using in cool weather rather than spring &amp; summer.  Hoping results are worth the discomfort. 
Roughened Red Patches of Skin due to Sun Exposure	glassman, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	65-74	3/15/2011 2:38:19 PM	What were almost invisible ak are now obvious red spots.  Stopped after 4-5 days of visiable sores,  They healed and went to other locations on the face.  Too long a process but seems to be working.  The biggest side effect is trying to explain to others than the appearance is due to treatment and not catching.
Roughened Red Patches of Skin due to Sun Exposure	NeverAgainWith5FU, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	45-54	1/12/2011 12:48:25 PM	I was told to use 5FU cream on my arms, hands and fingers for 5 weeks, twice daily. Areas affected proved to be larger than I expected. It is unsightly and much more painful than I was expecting. In week 6 now, stopped treatment last week. Arms are very sore, it's difficult to think of anything else. Just a constant burning. Certain areas became so raw as to bleed, and I d/c'd the cream in those areas. Constant moisturizing, several times a day is a requirement. As someone said, &quot;5FU treatment is not hell, but you can see hell from here.&quot; Unless you have done it you just won't get it. Is it effective? I guess time will tell. But if someone is thinking of inventing an alternative therapy, I would say you have a wide-open marketplace.
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	Lyn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	10/17/2010 6:52:17 PM	My dad is the one taking Fluorouracil 5% and it helps to read all reviews.  He's 1 1/2 weeks into treatment and he is extremely red, purple, blotchy, swollen with both raw areas and scabs.  He is sleeping a lot and I read one other comment about someone sleeping a lot although this is not one of the listed side effects.  Too early to tell effectiveness or satisfaction.  It's very troubling to see someone borderline disformed from the side effect of this medicine.  The dermatologist and prescription info advise not to discontinue use, but with such considerable discoloration, open sores and scabs it's very scrary to continue use that will cause even further discoloration, scabing and sores.  My dad's face is almost black in certain areas.  Praying that this medicine is working and that he will fully heal before long.  He's supposed to take it thru early November.  Will re-review at that time.

The area healed very quickly after the applications were discontinued and left new, soft, baby pink skin and if it didn't make me look so bad during treatment, I'd use it on my whole face.  I found it to be very effective and I've had no recurrence of the Squamous on my lip!

The process is very effective.My face is showing much more damage than I anticipated. Seven more days and I will stop and allow for the healing.My face looks horrible with very little irritation. More iching than discomfort.
Other	Judith, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/12/2010 10:49:35 AM	I have used Efudex in the past. It worked well, though with discomfort and unsightlyness. Since, I have used flourouracil, but after 4 days and major pain, redness, and itching, my dermatologist said that I was having an alergic reaction. Then he put me on Curac, which gave me a severe reaction after only 2 days. Now I am on Aldara, 3x a week for a month for actinic keratosis. I'm not sure what all of this means or if I should be worried or not. My brother (52) died of melanoma 5 years ago.

I had a malignant squamous cell cancer on my hand surgically rremoved 2 yrs ago and was concerned re lots of brown spots sprouting up on my face.  I used the topical on a few spots and realized that I needed to use it all over my face,  i had the redness and and scabbing. my skin feels tight and dry, using ice packs helps.  I accedently got some on eyelid, not a good idea, it became inflamed.  but I am looking forward to clear healthy skin.   I drive a convertable so I'll be using lots of sun screen and a hat.

First week my face just became red and blotchy. The second week it became irritated and sore. First week after treatmentmy face became like a bad sunburn on all the red spots. Second week it all peeled off and soon became very clear.The treatment is much like nitrogen treatment. A little uncomfortable and you look bad for awhile but worth it.  My face had allot of scale but I had no idea there was as much damage until the meds made it red. Im glad I did it but do it in the  cool time of the year,  the cream is like a 80 sun screen.

You look like and feel like a burn victim during the use time.  Some recommened doing one part of the face at a time versus all the affected areas.  Get it over with is my recommnedation.  It may hurt but the hurt is over versus the extended treatment plan.

My dermatologist prescribed the 5FU treatment.  After a week, it was apparent that the damage was far more widespread than I originally thought.  After two weeks, I had the typical splotchy, red, and crusty patches, and we discontinued treatment after 3 weeks.  This treatment is not very attractive, but it needed to be done, and after a few weeks it is healing well.  I plan to limit my future exposure to the sun and hope not to have to repeat the procedure in the near future.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with the 5FU treatment.

Imagine putting your head in a fire ant nest and you will come close to feelings I've experienced.  At times I've been unable to function; driving I've even had to pull over and stop.  I could go on, but this is enough for you to get the impression.I'm sure it performs its intended function, but that needs to be on someone besides me!
