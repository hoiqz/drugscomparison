High Blood Pressure	Happy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	65-74	8/22/2012 8:31:10 PM	Taking 10mg 1 week and was fatigued, no energy.  Inner right ear and throat felt tender, almost like I was getting an earache.  Lower back ached and tingling occastionally on my outer arms.  I started taking 1/2 (5gm) on my own and symptoms eased somewhat.  This med makes me feel a little uplifted emotionally for some reason.  Anyone else have this symptom.  I take very little meds so I know it has to be from lisinopril.  I'll have to wait and see if things get better. I'll see my Dr. in two weeks and will know more then.

I have been getting severe allergy problems and went to see an allergist..I was tested for everything under the sun and came up negative to everything! He diagnosed me with non-allergic rhinitis due to lisinopril which is an ACE inhibotor. My doctor switched me to Diovan HCT and hopefully I will be better. My allergies are already starting to get better and I have only been on the diovan for 5 days.

Not a large dose to help lower my BP. At first everything was fine . It lowered my BP to the 115/75 range. Then the itchy skin and tickling cough started.  Stayed on the med and thought I just needed to adjust  and it would get better.I know 2 friends that take this drug with no problems.I started feeling very nervous and anxious all the time. Bad dreams and insomia. Stopped taking drug and feel much better. But my BP started to go back up. Trying new med losartan. Hopefully it will be better.

Medication has redued BP (127 / 82) but experiencing side effects.  Dry cough, fatigue, back pain, and depression.  I am exhausted at the end of the work day.  No interest in outside activities.  Sex drive is non-existent. There must be something better to treat my BP.

I also have trouble swallowing. I believe this drug should be taken off the market or wouldn't be suprised if the FDA takes it off the market some time soon. I think the Family Medicine MDs and DOs are in denial on this drug. It works but the side effects seriously outweight the benefits. I have been off it for a month now and the side effects seem to get worse. Data have read says it could take years for the side effects to go away.

I also take clonidine twice a day.  I do a lot of coughing and sometimes I have severe leg and foot cramps.  Sometimes even the muscles in my lower arms start cramping up.  This is very painful.  I asked my Doctor about the medication.  I wanted to know if it was causing it.  She said &quot;No way.&quot;,  so I'm still coughing my head off, but I found that taking magnesium 250mg twice a day has improved the cramping a lot.  Not gone, but helped.  I will tell my Doctor on my next appoinment.  I have thought about just stop taking the lisinopril.  I might have to.

I have been on it for several years, but my Dr &amp; I need to chat about this as I cannot continue to feel like I am going to pass out when my BP 'bottoms out' like it has been doing!

No longer taking plavix.  Cholestorel dropped from 240 to 140, other numbers improved considerably.  No adverse side effects noticed from any of these drugs.  I believe that moderate consitent exercise and improved diet can counteract negative effects of these drugs.Also, positive mental outlook does not hurt.

My blood pressure was 132/83.  I have never had blood pressure issues before.  My doctor decided that I needed some medication so he put me on the Lisinopril 20mg/ once a day.  I also have ALS which effects my bulbar region (diagnosed in March 2012).  I see a neurologist for this.  I was concerned about the med. but began taking it 2 weeks ago.  First week I felt find, but this second week I am absolutely exhausted and have been having slight migrains.  I believe this exhaustion is due to the blood pressure medication and not the ALS.  After reading what the other people are saying about this drug I have great concerns.  I do not need to be exhausted due to medication because I am trying to live my life as full as possible due to the ALS.

The left leg hurt so bad behind my knee that I could not walk on it. My legs even hurt while I was laying down. After about 2 months I stoped taking the drug and a few days later my legs stoped hurting. My husband took this drug for a couple of years and almost cried his legs hurt so bad. We never knew the drug had this side effects untill after he died. I figured out what was causing my legs to hurt after I started taking this medcine. A friend of mine told me her legs had hurt for year or two and I told her my experience with this medcine she ask the doctor to take her off of it. He did and her legs got 95 percent better. This medcine will cause a big knot behind the knee also. This should be listed on the side effects but it is not. Doctors sometime will not beleive a person when they tell them about this medcine causing the legs to hurt. So far 3-4 people that I know of has proved it. Watch out for this side effect. You will hurt really bad in your legs.

My whole body is affected by this drug, as I don't feel well in the first few hours of taking it.
Other	intridan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	55-64	5/31/2012 5:24:14 PM	I found that Lisinopril helped my condition while being treated for my diastolic blood problem and edema, but I got the worst allergic reaction that caused me to have large hives and my arm to blister and peel while feeling like a chemical burn. I also had experiences with light-headness. I always had some edema though.

Also had diahrrea and headaches.  Headaches stopped immediately after stopping.  Diahrrea is still a problem.  Cough is finally improving after 6 weeks.

They got worse over time instead of better so I had a hard time telling what was causing my issues.    I felt completely run down all the time, weak, fatigued, no energy at all.  I originally started taking 10mg tabs and the side effects were bad but I thought I could live with them.  Then my BP went back up and I started taking 20mg tabs.  I literally thought I was going to die from the side effects.  Most days I did not even want to get out of bed, let alone got to work.   Within 3 days of stopping I felt better than I have in the past 2 years

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	45-54	5/21/2012 10:35:09 PM	i started takin this drug approximately six months--my blood pressure has reduced, but the side effects are disturbing. I am on 20mg pills x1 daily. I usually take in the evening. I have been experiencing the cough, that hurts and now have mucus. There was pain in my neck and arms.  I have also experienced severe leg twitches/jolts while I am lying down in bed. It lasts for an hour or so. I also began to notice joint pain in my ankle---all of this on my left side of body.  Most recently having heart palpitations and anxiety at night.  The fatigue is too much.  I need to lose about 30lbs and reduce personal stress. I do not want to continue on these meds and will be speaking with my physician. I am an African American female in her late 40's. I used to be more active up till the past four years. I am soooo tired now, I don't feel much like doing anything. This website has helped me put things in perspective after also reviewing the side effects in the pharmacy pamphlet. thanks.

I racked up so many medical bills I was worst off on this medication than I was without it.

Ive copy this from wikipedia on how the drug is made.An ACE inhibitor (or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor) is a pharmaceutical drug used primarily for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and congestive heart failure.Originally synthesized from compounds found in pit viper venom, ACE inhibitors inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (a component of the blood pressure-regulating renin-angiotensin system), thereby decreasing the tension of blood vessels and blood volume, thus lowering blood pressure.Frequently prescribed ACE inhibitors include captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and ramiprilwhy would i want to take anything made from snake venom, however this explains the side effects.  They need to take this drug off the market.

In all these years I have been treated for asthma (nebulizer and inhalers), constant phlegm production with bad cough and joint pains. I never knew that a side effect was coughing until recently when my mother had been prescribed same med. and it made her cough alot she was then changed to a diff med...I took her advice and quit taking it and almost overnight my coughing and wheezing just quit and I don't spit up phlegm anymore! Wow after all these years and my doctor never knew the side effects were causing my misery..I feel so much better now, I am now taking Losartan.

[exhaustion,aches,hair loss, overheating, shortness of breath on exertion,depression, cough, malaise]  I took it for 2 months.  I lost 4 pounds in a few days and started craving salty foods. At first I was just more tired and  couldn't sleep but 4 hours and started aching, my back begin to hurt after a little activity. I was becoming more exhausted and walking 2 blocks had me out of breath and boiling hot and it took 2 hours to cool down. I could not stand the heat outside [80 degrees] it didn't bother me before. I got a dry cough. I had to sit in a program for 2 days and after just 1 1/2 hours my back was killing me so I had to take 4 ibuprofen to stand it. I came home so exhausted I went to bed. I slept most of the next day and night next day and felt like I had the flu my BP was 133 over 69 pulse 77 my pulse generally was 60 so I took half a pill and felt better BP 153 over 82 pulse 71. I went back to now overpriced Metoprolol Succinate ER with it's side effects of indigestion,reflux,diarrhea,gas, brain fog, cold feet, weight gain increased appetite and being worn out after 1 1/2 to 2 hours exercise for the rest of the day. Better but a pain.  Tryed Carvedilol 12.5 2xs daily and I forget the 2nd dose.

High Blood Pressure	mollyanna, 35-44 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	1		35-44	5/7/2012 2:53:23 PM	I have taken Lisinopril for HB for approx. 7 yrs. And for 7 yrs. I have had a continous (every 10-20 seconds) cough, 24/7. I am a smoker and just thought it was a smokers cough. I complained to my Dr.s ( State Health Dept.) nurses all of 7 yrs. now and they just keep saying to stop smoking. Of course I need to stop smoking, what smoker doesn't? Little did I know until today, that it is the Lisinopril making me cough!! The coughing has caused so much damaged to my body. It's a tremendous force and blow to my body every time I cough. Of all the cough complaints on all these forums and such, a warning label must be put on this medication that EVERY dr. cannot miss!! I have even cough until my bladder has came apart inside and broken a rib. I hate this medication and I am stopping it today. As for the dr., I have no health insurance, so I may as well sit at home and die. At least I will not have the cough while dying from a stroke or heart attack.

I take 10mg per day, which isn't a large dose at all, and have not experienced any harmful side effects at all.   I also started to exercise (mainly just walking) and am now reducing my dosage to 5mg to see how that works.   Who knows, I may be able to stop taking it completely if I continue to exercise.   I have lost 30 lbs in the last 4 months, and am down to 170 lbs.   My dr says I'm doing great and may be able to completely stop taking the lisinopril due to a little bit of extra effort to get my butt off the couch.

High Blood Pressure	AJ, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	4/28/2012 5:05:48 PM	Beware! This medication can cause severe allergic reactions.  Within hours of taking the very first pill I developed a rash on most of my body and swollen lips.  A few hours later my throat swelled up and I was in danger of not being able to breathe.  I took a quick trip to an urgent care center, was given a steroid injection and told never ever take this drug again.  I also had to get an Epi-Pen to carry with me all the time in case the allergic reaction started again.  If you tend to have senstivities to medications, avoid this one at all costs.  It almost killed me.

I started having leg cramps,coughing,dry heaves,these sometimes lasted all day. I was treated by two doctors for allergys,flu,cold,and had chest xrays. I went through two rounds of high powered antibiotics,a steriod nose spray and four bottles of cough syrup. Being 72 years old I was afraid I was going to wind up in the hospital. The doctor finally figured out the problem was the lisinopril and changed my meds. I've been off it for three days and im seeing some improvement. It may take up to two weeks to get completely over everything. I couldn't find any warnings about this medication that said this medication would cause any of these symptoms. I hope they change the printouts that come with the prescriptions and include these warnings.

Also since starting the drug- runny nose, tightness in chest tightness in throat. Aches in legs and shoulder. Prior to this med I never had any of those symptoms. The treatment is worse than the cure. I'm going to try to find something else for my high Blood pressure or live with high blood pressure.

On the second day I started experiencing a dry cough. I only have to take one a day, which I do that in the mornings same time.  I have been monitoring my B/P every twelve hours and it has no effect with lowing my pressure.  When I urinate the flow is so slow like it don't want to come out and I drink plenty of water.  So far I don't like this medicine and based on the reviews I am going to ask my doctor to prescribed something else. Oh yeah the printout from the pharmacy says that this drug does not work well in black patients.  I am black so I will no longer put myself thru this expecting it to get better.

High Blood Pressure	Bob, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	2/26/2012 9:55:17 PM	I am a 34 year old male and have been taking this medication for high blood pressure for 4 months. for the past nine days I have experienced severe chest pain, leg pain, back pain, neck pain, arm pain, and hand pain. Essentially my entire body was in severe pain. After a consultation with my doctor and two trips to the ER I was told that is was not Lisinopril. I have also been through, in the last nine days, a chest xray, MRI, and enough bloodwork to keep Dracula happy. I was then told to consult with a neurologist. Lastly I took it upon myself to research this medication and voluntarily stopped it for a few days. I already feel the horrendous pain beginning to subside. The mental anguish that both I and my family endured these past days is indescribable. This medicine has SEVERE side effects. I will say, it DID lower my pressure and got rid of all headaches and migraines, but nearly killed me. I hope this post helps at least one person.

When I first started taking these meds I was taking 2-20 mg along with a water pill and I had all kinds of issues, breathing, dizzy, tiredness. Then reduced dosage to 1-20 mg and a different type of water pill and this has controlled my hbp 120/80 or lower. I am still tired and have to take nap after work, also lately i feel faint frequently to the point I almost passout. Not sure but, i think I will see my dr to switch to different meds

Both keep my BP down, especially after exercising (exercise 2-3x weekly).  Side effects included: initially getting lite-headed after standing up too fast; throat tickle causing mild cough/throat clearing-went away after 3-4 wks; libido is normal.  I don't really follow HBP diet guidelines-I like my foods &amp; eating out.

Blood pressure is usually 118/76 especilly after light excersize. Just started taking bonita fish peptide to see if I can wean myself off of drugs. Also I Drink Kefir often,it contains 10 probiotics. I strongly belive this is the reason I haven't had a cold in years. Im 54 and feel great, losing belly fat slowly by watching carbs, especially bread. Am confident lifestyle changes will improve my blood pressure but will continue to take lisinopril if needed.

However I have been trying to determine the source of chronic dry cough and find that my MD thinks it is the Lisinopril. The cough is life changing. No sleep, can't talk or eat without coughing. Not worth the use to me.

I work in a hospital and many of my patients asked me was I ok and were concerned I had something contagious! It lowered my bp impressively. I always had a good bp reading. Just could not deal with the cough!   Now I take Diovan. No noticeble side effects - but bp not in good range, either. I shall have to work on my physical aspects to change that or up the dosage :( .

I developed a very nasty cough.  I could not sleep at night and it felt as though I had asthma.  It didn't help that my doctor didn't realized it was the medicine doing all that.  He prescripbed me an inhaler, allergy medicines, antibiotics, etc.  When I finally when off the med, the cough stopped.  I'm on another bp med that works just fine.

Started out feeling like I had razor blades in my throat, followed by severe swelling of my lymth nodes &amp; tongue.  I couldn't swallow and had a great deal of trouble speaking.  I was rushed to the hospital by ambulance where they hooked me up to an IV and monitors for 12 hrs.  Instructed not to take it any longer.

Side effect of nasal drainage but a cough from h-ll!  I have taken this drug for nine (9) months and have coughed more in the last nine months than I have in the past nine years.  And the cough is (was) to the point sometimes I gagged and almost chocked.  Otherwise.. no problems...  Stopped taking the drug last week.  Cough almost gone away.

Taken off for a month then put back on for 1 week.  I didn't put two and two together when I took it originally but it happened again this week.  After about a week on it, I have severe abdominal pain. The first time it lasted about 3 days and went away.  This time, I'm on day 2 so hopefully after tomorrow it will go away and I'll feel fine and have normal bp.

I am glad to see that some others are experiencing similar side effects as it might not be extreme pain from neuropathy.

But the new side effects are lightheadness, weird dreams, feeling like I am in a fog, palpations and rebound elevated bp at times. All drugs are going to cause some time of side effect, I guess after reading all the reviews and my experience, we just have to choose which ones we can live with.

High Blood Pressure	Rose Song, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	1/4/2012 5:22:50 PM	I was prescribed LISINOPRIL-HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE 10-12.5 MG TABLET and have been taking for approximately four years. One tablet each morning quickly controlled BP. The Lisinopril caused side effect of persistent cough, especially after eating; also caused tickling of throat at night. Drinking water did not help however sucking on hard candy or chewing gum got the saliva glands going to alleviate cough and throat tickle. Lost a lot of sleep these last four years. Hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ (a diuretic) caused dry mouth, which contriubted to cough, and some cramping in the strangest places (jaw, scalp, back). I have been proactively working to get cholesterol within normal range and after doing extensive research, found out that HCTZ can also cause elevation in cholesterol by as much as 12%. Talked with my doctor to get meds changed. Would recommend this med due to its effectivenss with caveat that you monitor side effects closely.

Have tried to decrease dose to wean off this drug, but my body is addicted at this point. Also have had a rebound incident that sent me to the ER while I was on the meds. I want off this drug!

I took one that I had only to take 20mg. Next refill, drug store changed maker and I could not control BP even with 40mg.I took it back to the drug store and they gave me a different maker. That works great, although I have to take the 40mg, not the 20mg. They no longer have the first maker that they gave me.

Prevention of Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation	GPhillips, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	11/10/2011 1:57:36 PM	I am taking this med for both high BP and Paroxysmal (sudden) Atrial Fibrillation. The AFib happens very infrequently so I am unsure how effective this drug is for preventing it, having only been in treatment for about 45 days. I had a problem with elevated heart rate upon awakening from sleep which would at times lead to an &quot;attack&quot; of AFib and the drug seems to have alleviated that problem. So far it has not been 100% effective at controlling my high BP. My BP is not extremely high; only a few points above borderline on both the systolic and diastolic. An additional drug is being considered to assist in this effort. I have had no side effects that are detectable, however 45 days may not be enough time for any to develop as yet.

Other	hyphen1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	11/4/2011 3:14:13 PM	I have been on this med for nearly a month now. My headaches are back, my stomach aches &amp; burns to the point that I don't want to eat or drink anything, my urination has slowed way, way down to where I feel like I have a kidney infection &amp; my blood pressure keeps going down very low to where I get very dizzy &amp; lighthead. On strange thing is that when I lean my head back I feel like I'm going in circles &amp; really get dizzy, I'm so weak I feel like I'm sick all the time (like with the flu). I can't take this I'm going back to my Triamenterene I felt so much better on it. The one positive I can think of is that my potassium level has come up 2 pts. but my sodium is still low so Dr. says drink gatorade instead of water, Now my glucosoe has jumped way up...Never had a problem with that either. Good Luck to Everyone &amp; God Speed. hyphen1

High Blood Pressure	Kitty, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	10/28/2011 11:41:26 PM	This drug worked great at lowering my pressure but I could not take the cough , I tried everything to sooth the cough but it kept making me lose sleep , this drug is cheap and works if you can stand the coughing . I now switched to Losatan and the coughing stopped but not sure yet if it lowers the pressure as good as this one did . I now pay $80.00 a month vs the $4.00 this drug was . I wish I did not have to change because this drug really worked and other than coughing I had no other problems with it . Seems all these blood pressure meds have nasty side effects , I just hope that I found one now that doesn't , too soon to tell . I did find that when I coughed a lot lifesavers helped but who wants to be woken up all hours of the night and have to eat lifesavers ?

Assumed I had a sinus infection since I work with children and usually have whatever they have.  Went back to my doctor a couple of times--nothing was ever mentioned about side effects of a cough.  It would start with a sharp pain in my throat (like a pin sticking ) then the tears would come--and the COUGH!!  It was truly the cough from H_ll. Couldn't sleep at night for it.  I think I kept Robitussin cough medicine stock up for a couple of months.  Nausea-horrible coughing!! When I read some of the reviews on this site, I stopped taking it immediately!!  I was so excited to know that I wasn't losing my mind or dying, I called my doctor's office that day and went in the next day.  My doctor didn't seem nearly as excited as I was about my discovery.  If you think a med is causing a problem, don't think you are crazy! And don't be intimidated!!  You know your body!! What is so bad that if your symptoms are so horrible, it's really hard to think straight.

I looked like a gorilla the swelling in my lips and cheeks was unbelievable. Dr immediately attributed the angioedema to lisinopril. I had taken prednisone and benadryl at home before going to office but he also gave me a shot of steroids. I am now wondering if the fatique and night sweats I have had for years may also have been a side effect. I will go back to HCTZ.

I noticed that I developed this nagging cough and nasal drip that never seems to go away. A friend of mine that had been on it told me that, &quot;it's a side affect&quot; I thought she didn't know what she was talking about. But after reading some of the other comments I now realize that she was right. I've also noticed that I keep a headache, as well. I am  going to ask my PCP for something else to keep these kidneys up and running.

I really felt that something was wrong with me.   I went out and got so many blood test and everything came back ok.  I asked the doctor to switch me to a CCB and now I feel like my old self again.  I'm 27....I wish I never took lisiponril.  The side effects were to much.  I feel great now,  I feel brand new.  I feel young again.  Most importanly I feel healthly and no longer feel like I'm sick.  I feel great.  I'm glad I did the research about blood pressure medicines.  If it was not for that I would have never asked my Doctor to switch me to a Calicum Channel Blocker.  From what I hear though CCB work better in African American males anyway.  My sex drive is back and the headaches are gone and my eyes don't feel dry anymore and I have so much more energy.  Thank You God!

I have chronic back pain and I went to my doctor who then checked by blood pressure which was 171 0ver 100. At that time she decided I needed this medicine. How ever I have been testing my pressure at the pharmacy and it has been running in the range of 130/79 for about a month. I have not even been taking this medication as often as I should and still seem's ok. I did see my doctor about three week's and she didn't indicate to me that I should stop taking the med. I have been bruising alot lately and then they break open and bleed. I am 58 and the web site indicated that with age one may bruise more easly. Can Lisinopril cause bruising?

The only new medication I recently had was Lisinopril. The cough became so bad that I had to go to the ER. XR was negative no PNA of infiltrates. I was put on Zithromax and then prednisone because of pulmonary complications. I am stopping the medication.

Also when I went to the beach (this is Florida) I would break out in a rash and had such itchyness that I scratched for days and made my skin raw.  I am now starting to take another medication.  PS: My GP started me on all sorts of anti cough meds ($150!!) without telling me that it was one of the side effects of Lisinopril.
High Blood Pressure	ShaL, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	6/8/2011 12:41:28 PM	I started off at 10mg the 1st month. Saw little change in BP other than higher pulse rate. Dr increased to 20mg. After about 3 weeks began getting rash with blisters all over my body. Also sun sensitivity and extreme lethargy, as well as trouble breathing. Intensified my asthma condition and my pulse was well over 100 at times of the least exertion. Rash is still healing even though I stopped taking the med 2 weeks ago. My pulse is back to 72 and other symptoms subsiding. My BP is not all high but I must take for kidney condition. Will start Norvasc shortly, I hope I have no reactions to this one.

High Blood Pressure	Concerned In CA, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	45-54	6/3/2011 8:41:01 PM	The side effects of Lisinopril were worse than the benefits. I was on this drug for 30 days. Starting on the 3rd day, I had constant headaches and dry coughs. I needed to take 3-4 doses of Excedrin daily just to function. The coughing made it hard to sleep. My mouth and throat were constantly dry, which lead to drinking a lot of water, so bathroom visits also increased. I also felt lethargic - no motivation to do anything. On the positive side, it did keep my blood pressure in check, averaging 117/74, which is the only reason I rated it three stars for effectiveness. Doctor's staff told me that most HBP medication can lead to E.D. problems. This was very true of Atenolol. With Lisinopril, I was able to get an erection, but could not maintain it for as long as needed.Hoping the next med will be better.

I thought it was allergies, and my asthma medication had no affect anymore. The cough became a chronic (make you choke/stop breathing) cough. After my doctor changed my medication, the cough went away. I read the entire yays and nays of lisinopril and a chronic cough was one of the less common side affects. If you have respiratory problems do not take this medication.

High Blood Pressure	hipointer, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	5/28/2011 3:54:26 PM	I took Lisinopril previously for several years.  A new physician changed me to Avapro since I had a cough.  It was effective but too expensive. I requested Lisinopril again recently.  When I began taking it again I felt terrible, legs hurt, face and throat were flush. I felt as though something heavy was weighing me down. I also noticed joint pains which I had previously, but had disappeared once I stopped taking Lisinopril although I had not associated it.  I was only when I began taking it again that I thought the Lisinopril may be causing the pains and the cough is back.  I will have to change again I think.

I was taking Lisinopril/HZTZ  and the Diuretic part of it HZTZ (Hydrochlorothiazide) wasn't strong enough to keep me from holding water so My Dr. Put me om straight Lisinopril and gave me a stronger Diuretic andsolved that problem.  Works great for me, as far as rating it's ease of use,...how can swalowimg a pill be!

High Blood Pressure	Herbal Mom 2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	5/12/2011 12:08:56 PM	Day 2 - although it is too soon to decide but day one took pill at lunch starting experiencing lower back pain and felt like ovary pain as if I was on a cycle.  Day two (today) took one this morning.  BP is good but pain has a pulsating feeling in the lower back and I sit at work. Ok when standing up, its when I start to feel the kicking to my back that tells me my body is not adjusting well and this is not a good sign.  Will not take tomorrow. Going back herbal - my mother has had High BP for 30 years and is now 73. She refuses to take dr. prescribed meds - I may follow her lead. Best of luck to all on this med.

I am  on a steroid and an antihistimine for the next 5 days and have been instructed to see my family  physician concerning the medications. I was told by both ER Drs. that although it was rare, the swolllen tongue was a side effect of the medication.

Mine also had phelm and kept me awake all night long. My lungs hurt. I also felt a terrible lack of energy.Prior to this medication I first started Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. I developed a rash like poison oak on my cheeks.I was told that it has sulfa and I was allergic to it. I was moved to Benazepril. The same symptoms as Lisinopril but had a dry sore cough and same lack of energy. My Dr. wanted to move me yet to another med in the same pril family. I'd had it. I was exhausted from lack of sleep, the cough, and no energy. My BP was only slightly lower. I had to keep a bag of cough drops on my night stand and was using them all night long. A friend told me about her success with Atenolol. It is a beta blocker which does not pass the blood brain barrier or the central nervous system. Therefore, avoiding side effects. I do not have any of the side effects of Linosinopril. For me the &quot;Pril&quot; family was a terrible experience!

Thought maybe this would go away after a few days. No such luck. After 9 days of caughing and not sleeping I quit taking it and called my doctor. I am on a different medication and hope the caughing stops soon. It's been 3 days.

I have been very shaky all day since I took the pill, now I have a red blotchy  rash all over and tingly. Can anyone relate to this?

They were so bad that she looked like someone took a baseball bat and beat her.  After 36 hours, she was in the ED due to inability to breath as the hives developed in her throat blocking her airway.  She DC taking the med but hives persisted.  Allergist told her they could last for years from this &quot;helpful medication&quot;.  I was also given this med...irretractible diahrrea, nausea, and suprise suprise, HIVES.  Norvasc has almost none of the same side effects as lisinopril, so why are Doctors pushing this drug 50% more than any other?  Moral of the story, unless this drug means life or death for you, women...stay away!

The new PCP increased the Lisinopril to 25 MG and had lab work done on me about every four months.  Each following lab report showed all three conditions getting worse(creatinine 2.08). My cardiologist changed the RX from Lisinopril to Amlodipine and ordered more lab work.  After six days on Amlodipine the results of the lab test showed improvement in all three conditions and creatinine dropped to 1.86.

Muscles, for no apparent reason, suddenly tie up like a knot. Dr.'s seem dismissive when reported, and do not appreciate the severe pain that such cramps cause.  Never had cramps prior to taking this med.  So which is better possible affects of high blood pressure or continual, severe cramping?

Scary, but never any respiratory compromise. No allergic hx, no known association w/food or anything else.  Allergy testing was negative.  Inference that lisinopril was the likely culprit.  Discontinued Rx; am now on amlodopine 5 mg, so far so good.
High Blood Pressure	Stanford, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	2/8/2011 2:44:33 PM	I cannot believe this drug is still on the market. Over 2000 comments here, about 90% complain of severe dry hacking cough. I developed the cough within days of starting and the cough went away just as quickly when I stopped taking lisinopril. This drug should not even be considered as medication. It is mostly ineffective with very bad side effects, but it is cheap.
High Blood Pressure	Tweetyb421, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	2/8/2011 7:14:59 AM	This medication did not work for me.  I was only on 2.5mg with Lopressor 50mg, but 4 days after I started it, I was not doing well.  I was dizzy, very tired, weak and had a headache that would last most of the day, almost everyday.  I think the worst of it was when I called my cardiologist to report this and get some help, and I was told that this medicine doesn't cause the symptoms I was having.  EVEN THOUGH all the literature I've read and received with the med from the pharmacy says otherwise.  I felt unheard and dismissed.  I stopped the med and no longer use that cardiologist....I feel better...

It also aids in kidney function. the only downside is a very mild cough associated with this drug. My physician informed me this would likely occur. It is not a hacking cough but usually experienced within a half hour of taking the drug

I am still bothered by abnormally high blood pressure, both diastolic and systolic. But, I am also a psychiatric patient, and suffer from heart failure issues, as well. I find that while on this drug, simple stretching and movement exercises leave me feeling faint, with hot burning muscles. I have experien ced vertigo, and I have been admitted into the cardiac icu on one occasion recently. Also, I black out, and feel faint with moderate exercise. I have difficulty sleeping on several occasions, and can't stay asleep. Also, I bloat, and feel uncomfortable with tight clothing, altho, no swelling in the ankles yet. I wish I could have some relief from these side-effect type conditions before they kill me.

Last summer it got worse and with bouts of nausea. Then i developed a severe rash on my head and neck. Then my hands and back also developed a severe rash. After going to my doctor 3 times for the rash, I decided to get a second opinion. It was the lisinopril! they since changed my prescription, but the tissue damage from the rashes will take a long time to heal. oh, my 1st doctor blamed it on hormones then treated me for scabies. he is no longer my doctor!

Doc. says its allergies, no help from several allergy meds. I have stopped taking and see some lessening of symptoms. Actually slept through two nights without the usual several coughing FITS..

I was very pleased with the fact that I paid less than two dollars for a ninety day supply. It also reduced my blood pressure, but the side effect of coughing was too much for me so I reluctanly had to switch to another medication. If I didn't have coughing fits for hours I would have remained on this medication. Thank you

I eat good and exercice often and I am afraid of how dangerous high bp can be. Taking drug for 1 week and my bp close to normal, no side effects. 10mg.

My pressure still stay in the range of 130-150 and I take my medciation each and every day along with a water pill but my blood pressure still has not gotten better. Along with my pressure still not being good this medication makes me cough all the time. I hate it and when I see my doctor she will be taking me off of this because she was thinking that I had lung cancer or something. The coughing was so bad that she was sending me to get CT scan and xrays done of my chest and they found nothing. My mother has been coughing like this for almost 10 years and come to find out she takes the exact same medication for high blood as I do. I will no longer be taking this medication in about a week.
High Blood Pressure	hopeful, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	1/16/2011 1:00:00 AM	Just started taking this med only about a month ago. It has worked wonders on my blood pressure!! It's perfect and I'm a diabetic. I still get some periods of dizziness, a little nausea, and my head feels funny sometimes. I can feel it working. Not sure if this is related or not, but I have been having heart palpitations,will tell my dr about that.Overall, it looks like a wonder drug. I have to say, I see a lot of people wrote about this chronic coughing as a side effect. Honestly, I think, only the very first two days I had a little dry cough, but since then I have NO coughing at all!This is a wonder drug if you are looking for one! Overall, very happy

He is a truck driver and he developed a terrible cough that it got to be to dangerous for him to drive. His coughs got so bad that he was on the brink of passing out sometimes. So he had to get off of it a week ago still has cough but not as bad hopefully it goes away real soon. This is a dangerous drug for anyone that drives or uses machinery for a living. 
High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	65-74	1/15/2011 4:54:08 PM	I give only 3 stars for satisfaction because of the horrible cough I have to deal with.  The coughing racks my entire body, sore ribs, back and at time I feel as I will pass out.  Mr. Dr. said it was from post nasal drip, took various meds and cough syrups but nothing helps.  I cannot tolerate this drug because of the cough.  I sound like someone who smokes 5 packs a day.  If I'm out in public I have to leave the room.

My BP was 235/115 and it is now 135/85.  At first I was on 20 mg and am now on 40 mg.  At first I had dizzyness, diarrhea and lightheadedness, but those have gone away.  I still have the cough which makes me gag sometimes, but that is the only side effect I have left.  I asked the dr if there was anything I could do about that and he said no.  I thought the longer I took the med, that the cough would go away as well.  I would recommend this med to anyone with high BP.  It has brought down my BP 100 points on top and 30 points on the bottom.  No other BP med has ever done what this drug has done for me.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  (Caregiver) 	3	3	1	Male	45-54	12/29/2010 8:34:37 PM	My mother had been using lisinopril for years with no problems, until last week.  She developed an allergic reaction to the drug.  She was taken to the hospital by ambulance.  Emergency room physicians made my mother and I aware that allergic reactions to this drug is common among black americans.  My mother's tongue was so swollen that she could not talk.  It was horrifying.  She called me a work to let me know what was happening. I could not understand her on the phone.  It's a blessing that she was able to get to the hospital in time for to begin an IV of benadryl. She was transferred to ICU to receive monitoring.  She was unable to drink or eat. She was in the hospital for two days.  Her medication was been changed.  I'm taking lisinopril too, but I will be contacting my doctor to change my medication asap. I strongly advise anyone taking this medication to think twice about taking it, because you never know if you will develop an allergic reaction.

My blood pressure was staying high.  I quit taking it, and have discovered that the cough I had, the tiredness and exhaustion and dizziness that all had been attributed to allergies, is now gone and I have more energy than I have ever had.  I cannot believe I've lived with this for so many years when I could have gotten rid of all the &quot;allergy&quot; symptoms by discontinuing use of lisinopril!

High Blood Pressure	Robert, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	12/13/2010 1:33:02 PM	I took lisinopril for less than 6 mo; it gave a dry hacking cough and was completely ineffective for high BP. My doctor thought I had COPD, but the cough went away within 1 week after I stopped taking lisinopril. I have taken many meds for BP over the past 30 yrs, this was the worst!

One morning, after taking my dose of 10mg, my tongue started swelling. I had to go to the ER where they changed my prescription. If it weren't for the tongue swelling, which was scary in itself, I would have continued to take this med.

High Blood Pressure	frustrated, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	11/20/2010 4:16:01 AM	I'm 32yo and have recently been diagnosed with hypertension.  It runs heavily in my family for those family members that are obese.  I am active, fit and a healthy eater.  My doctor checked my kidney function levels prior to starting the Lisinopril HCTZ and they were normal.  Then my 2wk bloodwork after taking the med showed extreme high kidney levels but my blood pressure is great.  So my doc changed my prescription without the diaretic (HCTZ) and see how it works and do bloodwork in 2 wks.  I would advise everyone on any blood pressure med to make sure your doctor is checking your kidney functions.

High Blood Pressure	Kelly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	11/18/2010 9:02:45 PM	I was given this medications for high blood pressure and took it for 2 weeks. I began to have intense cravings for salt and spicy food. I also severe from depression and take an antidepressant for it. Over the two weeks I was on the medication, I became more and more depressed. It got to the point where I couldn't control my emotions. My tears were unstoppable. My doctor told me to stop taking the medication nd he switched me to a calcium channel blocker and increased my antidepressant. I researched more the connection between diuretics, salt cravings, and depression and discovered the diuretic in Lisinopril was ridding my body of salt; hence, my intense salt craving. I also discovered that salt is considered the body's natural anti-depressant which explains my deterioration in mood. Also, discovered that intense salt cravings means that you are probably deficient in sodium and low blood sodium levels can be fatal so if you have intense salt cravings you should give your body what it wants and have your blood sodium levels checked. I would not recommend this medication to any that suffers from depression. I went completely haywire and couldn't make through any day at work this week. I am starting to feel better. I am excited about the Calcium channel blocker because it helps prevent chest pain which has been my major complaint. My blood pressure hovers a little over 140/90 with the 2nd number being the highest. I didn't notice significant drops in blood pressure with Lisinopril which could be because of the extra salt I was adding. I did notice some weight loss while on lisinopril that made me happy. I will miss the weight loss but it is not worth running around like a crazy salt addict crying uncontrobly. Depression isn't a recognized side effect of Lisinopril but it should be.

I cannot believe all the others that experience the same exact thing. I had no idea. I have been taking this medication for over 5 years, the dr. has just recently doubled by dsg to 80 mgs 2x a day. No wonder I feel so awful. Thanx people out there without your feedback I would have never guessed that it was the side effect of this medicine. I can hardly use my right hand. I cant believe this. I take 80 mgs of lisinipril, .4 mg of Clonidine, and 100 mg of Metropolol, daily.

At first I thought I was getting a cold, blew my nose all the time and had post nasal drip which caused the coughing.  I never got a cold and the coughing continues. I have given this about 6 weeks so I'm going in next week and see if I can try something else.  I am tired of not knowing when I am going to have a &quot;coughing attack&quot; and I am sucking on throat lozenges all the time.  I hope this all clears up when I switch to something else. BP has been &quot;ok&quot; but I have had some times where it has spiked up but if everyone took their BP as much as I do, maybe everyone spikes throughout the day, especially during the elections or thinking of the many stresses of our lives.

I did have the dry cough when I started taking Lisinopril but that only lasted for about 2wks.  I have had no problems at all after that first 2wks. I had been taking atenolol 50mg and did not like it at all compared to Lisinopril.  Lisinopril does not have the instant rebound effect that atenolol has if you forget a dose. And did not cause any of the racing heart beat effect that atenolol would give to me.

I suffered a fracture of the cervical spine, a broken sternum, two cracked ribs &amp; four teeth knocked out. I'm lucky for having great medical care. I was off work for six months.

High Blood Pressure	mark, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	55-64	10/15/2010 2:46:15 PM	for 15 months my lisonpril dose was 5 mg and my blood pressure was constant at 125/65 (average per day per month). After Aortic Valve Relacement and Aortic Anuerysm repair, 4 months ago,  my dose is now 40 mg and my blood pressure range is all over the spectrum. The dosage increase has been incremental but doesn't seem to be treating the condition. This counter intuitive to me - get fixed and need 8 times the dose yet it hasn't corrected the symptom.

It has left me with a terrible cough, constant dry mouth, fatigue, depression, leg cramps, abdominal pain, headaches,  and neck pain.  It did lower blood pressure, for the most part, but I still got tightness and pain in chest and upper back making it hard to breathe from time to time (they doubled the dosage). The side effects ARE NOT worth it! My overall health has severely declined since being on this medication.  I have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Restless Leg Syndrome, Asthma, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Sjogren's Syndrome (dry mouth), and have gained about 100 lbs.  Doctors were treating me for so many other things, instead of just changing the medication, with the known side effects, but I guess that's how they make their money. I am no longer taking it.  I just hope it doesn't have lasting side effects, and I can get on with my life and be happier &amp; healthier, now.

Blood pressure and great and NO BAD SIDE EFFECTS. The only bad thing is having to pee after drinking a glass of water because of the diuretic. :)

I have had severe side effects that the doctor says could not be the medication. I finally went to a heart specialist. It was determined I was over medicated. I started  taking 50mg. I had all of the severe side effects and more! I have been in the hospital twice this year. The last time was not a heart attack... it was a panic attack caused from blood pressure dropping to 80/34. I am now taking 2,5mg about every other day and it still drops to 90/54 in the evenings! I fight panic attack from the medication. I feel weak, dizzy and faint most of the time. I want to feel good again!

Azor effective, softer tinnitus, but zone-out in evening, bad sinus/ear infections, testosterone low, PSA up, some hair loss.  Diovan worse than lisinopril.IS there a solution without the grief?

High Blood Pressure	Sandy, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	55-64	9/25/2010 3:22:59 AM	I was on Coreg for almost a year and had all of these side effects..tiredness, headaches, dizzy,joint pain in my knees, weight gain. Cardio doctor took me off this medication and put me on lisinopril 10 mg. a day and left me on HTCZ. My left foot started swelling in June and then my thigh in my left leg right above my knee has swollen. I had SEVERE pain in my knees caused by the Coreg and the pain is gone but my left leg is swollen still. Every since I started this lisinopril I have had my asthma flare up, and it rarily bothers me. I feel my chest in my bhroncial area tighten up and I cough until I use my inhaler. I am reading all of these others side effects to this drug. It's pretty scarey &amp; my left calf is starting to swell too. Is any one else out there having trouble with just one leg swelling? I had tests ran &amp; it's not my heart. Please email me at agentmcbride@hotmail.com if you have had these side effects.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	9/18/2010 10:41:07 PM	This medicine worked great for the first couple of months but after about 3 months the stomach pains started.  I experienced seasonal allergy feelings, dry cough, heartburn, indigestion, acid reflex, urine frequency increased and then the stomach pains started.  Once that started then the urgency and frequency for bowel movements also increased.  The pain then started in my lower back and got more intense in my lower stomach.  It also felt like I had a urinary tract infection.  The pain kept getting worse.  This is the second time I was on this medication and I had the same effects both times after a few months of being on this. Won't take this medication again.

As time went on I started peeling everywhere (even the palms of my hands and fingertips), some burning on my skin and itching. Could this be caused by this medication.? I can't afford to go to a dermatologists, I have no insurance.

High Blood Pressure	Louise, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	9/1/2010 11:40:21 AM	My blood pressure stated to elevate after being diagnosed with Breast Cancer and going thru raidaiton treatments (no doubt stress)..My Dr prescibed Antenol, which I took for a few months but did not like the extreme fatigue, combined with taking Tamoxifen, so she swithched me to 5mg of Lisinopril. I seem to have more energy, but the cough I have developed is very annoying and has me very concerned, because of constant chest pains, and when you have been diagnosed with cancer right away I am thinking the worse....these reviews has eased my mind quite a bit, Thank You... I am going back in to see my cancer Dr, just to make sure and then  follow up with my regular Dr. I rather this med than the Antenol.

High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	8/30/2010 2:11:36 PM	After a major stroke I made serious lifestyle changes.  When diet and exercise failed to lower BP enough the Dr. advised 10 mg daily. BP is under control.  I have had intermittant dry cough.  I drink at least 80oz water daily and this helps keep me hydrated and avoiding muscle cramps.

Good golly, the cough I could NOT get rid of till I quit this med.  And I miss it because I think it was helping to curb my appetite.  I tried to take 1 lisinopril after being switched to Norvasc and the cough was back that very nite.  Now I'm on Norvasc and it seems to be working but I never take my b.p. and my appetite is coming back which is bad, I've gained weight fast.  Can't these companies make a drug that doesn't have side effects???

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	55-64	8/28/2010 5:33:29 PM	When taking this medication (2.5mg)I have acquired extremely bad upper back burning sensation with pain and tranferring to center part of chest. The burning sensation in chest feels like a heart attack. I complained to my Cardiologist and was told to keep using it and as in fact, was told to use twice a day. I finally stopped using it and 3 days after I stopped, the pain dissappeared. For me personally, the cons outweighed the benefits. I wish everyone luck with this medication but for me it had very little to no effect.

High Blood Pressure	aynnie1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	8/26/2010 8:05:12 AM	I was taken off Chlorthalidone, a diuretic because of a slight drop in my postassimum and sodium levels and put on Lisinopril.I am on some mdications that cause some bladder constipation and the Chlorthalidone took care of that problem completely. I could finally urinate completely. I also lost pounds of water weight. When the doctor called about the potassium levels, which were not bad at all, but she said why deal with it all if we don't have to?I stopped the Chlorthalidone and began the Lisinopril.Within one day I couldn't urinate, I had leg cramps that frightened me and felt totally out of it and dizzy.I didn't suffer from a cough, but that is because I stopped the drug, went back on the Chlor.(which had gotten my B.P under control)and began taking supplements and eating bananas. I feel fine after a week back on the 1st medication and now have to call my Dr. to tell her what I have done. However, no matter *what* she says I will NOT go back on Lisinopril.

I have been dealing with bad cough for almost 4 months. It is so bad I have vomited and wet myself (I am only 37) Co-workers are concerned. I have been to my regular doctor several times for the coughing and I have been directed to see a lung specialist. My cough started around 2 weeks after starting taking this. Other problems are leg cramps and trouble sleeping. I am going to stop this medicine, and hopefully I can get better. It is amazing that my doctor didnt tell me of these side effects and my cough could be from this medication. I will no longer see this doctor.

Had dizziness and cough from the first day. Lowered BP but side effects are awful. Heart palpitations, anxiety attacks, flushing, tingling in hands, feet and legs. Restless sleep also a bother. Also had a rash on left foot toes. hair loss, itchy scalp, sensitivity to sun. swollen gums, lips, throat, hard to swallow. runny nose, aches, stiff joints in both hands. The list goes on and on. Off med for 10 days and still not 100%.

I started with 10 mg. of Lisinopril, which marginally brought my blood pressure down, so my doctor upped it to 20mg., this has been very effective. The only noticeable side effect is I sometimes have a cough, but not enough to be bothersome.

Went to Dr. for rash and was given a steriod base Rx, which helped until gone asnd within 24hours rassh was back ,even worse it is now spreawd to the back and stomach and is starting on the upper thighs, not limited to one side of the body.  Itch is very uncomfortable.  Was also given a comination oral Rx hydroxyz hcl 25mg generic for Atarax. Doesn't seem effective, it was for 10 day regimin, may have  lessened itch slightly  but not to a really tolerable level.  We have heard of similar reactions to lisinopril in several other cases....what to do now?

High Blood Pressure	hfp60, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	45-54	7/15/2010 1:29:10 PM	I have been on this medication for 6 weeks now at 10 mg. I have found that I have increased anxiety, rapid heart rate and trouble sleeping. I also take thyroid medication and have found that I have to space the medications out at least 12 hours apart, and I always take my BP medication with food.I am sensitive to medications and have been for the last 10 yrs. I have tried talking with my doctor about lowering the dosage, but with no success as of yet.I feel that my blood pressure problems are largely due to my hypothyroidism not being treated as it should be. I had no problems for 6 yrs when on a different thyroid medication. But its frustrating to get the doctors now days to listen to their patient, we know our bodies better than they do. But unfortunately doctors today are all about the lab results, and treating only the symptoms then they are about listening to their patients and finding out the actual cause of the problem.And for that, many of us suffer needlessly and are over medicated.

Only side effect has been a dry cough in the winter, but over the last couple of years I've started developing noticeable fatigue (physical and mental). I wonder if it's from this drug.

I think all meds have some side effects and I hate to take anything.

My face, lips, and throat were swelling up and it was difficult to breathe. I happened to be in a hospital lobby when it happened and a code blue was announced.I was informed this drug can cause these symptoms the first time you take it or after 20 to 30 years. I dealt with the dry cough all these years since the drug lowered my BP at low doses. I'm still recovering two weeks.

I have been taking both of them for over 2 years and experienced some light headness plus several anxiety attacks.  I stopped taking the medicine when I developed swollen lips eyes and a rash.  My DR took me off the med immediately and I think my tolerance for this medication is now very low.  I would suggest everyone have their DR. go over the side effects of the meds they take periodically.  Lastly I was thinking I had a reaction to Mangoes when my lips swelled up but Dr. said he had seen patient in the past with this reaction from the medication

I knew one of the side effects would be coughing but it stated it should subside after the body become use to the meds.  Well 5 months later the cough was very light and now it has turned into a very harsh, strong and disruptive dry cough.  This cough causes others to have concern because of the severeness at times.  It disrupts my sleep every single night and can be painful to the stomach it is such a powerful type of cough.  I get no sleep with this med.  I will be seeking out another med because it is taking my pressure down but bringing it back up with the stress of not sleeping and all the coughing.

My husband was on it also, but it made him cough, which could be one of the side-effects.  So my doctor put him on another brand.

I immediately stopped taking this RX and spent the next 9 days recovering. In the mean time I had an episode where I could not talk nor form words. I was subsequently sent to my local hospital for a head CT /w contrast. COMPLETELY NORMAL. I know that it was the combination of those two meds!!!!! So, the side effects were very life threatening!!!

I am stopping this med and hope to improve in a matter of days but I can find no other reason why I waking up feeling okay, take the medication and 2 to 3 hours later have high anxiety, nervousness and even panic attacks for no reason at all....  Not happy with drug, also lack of concentration and comprehension on this medication...

I have put up with the nonproductive cough for almost as long as I've been taking it. In the past few (6?) months, I have noticed  that my lips and tongue have been sore. I have changed toothpaste with no real change. For the past week my lips have been swollen and are now blistering. I thought it was from something I ate, but can think of nothing I have been allergic to in the past that could have bothered me. I'm thinking it is the Lisinopril. Does anyone have a similar experience? Please let me know

Shortly after using this medication (2 months or so), I developed itching in my scalp and began to loose my hair.  I am 73 years old male in excellent health and my hair never experienced such a detrimental condition. I am partially bald and I am worrying about this problem.  I also take Lipitor to control cholesterol, and Co Q-10 200 MG to suppress the muscle pain Lipitor has caused.   Please advice

Became extremely tired and had to lay down for several hours. I stopped taking them and began feeling like my head would explode. My blood pressure went up to stroke levels. I began taking lisinopril again. My blood pressure went down but I began having a dry cough,exaustion, racing heart beat and panic attacks. What's worse, my throat became swollen and sore. Turning my head was difficult as a result of the swelling. Fearing that I may have cancer, I went to the emergency room; They were unmoved by my pain. I was told that it was more than likely, my lymph nodes and sent me on my way. I decided to check Web.MD and found that there were thousands of people who have had the same experience with this medication that I had! Some people can use this drug, I suppose, because some have sung it's praises. But if your first reaction to Lisinopril is not a good one. Call your Doctor!

My heart palpitations are to a minimal finally!  I love this medication but the coughing and the horseness in my voice has become so annoying.  So I am now going to try micardis 40 mg once a day.  I just read the reviews on this drug and hope I dont experience the side effects other people have had.  I walk everday and have lost weight and feel great! I guess I will compare the two and if I have to put up with the cough instead of fatigue and back pain-then I may switch back.

Contacted Dr who agreed with my decision and schedule appt in one month to review BP and possible lower dosage (2 1/2 mg) or another drug.

I would like to get off this drug.  But, am not sure if there are side effects to quitting.  However, I have found a cosmetic side effect.  Ladies if you hightlight your hair blond, have well water and night sweats, your hair will turn copper red.  I have to strip my hair every 3-4 weeks at the hairdresser.  This didn't start until being on the drug for about 4 to 5 months. My hair looks stained red just where it touchs the nape of my neck and ears.  Anyone else experience this?

While it has been EXCELLENT at lowering my blood pressure quickly, I've been attributing all the other side effects to allergies including:  persistent cough, watery eyes, runny nose.  But there's also been serious diarrhea, tiredness and 'growling' stomach.  I'm going to as for a change next time I visit my doctor in a few weeks.  Thanks for all the objective reviews on here for the 'wake-up' call!!

Yesterday, my face and mouth swelled terribly and I ended up in the ER. The dr immediately told me i had angioedema. This can lead to an airway obstruction. Luckily, I decided to go seek medical assistance. I can no longer take lisinopril. Be aware that this too can happen to you. Today, I am on steroids, benadryl, and pepcid. I feel fine overall just be aware that if you suddenly swell in the throat, face, lips, or tongue that you could be in big trouble. This also explains a big scare 6 months ago when out of the country and my throat swelled 5x its size both inside and out. Know the risks and act immediately. It could save your life. I was told by the DR that you can take lisinopril for years w/o any side affects then all of a sudden it turns on you.

The coughing doesn't stop the tickle, which can rapidly progress to uncontrollable coughs, gagging &amp; tearing eyes.  The ONLY thing that helps is a constant ingestion of menthol cough drops along with a CARBONATED drink.  Water or non-carbonated drinks don't stop the tickle, but the bubbles seem to &quot;scratch it&quot;! I'll be seeking another medication, as this side effect is REALLY annoying &amp; embarrassing.

For some reason the other day I had a reaction which caused a life threatening episode. My tongue swelled it's called ANGIOEDEMA(also my feet were itching like crazy).I wound up in the emergency room and every medical personnel asked me if I was taking Lisinopril.I was told even though I had never had a reaction it can happen at anytime and that my recent prescription (2 days before) for prilosec was not the cause. In any case, as far as I'm concerned Lisinopril is a very dangerous medication. None of the pharmacy information lists this side effect.It is just listed with many other meds. that MAY require additional monitering. I think angioedema should be listed as a definite side effect.

It is bad because I also have a bad back with a buldging disc so the coughing hurts. It does not stay but when I do get the cough I cannot sleep wake up all night May have to try something else although it has worked for my blood pressure.

Switch to Lisinopril and am now dealing with cough, hoarse voice and racing heart beat. BP still stayed the same (high).  Only on meds for 5 days appx.  Called Doctor and will see about switching to something else.  Just wonder why Toprol stopped working.  Had no issues with those meds at all!

Other	UnwindBKind, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	4/17/2010 7:53:32 PM	Took Lisinopril for a year or so and just totally suffered on and off.  Dizziness, can't walk well without holding on to something, severe coughing and blurred vision that is only suppose to be temporary.   Two doctors failed to acknowledge that it was the medicine so I decided to make the decision to quit taking it after searching for better results on other medicines.  Most people seem to think Cozaar works well with very little side effects for some.  I've been on it for a week and the severe dizziness is going away and I feel so happy and relieved.   But I get a slight achy feeling in my knees/joints which I can tolerate if that is one of the side effects and some people are experiencing this problem as I see in the reviews on here.  I can handle it as long as that feeling is going to be very mild and it beats the heck out of not being able to walk well and feeling so lousy every single day because your so dizzy.  Not sure if everyone has this problem but when I first take a new BP medicine and too high of a dose, my BP will actually go up for a few weeks.  I had it go up so high, I think the strokes I had was from the medicine and too high of a dose.  The doctor in the ER mentioned that this can happen.  They never found out that I had 8 strokes until weeks or a month later after an MRI.  The neroulogist showed me the scan.  I swear a volunteer doctor I had gave me too high of a dose and that is what happened.  Luckily I got better but it took almost a year, lots of exercise, very low salt, small portions of food and plenty of water to get better.

I developed a dry hacking cough and had gagging in the throat. When my doctor discontinued this drug most of the hurting in my legs went away. My husband was on this drug for his  heart and he complained of his legs hurting so very bad. The doctors never realized this drug was causing his legs to hurt. Neither did I untill after his death I started to take it. I think someone should alert people taking the drug to be aware of the cough and the legs hurting.And nothing helped the cough I had. My husband suffered for over 2 years and no doctor ever came up with why his legs hurt or the cough (They thought the coughing was due to smoking(I do not smoke) and thought the legs hurt because of bypass surgery. They were so wrong.

Found that I would throw up within a couple of hours of taking med and developed horrible nagging cough that would not quite. Helped to control hbp, but cough and vomiting too much to handle. Dr switched me to Diovan and no side effects;although doesn't control as well. Apparently, my side effects were enough to deem that I'm allergic to the med.  Of course, everyone can be different in how they react to meds, but I sure gave it a good try on this one before requesting dr to switch.

I have switched back to Lisinopril because the other meds had worse side effects. I take it at night and have no allergic reactions. Try splitting your dose or taking it at bedtime. Takes a good 2 weeks for your body to adjust. 
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/4/2010 5:22:54 PM	Was on Prinival 10 MG (Merck) but have tried 3 times over the last 3 years to use the generic Lisinopril (TEVA) to save money.  Each time, no matter what the duration, constant chest fluttering and  even higher BP were experienced.  Keep being told no difference between generic &amp; brand name, but I believe there is something in the filler/binder the manufacturer (TEVA) uses since I am on 2 other medications from the same manufacturer (TEVA) and also have side effects, but the side effect is tolerable.  When switched back to Prinivil, everything is fine so I'm staying with Prinivil.
High Blood Pressure	skinnybones, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/4/2010 2:01:32 PM	Dr. started me on 10 mgs, worked well, but not quite good enough, he raised it to 40 mgs.  I never felt so bad in my life! But I'm stubborn and besides I didn't want to have meds changed again.  So I hung in, read hundreds of reviews on this website.  Then I found a few that said the same thing was happening to them when their prescription was raised to 40 mgs. These few reviews each said they divided the 40 mgs into two 20mgs doses, one taken in am, the other in pm.  I tried, it worked!! Don't give up, this medication is the only one that works on my bp.  The dry cough lasted about 3 wks, the flu feelings left, too, once I divided the dosage.

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	3/3/2010 4:13:08 PM	I have been taking lisinopril for over a month now.  When I first started taking this I came to web md to read the reviews on this, so I would have an idea about any side affects.  A week after I started taking this drug I experience a cough, sinus drainage, and sore throat.  I also experience a little insomia.  This went on for about 2 weeks, so I started drinking a lot of water with this medicine.  Not sure if this is what helped me but since I drink plenty of water with it I haven't had any of these problems.  This may not work for everyone but it's worth a try.

I took it for several months, never knowing the persistant, urgent cough could possibly be a side effect. I had just ordered another 3 month supply, when I found this site where everyone confirmed to me that the cough came from this medicine! The dr. permenantly took me off it, and replaced it with Micartis--expensive, but effective without that annoying cough! He says they're working on a generic.

I guess the more affordable the medication the more misery you must go through. While this medication may work the miserable chronic cough it produces makes this product unacceptable and with so many other options out there it surprises me doctors push this one for there patients. Maybe they need to be required to try these medications before prescribing them so they will learn first hand how horrible the cost of benefits penality is taking these blood pressure medications. Avoid Lisinopril- again it may work but when coughing your head off regularly day after day it gets old fast. Too- getting dirty looks in public by women with children that you are a sick puppy and belong indoors and not outdoors thinking you may be making there children become sick since you appear so. A coughing mouth mask should come with this product upon purchase. Sincerely, W.S.

As far as controlling my hyertension, I guess it was OK, but I was only on Lisinopril for about 2 months.  Symptoms of uncontollable dry cough showed up after I had a bout of bronchitis, and got progressively worse each day.  I finally went back to my Dr thinking I still had bronchitis, but was diagnosed as simply having allergic reaction to the drug, so she had me taking allergy pills to alleviate symptoms.  I had to swtich back to Diovan.

Before trying lisiniopril I was on a vasodialator and experienced some of the symptoms reported here by other people on lisinopril, ie:dry cough, migrain, body ache.  Initially on lisinopril I was dizzy.  Dizzyness wore off after 10 days.  Overall, very pleased with the product, no lasting side effects.

Other	Rlatham, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	2/4/2010 5:40:37 PM	I'm a 44 yr old male and was prescribed Lisonipril for high blood psi prevention. I do not have high BP currently.The first month I developed what I thought was a cold. Headache, bad cough,weezing lots of mucus. It was bad enough to get anti biotics from my doctor. The cold symtoms never got better, I saw a allergist and had all test done for every allergy. He gave me a breathing machine to take home as my lungs were full and I could not breath correctly. Night time was the worst, coughing started once I layed down, sometimes choking on the mucus. I noticed my sex drive was way down, I have always had a very healthy sex drive and this was distressing. I was always tired, depressed, irritable. My hair began to get dried out and dead feeling, I thought it was my shampoo or something. My mouth was so dry I began carrying a water bottle around with me. I have rashes on both legs that itch severely. I remember saying to my wife, I feel really sick, like all around bad. Something is wrong. I never get colds, I have perfect numbers cholest is 166. I know when something is wrong. I ran out of pills before the weekend and did not take any for 4 days. I began to feel less sick and could breath. I took my first pill in the 4 days and that night was feeling ill again. I looked up side effects that night and was shocked. I trusted my doctor, never thought this little pill was responsible for all this pain. 3 months of lost productivity. It been just one day off the pills, I can only hope I return to normal.
High Blood Pressure	sufferwithIC, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	55-64	2/4/2010 1:43:15 PM	Shortly after initiating treatment with this drug, I developed the &quot;chronic dry cough&quot; everyone talks about.  It has somewhat lessened over time but is still there.  After taking 10mg/day (doc had actually prescribed 40 mg!) for 5 months I developed Interstitial Cystitis (painful bladder disease) due to bladder irritation from the drug.  This is extremely painful and hard to resolve.  I would not recommend this drug for anyone having previous bladder sensitivity problems.       At the same time of being diagnosed with hypertension, I was also found to be hypothyroid.  The thyroid medication has brought down the B.P. to a much greater degree than the lisinopril.       My recommendation to anyone with high blood pressure or high cholesterol - rule out thyroid problems first before taking medications that may result in adverse side effects!!

Very bad raspy to lose voice, severe stomach pain, bloating, and gas, initial dizziness that went away, and congestion/lots of phlegm.  Used to take 1st thing in AM &amp; switched to before bed. This drug helped drop my BP but lots of issues with it.  Will see doc to soon to change med. Otherwise healthy person that now has severe gastro issues, creeping up potassium levels, cholesterol and sugar after taking Lisinopril HCI. These were gradual issues that appeared over time and it has taken a lot of discomfort and detective work to identify this drug is most likely the problem.

I never did attribute all of the new joint aches and pains that I have with this medicine as I only take 10mg with HCTZ 25mg but I am starting to realize that is what maybe causing all of this for me. I am still in denial that I will have to take something for the rest of my life in order to keep it under control so I will be losing weight of which I have already done and eating better. I can't stand to have to be on medication and I am an nurse. My BP now runs in the low 118/75. My BP use to be in the 100/70 range.

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	55-64	1/15/2010 2:03:28 AM	I have well-controlled myasthenia gravis and I am taking Lisinopril, Norvasc, and Diovan to control my blood pressure. I would like to know if these drugs are safe with MG.  I lost a son about 4 years ago and my husband has been a Hospice patient since March 06, 2009.  I am sole care giver.  I recently felt like I was losing my mind or having a breakdown, so my doctor put me on Zoloft 75mg daily.  It has certainly taken the edge off but I am horrified of it!  I have been told that withdrawing from it is a living nightmare!  It seems to agree with the MG, but I would really, really like to know if ALL of these meds are safe with MG.  Thank you.

High Blood Pressure	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	65-74	1/11/2010 12:39:26 AM	I have been taking this drug for many years. I have never associated any of the sleep, cough, or allergy problems others report, even though some of my previous reactions could have been as a result of this drug. However, I also take atenolol. Dr is going to take me off the beta blocker, and up the dosage of this drug. Not sure what the result will be, but i will report back if there are any adverse effects. The atenolol did cause me to lose taste for a time, but it eventually came back. I do have to urinate quite often, but don't know if it is related to this drug.

Yes, I'm diabetic (type 2), but my blood pressure is fine. Every time I've tested my blood sugar, it's well within range. (I'm on actos). I've been taking this medication for 5 days and experience nausea with some vision problems. I currently take 8 pill medications per day (including lisinopril and aspirin) and two eye-drop medications per day. I feel like I'm being medicated to death. At what point are all the medications more than enough? What can I do to prevent what I believe is over-medication.

He has complained of watery eyes, sinus problems, cough, but we attributed it to his COPD. It did help his HBP, but just had a very scary reaction: a dangerously swollen tongue. Rushed to ER, they got him immediately. The first thing the dr. asked was: are you on Lisinopril? Yes. They have seen this reaction many times before from people who have taken it for a long time, and even after they have quit. He was admitted to Critical Care Unit overnight.  Very jarring experience as he's never had ANYTHING like that before. The med has been discontinued and he will need to get another one to help the diltiazen keep the BP down. Not a good experience!!!

I quit taking the lisinopril and my voice became strong again and not shaky...I began again and there went my voice.  Have any of you had similar problems?

I was put on losartan instead so far so good.

High Blood Pressure	Cassandra, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	12/15/2009 6:46:23 PM	I gave this drug a one star for effectivenss and ease of use not because it wasn't easy to swallow the pill or because it didn't lower my blood pressure.  I would have liked to give a no star for satisfaction however.  I developed all the side effects after several months until I truly felt I would rather die of a heart attack than feel the way I felt on this drug.  I quit taking it on my own.  I feel a little better, but if my vision problems that developed because of it don't soon reverse, I will be extremely unhappy, more than I am now.

I have had good success with Lisinopril.  The cough others have indicated was also a problem but I stuck with the meds and the cough is now gone after about 3-4 months with it.  I have leg cramps also but have had them for years.  the secret to dealing with them is to keep my legs and feet very warm at night.My blood pressure is never higher than 120/80 and my heart rate is about 62.  Previously my resting heart rate was 102.If you can stick with the meds thru the first six months I think some of the side effects will lessen.

High Blood Pressure	mermo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	11/30/2009 7:16:36 PM	Brought my BP down over the course of 3 weeks:190/120 to 123/82, so it does the job but in the meantime I feel like I am not alive any more.  Exhaustion, headaches, chills, sweats, loss of appetite, and feeling like my head is not screwed on straight. Dr. switched me to another med but if side effects make you too tired to exercise and take care of yourself what are we gaining ?...very frustrating- but hoping to find a balance

Blurred vision about 60 minutes after taking at bedtime. Decreased sexual ability [very noticable change.] Chest pain  Faint to mild lasting only 15  30 minutes. None last few weeks. Breathing OK. Stomach/abdominal pain/ nausea [mild, but daily] Excessive sweating/head, face and ears get very red and feel very hot [about 5-6 time a day.] Will ask doctor to go back to 20 mg and hope side effects go away.

It works at lowering my bp but the fatigue and tiredness is intolerable.  I also can't sleep at night.  One thing which I haven't gotten is the cough.  I am going to see my doctor for the insomnia which has been horrible for me.

The doctor put me on 10mg of lisinopril, it brought my BP down to 150/75, but brought my erectile ability to about 90% of what it normally is (still okay). Doctor increased to 20mg and then 40mg. At 20mg and 40mg (no difference between the two), my BP was around 135/75 and but my erectile ability dropped to about 40%...which is not okay. I am a personal trainer, and am only 25...too young to be dealing with impotence. Changed to cozaar, which lowers bp about 10 points and adds to sexual ability.

High Blood Pressure	mowdawg, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	45-54	11/27/2009 8:23:44 AM	Had been taking this drug about 2 months and developed a cough almost immediately.  Generally when I lay down to sleep the cough begins and persists for almost an hour.  Thought the cough was related to a cold I had just gotten over until I realized other people on this drug had the cough.  Also, started getting occasional ringing in my ears which now is almost non-stop.  Took myself off the med 3 days ago and will be seeing my dr next week, AND an ENT for the hearing.  45 yr old male.

Then the doctor added 12.5 mg of a diuretic once a day, then 12.5 twice a day and still no change (except for more frequent bathroom trips).I am not impressed with Lisinopril at all but it worked for my Dr.'s wife so he likes it.  If I am taking meds for hypertension, especially 2 meds twice a day I don't want just improved BP, I want GOOD BP.  I don't know what the change will be next month.

Also sneezing and sneezing in fits sometimes uncontrollable is another issue

I took it with another hi BP med and it was fine.  On day I woke up, took my meds and in an hour I could not get the energy to get off of the couch.  My BP was 86/40.  After a couple more days of this, I finally stopped the med.  It was working too well with the other med and I was unable to function with that low BP.  I would say the med worked well but not to mix it with another without good follow up.

Dr switched it from expensive Diovan.  Right away the coughing started...all day and ESPECIALLY as soon as I lay down at night, non-stop.  5 minutues after I am in bed I cant breathe and I stay all stuffed up all night.  Cant used any decongestants.  Another stupid thing I noticed a couple of years back was incontinence.  Coughing all nite causes me to pee constantly.  I hate it.  I do have to say that the med does definitely work with my other meds to lower the pressure.  I went from 235/130 average to 116/70.  So it does work even if I pee every time I cough.

I have allergies and congestion is hard to get rid of.

High Blood Pressure	Runner, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	11/22/2009 1:52:33 AM	Ever since my first episode of anxiety my blood pressure has been elevated and my doctor decided it was finally time to get on a blood pressure med. He prescribed Lisinopril. Hours after taking my first dose my upper abdomen hurt so bad as though I had some type of internal injuries. I began throwing up, fainting and ended up unable to walk much less even sit up for 3 days. I stopped taking it because I thought I had the flu and was too sick to even worry about my BP. When I got well I started the med again and my stomach had me doubled over in pain again for days. I finally read other reviews and learned from Lucky and Levettep it was this Lisinopril that was making me severely ill, like them. I saw my doctor and had to have an abdominal ultrasound to rule out gallbladder problems. I ended up being treated for Gastritis and was told I had a bad allergic reaction to this drug. It's  been almost 2 months now and my stomach is still not healed. I have never in my life had a bad reaction to a drug like I did Lisinopril. No wonder it warns it can kill your unborn child if you're pregnant, I was so ill I felt as though it was going to kill me. Thank you to those who shared their experience with this drug, otherwise I don't think I would have figured out it was this BP med. that was making me so ill. The FDA should take a closer look at this dangerous medication and possibly recall it. I don't know if my stomach will ever completely heal!!!

I also have a pain in the right side of my neck. Only been on  Lisinopril since end of May. I finally went to a throat specialist and he told me about this drug and this cough being one of the side effects.

I take 10mg: My BP has been consistantly good, no big fluctuations, and No More Panic Attacks!  (thank God!)  So far, so good (3 months now).  Although I do still have some anxiety left over from when I was taking Benicar...hoping that will go away soon.  It's fairly annoying.  But the good news is Lisinipril has been ok for me.

I started coughing soon after starting the drug but did not know it was a side effect.  I was coughing up to 100 times a day.  The cough got so bad that my dr. sent me to an allergist an ENT dr., plus chest xrays and lots of meds to try to control the cough.  I finally read about the side effects and got put on a med that is not an ACE.  My dr. never mentioned the side effects of this med.!!!  Even after a year of suffering daily and numerous appointments.  I feel like a fool for not looking this up sooner.  I still have the cough but it's getting less &amp; less.

Doc said to &quot;be patient. Takes a while to work in some people.&quot; I have tried other highBP meds without success, so put on lisinopril 10 mg. in May-mild dizziness and fatigue but no change in BP or 140/90 to 170/100. Increased to 20 mg in early August-chronic sore throat, fatigue, dizziness and balance problems worse. Increased to 30 mg. on Halloween. Sore throat became wet cough, insomnia, and draining nose. All getting worse and think these are from the Lisinopril. Money is limited, so have been patient in trying to get BP down. Have seen no change in BP and increasing side effects.

High Blood Pressure	I Feel Good!, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	65-74	11/12/2009 3:49:01 PM	BP was 210/90 before getting this med. After one month it was 150/80, and was given a double dose script. After one month BP went to 120/50 so with this and some light exercise and diet I feel confident it works with NO adverse affects.
High Blood Pressure	poorkitty, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	11/12/2009 6:09:47 AM	Had to switch from Hyzarr to Lisinopril, a less expensive drug. My doctor gave me samples to take for 3 week to see if I could tolerate it. Almost immediately I developed a cough which I thought was an allergy to weather changes. Now, in the third week, the cough is horrible especially at night or when lying down. (Includes heavy sinus drainage resulting in coughing to point of gagging) Definitely trying something else!

Product works, but side effects include dizziness at times, headache, vertigo, and at times, one feels as if their head is going to explode.  BP stays low.  besides this med, also on verapamil, digoxin, aspirin, effexor XR, and others, due to heart problems and the end result of two open heart surgeries.  Still vertical and still a working stiff, instead of a 'dead' stiff.  A pill for everything, but things work.  too bad beer wasn't included in the therapy, I could use one or two everyday.lisonopril is cheap enough, and effective.

I've quit taking this junk - couldn't figure out why the cramps in my  toes, feet,and in my side under my rib cage just wouldn't go away - after reading these reviews, I know why!  I also have figured out the reason I can't sleep at night so we will advise the Dr and have him change my meds - I didn't have the terrible cough, but my husband has to be removed from this medication after only a weeks usage due to the cough!

Found out, after lung xray and ENT work that Lisinopril is and ACE inhibitor with a large number of people suffering the cough side effect.  Wayyy more than the 4% the drug company claims.

High Blood Pressure	lpric, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	10/6/2009 6:38:43 PM	I had a allergic reaction from this drug, which caused a severe rash on my forearms, neck, chest, face and forehead and hair line costing hair loss. This has taken place since  October 2008. I am still caring the rash scars on my face, neck and chest with redness still in hair line. I was seen by a Dermatologist and he was of no success in resolving this condition. I am still trying to find a cure to take this away from. I get looked at funny and I have very low self-esteem of my looks. I work in the public environment.  If anyone has a solution to my condition I would greatly appreciate any input.

Now I get a sore throat every night which can wake me up.  I forgot to take a pill one day and the next morning woke up with no sore throat. So I am convinced that the Lisinopril is causing my nightly sore throat.

I was taking just 5 mg per day.  The cough became so persistent, I was buying cough drops, using Vicks on my throat, etc.  Went to the doctor, thinking I had a medical problem.  She determined it was the Lisinopril.  After about 2 weeks of being off it, the cough went away and has not returned.

I had been on Hydrachloathiazide for a few years which didn't help much in reducing my hypertension.  I didn't experience a cough or any lack of energy, but I think I might be able to go back to drinking coffee with caffiene.  The lower BP seems to make me drowsy after lunch when I drink my usual decaf.

I had muscus, coughing, horrible congestion, which was so bad I hated going to a store as people thought I was so sick and did not want to be near me. Sleeping because of it was out of the question, because of the coughing. I was told that the new version which is not genetic addresses this problem. It was dollars a pill, and i could not afford it. I am on nothing now as I started a walking program, but I am now under a lot of stress and it is climbing again.  Do not know what iI am going to do. Seeing Dr. tomorrow.

I never noticed a cough until I read these reviews. I have to cut a 20mg pill in half so I don't lower my BP to fast. When I take a 10mg pill, Sometimes when I work hard and expel a lot of sweat, I start to feel very dizzy, I get pale, And get the cold sweats from my forehead and I have to lay down. I've experienced this for 7 years now. It's a result of extreme lowered BP. I've checked my BP when experiencing this feeling and my BP was 99 over 55 and yes, I literally felt like passing out. This is very strong BP medication and I would tell people to use extreme caution while taking this medication.  : )

Attempted to switch times of taking drug with HCTZ at night to accomodate my waking hours because I now work nights. Lack of sleep frequently cause me to forget to take the medication and then I over compensate.  This doesn't always work well.  Presently I have taken 2 pills approx. 12-18 hours apart during the day.  I may just stay with day time med administration.

It did a good job in lowering my blood pressure, but the coughing became a big problem.  At first it was mildly irritating and I could control it with throat lozenges.  Recently the coughing was day and night and spasms lasted several minutes.  I finally complained and the doctor changed my prescription to cozaar today.

Verapamil 2x day wasthen added to the lisinopril 2xday and whenI was at the dr. yesterday my blood pressurewas as it was before beginning the first dose of lisinopril.  In my opinion, taking this drug has not worked for me. I had no adverse reactions except some dizziness which also could have been from some of theother meds I am taking.

I had massive headaches, musscle cramps, tightness of the jaw, dry mouth, weakness and anxiety.  After the first month it was great, brought my BP down to normal numbers then the cough started.  I coughed so much that my ribs hurt.  Then it became so bad that I would wet myself because of the uncontrollable cough.  PLease if you are on this and experience any of these ask your Dr. to change your RX.

I am taking metformin too.  I'm going in for my 3-mo checkup to get stats after/before use.  I believe another reason I was put on it was because my kidneys were not processing protein, and I was expelling it. I've lost 12 lbs so far since not being able to have protein processed and retained.  I'm not happy about that because I am a bodybuilder -- I'm not a happy camper right now.  I just turned 50 in March.  My maternal grandmother and paternal grandfather were diabetics.

In the past couple of years I have developed a consistent cough and post nasal drip that keeps me awake at night, and I cannot get rid of it.  I also think that my light headedness has been caused by this medication.  I have lupus, very mild, and have to take prednisone for it.  I will call my Dr, and see about changing my meds.

After 3 years, the atenolol caused impotence. My doctor switched me to lisinopril. It then took about 2 years to get back to maybe 50% ability. Now, 5 years later, I'd say I'm at about 80%, but it could be my age and not the medication. Otherwise, I have had no side effects and good blood pressure, even though i don't exercise much.

My mom had to rush herself to the hospital at 3am on Friday 8/21/09 after the tonge and face had swollen.  Her tongue covered her entire mouth , I mean top to bottom and check to check.  The tongue covered her entire mouth.  Her face was almost swollen beyond recognition, and her tongue almost blocked her airway.  After she was admitted the Dr at the hospital explained that the mediation cause her tongue/face to swell and she probably needed a better medication. She thought she was having a stroke.  After a few calls from family members inquiring on her status.  I was shocked to see my grandfather (my mom's dad) and my great uncle (grandfathers brother) both has to be taken off Lisinopril after being rushed to the E.R for the same symptons.  I told my uncle since he and his wife are also on Lisinopril, he was shoked and said he would see his Dr. right away.  My moms morning nurse in the hospital told me to be sure when her pysicians follows up with her after being released, he doesn't prescribe anything in the &quot; Pril&quot; family of blood pressure medication.  Or any ACE Inhibitors, since they are know to have various side effects.  It also seems a lot of people have problems at or around 2+ years on Lisinopril.  It just a shame what is happening to so many people on this medication, I think the manufacturer knows this isn't a few cases, or random mishaps, it's a serious problem with this medication and I would avoid it at all cost !!!!

The cough started out light &amp; after some years it got so bad I was bring up flem from my lungs &amp; I also started having joint pains all over my body that I am starting to believe was caused by it.I say if you take it &amp; start to have a slight cough or any other symptom STOP USING IT  PLEASE.COZARR has brought my blood pressure down to the normal range for the first time in almost ten years  116 TO 118 over  68  which is impressive for me because the lisinopril was never able to get my pressure below 130 over 80.  STAY AWAY FROM  LISINOPRIL.  your doctor will leave you on any meds you will continue to take unless you insist that they give you something that is better for you . they will tell you a little cough is normal.Normal for who????  pay attention &amp; see if your doctor is walking aroung coughing or in pain. I think not !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am not certain that the drug is causing this tingling/pain on the crown of my head, but it began almost immediately after I raised the dosage. It feels like a crown of needles or electrical charge in my scalp, just in the crown or back of my head. It occasionally stops, but is very annoying. Has anyone else experienced this problem?&gt;

It was like a tickle constantly on either side of my throat. So the doctor took me off it and I tried a bunch of other blood pressure medications that hardly helped and made me sooo dizzy all the time. So I told the doctor I'd rather cough than be dizzy and we continued on with the lisinopril. I tried Allegra with it and the coughing stopped. Now, a year later I don't even need the Allegra. And my blood pressure stays perfect.

My cough would come out of no where starting with a 'tickle' feeling and nothing worked to stop it. Woke me up at night and in the morning; came on in middle of conversations! Since I was told Lisinopril is drug of choice for protecting kidneys for diabetics, and I have both issues (B/P and diabetes) I tried my hardest thinking the cough would subside, but never did. My doc gave me Cozaar and it has no ill effects for me. If I didn't cough, I'd stay on Lisinopril as Cozaar is very expensive with no generic.

The bottle said to take 3 - 40mg pills per day.  After my dad took the third pill, he passed out at a restaurant and was rushed to the hospital via ambulance.  Tests revel that an overdose of Lisinopril caused his BP to drop to 62 over 40.  He is still in the hospital and should be released after 2 days.  We're lucky he did not fall asleep at home or he might not have woken up.  Never take more than 40mg a day.

My hands went numb, I was extremely tired and slightly depressed.  Once my doctor switched me to another med, side effects cleared up and I was once again able to exercise fully.  I found this drug made it difficult to perform daily tasks, and I was exhausted and slept often after exercising.  I was taking daily naps, which I don't ever do now that I have switched, and never did before.

Dr. advised me to half the medication.  Then the tingling and feeling of needles started into the palms of my hands also.  Before I contacted the dr. again my left wrist began to hurt but advil helped with the pain.  Now I am advised to not continue this one at all and hopefully all the feelings will come back as soon as all of the Lisinopril is out of my system.  I'm now on another drug to see if it works.

My doctor tried to convince me to stop taking it for a long time, but it worked so well, I resisted trying something else.  I tolerated the dry cough. But the cough got much worse after the dosage was increased from 20mg daily to 40mg daily.  It turned into an asthyma sounding cough.  I would almost black out at times.  I felt like I was drowning.  Doctor insisted that I get off lisinopril.  This time I agreed.  I am willing to try anything.  Had a chest x-ray-normal.  I have had the cough for seven months now.  I have only stopped the lisinopril for two days, so I am not sure if that is the cause of the chronic cough.  Doctor has been treating me for asthyma and allergies.  The allergy drugs seem to help, but no improvement with inhalants for asthyma symptoms.

More recently experienced scarey episodes of light headed and dizzy spells which led me back to the dr.  I am now on hydrochlorizide and and finding all of the symptoms mentioned above are COMPLETELY gone.  I encourage anyone experiencing any affects mentioned above to talk to your dr about changing medication asap.  There are several alternatives available.

I'm started to feel down and depressed throughout the day and when I go to bed my mind is still pretty busy so its hard to fall asleep, not sure if its the medicine or not.No other side effects yet but that could be because its a small dosage. No other medicines taken. I hope this helps someone.

Occasional slight cough, but a chronic runny nose.

Dr. took me off it on 6/22/09 &amp; put me on methylprednisolone 4mg to clear up symptoms. Much better now except I still have rashes/itching. Not aware of these problems before I read here. This has been a real wakeup call for me as I was surprised that side effects could take over 1 yr to show up!

High Blood Pressure	joannca1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	2	Female	45-54	6/26/2009 9:08:37 PM	I switched from Atenolol to Lisinopril about 20 days ago.  50 mgs. of Atenolol was making me extremely dizzy - like a drunk staggering around.  I switched to 5 mg. of Lisinopril.  The cough is a little irritating - my husband has commented on it, but I don't know how dangerous it is.  Maybe just irritating?  Anyway, the last two days I have had difficulty urinating - like I'm on the verge of a urinary tract infection.  I called the pharmacy, but they don't seem to think it is the drug.  I would like to know if anyone else has had this reaction to Lisinopril, or if it is just a coincidence.  Right now, I can't figure out if I need an antibiotic, or if this is just another irritating side effect that doesn't cause any real harm.

Has worked extremly well for me all this time but had to discontinue taking it.

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	6/19/2009 11:14:36 PM	I have been taking this medicine for three years.  This morning I woke up and my right upper lip was completely swollen.  While at the ER, the doctor said that it was a common side effect--even if the person had taken it for a prolonged period of time. I had to go back to the ER about 3 hours later because my mouth became even bigger! As I was checking in, a nurse looked at my mouth and said, &quot;Oh, you take Lisinopril, right? I see that reaction all the time here, plus, I had it myself.&quot;  The second Dr. came out and told me my airwaves and oxygen were okay and that I was just going to have to wait it out (they had earlier prescribed me Benyadryl and a steroid). Then he explained he had to stop using the medicine himself because is tongue became swollen. This is a common occurance. And if you are like me, you assume if you are going to have a reaction to a medicine, it's going to be rather early.  This side effect can take time before it shows. Be careful, apparently it is a very common incident with this drug.

Loose weight no bacon etc.  Feel so much better to be off of the medicine.

High Blood Pressure	aleah, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female		6/9/2009 5:22:32 PM	I started taking lisinopril in Oct. 2008. Developed a drippy nose, and a cough; did not think it was the med.  In Feb. Dr. increased dosage (even tho bp had dropped)3 days later I developed allergy symptoms; congestion,very runny nose and loss of hearing. Went to Dr. took cipro 10 days; no help; saw reports so cut med in half and seemed better; hearing better; May 27 developed severe sinus infection (never before had one) took Z-Pak 10 days; added 2 more antibiodics and hearing is still getting worse.  Beware of ototoxic drugs - ask Drs.  Am seeing Dr. in 2 days and have an appt. to ear/nose/throat spec. next week.Hearing loss may be irreversible.  It did help my blood pressure, but so did my prev. one. Worse part is you have these problems and impossible to see Dr. - and they dont always listen. Should have seen spec. earlier, but as one Dr. said &quot;you just need a hearing aid&quot;  I told my new Dr. that I will not take lisinopril again.Does anyone else notice hearing loss - I am very hard of hearing and can't hear phone ring and I was the one who &quot;heard&quot; a pin drop til this started.  Be careful of drugs!  I only found out about the side effects on this site - thank you!Dr.

Has anyone else ever experienced this salty mouth/tongue thing?

High Blood Pressure	ROSE, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	5/25/2009 8:05:33 PM	A few days after I began taking Lisinopril I started to have a tickle in my throat. I would cough all day and night. My cough was so fierce that my windpipe got raw. Every time I coughed it felt like I was catching a cold. I would get a feeling in my nose  like you would if you were getting sick. I stopped taking Lisinopril about three weeks after I started taking it. I developed a SEVERE sinus infection and was put on 1500mg of AMOXICILLIN. I continue to have coughing that will not go away despite stopping this medication more then 2 months ago. I have never (I'm 52) had any kind of sinus problems until I took Lisinopril. I would suggest to anyone that might be considering this medication NOT to take it. I will live with this for the rest of my life.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	45-54	5/17/2009 10:25:55 AM	Insurance requirement for me to change to cheaper lisinopril vs. Benecar HCT which I have had no prob's with for 2 years. Thought I had a strange sinus infection where I would absolutely drown at night with post nasal drip. 3 dr trips and a mountain of antibiotic later where as soon as I would stop it would come back I wised up and changed back to Benecar that I had left over. Got better within 24 hours. Lisinopril was a nightmare for me. Now the damn insurance company has me trying diovan HCT. I'll be sure to monitor the situation this time instead of suffering on lisinopril for a month! 
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	55-64	5/16/2009 5:31:06 PM	Started this medication April 1st due to losing my job and could not afford Atacand any longer. Had side effects within couple days with leg cramps, nightmares,anxiety,insomia,sweating, ruberly legs. Then 8days into taking medicine cough started, heavy mucous in throat,sinus congestion and headache and throat tickle,allergy symptoms.Coughing so bad was throwing up all the time from the mucous. In last 7 weeks been to doctor twice-I have had 4 shots, 2 breathing treatments, 2 z-packs of prednisone, 2 different antibodies, 3 cough medicines and two nasal sprays,2 blood tests and one chest x-ray. Nothing showed up in any of the tests. Each time I would get better on medicine, then relapse 2 days after completing medicine. I thought at the time I was dealing with two separate problems,side effects from lisinopril and upper respiratory infection. Last night I tried to attend my grandson ballgame and coughed so much, lost my breath couldn't swallow from mucous in throat, felt like I was drowning from fluid. After I got home got onto internet and read these reviews,and knew right away it was the Lisinopril, not upper respiratory infection.I have not taken one since Thursday night, will call cardilogist Mon. and report side effects and go onto something else. If you start taking this medicine and cough starts, stop immediately, because it only gets really worse after that. Trying to save monjey by going onto genetic, and have spent close to $500.00 in last 6 weeks.

He prescribed lexapro at the same time.  I'm not sure why my bp increased.  It could be my anxiety, or my hot flashes, or my job stress.  I have noticed a decrease in hot flashes, which has been helpful.  My bp is normal now.  I am very fatigued and have gained weight for no apparent reason.  The jury is still out on this one . . .

About a week before seeing the doctor, before he had put me on lisinopril, I was downtown and thought I was fixing to have a heart attack or a stroke, because my face felt numb. Anyway, I saw a policeman and he called an ambulance and I ended up finding out from the emergency room doctor that I was experencing those problems because my blood pressure was too high. That week before going to the doctor, I couldn't even walk half a block before experiencing bad symptoms. A week after my doctor put me on this drug, I could do my regular daily activities with NO PROBLEMS any more! It was like a miracle drug for me. I still got to watch what things I eat and how much sodium I put into my body, but I think this drug works great most of the time. I have been on it for 18 months now. I take 10mg once a day at around 6:30 pm.

HOWEVER, I developed an excruciating cough soon after I started taking it... even struggling to catch my breath at times. The cough started in Nov., 2008(the beginning of cold weather) and continued until one week after I stopped the drug.  I thought I had lung cancer-even tho I don't smoke!Now I have lost my senses of tasting and smelling. Is it connected?  I know the cough was caused by the drug because of all the reviews I had read online.  Be careful with this drug.

I believe it caused dehydration at that doasage one time a day causing these systmes. Until it get with my doctor, I am changing the dosage back to the orginal 5 mg two times a day. You need to be your own advocate.

The leg muscles swelled and it was very painful to walk.  I felt like my legs were becoming paralyzed. This was Lisinopril/HCTZ 12.5 mg HCTZ (hydrochlorithiazide) has worked well for me alone, as has Metoporal.  The Lisinopril affected me for about 12 hours.  I do not know why it affected me or what it did to my body but I will not be taking it again.  Warnings for muscle cramps was in my pharmacy handout but I did not see it here.

The fact that I have refrained from any alcohol, decreasing my salt intake and taking 2000 mg./day of Omega 3 has helped tremendously in lowing my blood pressure.  My next goal is to stop smoking entirely in hope that I will not have to take ANY medication in the future.

High Blood Pressure	Brobeo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	45-54	4/14/2009 9:52:44 AM	I took 20mg per day for three years to treat HBP. Developed the night time, itchy back of throat cough, metalic taste, sometimes dizzy when first standing up, noticable reduction of libido, restless sleep and many times waking from sleep feeling very warm, sometimes sweating, and my heart rate very high.  After reading most of these postings, decided enough of this!  I needed to change my eating habits, lose weight and exercise.  I cut my dose in 1/2 for a month, then down to 1/4 for another month.  Check with your doctor before reducing your dose.  During this time I ate less and better, and began to exercise at least five days a week, 30 plus minutes a day.  I now sleep soundly, no waking up overheated, no itchy cough, metalic taste is gone, dizzy no more.  After four months, I weigh 30 lbs less with 25 lbs to more to go.  Point is, ditch the meds and take control.

I thought it was due to my allergies, and I didn't tell the doctor about the cough, although I did tell him about my sinus;s and stuffy head.  Make sure that you mention the cough, or the doctors do not link that symtom with Lisinopril.

I was searching for my mom actually, she been on Lisinopril for about 4+ years and she has been complaining about sore muscles and trouble sleeping, trouble swallowing and very fatigue. The doctor even gave her medication for depression so she can sleep. I even thought she had fibromi---- (can't spell either) but nothing, thank you very much for the comments I will have her check out. Maybe all those years of pain has to do with the high blood pressure medication.

I also have body aches and coughing.  I thought the body aches were laying restless in the bed at night but now know thats probably from this drug as well.  I also experience the lightheadedness.  Will be going to the Dr next week and see if I cant get this medication changed!

I had side effects of a dry cough, spitting up, and it continued until 4/7/09 when I switched back to Benicar. My pharmacist said the Lisinopril has an ACE Inhibitor ingredient and the Benicar does not. A lot of people have coughing, etc reactions. I only tried the Lisinopril becacuse of cost of $4 vs Benicar $40 thru Humana prescription drug plan

High Blood Pressure	linisopril, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Male	55-64	4/2/2009 10:36:36 PM	I posted a self review yesterday but after reading some of the complants from people I realise I have had alot of the problems as well. After a day or two taking lisinopril I started tossing &amp; turning in bed not able to sleep because my musles were sore. I thought I was getting fibromialgia. (can't spell) I will say it has gone away now but I still have this wad of flim in my throat I just can't seem to swallow. It does work for me if I can do somthing about this flim. My BP was 134/ 82 at the Dr's office the other day and it hasen't been that low for a long time. I also get very tired very quick and just don't feel like doing a thing. The DR dismissed it as being lazy but I think it is the medicine. I'm 62 and what I think is fairly healthy for that age. I was wondering if anyone has had the flim in the throat?

I have been on this medication for about 3 years. However, I am constantly dizzy.  I did experience the dry cough for a few months, but that went away. My vision is somewhat blurry at times too.

As I'm typing this there is a jag of it in my throat right now and it's driving me crazy. Other than that and getting tired really really fast I must be doing OK.

My doctor felt that I needed to up the dose to (10mg)- and it did not help! (160/113 p114)  This drug caused aweful side effects including a deep cough. I went back in to the doctor because I thought maybe something was wrong with my home bp cuff...it wasn't wrong - my bp was going up and getting worse.  She took me off and put me back on Zebeta (10mg) and the pressure this morning is back to 124/82 p 67.  I really believe if I kept taking this drug it would have led to a heart attack based on my body reaction.
High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	3/28/2009 12:38:45 AM	I have been taking 10mg 2x daily for about 1 year and it has lowered my bloodpressure, 129/89. Tonight in a desperate attempt to get information on my severe cough and asthma/bronchial spasms, I accidentally ran into an article linking lisinopril. It never crossed my mind that this could be the reason for my severe allergy and asthma attacks. Since the begining of 2009, I have been treated three times with the Z-pak and have to keep my albutorol inhaler on my person. One incident was so severe, I had to be taken to the ER. These coughing attacks usually occur at nights. I have an appointment to see an allergist/immunologist for next week. Reading about 100 of these reviews tonight have brought tears to my eyes because of how much I have been suffering with these symptoms over the past year. I will stop this medication immediately and will see my Dr on Monday. I do also experience extreme fatigue, extreme heartburn, weightgain and lightheadedness quite regularly. This is amazing.

This is a horrible poison. From now on, I will check this website before purchasing meds. I suggest you ask your doctor for samples because it seems that bp meds all have side effects, and you have to choose the one that will affect you the least. Bad medicine! 
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	3/26/2009 9:54:43 PM	Well I was very surprised after reading at least 30 reviews; but now I know why I have my coughing, especially at night. I have been on this med since Jan 2006. Due to my multi-level disk desinegration &amp; bulging disks I figured that was why my BP was often unstable &amp; in the low high range for HBP..I need to see a doctor about possibly changing this med to something else.

After reviewing over 500 of these reviews I am now convinced that these symptoms are related to Lisinopril. I definitely need to address my BP problem, but not be with this drug!

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	3/23/2009 9:10:42 AM	This medication caused severe swelling of my upper lip after only one 10 mg dose.  Approximately 18 hours after taking the first dose, the swelling started.  At first it was just a small portion of my upper lip.  By the end of dinner, it was my whole upper lip.  It looked like a collagen treatment gone bad.  I didn't go to the emergency room that night, because I knew it wasn't an allergic reaction, but when I got up the next morning and the swelling was moving into the skin directly under my nose, I did go to an urgent care clinic.  Luckily my fears weren't completely justified.  I was told not to take any more of the meds and to take a steroid for 5 days to mitigate the effects of the Lisoprinil as it worked it's way out of my system.  Thank heavens the swelling went down.  I was getting all kinds of stares.  My boyfriend jokingly referred to it as duck lips once we both knew it was something that could be easily treated.  It's funny now, but scared the heck out of me when I saw how much swelling was present.  Be careful with this one!

I went to 3 different Dr's/Nurse Pract. at the same practice. They all gave me Z-pak antibiotics and cough medicine. The problem came back after 10 months, then 5 months, then 2 months. Finally I got in to my prescribing Doctor. The first thing he said was &quot;Lisinopril causes cough&quot; and took me off it.
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/19/2009 5:46:27 PM	Been on it a month (5mg).  No noticeable side effects and it appears to be working in bringing down my BP. I am about 30 lbs overweight and I am also combining this with walking, drinking a lot of water, and overhaul of my diet which may be helping also.

Take 20 mg. at night which causes extreme dry mouth, stomach upset, and severe leg cramps! Toss and turn all night. Dr. said to stop taking it temporarily, and I have. BP back up. Will try again in a 2-3 weeks to see if symptoms return.
High Blood Pressure	taxgirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/18/2009 1:09:27 PM	Only on it for 4 weeks so far for high BP (5 mg).  It appears to be working and I've  not experienced any dizziness or coughing as others have.  I am presently about 30 lbs overweight and I pretty much know that's a good portion of my BP problem anyway so I also started walking again - about 2 miles a day and do some lifting of low weight dumbells about 3 nights a week and drink a lot more water to flush my system.  Maybe this is helping keep away  some of these symptoms.  Also have elderly father in home who cannot use salt so low sodium has always been a way of life here which also helps so we'll see how continued use gets.

Now I have extreme anxiety and pressure spikes bad enough to pass out. The worst spike was 175 over 134 with a pulse of 127 while not doing anything but sitting. This hurt so bad I thought I was going to die. Later, I was just evil acting to my loved ones for no reason other than being truly scared,

However, I had a sudden allergic reaction which landed me in the emergency room after my tongue swelled so badly that it was affecting my breathing.  This has happened to two other people I know -- coincidentally all of use middle-aged African Americans.  After doing some research, I discovered that the incidence of allergic reactions to ACE inhibitors is approximately doubled in the African-American population than in the general population.

I can NO longer put up with increased dizzy spells(sitting,standing or lying down) Heart palpatations etc. My doctor does not seem concerned. After months of complaining I have gone from 40 mgs to 5 to Nothing because I was still symptomatic on 5 mgs. I refuse to take this drug anymore, I can't afford the trips to the ER for low pressure . I had never been to this or similar sites until today. symptom list is identical to mine. I don't like this drug at all.

My co-pay was increased, which made Lisinopril much cheaper. I feel lousy on the Lisinopril, light-headed, spacey, not focused, unusual knee pain, and drowsy.  I plan to go back to Zestril immediately.  It did a great job for me, kept my BP down, without any side effects.  Lisinopril has not kept my numbers as low as they should be.  BP is elevated, and the air-headedness is ridiculous.  I even got a speeding ticket!  Haven't had one in 40 yrs! Just wasn't focused on my driving, which is unusual.  That's dangerous.  Returning to my Zestril...pronto!  You get what you pay for in this world. I won't skimp on meds again....

Started having sore throat, cough, vomitting, and dizziness.  Thought I had the flu.  Too dizzy to stand or walk.  Went to ER. BP was 197/100.  Waited 10 hours, was never seen, and went home.  BP had come down to 180/94.  Saw my DR. the next day.  Treated for flu (antibiotic) and increased bp med. 2 weeks later, still sick.  Bp has not come down below 148/88.  After 3 weeks, finally feeling better, but bp is still a little high.  After 1 month, it all comes back again, especially sore throat &amp; cough.  Called DR. and he is taking me off this med.  Now I'll try benicor.  Hopefully, it will work better.

It wasn't worth me saving a few dollars a month to feel that miserable. I have NO side effects with the Benicar and it works for me.

In addition to being treated for high blood pressure I am being treated for asthma.  No matter what my doctor prescribed to control my coughing spells it did not help.  By accident I discovered that Lisinopril causes coughing spells in some patients.  I stopped taking Lisinopril and the coughing spells and asthma have both gone away.  I now take Telmisartan (Micardis) and my blood pressure is just where my doctor thinks it ought to be.

Donaby, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	3/3/2009 8:17:20 AM	I've taken this Medicine, 30 mg daily with HTCZ 25 mg, since 1989. It has worked for me well, until first of year, then numbers started edging up to 140/90 in late Jan. Until then, BP consistently around 117/80. Had to add, daily, Norvasc 10 mg to bring BP back to normal. I have endured these years with such side effects of: periodic times of wavy blue lines in northwest corner of my vision,short breath when carrying any weight of 25+ pounds upstairs ie... boxes, groceries, etc... .  insomnia, right calf ache periodically, ED, and at times, listlessness.

After being rushed to the emergency room and giving them the list of my meds, the ER Doctor knew immediatly what caused the reaction and was able to reverse the effect.  This medicine almost took my life.

High Blood Pressure	Teaapples, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	3/1/2009 2:54:13 PM	About 4 years ago I complained to my Dr. that the Zestril I was taking wasn't working anymore,(I read my pressure at home),so she put me on Lisinopril,little did I know it was the same med. My pressure did come down but I felt tired.  I also suffer from depression and anxiety,so I contributed alot of the side effects to that. I started having chest discomfort,like a throbby heart beat and then skipping beats and the Dr. raised my antidepressants,but I still had that chest discomfort. I went through a battery of heart tests and all were negative,my heart was in good condition,BUT the discomfort would come and go.  Last summer I developed a pain in my left side and my vision was getting blurry. I saw the Eye Dr. and I had an eye infection,which seems to return each spring for the past 2 years.  The chest discomfort was really bad the past 2 years and I had no idea that this med was noted for this condition.  I saw my Dr. 2 days ago because I'm sick of feeling this bad,she didn't change the meds.just said that she thought maybe I needed some more tests on my heart.  After reading all of these reviews,I now know that the Lisinopril is responsible for them.  I trusted my Dr. to help me but when I point out that the meds are the cause of my discomfort and it is ignored,I have to wonder just how much she really does know. My BP is down and has been,but these side effects are killing me,as I can't sleep at night,I have the sinsus drainage,and a general feeling of unwellness,not to mention leg pain.  I love to read but everytime I set down to read I fall asleep and after reading a few pages,my vision is so blurry I can't see the words on the pages,I had my eyes examined and changed glasses last spring and I still can't see good.

However, each winter I would have extremely chapped lips, with a red almost kool-aid stain looking rash around my mouth and my lips would be swollen in the morning.  It was attributed to allergies, however after switching doctors, I explained this to my new doctor and she immediately attributed it to the lisinopril and switched me over to Cozaar.  Since switching my lips have not been extremely chapped swollen and the rash has not appeared.

Like many others here I began to have a dry cough with gagging. At first it was just at night but now has become constant during the day also. I called my doctor after talking to a friend and reading these reviews. I will no longer be taking this drug, if I need more than my atenonl we will visit this later. I have had heaviness in the chest, and feel tired all the time. I had been attributing this to having a stent placed several months ago. Spent a whole bunch of money on additional stress tests and nuclear heart testing since the stent. I am thinking this medication could have been causing many if not all of my symptoms. The troubling part is none of these side effects which I discussed with my Dr. and the testing personnel were attributed to this drug. Just more tests. To say I am somewhat disturbed by this is an understatement.

Then I had a times where my tougue swelled during the night and I had to have steroid treatments etc.  After three of these over a 6 month time frame, I was told by one emergency room doctor, that lisinopril was the cause and to stop taking it.  I did and was fine for a month or so but then had another tongue swelling episode.  Now total cofusion with this product and my condition.

I have a nasal drip I thought was due to allergies but I now feel are from the medication.  One stroe I was getting my meds from gave me a report on each drug I had to take well, with the price of gas and distance I had to drive I changed pharmacies and they gave reports on drugs also.  That's when I found out this mediction can cause dry cough.  (one pharmacy report contains this info and the other doesn't)so all this time I have been coughing and gagging and now it feels like there is something caught in the back of my throat.  I am going to the Dr. Feb. 26th.  I hope there isn't any permanent damage to my throat.

High Blood Pressure	HappyBooker, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/16/2009 4:10:35 PM	I took this drug for 4 weeks.  After the first week I developed a horrible dry cough that left me gagging approximately 15 times a day and every hour on the hour at night.  I also became severely constipated and my urine output was drastically reduced no matter how much I drank.  I was tired all the time, my heart would palpitate occasionally, and I had trouble catching my breath. After 3 weeks I called my doctor to complain of the cough only to be prescribed a cough medicine which didn't touch the problem.  I couldn't sleep at night because of the cough even with sleep aids.  I had trouble focusing on the simplest of tasks at work and had blurred vision.  I finally got online to research the dry cough (I was afraid it was throat cancer) only to find an abundance of sites associated with side effects of lisinopril.  I immediately stopped taking the drug.  It's been 5 days and the cough is still as bad as it was before.  I've never been more miserable in my life.

High Blood Pressure	Cathy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	2/7/2009 7:36:38 PM	I had taken Lisinopril for years and one day my tongue swelled up and was as hard as a golf ball. I saw a nurse practitioner at my PCP's office and she didn't even connect it to my medication. The second unplanned trip to the ER and the doctor there told me that this is a common side effect. I have an appt to see an allergist and the ER doctor says he's sure the allergist will agree with him.  Life threatening side effects are incredibly scary. Reading others reviews today also show me that I have other side effects that I wasn't aware of.  The next prescription will be discussed very thoroughly.

The drug lowered my bp but the side effects were too much for me to take.  My doctor did not seem concerned when I told him of chest discomfort because of my age but a person should not have to feel like or worry about having a heart attack.  So yup this drug does side effects other than the nasty cough.

My I can say that as I continue to take my meds and treat my hair I have nice and thick hair again and haven't had any more problems with my hair again. I do notice that I cough alot and I was talking with a friend that take meds for her high blood that said she bet I'm probably coughing from the meds and I went to the doctor and mentioned it to him about all the coughing since he increased my meds from 10 to 20 mgs now he stated that it could be from the meds and he schedule me to come back within 3 weeks to see if I'm still having the cough he will consider putting me on another one. But overall I can say I haven't notice any other signs or discomforts with taking the med and my blood pressure is under controll at this point and the increase in my meds was due to stress when my grandmother was extremely sick with cancer before passing.

He has had Kidney disease since age 9.  High Blood Pressure is a side affect of the disease.  He doesn't like taking these medications because he says that they make him feel extemely tired and ill feeling.  It is a constant battle to get him to take them.  Doctor says that if we don't get his blood pressure under control, his kidneys will fail faster.  What can I do, he is 19 yrs old now.

I have been on it for 9 months. A cough has developed which mostly happens when I get into bed. Other symptoms are no energy/tired, heartburn, constipation, which I never experienced before. I find my BP level creeping up 10 15 points lately. I plan to find another BP med soon. 
High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	1/25/2009 12:08:39 PM	Lisinopril does a great job of lowering bp, however, if you are among those who develop a cough from this drug, you and your doctor may need to consider other options.  I developed a terrible, hacking cough that kept me up at night and is very difficult to quiet.  For me, the cough did not respond to water, cough drops or cough medicine.  I have been off this drug for almost a week and the cough has only abated slightly.  I cannot wait to get a good nights rest again.  I'm back on my beta-blocker and somewhat fatigued, but at least I'll be able to sleep again!

I started taking Lisinpril Nov. 12, 2008. 20mg, once a day. It keeps my BP at an average 117/75 to 125/83, MUCH BETTER than the clonodine. Side effects: No coughing but allergic type reaction, area around my sinuses and sensitive upper gums/teeth roots is swelling, a dull numbing feeling. Especially when I inhale. I try to live with it, but sometimes it's very annoying, uncomfortable. I get into depressive moods because of it. I want to ask my doc to let me try another type of drug.

High Blood Pressure	darkntall, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Male	35-44	1/16/2009 11:09:40 AM	This med worked in bringing my pressure down, but it was making my side hurt while I was taking it.  So my pcp put me back on Benicar, which has been keeping my pressure down without the side affects as this med does.

High Blood Pressure	George, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	55-64	1/15/2009 11:51:23 AM	Med lowered my BP from 160+ down to 130 - 140 level in conjunction with my Doxazosin, but created what apears to be sinus drainage and a cough. Staying cool eases cough and being warm worstens cough. Realy disturbs sleep at night. Stayed off drug for a couple days, sinus drainage stopped and cough cleared up. Will advise Dr. and ask for a change.

High Blood Pressure	Hector, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	1/15/2009 3:13:12 AM	So far this medication has worked for me to lower my blood pressure. Be on it about two weeks. The first night I took it, my head felt clogged as if I had a bad head cold and I couldnt hear to well. After that first night things seemed to be okay. I noticed I urinate alot at night, but I am also taking a water pill. I exercise alot and noticed some pudginess around my waist that wasnt there before. Another thing is a loss of sex drive, I just have no interest. I will stay on it, most important is for my blood pressure to stay down.

I had asked my doctor to change my blood pressure script to a less expensive generic.  Not worth it I am going back on Hyzaar.  Although lisinopril worked on my B.P. it's side effect is very bothersome to me.  My doctor told me that other patients have also reported these symptoms.

This after 2 weeks, alittle dizziness, at work and in bed.  Don't know it it caused nose bleeds, but I had them twice.  Today I went to my doctor, I also told her about a cough that I've seemed to have for the past 3 weeks.  Today I got a new medicine prescription for Diovan HCT 12.5-80 mg, let's see what this does.  Did not like this drug at all.
High Blood Pressure	none, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	1/14/2009 1:45:20 PM	Seems Less effective in lowering blood pressure as usage continues. Blood pressure goes way above the level for which treatment was initiated if you stop taking it. BP was in the 140s when I started  Lisinopril treatment, but became short tempered and experienced ED so I stopped taking it. Within days, BP was over 160 and I started gaining weight so I started taking it again.

I could not believe a human tongue could swell to the magnitude my mother's tongue swelled to.  We were informed while in ER that it would be a possibility she would neet a trach may have to be inserted, but thank God, she did not need one.  Mother was in ICU at local hospital for 13 days and then was moved from ICU to another room in the hospital.  While in ICU mother was not aware of anything and was being assisted by breathing machines and tubes for feeding.  While reading the different reviews, I am amazed at the various reactions this medication causes and yet it has not been pulled from the shelves of pharmacies and medical facilities across the USA. As of this writing she still remains hospitalized with having to eat pureed food because of the tubes inserted in her. I feel the makers of this product needs to know the severity this medication causes and should be held accountable for their actions. We pray that our mother is left with no other illness caused by this medication and recovers fully from it.
High Blood Pressure	WHOAMI, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	35-44	1/14/2009 9:22:38 AM	Brought down BP, thank Jesus, was very happy. Almost 3 months later I feel like someone else... BUT NOT AT ALL IN A GOOD WAY! I did not read the side effects when starting so not to preconceive anything. I now experience... BLURRED VISION, DRY HACKING COUGH, URINATION DARK FREQUENT &amp; URGENT, INCREASED LOOSE BOWEL MOVEMENTS, LETHARGIC, DEPRESSION, DIZZY, TREMORS/NERVOUSNESS, JOINT/MUSCLE PAIN &amp; NUMBNESS IN LEFT HAND, SLEEPLESSNES, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, FEELS LIKE MY HEART IS POUNDING &amp; FLUTTERING SOMETIMES (ESPECIALLY IN EVE/NIGHT), NAUSEA, BAD TASTE, FULLNESS IN RIGHT EAR, LOWER SEX DRIVE, MY HAIR APPEARS TO BE THINNING AND EVEN A FEW MORE STRANGE THINGS. I know this may seem like someone with a mental issue is writing this, and I've been very reluctant, but if this will help others that's what counts. I have felt like someone very opposite of myself. Thank God I do not drink alcohol, smoke or do drugs. I am a businessman with a wonderful family and have a lot to live for. Yes, my BP did come down, as I feel was a direct result of this drug, but so would cutting off my head. I hope this has been a help. I just do not understand how dangerous drugs get passed thru the FDA. I agree to no testing on animals, but even more so for us humans! Best Regards

The most common thing has been frequent and urgency to urinate which causes nausea thatusualy subsides after urination. On some occasions, my nausea requires a half a pillof Promethazine (Pho quiet the Phenergan) to stop the nausea. I have reduced the dosefrom a half a pill to a fourth of a pill a day but the nausea continues, I also takeLithium Carbonate, Mirtazepine, and Hydroxyzine for Bipolar Disorder and PanicAttacks/Phobia/PTSD from VietNam and am a100 % Disabled American Veteran due to sometraumatic experiences leading up to a medical discharge after 13 months with the3rd Marine Division as A Navy HospitalCorpsman. I am also taking Clonazepam 0.5mg 3 X a day for severe anxiety. I feel pretty good for a 70 year old man nonsmokerand non drinker who is concerned abbout thenausea and dizziness.  I stopped taking theHCTC at the doctor's request and wonder if the lisinopril in such a low dose can be causing the nausea, etc?

Brings bp down slightly but I feel run down alot and have no interest in sex at all. Also my hands and feet are cold alot and sometimes my fingers appear as if they are getting no blood to them at all. They turn yellow and purple. Due to go back to the Dr. in March.
High Blood Pressure	Lisinopril, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	1/10/2009 6:50:14 PM	Of course the ideal is to have no side effects, but finding that probably impossible I started taking this drug as a replacement for Diovan which didn't work at all for me.  Lisinopril was prescribed for me at 40mg once a day to start.  My b/p was ranging around 160/100.  Scared to start this drug at such a high dose especially after having bad reactions to Diovan and reading other patient reviews that Lisinopril was derived from snake venom (not true according to my Dr. and pharmacist), I started at 10mg once per day.  No side effects except for a tiny bit of light headedness and feeling inconsistent itchiness.  After 2 weeks at 10mg, I upped the dose to 15mg per day for another 2 weeks.  Now at 20mg once per day and blood pressure down to approx. 125/79 and side effects not any worse (in fact, the &quot;itchy&quot; feeling has let up).  I do feel extra tired when getting up in the morning (I take this drug at night), but overall feel a lot better because my blood pressure is dropping.  I've also lost a little weight since being on Lisinopril which is great because I had gained an atrocious appetite while I was on Diovan. I only wish that people that write reviews on drugs would quit exaggerating and imagining side effects that don't really exist and be truthful about their experience.

I have been on 10mg 1x daily of this drug for 29 days and ever since, my quality of life has suffered. I stay tired, I'm constantly light headed. I'm 38 and have the sex drive of someone twice my age. All of these side effects seemed to happen immediatly after starting this drug. I see my doctor this afternoon for my 1 month checkup and will demand that she change my medication. I felt better when I had high BP! God Bless

Heart Attack	T, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	55-64	1/1/2009 7:55:22 PM	After a heart attack at age 57, my Dr. put me on lisinopril. I was on it exactly 3 weeks, when I felt like I had stood in a pile of fire ants. My feet itched, then my hands itched and  swelled. I took Benadryl to ease the itching. The next day I developed raised, red welts in my groin and a cough. Also sinus congestion. I called my Dr--he said to stop the drug, now! Later the same day it felt like I was having another heart attack---pressure in chest, short of breath, so I went to the ER. It was not heart related. I am allergic to the drug. It's been a LONG week since I stopped the drug and I still feel like crap. Itching, and GERD symptoms persist. The Dr. said it will take 7-10 days to get the drug out of my system---meanwhile I'm on Benadryl every 4-6 hrs.  After reading many of these comments, this drug should be outlawed!!!!!
Heart Attack	75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male		1/1/2009 5:05:01 PM	I took Lisinopril for 7 days only.  After 3 or 4 days, I had discomfort in my left arm and wrist almost constantly and periodic pain at night.  Developed a small rash on left forearm and then it turned into something that looked like a bruise.  Had no energy.  Stopped taking it after 7 days but side effects continued to get worse for next 4 days.  Frequent urination - one night had to get up 6 times.  After being off medicine for a week, starting to feel normal again.  Left arm still has some discomfort but no periodic pain at night and no more frequent urination.  This medicine is not for me  
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	3	4	2	Female	45-54	1/1/2009 12:09:24 PM	My high bp is caused by kidney disease, stage 3. I take 2.5mg, lowest dose and have ringing in ears, dry and wet cough 24/7, hot flashes(menopause), frequent nose bleeds, tingling feet, but Dr. says this med. will help to slow down kidney disfunction as well as lower bp. A low sodium diet is necessary for anyone with hbp, but is so hard to do. Our processed food is full of types sodium, not just salt.Dining out is a hassle. Now I hear daughter has kidney disease, it runs in families, have yours checked, it could be in yours.

I went to the Dr today for Strep Throat, no fever, bp was elevated 154/84, My blood work that I had previouly had was all great and in normal range except chlorestol was a little over 200 , she wanted to put me on this Medication she said it had low side effects, but after reading about 125 comments of bad cough, hair loss,loweing bp to an unsafe level,insomnia, weight gain, sores on your lips, I think I'll just lose some weight and chose not to take the Meds. There was just to many cons and not enough pros about the side effects. Thanks for your info, this should be able to get back to the drs, when they have more time to spend w/you, then rush you in and out oh she did give me a Rx for my Strep Throat that I will take. Where has the Drs gone that used to care for you and your health surely that are getting paid enough for there services.   
High Blood Pressure	Bonnie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	55-64	12/30/2008 9:51:50 AM	I take 2 meds (vitamins too).  Lisinopril and tricor.  I CANNOT sleep.  Legs twitch at bottom, go numb at top.  If I manage to take a nap because of lack of sleep at nite, I wake with heart pounding so hard it's unbelievable.  Slight bouts of depression.  It's hard to know which is the culprit tricor or lisinopril.  Have horrible cough too.  I'm thankful for this website.  Dr. recommended it.  From all the comments it seems we're all guinea pigs and even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while (it may work for one thing, but cause something worse). I feel like throwing all prescribed meds in garbage and taking my chances with what God has given me.

She said that it was probably allergies. I never had an allergy in my life. I also became very dizzy while turning in my sleep. My dr. gave me pills for vertigo. I was getting ready for hip replacement surgery when my dr. said that my potassium levels were very high (6) and I should stop eating bananas or she won't clear me for surgery. I don't eat bananas. Did my own research told her that the lisinopril was causing all my symptoms and she finally switched me to atenolol and had the surgery. Thought I had a very good dr. from UCLA with honors and I had to diagnose myself!

If you are age 55 or over, please read the FDA report on the use of Lisinopril and this bowel prep. You don't hear any of this from the doctor w/ &quot;the one size fits all prep&quot;.I can no longer take Lisinopril.

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	12/28/2008 12:41:43 AM	I began taking this medication in August 2008 at the lowest dosage. It was fine I had no problems and no side effects. But I recently went back to the doctor because I thought I was retaining water and he increased the dosage. It has been a little over a week since he increased my dosage and I have started out being really lethargic (which I knew was a side effect).  Then i became light headed at times.  Now a week and a half after the new dosage I have this horrible cough that I can't seem to get rid of.  I've been taking the normal allergy medicines that usually work for me, but this cough is consistent--dry at times and other times it is full of mucus.  I can't sleep because I'm coughing, I can't have a conversation with someone because I'm coughing.  After reading everyone else's posts, it falls in line with the same symptoms.  Definitely calling the doctor on Monday for a new prescription or will find a new doctor. Besides, BP is still high.
High Blood Pressure	Shotgun Johnny, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	45-54	12/27/2008 2:33:26 PM	Brought my BP down from 175/110 to 125/83 in two weeks. Amazing? Also keeps my me coughing like I have the whooping cough - day and night. Nothing seems to help relieve it for more than a minute or two. Went off drug after three weeks of hell; now on Amlodipine (Calcium chnnel blocker) - but I am still coughing almost one week after ceasing Lisinopril. I understand the cough can linger on for weeks. I think it's best to exercise and diet to get to a healthy weight if your high BP is affected by your diet &amp; weight. At least one might be able to reduce their dosage a bit.

I called my doctor to put me back on my old medicine.  I found that It doesn't mix well with celebrex.  I also have the cough, but I didn't know that it was from this and the sinus.  I will not take this medicine anymore.

Now I have a trach tube that helps me to  breath, and all this happen because i took this drug,must keep in 3or4 month still don't know if i will get my voice back,without speaking with a tube down my throat, so be very careful when taking this drug, I am just one of the lucky ones who lived to tell the story about this drug life is ruin. No job can't get help when you do must waiting until you are almost dead to get it. Big companies make money on your behalf make them pay when a drug they put on market almost kills someone or does kill someone. Let it be your family member and i bet you would want the drug companies to do something about this drug. This happen to me on 8/22/2008 5 hrs later in er,20 later in ICU on ventilator for 5 day  put to sleep so body could go down, face,throat, eyes,lips,entire body swollen,now i am very careful about any drug that i take.Today date is 12/23/2008 no christmas for me ,but happy to be alive,with my breathing tube,must keep suction machine, and breathing machine to keep throat from getting dry,my cough is still here just not as much.FDA check yourself and the drugs that you put on the market.thanks

I am stopping this medication. I have been on 40 mg for over 2 years and to date I am lethargic, tired all the time, memory is not as good, hands go numb, dizziness all the time, I cannot feel my toes, my feet feel like pins and needles sticking in them all the time when resting, doc says it is arthritis but I know better, had a bacterial infection in gland under my chin which swelled to the size of a golf ball and caused a type of blister to form on in the corner of my upper lip which resulted in a huge scar after 3 weeks and a bunch of cipro. Doc acts like he doesn't know what is going on. Maybe it's not an act. I am changing both the meds and the doc. Taking no more of this trash. I am glad to have found this site! his is my 3rd BP doc. What are we going to do? Being a doctor means money not healing. There are very few true healers in this world and a butt load of doctors.

However, the coughing all the time is nuts!  I use cough-drops and throat losenges, and this seems to help most of the time.  Especially at night.  I do feel fatigued alot, but this could also be from a combination of other problems and meds I have.  I have had no other side effects, and this med is working well for me so far.

Now, a year later, when I went in for a blood test for my thyroid, they also checked my liver count, and it has gone sky high, way over what it should be. So now I have to find out if the lisinopral is what is causing it. And I believe it is. Has anyone else had this problem?

High Blood Pressure	mott, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	12/8/2008 7:02:24 AM	I started taking lisnopril about a year ago and had some serious side effects.  The main problem was the dry cough and heaving that I developed.  At night I could not sleep without having a glass of water by my bedside.  During my normal work hours I couldn't hold a conversation without a hard piece of candy.  The condition got worse until I changed doctor's and medication.  Now that I don't take lisnopril there is no more dry cough and heaving.  My advice get another medication before that one kills you.
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	12/6/2008 3:31:27 AM	I have been on Lisinopril, 5 mgs., for nearly a year now. I did have some dizzyness, headaches, and sinus pressure but recently developed &quot;burning mouth syndrome,&quot; which is sometimes caused by Ace Inhibitors, which this drug is. I experimented to see if getting off the medication helped with this, and it did. The first time I tried even half a pill, it came back immediately. I was lucky to have read about this side effect as I did not know what was causing it for a couple of months. I did like that the drug is one of the $4 drugs around town. I am being put now on Norvasc with no health insurance, and I understand it is pricey. I am very sensitive to medications with lots of drug allergies so I hate taking any kind of medication.

My BP has gone as low as 96/74 on this stuff.  I feel very lethargic, hard to get motivated to do anything but sleep.  Aches and pains on my left side particularly in my hand, leg, hip and collarbone.  A little bit of nausea and funny taste in my mouth.  No cough, but my sinuses are acting like I have a head cold (thick yellow mucus).  I am taking 10mg a day.  I think maybe 5mg would help - will ask Dr. to drop dosage or maybe I'll just chop my pills!

It has worked beautifully for me. Only big problem is the no babies part. We haven't found another med that works as well, so as of right now, it's too dangerous to take me off this one, and I have no children...

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/24/2008 3:56:45 PM	I started this drug recently and never got to see if it lowered my BP because the side-effects were so bad.  After 3 days taking the pills I experienced extreme bloated feelings with gas and abdominal pain. It lasted for 3 days in which time I didn't take the pills. I was also nauseated and couldn't swallow them.  Symptoms then resolved and I thought it was a stomach flu. I then started to take the Lisinopril again and after 2 more days became sick with the same severe stomach cramps with gas and this time vomiting. I immediately stopped and got better after a day or so.  I am now going to try something else.  Apparently my side effects only affect 2% of those taking it..Lucky me...=)

From the very first day I took this medicine I have had problems from shortness of breath, dizziness, to fatigue and a dry mouth with a hacking cough all day and night. I read the side effects that came with the pills and when I started experiencing several of them I went back to the doctor and she changed me to a different medicine and I still cough. That was 4 months ago. Works great at lowering the blood pressure though.

I suffered from severe dizziness, blurred vision, racing heartbeat and severe anxiety.  I kept complaining to my doctor yet he refused to believe it was the lisinopril causing the side effects.  Finally I told him I refuse to take it.  After 10 days or so I started feeling a lot better.  I will never ever take lisinopril again.  EVER!

I have been taking it for 1 week, once a day, and expect further improvement over next few weeks. Very mild side effects i.e. fatigue, indigestion; no big deal. So far, I would continue this med indefinately. I will continue posting any issues. Good luck.
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Male  (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	55-64	11/20/2008 10:57:35 PM	This medication, used for elevated blood pressure, did help the stubborn blood pressure when used with atenalol and hctz. Side effect:  I noticed a persistent caugh--not terrible--but increasingly irritating.  The doctor suspected the lisinopril and took me off it.  The caugh disappeared within 3 weeks (Dr. says it takes that long or longer).

Tonight it was 78/55.  Can't sleep because of awful scratchy cough and itching in lungs.  Terrible diarrhea and poor appetite.  Very, very tired.  I've been on it for a little over a week, and I'm calling my doctor tomorrow to find out how to get off this stuff.  One other weird side effect: I'm having 5 or 6 allergy attacks a day.  Normally during this season, I have one or two a week.  Feels like my body can't protect itself.

We used to have an active sex life but since he started taking Lisinopril, he does not have any interest at all.  We might have sex once every 3-4 months.  Although it has controlled his blood pressure, I would have to say that this is a major draw back.

I thought I was getting allergies but after reading this board and the side effects of this drug that everyone has developed after taking it,I now realize all the symtoms you all have developed I now have, but there is one thing everyone should watch for if you have been taking this drug for a long period of time like I have, and that this drug causes Hypoglycemia,I found this out after last week of this writing, I went to my doctor with complaints that within the last six months I have been feeling weak,tired,and if out in the sun to long I feel like passing out,tightness around my chest and belly,legs weak,feet hurt after a short time of either walking or working in the yard,he decided to do a blood test and said the results showed I had low sugar so he had me tested for sugar levels,he said I was Hypoglycemic,and there is no meds. to help it and only diet will work,ok! so, I went home and got on the WebMD for info about the diet I was suppose to get on [for the rest of my life]everyone that has Hypoglycemia was great and told me what I can eat and not eat,but they also said its a confusing diet and I pray for anyone out there that has been on this drug for only a short time and has only developed the start of these side effects to stop taking this drug it will in combination of other meds i.e.Aleve,Ibuprofen and asprin bring on Hypoglycemia,this is terrible, I went from being on the go and full of energy to a mess and will remain so until I get my blood sugar under control if I ever will and that's only if I can keep my diet managed, Im madd as hell! that my doctor didn't do his job,Im considering legal actions against the drug company that developed Lisinopril,it took a lot of research to find out how it contributes or causes Hypoglycemia,no,one should have to live with this terrible infliction,please,please everyone that has been taking this drug for long peroid and your tired,weak all over and only feel good after eating have your bs ck'

I have not had an episode or been hospitalized for a very long.  I was surprised to read all the negative comments about it and thought I would share a positive one. Take Care.

High Blood Pressure	Pamela, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	10/28/2008 10:54:43 AM	I started taking Lisinopril on Oct. 17.  On Oct. 22 I started sweating profusely, was nauseous, vomitting, had diarrhea and started passing blood every two hours.  I ended up in the hospital for three days and had a colonoscopy.  The gastroenterologist believes my problems were due to low blood pressure, however my blood pressure has been low for many months.  I take my blood pressure at least three times a week and I have a record of the readings.  I had taken my blood pressure about an hour before I started having problems.  I believe the side effects of Lisinopril caused the irritation to my colon and caused the blood loss.

Too bad I had to endure allergy testing, tubes up my nose &amp; down my throat, prescription after prescription cough medicine &amp; antibiotics.  I coughed constantly.  I was so embarrassed in public, spent many nights awake on the couch. This side effect is listed very low o the warnings. I wish I had read here months ago.

Dr. switched me to this drug and with in a month I had symptoms, deep dry cough, acid reflex, sleeplessness,exteme fatigue. Ended up in emergency room and was diagnosed with drug induced lupus. Quit the drug right away and am feeling much better. The symptoms have gotten much better.  They say that it can take some time before the symptoms are gone.  I am back on the brand name and feeling much better.  I still see a specialist.  This drug should be banned from use cause of the side effects.  I know of other people who have taken the drug and had the same symptoms.  It is not a good drug to take and it was not necessary for me to go thru this cause the insurance company decided that they would not pay for the brand name.  It was not a cheap drug and anyone who knows the how it is to pay for brand name drugs, they are not cheap.  Why do insurance companys have so much power over the patient?  This needs to stop.

I have had severe coughing and dark circles under my eyes from lack of sleep.  I told my doctor about my hacking persistent coughing and she never mentioned that the lisinopril might be the reason.  A co-worker told me that her husband had taken lisinopril before and that he had coughed while using it too.  I called and asked my doctor if this was a side effect of this drug and she then admitted that it was!  She then switched me to a new drug, I  switched doctors.  I also gained weight and had water retention problems, esp. in my thighs.  I can't believe that some doctors would not warn their patients about these side effects.  My legs are still heavy and feel detached from the rest of my body, even though I am now taking a water pill. Please, be careful.

After just a few days I was coughing and choking constantly, day and night.  I couldn't sleep and was driving my family &amp; co-workers crazy.   Luckily my Dr. had warned me and I quickly got off the meds. It still took several weeks for the cough to subside.Personally I am horrified at how many have left feedback that their Drs didn't warn them of the side effect and lived with it not knowing the cause.  Shame on the Drs!

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	9/25/2008 9:32:13 AM	I was recently diagnosed with hypertension.  Lisinpril was the first drug prescribed.  I immediately developed a bad persistent cough and started experiencing hot flashes several times a day.  I hadn't had a hot flash in more than 3 years. Within a week of discontinuing usage, the hot flashes stopped.  The coughing is still present but not as bad on Diovan HCT.

It just seems to come and go without any warning. After reading the reviews on some other HBP medication, I'll keep using until something better comes along.

My BP was 170/98  and has gone down with little side effectsI take one pill in the AM and now I find my BP going up after lunch and I need it to be more long lasting. I do have an occasional dry throat but no coughing. I am 46 YO male that has had irregular heart beat for ever and it has manifested in high bp in my 40's. I was on metoprolol 50 mg for 8 years and I gained 30 lbs and it became ineffective. I can't stay awake past 9 oclock to save my life, it makes you lethargic.

I work out 4 days a week. I am very active person, however I have high BP 148/95. I was taking HCTZ 25mg but it didn't control BP as well as it should have. I have started on Lisinopril 3 days ago. 1st day my BP went down very quickly. 2nd day I was down to 104/65. For me it's too low. I wasn't able to do my normal activities. I felt sleepy all day (I slept all day). I noticed that I was getting dehydrated. So I started to pump little extra fluid. My energy came back I felt almost normal, so far no serious caugh, no other side effects. BUT IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL. I HAVE BEEN ON THIS MEDICATION FOR 3 DAYS ONLY. USE COMMON SENSE, ASK YOUR DOCTOR LOTS OF QUESTION, KNOW YOUR ON BODY AND RESPONSE TO THE REACTIONS OF THE MEDICATION, YOUR DOCTOR DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING. SO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. i'LL REPORT ON MY PROGRESS IN 2 WEEKS.

I have my fingers crossed that I will not get the side affects many of you report. BP baseline is 145/80. My MD has me returning in 30 days for blood work. My potassium is 1 point high and I see that is one of the conditions that you should not take the drug. Maybe that is part of the reason for more blood work. The star rating system does not allow me to rate as a beginner.  Wish me luck.

He was put on linsopril and after 3 days he started coughing. The dr. took him off the drug, but he has be coughing constantly from May 08 to the present Sept.08. It is a very bad cough. He has been treated twice with antibiotics and 4 scripts of cough medicine. The cough is still as bad or worse than when it started. He only stayed on this medicine for 3 days and he has been coughing for 4 months. I don't know what we do next. He has chest pains from coughing so much. It is constant day and night. He is 78, I don't think he can stand much more of the coughing.I think this drug should be investigated, there are too many side effects.

I understand that other people here have had side effects, but I haven't had ANY side effects, other than getting a little light-headed if I allow myself to get dehydrated.As long as I pay attention to my fluid intake, this drug has been perfect for me.(Plus? It's super cheap, and since I have the horrible insurance of the self-employed, that's important to me.)

Blood Pressure is now about 106/60.  Started out with congestive heart failure with atril fibrilation and elevated blood pressure.  Now down to just the lisinopril in conjunction with lipitor for colesterol.  Some dry mouth in morning but no particular problems.  Anticipate being on this drug for quite some time.  Dosage was initially increased in small steps.  Talked to doctor about taking the 5mg dosage and cutting in half to take in morning and evening.  He increased dosage with desire to get me to 20mg per day but I could not tolerate all at once.  He OK'd cutting the pills up and get it done over a period of about 4 months.  Now taking 10mg in morning and 10 mg in evening.  Talk to your doctor about gradual increases over time.  IT worked for me.Started at age 58 and now age 62

And at 27 years old, it was a serious concern of mine. However, I too experience the coughing and clearing of the throat side effect described by other users. Until looking into the side effects and reviews listed on this site, I was unaware of this side effect. I had assumed, because of the season, that it was allergy related. It's to the point that it's effecting my sleep. I have a horrible breathing pattern, experience snoring and the dry hacking cough at all hours of the night.

I have been on this drug for @ 6 months and bp is good; however the dry cough is killing me.  I, like many of the others, though it was allergies maybe, or then the thought of something much worse.  However, I was relieved to read that this is a common side effect for many others.  I will probably try to change to something else when I see my doc next month.  However, now I'm worried about what side effects something else may have :(

I didn't know what the side effects were until I went to my Dr.with a horrible dry cough that had me to the point of gagging and almost vomiting. My kids begged me to see the Dr because I was waking them up at night coughing and gagging.People didn't want to be around me because they thought I was very sick. I told the Dr that I felt fine except for the barking cough.He said I'm sorry that's my fault , it's probably the Lisinopril. I also have the bad headaches in the morning like some other reviewers mentioned. I thougt it was my allergies or my damp foundation of my house. Glad my Dr changed my medication.

I cough constantly to the point of gagging.  I hate to go out anywhere or be in a crowd.  I really worked on my blood pressure, though.  I had to go for chest exrays twice to see if I had something in my lungs causing the cough.  The doctor put me on Zyrtec but that didn't help the cough at all.  She told me to stop taking Lisinopril for two weeks and see what happens.  I stopped yesterday but am still coughing so I guess it takes a few days to get out of your system.  Hope there's a replacement because it really took my blood pressure down.

It did not occur to me until another lady asked me if I was taking Lisinopril--that she had taken it and coughed all the time!  Thanks to her, I talked to my doctor and he changed my medication.  What a miserable time I spent on this med.  Hats off to the lady who brought this to my attention---I thought maybe I had some other major health issues the way I coughed.  After being off the medication for a few days the coughing ceased!

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/19/2008 2:18:48 PM	Have taken Lisinopril for about 4-5 years.  I have noticed a cough but not persistent.  The cough may also be due to acid reflux so a lot of you with cough may want to consider reflux as well.  I can't take it at night...it gives me a terrible &quot;hangover&quot; headache in the morning. It has been very effective with lowering my BP but I will have to try a different BP med if I plan to get pregnant.

I have experienced the dry/hacking cough but have also noticed weight loss and headaches.  My BP is good, so does the side effects outweigh the higher blood pressure that I had before?  NO.  I like this medication for the time being. 
High Blood Pressure	BPfemale, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/13/2008 4:19:03 PM	I have been taking this med. (10mg) for a little over a month now and I have that dry cough and fatigue that everyone is talking about. The answers for me was to take it at night, drink plentyof water and use a humidifier. I first, starting drinking a lot of water with the med., then that didnt work but when I added the humid. and taking it at night it work out the best. I get plenty of sleep and the cough is gone. It seems to make your throat dry and I'm assuming that's why the cough started in the first place. I feel good otherwise am very greatful to have anything to help lower my BP and help my health. So to prevent all of it from starting every night I plug up the humidifier an hour before bed along with the med. so when the meds. kick in I'm prepared and ready for a goodnight sleep and &quot;GOOD&quot; it is. I hadn't slept this good in years. I hope this was helpful for all.

After 5 days went to ER, my doctor thinking I was having a heart attack. Had shakes, nausea, numbness and tingling of lips and left arm.  ER found nothing wrong with me . They knew I was taking this drug but no one checked into the side effects.   After reading all of your reactions to this drug, I feel much better. I have almost all the bad effects from it, except the cough. I guess if I wait long enough that will also come.  I will be seeing my doctor tomorrow and complain!!  Thanks for all your imputs, you have made a 54 year old women feel much better.

Dr. quickly lowered dosage to 10mg &amp; had me take pill at night &amp; symptoms decreased significantly.  14 months later after losing 32lbs, my dosage was again lowered to 5mg and ALL the above symptoms are gone.  BP now 108/70.  If you experience bad side effects like I did tell your Dr. quickly because your dosage may be too high.

Last year I was diagnosed with asthma, and it's true that I had several episodes that sent me to Urgent Care clinics. But moving to a country address with clean air has helped. However I have this cough that usually starts when I lay down at night. It's in my upper airway, not in my chest. So maybe I have found the reason for it.Otherwise I'm very active; ride a horse at age 70.

It has caused me to have a constant night and day cough and has not done anything for the BP.  Since I am on peritoneal dialysis and need to have uninterrupted sleep as much as possible, I plan to talk to my Dr. about taking another medicine.  I have taken many others without side effects like the cough.  It is embarrassing to be out in public, since I cough so hard that I sometimes leak urine.I certainly the cardiologist RX's another med.

I've to say I always feared taking prescribed medications because I often feel as if they push you closer to &quot;the light&quot; but I'm happy my dr put me on the 10/12.5dose. I'venot tracked my bp, and i know i should, but i feel so much better since i've been taking itover the past 3 weeks. He did tell me about the possible side effects, and i've experience an occasional headache, but hey im in the land of the living. i also know that i need to do my part while taking this medication and start an exercise plan and make better food choices...oh and drink more water. I've not experienced the cough or the scratchy throat that i've often heard lots of people experience. I'm just grateful to be alive, not having the chest pains and heaviness that i'd been having before, there hasn't been any weight gain thank god, and mst of all i'm alive and well to write this review

Why is the reaction sporadic instead of every day?

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	35-44	6/30/2008 1:13:54 PM	BP was 155/95 when starting low dosage of Lisinopril.  One month later, BP was 145/95 so doc increased dosage.  Within a few days, I felt very upset, angry and stressed all of the time.  Three weeks later, BP was 165/105.  Doc switched medicine to Diovan, and within a few days, I felt much better, and BP is mostly under control.  Didn't have the cough or sore throat that most people had while taking this medication.

Tickly sore throat and nagging cough developed the past month. Drug did lower BP to 120/75, but these side effects are maddening. Am hoping symptoms will go away; other sufferers say up to 6 weeks for relief. Any similar experiences out there?

Have had dizziness, almost like a mild hangover, every day for 2 weeks. Also have the dry mouth, coughing, thought that was from a virus from a month ago. Going to call my MD for advice, maybe a lower dose or whatever. I don't like the way i've been feeling and that needs to change.

My doctor wants me to take Exforge. Why can't I continue taking Lisinopril at a higher dose?  I don't want to start all over again trying to find out what dose is right for me or fearing to take this medication based on the side effects which really freaks me out.  Is changing my medication really necessary or it's their way of promoting a  product?

Before starting Lisinopril, my Dr. had me on Toprol XL which made me very tired and I was almost falling asleep in school.  Then I was put on another medication that gave me a bad cough.  This medication has helped my high blood pressure better than the other things I've been on.

High Blood Pressure	kittyluv1, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	6/16/2008 11:08:28 PM	I have been on Lisinopril 10mg every morning for about one month.  Just recently got a refill for another month supply.  Noticed generalized itching over all my body and tingling sensation around my lips.  Feels like ants crawling over my body!  Did not connect symptoms with Lisinopril until today and reading the previous posts from others who have experienced similar symptoms. Also having muscle aches, leg cramps etc.  Called my insurance company and spoke with a nurse -- sounds like a typical allergic reaction -- why it did not surface and become more severe prior to this is a mystery to me, but I know I won't be taking any more of this medication or any other ACE inhibitor!  The itching is horrific!
High Blood Pressure	Bromelia, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	65-74	6/16/2008 6:58:10 PM	Was taking Coreg for elevated BP and because I had a stroke in a vein in my eye, but it wasn't lowering it enough-then added 10mg of Lisinoprol daily, which helped. My blood pressure was around 145 /90 with a pulse of 80-83.  In retrospect, I should have known something was wrong, but I have such bad airborn allergies that it didn't occur to me that the horrible coughing spells could be caused by something else. And, all I want to do is sleep. The headaches were so random that I thought it was because of my allergies.  We even bought two large room air cleaners for our bedroom and living room!  The urine leakage has been a nightmare,but I thought it was because of my age--my gynocologist suggested exercises to strengthen my abdominal muscles! Getting to sleep is hard and then the coughing wakes me up--so I thought that was what was causing me to feel tired all of the time. Lack of sleep. Because of an accident, I have been having physical therapy--and got seriously winded after only 6 minutes on the stationary bike.  If I bend over for too long I get so nauseated that I have to sit for awhile 'til it passes.  Today was my three months check-up with my Dr.and told him how I felt and that I had a cough that I couldn't shake, a weight on my chest, lethargy and that I felt overall terrible. That my mouth gets so dry at night, that I wake up gagging, if I'm not coughing! He stopped the lisenoprol--and I finally looked it up when I got home and found this site. I am in shock! I should have read the material more thoroughly when I first got the prescription. This is a lesson I won't have to learn twice! I have also had another stroke in my eye a week ago!  My doctor feels badlybut all I want is to feel like my old self, the sooner the better. I am only 15 pounds overweight and 65 years old--but I feel 100 right now and depressed.

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	6/5/2008 2:46:55 PM	Took Lisinopril several years ago and had a cough that wouldn't quit. My Dr at that time told me it was all in my head. Needless to say I quit taking it. I also found a new Dr. Did not need anything for HTN for several years. Started back on Lisinopril this year. Cough returned and my current Dr told me that this is not a symptom that goes away, so we switched to another drug. I even had family &amp; co-workers asking me to do something about my cough!

It usually stays under 120/80 with this med. While I sleep, it can drop to 103/58 I take this med. in the morning. It makes me feel tired, but I'm much calmer than I used to be. I have a slight dry cough off and on, but it's not a big problem. I do notice that my mouth gets very dry, and I have to use the bathroom a lot more than I used too. I take 10mg once a day.

I was surprised that using this medication and losing 30lbs after 13 months was enough to bring my BP to normal.  At first I had muscle cramps in legs, feet &amp; hands and some blurred vision, but after adding 45 minutes of walking and 15 minutes of stretching 4 days/wk most of the problems are at a tolerable level, and I feel much more energetic too.  During the rainy season, I check out exercise DVDs for Baby Boomers from the library to keep up my exercise regimen.   Dr. says if I lose another 20lbs he can lower the dosage which is incentive enough for me to add a modest diet to my regimenI haven't felt this good in years...

High Blood Pressure	Moody Blue, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	5/25/2008 2:28:23 AM	Please bare with me as I make my case about Lisinoprol&gt;&gt;&gt;Five days ago my doctor represcribed Lisinoprol and increased my dosage to 20 mg. He also changed an anxiety medication to Xanax XR. My doctor suggestted I lose a few pounds so, I started following a strict diet, exercising, gardening, etc. After 5 days, I've GAINED 5 POUNDS. I was sick of looking at my weight increase (despite my efforts), so I started doing research on all the prescribed meds I'm taking. I started with the anxiety med. While taking regular Xanax (which is addictive, but I have peace in my life again), I didn't gain any additional weight. I started reflecting on my time gardening today. After about an hour of gardening, my legs were so weak I could bare stand up, I felt lightheaded, my body was weak and my ankles were swollen.  When searching for the side effects of Lisinoprol, I was so disturbed. I was experiencing up to five symptoms at any given time. Also, I've been leaking urine without a full bladder and/or not having to go to the bathroom. My blood pressure has been elevated for over 10 years, but my doctor have some explaining to do. The side effects of this drug are serious and may have caused me to begin having anxiety attacks; I began having them about 2 - 3 years ago around the same time my doctor first began prescribing this med. I'm learning to question my doctor not only about the benefits of a drug, but also the possible side effects. Doctor's make mistakes. There was a serious mistake in my medical records in which he had to write an addendum for. I DO NOT recommend this drug.

High Blood Pressure	GN, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	5/24/2008 5:26:25 PM	I was using Diovan &amp; went into respiratory distress (also swelling of lips, face, neck &amp; throat) and was then switched to 2-3 other drugs and now finally to Lisinopril 10mg for about a year.  Initially I had coughing during the day and night (not to the extreme where it kept me awake at night), but enough that I thought I had an allergy or common cold etc. and then after reading the information on this site I found that coughing is a common symptom with this drug.  I also had some muscle cramps in my feet and hands and some headaches too, but after including an hour of combined aerobics and stretching exercises 3-4 days/wk most of the symptoms have been reduced to the occasional headaches.  In a years time, I have lost about 35lbs, blood pressure &amp; cholesterol levels are normal, and my doctor has recently lowered my dosage from 10 to 5mg.  
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	5/24/2008 10:58:16 AM	This med. gave me such a horrible cough, that I couldn't sleep, would gag and just about throw up.  Plus, the runny nose, sore throat and chest congestion.  Thought it was allergies at first, but I have never had allergies this bad.  Finally, remembered my husband tried to take this drug a few years back and it did him the same.  Wish I would of put two and two together sooner.  This has been a horrible experience!
High Blood Pressure	fairburn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/23/2008 5:32:15 PM	This drug nearly killed me.  Upon my very first dose - one pill - I went into anaphalytic shock and ended up in the chronic care unit for 9 days.  I was hospitalized for 2 weeks total.  My thoat and tongue were so swollen that my mouth could not contain my tongue.  I could not breathe and I was intubated to assist me.  Additionally, my stomach was pumped and I had to have a blood transfusion during my stay in the hospital.  It turned out that because I have lupus that I should never have been prescribed this medicine because it contains ACE inhibitors.

Then 20 mg, now 30 mg a day. Now it has lowered my blood pressure but after reading about others problems, I'm wondering if some of my other problems may have been caused by this medication. A year ago I had pains in my chest and had tests done including an angiogram. Showed some blockage and 1 leaky valve. Since than, I now have 3 leaky vales and heart rate was so low I had to have a pacemaker put in. I'm 54 years old and thought I was in basically good health. As far a Lisinopril, I had usual cough from it, started snoring, jaw cracking, irregular heart beats, depression that worsened with increased dosage and foot and leg cramping. Now I don't know how much Lisinopril had to do with that, however I cut back to 20 mg. and I'm starting to feel better. Now I will cut back to 10 mg. and then I'm going to get another medication.

I live in Los Angeles, CA and my 10mg Lisinopril is one of the $4 discounted drugs on the Wal-Mart &amp; Target pharmacy list.  However, starting May 2008 Wal-Mart implemented the program whereby the customer can obtain a 90 day supply for $10.   Target is closer to me so I asked Target pharmacy would they match Wal-Marts offer and they accepted.   I now pay $10 for a 90 day supply of Lisinopril 10 mg which averages $3.33 per month.   
High Blood Pressure	BW, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	5/18/2008 6:51:01 PM	The first year I had mild symptoms of coughing, headaches and blurry vision.  Now In my second year, I still have the same symptoms, but only occasionally.  I now include walking exercises 4 days/week at 45 minutes and my blood pressure is now normal.  I am hoping in future that my doctor takes me totally off medication for good.

Have had blood pressure issues for over 10 years and tried different medications. This works fine for me after suffering a mini stroke. No side effects. Adjusted very well. Acutally, Benicar was the best but couldn't afford the expense. Weight low, eat healthy, cholestral extemely low, don't smoke, etc. Just the blood pressure and varicose veins. Genes I guess.

I alsostopped taking thenm for five days to check if there would be an improvement in my ED problem, but there wasn't, so it is not the Lisinopril but obviously the taking of other BP tablets for the last 20 years.
High Blood Pressure	BW,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female		5/16/2008 12:27:54 AM	I am taking 10 mg once per day.  The only side effect I had was mild to modest headaches and mild vision blurring.  In an effort to reduce the headaches, I split the pill and took twice per day for about 6 months but my blood pressure lowered only a little.  But once my body became accustomed to the medicine, I can now tolerate taking it once a day per the doctors orders.  I am now on a modest diet plus 60 minutes of exercise 4 days per week, and the combination of all three is bringing my blood pressure down at a more modest pace.

On 2 occasions, I have woken up in the middle of the night, struggling to get my breath. I thought the first time, since I had a cold, that for some reason I closed my mouth during sleep and that's why I couldn't breathe. However, last night, I had a dream about not being able to get my breath, and woke up feeling that I had stopped breathing. I was gasping for air. I also noticed that my neck was swollen. Has anyone else had the problem of feeling like they have stopped breathing during sleep? This is really scary. 
High Blood Pressure	Roger, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	65-74	5/2/2008 3:12:19 PM	I live in Michigan and recenly (12/07) started on generic lisinopril 10 mg from Meijer's (blue gray pill) manufactured by Watson LA with no side effects. Spent Jan 08 - Mar 08 in Florida and switched to Walgreen's lisinopril (pink pill) manufactured by Lupin.  Immediately within 1 week after beginning Walgreen's lisinopril experienced dry cough.  Upon returning to Michigan and switching back to Meijer's lisinopril dry cough stopped within 1 week. My recent visit to my doctor confirmed that lisinopril has lowered my BP and is working and I continue at 10 mg dossage. I talked with the Pharmacists at both Walgreens and Meijer's and neither could explain why one had dry cough side effect and the other did not.  The only difference is the pill color and manufacturer.

I'm on a low dose of 10mg, but it's really messing me up. First I couldn't sleep, but now I can't get enough sleep and am so fatigued during the day, major non-stop diarrhea, cough, pounding/racing heartbeat,stomach pains/cramps, painful joints, sore all over, sore tongue, then as of 2 days ago my tongue has a thick black coating on it. GROSS!! My Dr. had put me on Flagyl for the diarrhea, thinking I had an intestinal bacterial bug, but it made me completely stop for days. I stopped taking it for a day and later (literally) the water was back on. But, after seeing that that is one of the side effects, I'm stopping it and am now waiting to get in to see my Dr. I've never felt so aweful!

High Blood Pressure	kay, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	4/13/2008 4:43:24 PM	This is a follow up to a previous rating I gave where I described my severe coughingas a result of taking lisinopri. This condition went on for over a month and has now subsided.  The doctor gave me allergy meications but apparently I never took them long enough.  She said you have to keep with it for a long time, maybe over a week to get relief.  So for those of you still afflicted by the cough try staying with some of the allergy meds.  For those of you who think you might have the coughing side effect be aware they last a long time.  I stopped taking lisinopril for three days thinking the coughing would stop and it didn't, so I resumed the dosage.  If you have that itchy throat you should probably stop right away.

I take 49mg. and I am only 34. Yes, this medication has helped lower my blood pressure from 220/120 at times along with 2 other drugs. It has lowered my libido to almost nothing. I occasionally get numbness in my hand and aching joints. I don't know if these are side effects, but, reading the other reviews, a lot of people have the same problems.

High Blood Pressure	ramdriver, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	4/9/2008 10:03:00 AM	Used 20mg once daily for two weeks, now have swollen tender ankles, sore feet, leg cramps, aching elbow and wrist joints, excruciating headachs, anxiety, but worse of all, it has created a restriction in my urinary tract causing painful and constant urge to pee but can only dribble. Libido is non-existant. I will not take this medication any longer. This drug needs much more study in my opinion.  My blood pressure has actually increased from a steady 190 over 110 to 222 over 112 as of today. Will be contacting my Doctor today.

However, I have gained 6 pounds in 4 weeks.  I work out 45 minutes a day, 4-5 days a week.  A friend told me she gained 10 pounds on drug.  If you research this drug, you will see that weight gain is a side effect.  My blood pressure was not very high anyway so I am not going to take this pill anymore.

There was no mention of the percentage of people who experience the cough which is anywhere from 3 to 11 percent depending on where you get the info.  My cough got worse and worse.  I couldn't sleep.  I stopped for three days but the cough persisted.  I now know you have to wait on an average of 14 days.  Not only did I have the cough and what I thought was a virus but I had a soreness at the back of my tongue and felt very tired.  I have not taken lisinopril for 10 days and the symptoms persist.  I am hoping they will go away soon.  I have lost sleep and gotten generally &quot;run down&quot;.  Pay attention to the side effects when you buy drugs even if you have never had a problem before like me.

She developed a cough in Dec 07 which continued to get worse. It got so bad she couldn't sleep and ended up on the couch to let me sllep. She took all kinds of allergy medicine thinking that was the problem.  Finally a doctor told her it was the Lisinopril and took her off of it .  She has been off of it for two weeks and her cough is gone.

Took it at night as per the pharmacist in case of dizziness. Woke up the next day with a very red face. by the time I got to work had fatigue and a headache that didnt go away for 6 hours. and that was after taking ibuprofen. Not sure if it was allergic reaction or not but this is the 3rd med I have tried so far. frustrated that I cant find one that doesnt give me a headache. Also, I just took a benicar for the first time so we'll see. after looking up its reviews it doesnt look very promising either. Said a Prayer. (still trying to figure out how I am only 33 and already have HBP.)

No symptoms after starting the medicine, but this past month felt like I had a sinus problem with nasal drainage, sore throat,tickle in bad of my throat,tight neck and shoulder muscles. The cough kept getting worse and finally after 2 doses of antibotics, cough medicine and Mucinex the doctor said it was the BP medicine causing my problems and the horrible cough, that kept me up all night.I have arthritis and this aggravated it! I felt I had no energy and my chest felt like I was having bronchiospasms. I am off of it for 2 days and the cough is lessening. Switched to Benicar, so I will wait and see how this med works for me. I really hated this medicine's side effects.

I thought it was bronchitis with a touch of post nasal that never seems to go completely away. Tough sleeping. After reading the other posts here, I'm wondering if the cough is the drug. I also thought my arthritis was getting worse, but I see many people report muscle aches. Time to try something else to compare.

Took many meds for cough but it continused to get worst.  During a visit to my Heart Doctor, who checked my meds. said I was having an alergic reaction to to the Lisinopril, and needed to get off of it,and that a high persentage of people are allergic to this medication.  With in 3 days the cough stopped completlet, throat swelling went down, but it took 4 mths. to lose the weight.  There are better medications than Lisinopril. My neighbor who was also on Lisinopril was just released from the Intensive Care Unit at the hospital after having a severe reaction to Lisinopril.  He had been on it for 3 years, His simptoms came on all of a sudden with swollen throat, tongue, hands and body, and severe breathing problems.  He was lucky, but now he has to carry an injuction medication with him at all times in case he has an allergic reaction to something else, and inject himself or he could die.   Please be carefull with this medication.

Had to switch to Diovan with immediate relief.  Believe Lisinopril is prescribed first because it's cheaper than others and not everyone will get the cough.  Asked 2 other coughing co-workers if they were taking &quot;blood pressure medicine&quot; and, sure enough they were.  They also switched to Diovan and all's quiet in the cubicles now.

High Blood Pressure		5	5	2			2/22/2008 8:11:22 AM	Very satisfied with what the drug did for my Blood pressure but not the side effects I got from taking the medicine for almost a year.  I couldn't figure out why I had this dry hacking cough and the doctor finally told me it was from the medicine.  He didn't tell me that was a side effect when he prescribed it to me.  So I switched to cozaar. We will see how well I do on that.

It lowered my BP significantly, but I felt tired and dizzy all day!! My eyes felt wierd and I had no energy! I'm going to halfen my dosage tomorrow by cutting my pill in half and see if I feel better. I haven't experience any coughing yet, but it is only the first day! :)

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	45-54	2/20/2008 9:35:55 AM	never had HBP until i got pneumonia in April.  HBP never went away.  Dr rx 20mg.  Coughed for 2 weeks.  Flushed my face.  BP did go down.  Next GP Dr said to cut pill in 1/2.  Worked just the same at 10mg.  Flushing still though.  I asked to come off it, especially since blood glucose didn't fall after I had eliminated sugar from diet.  Now I'm on 25 mg Atenolol.  I like it much better.  Flushing of face is gone.  Hopefully by also reducing carbs that blood glucose will go down.  Will check again in 8 weeks.

Is there anything that will work and not spike my blood sugar?
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	2/9/2008 11:38:24 AM	My dosage was extremely low at 5 mg, as my Dr. put it &quot;just a tiny little pill&quot;. After using this for 6 weeks it has lowered my Bp to 128/73 from 138/90. Not a great accomplishment, but better. It seems to act as a diuretic. The problem has been that I developed strong pains during the night in my chest, very alarming. Also, discoloration and weakening of nails. Lastly, I awoke the other night with a bad chest pain and shortness of breath. I thought maybe having a stroke? EKG showed no circultory system damage, thankfully. The Dr. swithched my meds to Diovan 160 mg, and after 4 days I am experiencing lower back pain- I think I am stopping it. I've been on Biovaxine which has phitonutrients and Bp lowering nutrients. I will continue this holistic treatment as I have had only good effects using it for  10 days- same with everyone else I know.

Since i started on this med about 1 1/2 yrs ago its been really good. Down to the normal range. I have noticed a change in my libedo though like someone else had mentioned. I occasionally have a cough and never connected it until i started reading these reviews. I have also noticed a vast increase in weight gain and no matter how hard I try to lose weight, it just will  not come off. Didnt realize this was due to anything to do with med....thought it was just getting older and lower metabolism... hmmm got me thinking now.. but my blood pressure is great!

Mild coughing at night, but not constant. Worst side effect was weight gain/ plateau. Have been on weight watchers for a year and was losing @ 1 lb per week, until this medication. Because it lowers metabolism (I think), I have hit a plateau and am no longer losing like I was prior to meds.

We rushed her to the hospital where she ended up in ICU.  Has been difficult reducing the swelling.  Very scary. About 5 years ago, I also was on this medication for some months when I experienced losing ability to taste and then acute swelling of my face.  Ended up in emergency.  Very allergic to this medication even though it seemed to be effedtive for my blood pressure.

Started on 10mg but was very lethargic and was falling asleep in the mid-afternoon. Started to daily monitor my BP; very low 85 over 60. Had dosage changed to 5mg and BP is now normal.

Am glad to hear from other people and to know that the coughing could be due to lisinopril and that there is hope.  i have been dreading sleep for weeks now.

At least on a long term basis it will eventually do havoc with living a normal life. For about 6 months, several doctors, more than two dozen tests, it was this combo that cause sleepless nights, the loss of 30 plus pounds, pain in the lower back, pain in the knee joints etc. etc. I have spoken to several other people some strangers who have gone through the same as I have. So please be advised. Wishing you better luck.

High Blood Pressure	Capital C for Cough, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	11/5/2007 1:01:43 AM	I was previously prescribed Diovan HCT and I loved it, but couldn't afford it (Absolutely no side affects at all!) but my doc couldn't keep giving me samples: answer: he switched me to Lisinopril and about 1 week after taking this medication, I developed a severe dry-almost choking cough, my muscles in my legs hurt, and the swelling in my hands, face and fingers is just repulsive. My doc either didn't care is too underpaid to notice that apparently these are all some pretty bad side affects. I would rather have high b.p than cough all day and night-I work in a hospital too, so everyone i come in contact with thinks that I'm spreading sickness, when it's just this bothersome side-effect. I have a new appointment with another physician and hope to try something else for my hypertension.

However, this med. does not work alone.  It should be coupled with exercises and low-sodium diet. This med. did make my blood pressure decline after two weeks.  I was on lisinopril for three months as a teenager. I had to go back on lisinopril or enalapril a few times after starting college because it was hard to keep my bp low without the med. Guess I can't beat my genes without ACE Inhibitors.

Was exercising regularly with home equipment, had energy, felt good.

Ankles &amp; feet swelling when I sit or stand any length of time---Runny nose that Claratin, etc. do not help at all--so weak &amp; tired can't do my exercises as needed...and to top it off, am having extreme body heat &amp; cold sweats practically all day and till late at night....I see my doctor again next week and I am absolutely refusing to take any more of this medicine.  I know it's the culprit.

I am switching back to Benicar for blood pressure control.  Never had a problem with Benicar.
