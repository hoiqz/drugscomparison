Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	45-54	5/12/2010 1:18:07 PM	I had very strong painful urges to urinate resembling a UTI but no infection was found.  I am currently scheduled to be tested for IC.  Urologist placed me on Prosed and I found immediate relief from the frequent painful urges.  I now can wait generally at least an hour and sometimes up to two hours before urinating.  Prior to this I was having to go every 10-15 minutes. 
Other	MaggieDee, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	65-74	11/9/2009 5:36:19 PM	I have been diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis.  Treatment from my Dr/clinical nurse requires catherization of the already tender bladder.  The Prosed relieves the tenderness and resulting pain from these treatments.  My life is really turning around after many months of discomfort before diagnosis.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/2/2009 12:38:43 AM	This took care of the burning and bladder spasms that came with a very severe UTI.Within about 4 hours of the 1st dose I was feeling better.  However, I too have had a severe reaction with the redness and severe itching, mainly in my lower legs and back. I would still take this, the itching is way better than the pain I was in with the UTI!

Is this a typical or common side effect?  I was rx'd this med due to dysuria.

Difficult or Painful Urination	kg, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	2/6/2009 4:00:16 PM	I too had all the classic symptoms of a UTI, but no infection ever showed up on my urine samples-I had several.  Finally went to see a Uro-Gynocologist who seems to have correctly diagnosed me with Interstitial Cystitis.  She immediately put me on Prosed to help relieve my symptoms and it has worked!  I had gone to 2 other Urologists &amp; they dismissed IC, and gave me Vesicare to treat my symptoms, but didn't get to the cause.  Prosed is a start to proper treatment for me!

Jury still out on effectiveness, this is my second month on it,I have noticed joint pain as mentioned by someone else, has anyone else noticed this?Anyone getting UTI's this frequently?
Difficult or Painful Urination	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	11/29/2008 10:00:36 AM	I have been using Prosed/DS for four days.  It has taken care of all my symptoms except that the urinary muscles still feel like they are always &quot;on&quot;, but there is no pain.  I have used pyridium in the past (15 years) and think this is a far superior drug.  The only drawback has been that my more acidic urine is making my skin vey sensitive/itchy.

Other	ellesse, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	10/13/2008 10:34:41 AM	I have been taking this medication as needed for more than a year.  It is a good rescue drug for those of us who suffer from interstitial cystitis.  However, it causes permanent staining of the toilet bowl.  Truly impossible to remove.  
Other	Julie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	10/11/2008 9:32:53 AM	I am taking this drug for IC. Has anyone else noticed severe muscle and joint pain associated with taking Prosed?
Difficult or Painful Urination	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	7/30/2008 3:55:15 PM	I used this drug when first diagnosed with interstitial cystitis, and the improvement from pain was very good. Yes, it does have all those staining issues others have mentioned. One side effect is possible urinary retention, and it was for this reason that I stopped, and changed to pyridium, which is not as effective for pain. But for the IC sufferer it can be a very good &quot;rescue&quot; drug if you have a flare,and for this reason I continue to keep it on hand.
