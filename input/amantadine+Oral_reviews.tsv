Parkinson Symptoms	michelann, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	8/13/2012 12:49:31 PM	My husband (age 62) was placed on the drug Amantadine (the generic for Symmetrel) a month ago and it has been somewhat of a roller coaster ride ever since! We are writing this to warn others of the potential dangers of using this drug. First diagnosed with Parkinsons back in 2010 by our family physician he was referred to a neurologist for further treatment. My husband was then placed on first Sinemet (Carb Levo). He was not responding to the drugs and after a year the doctor (and myself) decided as they were not helping (and were very expensive plus we had no insurance) to take him off the drugs. We came back to the neurologist nearly a year later for further testing and evaluation. The doctor then placed him on Amantadine. The drug caused my husband severe reactions in the way of hallucinations and extreme mental reactions. He did increase his movement and alertness (what the drug is supposed to do) but also brought on mental issues such as speaking of things that never occurred or events that never happened. He also showed me things he saw that I never could see. He began to become overly active and fell several times a day, causing trauma to his head and back. One day he was trying to pick up our 65 TV and clean behind it, resulting in him falling and the TV falling on top of him!Lightheadedness and dizziness as well as blurred vision, unable to get to sleep and became extremely fidgety and talking incoherently are among other symptoms he had for about a week when taking 100 MG of Amantadine 3 times per day as prescribed by the neurologist. I had read we should not just take him off the drug so cut back to two pills then only one in the morning. The next day he got no more Amantadine and almost immediately seemed better with less and less dramatic episodes (seeing things and talking of non-existent subjects as he had been). This drug is, in my opinion, very dangerous and potentially extremely harmful!Doctor's please think twice!
Fatigue associated with Multiple Sclerosis	Joseph, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	7/11/2012 2:04:50 PM	I'm on Provigil and, as a supplement, Amantadine.  When I take Amantadine, twice a daily, I'm good to go.  I get up each morning at about 0700HRS and take this and others.  At 1215HRS, I take the second of these, nap for 45mins and I'm good until I decide to go to bed, usually at +2000HRS.  For my life-style, it works.  I must remember to have the dosages overlap.  It's taken me a few tries to understand the need for the consistency.  Other meds require food.  After reading other contributions, I understand that food may be getting in the way FOR ME with this.  I'll work it out.  Managing MS ain't for sissies.

Fatigue associated with Multiple Sclerosis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	5/20/2012 4:40:35 PM	Started Jan 5, 2012 and now have purple blotches all over, red rash from knees to ankles, and extreme swollen ankles that hurt/burn feeling.  I stopped May 5th per doctor, still having NO let up of the purple blotches, rash and swelling.  I'm going back to provigil even though it's sooooo expensive, it did work for me before trying the amantadine which was way more affordable, but, I'm paying the price now!  Hope these side effects will go away.

Various diet, lifestyle, viatmin, mineral and overall boosting of my immune system trials got me back on my feet. Amantadine got me back to work. Fifteen solid years in IT program management. The increase in stamina was nearly miraculous for me. Guess the auto-immune approach did not make sense for me as my earlier attempts to slow down my immunity only made me rapidly/progressively worse. I took one 100 mg. capsule every other day in an effort to prolong it's effectual lifespan - it has worked. Still working.

She was in the hospital and the neurologist prescribed this drug to &quot;pep her up&quot;.  She has been on the drug 10 days and it has caused horrible results.  Her speaking is slurred, it's like she's drunk.  Her right hand is shaking so bad that she can't hold a fork.  And she's extremely nervous and aggitated.  It's so bad and I am furious at the doctor.

I have noticed some aggression and a mildly non cooperative attitude. I read where effects may diminish upon lengthy use and hope that is not so. The carbidopa he had been put on for a mild tremor caused dyskenisia, so I think this is our only alternative for symptom relief.

The effect has decreased some, but have found that while I take this first thing in the AM, I also take Provigil around 12:00 and Amantadine again at 4:00.  That way there is no lapse in energy.  Each drug without the other, did not do the trick.  Years ago, Amantadine was presribed as an anti-viral, and  I did found that as an added bonus, I have not been sick at all in the last 10 yrs.  I suppose it has a dual purpose and would not go off it!!

He has been taking it for 2 years and it has worked very well, but he started getting sick all the time, colds, sore throats, and lots of headaches. I'm very nervous that there is no long term study on people taking this medication for this type of problem. Can someone respond?

Other	CHRISTINA, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	9/20/2007 5:54:33 PM	I am taking this along with Oyxtocin and MSM. I have permanent nerve damage from a botched back surgery and my pain medicine Oxycotin is not as efffective now that I have been on it for almost 4 years, so this is what my doctor suggested I try I have only been taking it for a couple of weeks but it seems to be making a difference. I am anxious to see what it is going to be like in a couple of weeks.
