Enlarged Prostate	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	55-64	8/16/2012 12:05:14 AM	Greatly effected the sex drive - on erection or ejaculation. Worse than that, it drastically effected my blood sugars, made them very erratic. You could see the averages going up on a weekly basis. As soon as I went off of it, the blood sugars leveled off and started coming down. I can live with the getting up 2-3 times a night. Not a good drug if you are allergic to sulfa based drugs.

I started this drug about 3 months ago at the advice of my Cardiologist. I got off 8mg of Cardura because of lightheadedness and low blood pressure in the morning. This Tamsulosin works and I do not have lightheadedness in the morning since getting off Cardura, but had a better stream with Cardura.

I still get up 3 to 4 times a night to urinate.  I still have a weak urine stream, very little semen,and very recent a erection problem.  I have a allergy reaction like sinus systoms and eyes are semi red.  I stopped taking it daily to eliminate the allery reaction.  I only take it every other day to cope with the side effects.  I am thinking about taking Avodart.

After Knee surgery, I went into Rehab Physical Therapy, and upon release was given new scripts to cover prior needs. One med presribed was &quot;Tamsulosin HCL.&quot; I didn't recognise that as &quot;Flomax&quot;, so I took both for a short period. A CAUTION!

It really helps my flow...constantly, every 1/2 hour or so encluding night, forgot what sleep was like. Because the cost of tamsulosin has gone down, Floxmax under my plan has increased 5 fold. Switched to Avodart with simular results to Flomax.

Going back to the Flomax even if I have to pay for it out of pocket. This stuff does not work. I used to sleep seven-eight hours without urinating now have to get up several times a night to go.

Went to Dr for pain that he said was my urinary tract touching itself as it got squeezed together.  Was only happening intermittently.  The drug itself works great - peeing like a fire hydrant.  Unfortunately, I feel like I am in a haze, not dizzy but just don't feel right.  I also feel like it has slowed my metabolism or I'm retianing water - I feel bloated.  Pants that fit me two weeks ago (before I started the drug) don't really fit any more.  I'll stop taking this and only take it when there is pain.  No sexual side effects.  Still daily or every other day with my lady.

I have been on this for a month.  I am in pain, and have to urinate constantly.  I am going back to Flomas, even if that means I have to pay out of pocket.  There is a world of difference between Flomax and this junk.

Ejaculations went into the bladder at first then after 2 weeks some ejaculation thru the penis was possible although still somewhat restricted.Dizziness is moderate and you should be ready for it. Never experienced passing out, just light headedness.All pain experienced during urination is gone and after 1 month I am adding Saw Palmetto to my daily vitamin regiment in hopes of being able to stop the Flomax. My dosage is 0.4mg once daily.

Downside: reduces ejaculate and orgasm to next to nothing. Guess it's a &quot;trade off&quot;. Been using for 3+ years now and will continue to do so. I quit taking it for about five days, and couldn't pee at all. I think you likely get dependent on it.

Enlarged Prostate	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	3/21/2009 11:17:59 PM	Better than no help. Much better than Saw Palmetto or Beta Sisterol. Really reduces my ejaculate. It has helped me in frequency, and I only have to get up once at night - sometimes not at all.
