Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	2	Male	35-44	11/27/2010 11:15:14 PM	This medication definitely worked quickly and helped me sleep well during the night.  However, I found that mid-day I needed a mid-day nap, often for long periods of time.  My doctor suggested only using the drug &quot;as needed&quot; but now has changed the medication completely.

Other	nadialexis, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	4/1/2010 7:09:21 PM	I have a question for anybody that uses dalmane for acute panic attacks? I see a dr. at my local MHMR and is virtually impossible to have a trusting and open communication with any docs there. I had a serious panic/nervous breakdown two weeks ago and the doc prescribed flurazepam, xanax and prozac. The dosage of xanax she prescribed was not nearly enough to help, they were breaking through. Now I can't get in touch with anybody because nobody calls back for a week by then I may be dead

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/13/2009 9:32:05 PM	Ambien CR works for me, however, I was looing for something more when I had a accident.  It helped w/ calming me down, and I now use intermittenly w/ Ambien CR.  Never together, and ALWAYS ensure that I will have 9-10 rest.  Usually I wake w/ 8-9 regardless of what I take.  I have more energy during the day, can exercise again, and am back to gardening/yard work!!  I was checking the site to see why my Dr. had prescribed it, since I'd forgotten.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	llmccal, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	65-74	1/8/2009 7:34:06 AM	I have been using this drug for a number of years due to international travel in my job. I have also been taking the drug at the highest dosage, i.e, 30 mg.. The effectiveness has worn off and I have been having extreme daytime drowsiness. I will see if I have any withdrawal symptions. My advice is not to get &quot;hooked&quot; on this medication.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Bphillips, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/28/2007 1:33:27 PM	This drug helped me to go to sleep and stay asleep all night, if awaken during the night I was able to go back to sleep. I had been waking up during the night for 2-3 hours before I could go back to sleep then waking up mentally and physically tired. After taking this for a couple of nights I tend to get back on a regular sleep pattern.
