Cold Sore	Thankful, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/28/2012 10:31:17 PM	Starting at a young age I was getting reoccurring HSV1 sores in random areas on my face. Every few months I would get an outbreak on my face that was so swollen and painful I didn't want to leave the house. About 2 years ago my entire face; cheeks, nose, and forehead broken out. I was devastated! I went to my doctor and he was very worried about my eyes since the blisters were so close. HSV1 can cause blindness. After prescribing Valtrex, and taking one 500 mg tablet a day, I have been outbreak/side effect free. I thank God and my doctor for this drug. It has done wonders.

I have had Genital Herpes since I was 15 when I lost my virginity, but I did not know for sure for sure I had it until I was 17 and pregnant with child. I am glad that this pill works well with pregnant women and non-pregnant women, and just people all around. I would recommend this pill to anyone and everyone who is able to take it or may have Genital Herpes.

Genital Herpes	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	65-74	3/2/2012 3:28:36 PM	I contracted genital herpes about 35 years ago and had regular outbreaks for several years. Then I didn't have an outbreak for c.30 years. From out of the blue it came back with a vengeance and I was having outbreaks c. every few months. I was prescribed 500 mil. of the Valtrex generic once a day. Since then I had been herpes-free for 10 months. I have now started an outbreak. The dr. said when I sensed an outbreak coming on, I could take 4 a day (2000 mil.). Has anyone else been given this advice from your dr. and taken 4 a day during an outbreak? PS: The 500 mil. a day causes me no side effects.

Cold Sore	BettyB, 25-34 Female 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	12/30/2011 12:42:11 PM	I have been suffering from cold sores since childhood. My doctor prescribed Valtrex and instructed to take 4 pills as soon as I felt an outbreak, and then 4 pills exactly 12 hours later.. My doctor and my pharmacist both assured me that most people will not even get an outbreak if taken within an hour of the first symptoms.  Yesterday around 5:00 I noticed a slight red bump on my lip, I knew instantly that a cold sore was brewing on my lip and took the Valtrex right away, 12 hours later I took the remaining dose. It's been about 20 hours since I noticed the red bump and I can see a blister forming. I don't think this medication will work and I'm still going to have to hide until the cold sore has run it's course. Thought this was going to work but it looks like I just wasted a lot of money and hope. Not sure why this drugs has all these amazing reviews on here.

I notice this when I wake in the morning and in the afternoon. I can stop taking it, within a week, the odor goes away. I tried this for 6 months off and on and am convinced it's the medicine.

Cold Sore	Frustrated, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	19-24	7/17/2011 1:03:54 PM	First time outbreak. Doc prescribed the 4 gram one day treatment as recommended for cold sores when my lips were tingling. That night my face started itching, and the next day I had a couple on my cheek that looked like zits. They slowly have spread on my chin, jaw line, and mustache area. They die fast, but new ones keep showing up. I just did a second round of the one day treatment yesterday (8 days after first round). I'm going to ask for the genital herpes ten day treatment to see if that will end this!

Little pricey but well worth it to not give to others along with a condom and it cuts your shedding of the virus by 90%. anyways well worth it. 500mg valtrex brand a day outbreak-2grams twice day, then 1gram twice a day for 3-4 days then back to 1/day.

(xwife had affair and contracted through them) have abstained since then and finally i found valtrex after reading up on this virus.  after a dental visit last month it was 8 months since last outbreak(visibly on lips), ive had few in between but as mouth ulcers not going outside lips but anyways i now take 500mg valtrex daily once/suppresion and if i get recurrent i am given 15grams xtra each fill at the pharmacy so im set. and will take 2grams 12 hours apart one day, next 3 days 1gram twice a day, then back to once a day. So far no outbreaks since using everyday as suppresion. 2 dental appt's this month so it will be a real challenge to see if can hold it off.

I just got my bottle of 45 1gram per month for only 83$ brand.  really got lucky with the state of florida helping here, my cobra private insurance ran out feb. 11' so healthcare from state has been really good. I start today on a daily regiment now, and looking forward that this is finally going to start to help me since my x-wife had an affair 3 yrs ago and gave me this intentionally. Anyways, im praying this works. i know to take 500mg a day everyday but unclear if i get a breakout how much to take for how many days before returning to my daily dosage? ive read many different dosages on recurrances, in any case ive got dental work twice in June, and just got over a full oral type 1 outbreak last week, thanx to valtrex i was in scab phase in 3-4 days, healed completely really is amazing, and so now im on a fulltime regiment so i can start dating again. Thank God its not aids or type 2.  It could be worse. Anyways thank state of florida(plus my 80$) paid for month #45 1g brand valtrex!!!! every month

Prevent Recurrent Herpes Simplex Infection	Haleigh, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	5/2/2011 4:45:04 PM	My husband and I have been together 7 yrs. I've been fighting this unknown infection off and on for 3 yrs now.First it started on my rt leg in a little cluster of what looked like pimples. Then my lips and face started to swell. It would last a couple weeks and then go away. Then, 6 mos. later I'd be right back where I started. This last time, they showed up on the tops &amp; bottoms of both of my hands. I looked like a diseased piece of riff raff!I've been taking valtrex for a little over a week now. I only take a half tablet daily, but it looks like things are clearing up nicely. I hope this does the trick because I'm running out of money to visit the doctor and pharmacy at $60 each visit to either place!!!!

Back then, you put calamine lotion on the blisters and just suffered.  I slept constantly.  This time I had severe arm pain for 3 days and woke up one morning with shingles on my arm and neck.  I saw my doctor the next day and was prescribed this drug along with a pain killer.  At the time, there were a lot of shingles on my back under the surface as well.  None of them popped out!  If there are side effects, I wouldn't know it as the shingles make a person miserable anyway.  I am still very tired and some lingering pain, but what a different experience even though I am much older now.
Genital Herpes	flora, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/2/2011 5:30:59 PM	I get REALLY bad outbreaks that can come every few WEEKS so the doc put me on the daily dose, but this script is horrid!!! If I didn't need it so bad I wouldn't take it. I also would recommend that you try everything else first. The side effects are almost as bad as the condition. The first couple days I took it I slept all day, and I'm always sick to my stomach. I get hot and sweaty allot and have to shower sometimes twice a day. Not to say it doesn't work great, but, try everything else first! 
Cold Sore		4	5	5			2/14/2011 10:40:34 PM	I wanted to be sure and let everyone know - there is a generic for Valtrex now. It's been out for a while actually.  Not all states are required to substitute the generic for the brand when you fill the medication, so that is why you may be unaware.  I noticed a lot of people were complaining about the high brand copay for this medication.  The generic works the same way as the brand and has the same active ingredients as the brand - it's the law. I'm a certified(PTCB) and registered (with my home state) Pharmacy Tech (10+ years) so I know what I'm talking about. 
Genital Herpes	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	2/14/2011 11:52:26 AM	I'm 65 and have known I had it for the past 7 years.  Prior to that I had no symptoms and my husband does not have it.  Not sure where I contracted it but probably a prior marriage years ago.  It works great.  I take it 2 or 3 times a week for maintenance and as long as I do I have no outbreaks.  The only side effect I have is occasional night sweats.  My doctor said if I take it daily, to stay off of it one week per year.  I'm lucky....my insurance pays for it with only a small copay.  Otherwise it's very expensive but I would pay the price as it works great!  I also take multivitamins for my general health as I've had two doctors tell me that you can contract other viruses easily with this disease.

During that time period my Libido dramatically decreased and I blamed every other medicine I was on. The doctor's never mentioned Valtrex could have this side effect. I decided to stop taking Valtrex and treat symptoms as they arise and within 6 months I noticed a dractic difference. A year later and I have a very happy hubby!!!! Not sure if anyone else has noticed this down side.

Genital Herpes	Abbie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	11/9/2010 8:35:38 PM	Helpful tip for people with insurance. My co-pay is the same($30) whether I get 30 pills or 10 pills. I didnt realize this at first. My doctor wrote my Rx for 30 pills, refillable each month. Also, I asked her to write it for 1000mg and I break them in half. I only take 500mg daily, so this cuts my costs a lot. Even if you only take it when you need it, you can do both of these and save a lot of money. It's not like it gets old that quickly. Just keep what you don't use now and save for when you need it again.
Cold Sore	Neen, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/4/2010 6:31:53 PM	I get cold sores very easily and they always last for at least 10 days.  I only take Valtrex at the first sign of a cold sore and it always makes the cold sore go through the process quicker and it makes the cold sore smaller/less irritated than it might regularly have been.  Taken early enough, it has stopped one from forming all together.  I am very, very happy with the results I get from taking Valtrex.

It was 2 pills a day for 14 days I believe? By day 7 I saw improvement and soreness went down a great deal. By day 14 all the sores were completely gone.About 2 days ago I broke out again, just as bad.. I'm now on day 2 of Valacyclovir HCL. I think you just need to keep trying different medications until you find the one that works for your body.

Head aches have gotten a tiny bit better, but am noticing less symptoms of disease. So you have to think, is a few weeks of side effects worth almost permenant relief of disease....

I am not sexually active because of am afraid to spread this. I was told to take valtrex everyday. This would be too expensive due to $50.00 co-pay. I only take it when I feel an outbreak is coming.Sometimes I get it twice a month. This is driving me crazy.It is so painful. What can I do?
Shingles	TPS, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/8/2010 12:07:41 PM	I am having yet another shingles outbreak. Valtrex has always worked great for me, with no side effects at all. I have had reoccurring outbreaks of shingles for several years now. As a repeat shingles sufferer, I always feel like my itchy, aching,&quot;firey and tingling&quot; feeling nerves are going to explode before an outbreak. The nerve pain is just excrutiating. I know what is coming next...erupting itchy blisters that eventually burst and ooze. You can bet that I get started on my Valtrex ASAP when I have a outbreak of shingles. Early diagnosis and treatment of shingles is of paramount importance. Don't wait to go see your doctor! Shingles pain and the lingering post neuralgia pain is the worst pain that I've ever had in my life EVER, and I've had 4 babies and a total of 15+ surgeries. I am 100% positive (for me anyway) that stress triggers my shingles outbreaks. Anyone that has shingles has my sympathy. Anyone that has the lingering neuralgia pain (PHN) after the shingles outbreak, has even more of my sympathy. It is of no consolation, but you are not alone in your suffering. For me, Valtrex is an excellent medication that gets the job done with zero side effects.

I have been on every pill they have had out for herpes (acyclovir, zovirax, valacyclivir, etc...and Valtrex. Valtrex has worked the best for me. But i still have constant breakouts. My stress level is high and i tend to be very moody all the time and this has gone on for years. I struggle with my self image every day, i have become a very self doughting person. I have a great family and friend base, but deep down every time i think about herpes i get depressed...It has ruined all my relationships. I have two kids and by god's grace they were not infected. Because i cannot afford valtrex at the moment i am taking valacyclovir two times a day..and for some reason it is taking forever to go away. I do recommend Valtrex because it seems to work faster. Valacyclovir is ok, it just seems to take a little longer to see results for myself..just my opinion
Genital Herpes	Ann, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	9/23/2010 3:23:50 PM	I connect the dots and realize that Valtrex was giving me the same horrible side effects as are the symptoms of Fibromyalgia.  I was in bed with excruciating pain and nausea and a host of other symptoms for a year and a half, was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and began piling on the drugs without relief.  Finally did my own research on each of the drugs I was taking.  Discovered the match up between Valtrex's side effects and Fibromyalgia.  Discontinued Faltrex and was nearly pain and nausea free within 2 days.  I'm so mad that my doctors didn't make this connection and that I lost so much time to pain and illness and inability to work.

Cold Sore	TM, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/21/2010 8:31:12 AM	I have been taking 500mg per day for over a year and seem to not experience any side effects. I used to have several outbreaks a year around my mouth and nose with very large ugly sores. I am reduced to one or two sores per year and they are so small that it looks more like a pimple versus a cold sore and disappear in 1-2 days. It's been so nice using this med to prevent outbreaks and to keep the few that surface under control.
Shingles	pisceslady79, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	4	Female	25-34	8/5/2010 11:07:07 AM	I have been taking Valtrex for 6 days now on im prescribed 1 gm every 8 hrs 7 days but seems too much so i just take the 1gm a day and dr's orders is to finish all medication no more 7 days o well the blisters are drying up and beginning to look like they will be falling off...only problem is the blisters are a on towards the right side of my chest and my entire right shoulder itches so much and i don't know if it's b/c of Valtrex or the Outbreak on that side of my body..I needs some answers and Caladryl is not helping the itching much...any ideas on better anti-itching creams, lotions,ointments??

Genital Herpes	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		7/25/2010 11:07:02 PM	Was diagnosed 2yrs ago. I had 3 out breaks in the 1st 5 mnths after I was diagnosed. I was prescribed Valtrex.  Dr said I didn't have to take it every day if I didn't want to. I took the Valtrex when I needed it. Definitly helped alot. I only get one sore in the same spot, seemed to pop up during my periods.  In 2 yrs I have had 4 out breaks. I only take it when i need it.  I find that ibuprofin and benydril help w pain, swelling and the itch. My ins pays for it.  45$/mnth.
Genital Herpes	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/20/2010 6:46:45 PM	I had an initial outbreak of genital herpes at age 50 after 28 yrs. of marriage to the same man. I took one 500mg Valtrex once per day for 1 year (recommended) with no side effects, have been off of it for 7 mos. so far and have not had another outbreak since the 1st. 
Recurrent Genital Herpes	jrm, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/14/2010 6:35:36 PM	I use Valtrex as a suppressent once a day with the 500mg dosage. I have had herpes since a very small child and started out when only the creams were available (those did nothing but make a mess by the way). Have been fairly happy with this medication. (I would be extremely happy if it would just get rid of it completely!) Without Valtrex, outbreaks would last anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks before clearing up and occurred at least 5 times a year. Using Valtrex over the years, outbreaks usually only last 5 days and only come once or twice a year. I have no symptoms taking this medication but it doesn't always take away all the itching and pain that comes along with the outbreaks.

Since my insurance has recently forced me to use the generic by tripling making my copay (from $50 to $166) I can already tell the difference between the brand and the generic.  All the symptoms that I would feel if I were not taking my Rx I am feeling while taking the generic, ie..aches in my legs, tingling in my groin, and near outbreaks.  Whomever said that brand and generic are the same, they lied!
Shingles	CJMOORE, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	7/5/2010 10:09:24 PM	I never knew I had chicken pox so when I went to the Dr. to find out i had Shingles I was very surprised. I thought I had gotten bit by something,, but I waited a week before going to the dr. because i was trying cholesterol meds , and had several side effects from the different ones I tried, anyway I did not get the valtrex in my system soon enough,, so I am taking like 4 to 5 a day 1 gram 4 to 5 times a day, but I have never had anything in my life like this, it has been 2 weeks I still have pain, not as bad, still have itching, and welts on right side of back, around to my uner my right breast. I do feel very very tired, and drug out. I read these reviews thinking oh my gosh please don't tell me you get this more than once in your life? I am just now going back to work after being out, 2 weeks, this was awful, and I am a very strong person who hadles pain very well, but this kicked my butt, I hope it is almost over please God?

I'm going back to acyclovir because it worked great for 10yrs.

Shingles	UsuallyHealthy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/10/2010 6:47:30 PM	The good news:  The redness and swelling around my welts was completely gone within 12 hours. Now the spots are dark and feel like scabbed bruises. Since I started taking the medication within two days of symptoms it worked VERY quickly to reduce redness and swelling.The tough news:  The medication makes me feel drunk and I see dark trails behind objects. I can't tell if it's helping the pain, because I'm still in a lot of pain and I take the medication three times a day. The pain shoots through my sternum even though the welts are on my kidney area. I'm fatigued and loopy.
Genital Herpes	Relieved, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/26/2010 3:51:24 PM	I had an outbreak on my upper thigh. It looked gross and itched. At first I was un aware that I was having an outbreak because I thought it could only appear on the genitals. I had had been diganosed with the HSV 2 virus 4 months ago but never had an outbreak. After a week of this thing on my thigh I finally consulted my doctor who then recognized it as a herpes blister and prescribed valtrex and within 3days the swelling started going down and a scab begin to form. I did finish out the treatment which was a total of 7 days

Prior to that I had a break out almost every month from contraction  two years ago(cheating ex-boyfriend). I experienced headaches, leg cramps, nausea and fatigue the first 3 months on vatlrex. Similar to the birth control pill, all side effects eventually ceased. I would recommend valtrex to any one that wants to take back control of there lives. I have an amazing man in my life now, and we have the best sex life imaginable.

It was so painful.  Thank goodness for Valtrex, I only take it when I feel an outbreak coming on.  And I guess I am one of the &quot;lucky&quot; ones who only has one ulcer during the outbreak.  It seems to shorten the length of the outbreak, which I am thankful.  I've been married for almost 30 years and have never let my husband contract herpes.  I still wonder why some people spread it.  I can not fathom having sex during an outbreak, I don't feel the same emotionally.

I was put on Valtrex in April of 09. 1gram 3X a day.Now Im down to 1gram 1X a day. I will have to take this medicine the rest of my life probably. It has worked for me 100% no more out breaks of inflammation in my eye, no more blurred vision. I'm am willing to do whatever it takes so that I do not go blind! I would recomend this to anyone.

However, I now have high blood pressure, which is one of the side effects. I have also been skipping periods and have frequent night sweats. I thought it was early menopause. Now I'm not so sure. Am thinking I will back off on the every day dosage.

Valtrex 3/day for 6 months, now 1/day.  I had a solution of steriods.  Last week an injection behind the eye.  That really helped, no more reddness or itchiness.  Never itched on the skin, but slightly itched in my eye.  Eye was red in the corner.  Will need cataract removed in July.Still taking Valtrex, my medicine was changed to Valacyclovir which seems to be what Medco switched me to. Has anyone been switched?  That's really what brought me to this site.  Going back to my fabulous Dr. tomorrow.

I had gotten it while i was pregnant and didnt know. I didnt have any symptoms until i went into labor. I thought that i was having a reacton to something the nurses gave me. Since 2004 i have been taking valtrex off and on. I have had two more beautiful babies that are not affected by my illness. I take the medication every day and i know that i would be in a lot of pain with out it.

If I forget or get off my regamine for any length of time, I start getting that &quot;tingling&quot; feeling and pain. Of course I immediately get back on, taking up to 5 per day (as prescribed by my doctor) and the beginning of the blister goes away. It's the next-best thing to a cure.

I began taking Valtrex daily 6 yrs ago to suppress my outbreaks that I still was dealing with every other month.  Valtrex is a lifesaver!  In the beginning after taking Valtrex, my outbreaks became very slight and now are non-existent.  Because the generic is now available my insurance co. won't pay as much if I choose Valtrex and not the generic Valacyclovir.  I'll try the generic, but if it isn't as good, I'll go back no matter how much it costs.

I have shingles on my back that wrap around to my left side and breast.  The pain before break out was tremendous.  However, the second day on Valtrex, the pain in my left temple feels like nothing I've ever experienced.  Sharp shooting pain around the clock.  The doctor lowered my dose from 1G to 500mg, but I still have the pain in my head.  The rash and pain before do not compare to this pain.  I do not have any shingles on my face or head, so concerned about the pain and question whether or not to continue the Valtrex.

If I take it when the symptons start, it prevents the blisters from the Shingles from ever showing up.  Only issue is the cost.  It is really expensive, even with insurance.

Tests came back positive for simplex but there is no pain for me. People normally have pain right? Is there anyone else experiencing outbreaks without any major discomfort? The prescription drastically decreased the healing time of my second outbreak compared to my first outbreak. Overall I haven't experienced any problems with the medication and would recommend it to any one going through outbreaks.

The only bad thing I have to say about this drug is that, with my old insurance, it cost about $60 for a month and with my new insurance costs $100. VERY EXPENSIVE, obviously - the most expensive medicine I have ever taken. But the reason I spend this much money on this medicine is because it works. I take it once daily. Once, I was on vacation and didn't take it for 2 or 3 days because my prescription ran out. I had an infection and, from my doctor's orders, took 2/day for 3 days and the infection went away. I took this medicine for about 4 or 5 months and then stopped b/c I noticed it was working well and I didn't want to pay for something if I could survive w/o it. Unfortunately, soon after I stopped taking it, I had a painful outbreak. My OB/GYN told me that the makers said you should take it continuously for at least a year before stopping it. So, I'm back on it again, a bit more poor, but I think it's worth it because I have such painful outbreaks. I would highly reccommend this medicine.
Genital Herpes	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	8/19/2009 4:16:23 PM	After reading some of these reviews I feel like I must be a miracle. I never had a severe outbreak. I got what looked like a bug bite a couple times a year. A skin test showed I have HSV2. Since then I've had Valtrex handyd (500 mg/d). I take it to suppress outbreaks at the first sign of an itch. I also take it every day when sexually active. If the itch comes, it's gone within hours of taking a pill. The &quot;bug bite&quot; has never come back. I haven't transmitted it to anyone (even in a year-long relationship with regular unprotected sex). I've never had any notable side effects. If this drug were a little cheaper, it would be perfect in my book.

Genital Herpes	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	7/29/2009 9:29:04 AM	I took one 500 mg dose of valtrex to prevent genital herpes outbreaks and had an immediate, horrible reaction to it.  Within five hours of taking it, I began to sweat profusely in my feet, palms and forehead.  I went to sleep the same night and woke up sweating even worse than the night before.  I also experienced a crawling feeling in my legs and feelings of worthlessness.  I am 56 years old and in excellent health.  Perhaps Valtrex is right for some people; as for me I will not take it again.

I had a cyst break open and my boyfriend had a canquer (sp?) sore. Just be aware there are multiple ways to get this! I'm finding I'm having incredibly horrible night mares, lots of heart burn and stomach pain and painful periods since starting Valtrex on a regular basis vs. on a needed basis only. Does any one else have these same issues? I'm curious if the nightmares are related since I haven't changed anything else in my diet, exercise, job, etc. I've also been experiencing a lot of nausea during the days. The only conclusion I can come to is the valtrex. I always feel bloated when taking this too. Any other suggestions to use instead of Valtrex? Any suggestions are helpful!

I have a BSN amd an MA is pych.  i FIND i HAVE VERY LOW ENERGY AND JOINT PAIN, ALONG WITH MEDERATELY SEVERE MUSCULAR PAIN IN MY LOWER TO UPPER BACK.  While doing the research, of course these are some of the side effects of this medication, though thought to be on &quot;less severe&quot; scale.  My shingles are starting to go away, but the pain at the site of the shimgles can be very uncomfortable.  I am taking 1 gram every 8 hours.  When I finish my full course of this medication, I will again give it another review.  I'm not downing this medication because as a professional, I know it works well in many patients.  Just laetting y'all know my experience with this medication.  Thanks for listening...more soon.

He says that he fust had friends and needed to talk to those little girls. I am 41 and had to go to the emergency room who reffered me to my obgyn and after a painful situation and plenty of test. She put me on valtrex and it has helped so much. I still have trouble dealing with the thought of how I got this and I never had it when I had my kids. I amstill with my husband until the kids get older. But I can never understand how I got this and me never ever fooled around with no one since I met my husband!!!!!

Genital Herpes	 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female		7/6/2009 2:38:50 AM	was wondering if anyone could help me with some answers - how long can herpes be dormant before an outbreak? I had a horrible outbreak and I have never in my life had herpes or symptoms before - my husband who I am faithful to has never had it so I was clueless, all we could think of was we have a friend whose son gets hsv 1 the coldsores alot and is on medicine for it and that maybe i touched something of his and then contracted it wiping after going to the bathroom or something - the type I tested pos for was hsv 1 which my doc says normally is the cold sore type - he put me on valtrex but it seems I do have repeat outbreaks - not as much painful sores but alot of the flu like symptoms aches etc - I wonder if I should be on valtrex every day? I found it made me feel irritable while on it - any help is appreciated - the last resort is to think maybe my spouse was unfaithful and that is how I got this because I have never slept with anyone but him for the past 7 years so where did this come from

Hard to say how effective when I've gone 1 year to 15 years between episodes.  Have experienced some nausea, but better than crititcal condition in the hospital.  For those that say it's expensive, be sure to get your $10 coupons from the Valtrex website.  $120 a year off the cost really helps.

We were both prescribed Valtrex &amp; find it is an excellent drug. I dnt suffer from outbreaks anymore but always keep meds around just in case. Ive only ever had 1 sore in the same place so managing my herpes hasnt really been a problem so ive chosen 2 only use meds when i feel nessessary (eg- when sex has irritated area or im feeling rundown). I usually take 2-3 tabs @ a time which gives me relief quite quickly. I feel unless ur reg suffering outbreaks (u should ask why)U shouldnt really need 2 take valtrex everyday. Its very effective when taken @ req 2 quickly relieve any symtoms u think mayb about 2 appear. Listen 2 ur body,the tingeling feeling does happen b4 a sore appears so act on it asap &amp; valtrex will stop the sore from breaking thru.

Other	Rocco's Mom, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/5/2009 2:41:24 AM	I have what I've been told is known as &quot;Skin Herpes.&quot;  My outbreaks are frequently in my back about 1/2 way up the right side or on my right forehead.  Since I retired and am not under the stress of teaching in a high school, my outbreaks are much less frequent.  HOWEVER, I just had a bad one that swelled up my right forehead, went around my eye and down to my mid-cheek.  The blisters stayed onmy forehead, about the size of a quarter. The Valtrex stopped the pain within a two hour period.  What has shocked me though, is that it has helped other pain I have been suffering - I have Digenerative Disc Disease and have already lost three lumber disks.  I expect to lose the other two soon, but today for the first time, my back did not hurt nearly as much as usual!  My fibromyalgia is almost non-existent; my bad left shoulder is not hurting like usual.  Valtrex seems to be helping all my pain issues - even the ortheoarthritis.   I'll be meeting with my doctor ASAP to discuss long term treatment - I'm only taking 1 gr three times a day!  I've seen almost no discussion about skin herpes, but am told it is most common among wrestlers - and I was seeing a wrestling coach for 17 years. THANK YOU, VALTREX!

I am taking it only if I feel an outbreak coming on.  My dr said that if I experience more than 6 outbreaks a yr then it would be beneficial to take Valtrex everyday.  I researched that Valtrex is considered to be the most potent and effective way to treat HSV1&amp;2 because of its unique characteristics...It is very expensive about $90 for 10 pills but DEFINATELY worth it.  Ill update once I know more.

My blisters dried up and did not drain. This drug is the answer to shingles. I noticed reading other reviews that other patients said they had stomach trouble. My doctor informed me to eat a MEAL when I take this medication and I did and I expierenced no stomach problems.. and I have a VERY sensitive stomach as it is!

Since I couldn't see that area (just above the dimple area on my buttocks), I didn't realize what was going on. Started the Valtrex and within 2 days, blisters have dried up and pain is gone. Just wish I could see for my self what is going on - I'm just not flexible enough.
Cold Sore	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/4/2009 5:33:12 PM	I broke with a cold sore at approx. 5:30 PM on Thursday- I immediately started my prescription. (I had a VERY small blister that had broken the surface of my lip... I had taken a nap, and so missed the initial warning signs..) Anyway, I started the Valtrex an hour after noticing the emerging sore. By Friday, it had broken through, however was incredibly less severe than it ever had been before. By Sunday, it was beginning to scab over. On wednesday, at approx. 5 PM, the scab fell off, and I considered the sore resolved. Valtrex effectively not only turned a 10 day event into a 6 day one, but extremely lowered it's pain, size, and overall negative experience involved with a cold sore. I HIGHLY recommend this drug- I believe that if I had been able to take the drug before the sore broke the surface, I may not have even gotten a sore at all!

Cold Sore	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	2/21/2009 9:35:19 PM	Before undergoing a scar treatment on my face, I was given Valtrex to treat a coldsore that had gone wild on one corner of my mouth.  The pills are enormous and had some trouble swallowing them - I took one in the morning and one in the evening - but they cleared up a dime-sized sore in about 6 days.  Since this first outbreak 2.5 months ago, I have had two more very bad outbreaks (sores on both corners of my lips).  I don't know if this is valid, but I am wary about taking Valtrex again because I have never treated coldsores with antivirals before, and before the recent outbreaks, I haven't had coldsores anywhere near this bad in about 7 years.

The Valtrex helped to get rid of the horrible blisters on my face, mouth (inside &amp; out), scalp and rim of my eye after about 48 hrs, which was faster than I thought.  But, I am still in a lot of pain.  My teeth hurt, my jaw, head and ear hurt.  I itch so much, that it's driving me crazy.  The skin on the right side of my face, which is where the blisters were, is so dry, it looks like alligator skin.  This is HELL!!!

Most of the time my creme &quot;Zovirax&quot; will do. But every 3-4 months I break out with 4-6 cold sores. That's when I have to use Valtrex and it cleans it up - fast.... Valtrex and Zovirax work great together...

His entire face is covered in these blisters all to the right. The pain is out of this world he explains. The fevers as well, he has no appetite either.. The shingles began on Sat he was prescribed one thing by his pedi then due to the infection spreading to his right eye i rushed him in for an emergency appt to the opthamalogist, who then prescribed Valtrex. Since taking the first pill my son experienced a very bad head ache. after a few hours the headache has now cleared up.. The opthamalogist advised that the medication was my son was given by his pedi is from dinosaur age. Valtrex is the best thing right now for this type of diagnosis. Stay tuned everyone. i will let you know within 72 hours if this medication was benefical to my son. Thanks

No more outbreaks :-)when i was diagnosed it had to be the worst thing i ever heard, my daddy was my support when i went to the doctor... going to the bathroom was the most painful thing ever, i wouldn't even wish it on my worst enemy. ladies, an easy way to go to the bathroom.. strattle the toilet(as far as your legs can go),keep your body totally staight and go... it doesnt splash.. yay.. you'll love the non-burning sensation..i like to consider myself lucky, when you have genital herpes and you know that you have it, we can do something about not passing it along.. in my life i'm glad that it stops at me...good luck
Recurrent Genital Herpes	abc123, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	11/20/2008 2:03:32 PM	I started suppressive therapy (1g/day) about 8 days ago.  I used to only take the drug only with an occuring breakout because it gives me headaches. I was tired of the frequent breakouts, so I agreed to try the daily therapy.  The headaches I'm getting now don't seem to go away, whether I take them with food or at bedtime.  I went for a routine dr's appt a few days ago(about 6 days into my treatment), and found that my normally low blood pressure was abnormally elevated.  By the next day, my headache was so bad that I went to the doctor.  My blood pressure had skyrocketed!  My pressure was always low my entire life, and I'm generally in very good health.  So I stopped taking the medication yesterday.  Today I got the bp checked and it was back down, almost close to normal. It literally dropped about 50 pts overnight with no bp lowering medication.  I am very hesitant to take Valtrex again, and I'm curious how often patients that are having headaches with this medication are actually experiencing elevated blood pressure as a side effect of this drug. The headaches could be a symptom of elevated blood pressure.  It's worth looking into.

When I found out I had HSV 2 the doctor said I could either do suppressive therapy or just take it when I have an outbreak.  That first outbreak was a nightmare and enough to make me never want another one.  I have been on suppressive therapy for over 6 months now and the only other outbreak I had was when I went away for the weekend and forgot to take the Valtrex with me.  This allows me to live a normal life without being in pain.
Shingles	MReiser4670, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	11/8/2008 11:33:15 AM	I've been prone to shingles outbreaks since I was a child.  My mother took me to doctor after doctor to figure out how to treat it, but nobody could figure it out.  Only in recent years these anti-viral type drugs have had any effect.  After my last outbreak in September, my dr gave me an rx for Valtrex with the instructions to take it as soon as I realized an outbreak was coming.  Well, one just came.  I didn't realize it until yesterday (Friday), even though I had symptoms as early as Wednesday evening.  I took two 1mg pills last night and then two this AM, and this drug is BY FAR the most effective I've ever taken.  I normally suffer from the symptoms for about 1-3 weeks depending on severity, but I feel better already.  I normally start with a general malaise, then move on to slight nausea and then pain on the right side of my face &amp; head before I get the blisters.  They always start as a cold sore in the right corner of my mouth, but then they pop up on my forehead over my right eye.  Sometimes the clusters are as big as a quarter, other times, they're very minimal.  As of right now, I have the blisters on my lip, but nothing on my forehead.  I did feel pretty nauseous in the middle of the night and woke up with a moderate headache, but I don't know for sure if those are side-effects of the medicine or just symptoms of the outbreak.If this drug works like this every time I have an outbreak, it has the potential to change my life.

Shingles	shaypeach, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	11/1/2008 10:28:04 PM	I am a nursing assistant at a local hospital and this is my 3rd outbreak of shingles in the pst 2 years.  All three outbreaks have been on my left cheek parallel to my nose.  When I first noticed the first outbreak, I went to the ER 2x and was diagnosed with a &quot;spider bite&quot;???  Then I went my my family-friend dr who took one look and said it was shingles.  So really get a second opinion or even third when your experiencing that much pain.  The valtrex has healed the outbreak, but the pain is absolutely horrible after and the &quot;after out-break pain&quot; has been horrible with all three outbreaks recently.

It seems as if the medication, Valtrex, is not working as fast as I expect. No visible sores, but itching and burning comes and goes. I am not dealing well with this and haven't been able to share with anyone. Boyfriend seems to be taking the disease lightly and not in a rush to get tested. Very bothersome for me.

She didn't even look at the problem. Either way it should have cleared-up the problem.  My first doctor, the one that I trust the most. Looked at it and determend it was gential herpes. He gave me three samples of 1000mg of Valtrex and a script for seven more days. For a total of ten days at a 1000mg a day. Plus a script for a 30day supply of Valtrex 500mg.  I had to wait till June 1st. to get the scripts fill. When my Rx plan went into effect. Just out of sure habit, as soon as I got home I took one of the samples. I still had 13 days to wait for my Rx plan to go into effect. When I went back to him he did bloodwork and a culture. The culture came back negitive for herpes. I can't go go back because is not in my healthcare network.

My doctor prescribed it about 3 years ago and I have been taking it ever since and have only noticed an outbreak starting when I would stop taking the medication. I was not aware that I would be taking a prescription drug for such an extended period of time.I take it at night before retiring.Usually with a glass of water.I usually keep an extra glass of water on the night table so I can have more to drink when I awake at 2 or 3:ooam an feel thisty.I understand that it is important to drink plenty of water with this regimen, so this have been my routine.My only question is;will my liver be damaged at some pointfrom this med?

Cold Sore	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	7/24/2008 10:28:13 PM	For over 20 years I have had bad coldsore caused by weather, stress, skin irritation, and whatever else.  I would get between 3 and 8 coldsore per breakout that would cover my lips, chin, and sometimes underneath my finger nails at least once a month.  They were very painful and embarassing.  I began taking Valtrex and it has made the outbreaks alot more bearable and less frequent.  I get outbreaks only about every 3 to 4 months and not as severe.  I do sometimes have dizzy spells but the outcome of the medication is worth it.  I would also recommend looking into vitamins that have been associated with coldsores.  Remember to be safe when you do get an outbreak because you never know who you may pass it on to.  (Doctors believe a family friend gave it to me when I was a year old.)

The doctor prescribed 1 gram 3x day.  This drug has torn up my stomach, I have been extremely tired and for the first hour after taking the drug I feel spaced out and have difficulty focusing(not mentally just visually).  I guess the good news is that my shingles seem to have gotten a bit better and do not itch.  But, I still have 2 more days to go on the meds.

I have been outbreak free for over a year. My first outbreak had me in agony, my tip for making going to the bathroom bearable is to take a couple of 3 inch gauze pads, soak them with Bactine first aid liquid, then wipe affected area. The first few wipes might be touchy, but then the lidocane numbs so you can pee and wipe like normal.

Cold Sore	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	6/4/2008 5:17:46 PM	So I get horrible, enormous, cold sores when I'm stressed, have been in the sun, the weather changes, or when my body just wants to be a pain! I also don't get that &quot;tingling&quot; feeling before-hand that a lot of people talk about. I used acyclovir for a while, and it didn't work as well. Too many doses made it difficult to take diligently. Valtrex works well- it doesn't stop the sore, but it minimizes the time they last and their size, which is all I can ask for I guess. I take it whenever I see one forming. I've heard it's bad for your liver, so I don't want to go on suppressive dosage unless it gets to be many many times a month.

Well, I soon discovered that it was shingles, not herpes, but by acting quickly with the medication I knocked out the shingles (symptoms anyway) in about 4 days. I took one 500mg tablet 4x a day for 3 days.

Spoke to her doctor and he stated to give her Valtrex. As soon as she would feel the tingle or soreness on her lip, she would start taking Valtrex. It has made a difference in her self-esteem and how she functions as this is an infection and can bring down your system. She is happy for the relief.

Shingles	75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		3/25/2008 2:31:44 PM	Over 40 years ago I had a single shingle on my right hip area (buttock).  It recurred during 10-year period perhaps 15-20 times.  Then the virus became dormant until 2008.  Once again, a single outbreak at the same site plus an area on the neck---both on the right side.  This is the first time I have been prescribed an antiviral medication and it was very helpful.  I had two 10-day periods of treatment.  A fair amount of fatigue accompanied this episode as well as dizziness that lingers still.  The discomfort of pain is no longer present.

I used to constantly have out breaks, but once I got health insurance and talked to my doctor about it, I've had only one TINY outbreak (it lasted maybe two days and wasn't that painful). The only problem I had was headaches. I changed the time of day and what I ate with it and it's fine now! I'd recommend this to anyone with genital herpes.

Started taking Valtrex about 1 year ago and it works much better.  Cold sore will only last a few days and is barely noticable.  I still get cold sores after I've been ill or under stress but it isn't as bad and the medication makes the cold sore much more bearable.  I also keep a dose on hand so that I can take it immediately.

I have had recurrent cold sores since the age of 11.  I usually experienced 3 to 4 outbreaks a year.  However, after my last pregnancy, I was having 2 to 3 outbreaks a month.  I finally went on suppressive therapy with oral valtrex.  I feel like I finally have this virus under control again.  I am now concentrating on getting my immune system healthy.  I am extremely pleased with the effectiveness of this medication.

Genital Herpes	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	12/22/2007 11:59:09 AM	I have taken Valtrex and I noticed I became a little dizzy shortly after taking it. So my doctor change my medication to Famciclovir. This medication was not helpful at all and now I'm switching back to Valtrex. The way I see it, I would rather have the temporary dizzieness than the outbreak.

I was prescribed Valtrex. At first it didn't make to much of a difference to me, but as time has passed I no longer experience any outbreaks. When I say time, I talk about three months. The drug itself is a little pricey if not covered by your medical plan, however is well worth the money.

Within 24 hours after taking the first dose of Valtrex, the tingling sensation and the beginning signs of the cold sore are gone.  No blisters.  No pain.  I think this medication is remarkable.  I have had cold sores all my life and tried everything that the drugstore could offer.  Nothing OTC compares with this medication for cold sores.  I highly recommend it.

Cold Sore	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/10/2007 8:34:28 AM	I get several cold sores each winter, often lasting a week or more.  This drug, when taken at the first inkling of a cold sore, prevented it from becoming a full blown nightmare.  The cold sore was barely noticeable and was gone within 5 days.

Recurrent Genital Herpes	Ginger, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	11/6/2007 12:25:44 AM	I have been living with genital herpes for 21 years. I had outbreaks several times a month. I was placed on a high dosage suppression therapy. When I first started taking Valtrex it gave me severe headaches not unlike previous medications. Then I discovered that taking it before bed gave fantastic results. No headaches and I only have an outbreak when I have too much soy in my diet. My outbreaks are limited to 2/3 per year and last less than 2 days.

I insisted on suppressive treatment rather than waiting for symtoms and have been using this for about 4 years.  No outbreaks is over a year now.  I feel normal again.

My shingles outbreak would have been much worse without this medicine. I have no blisters because of Valtrex.There were no side effects, even if there were I would not have know it as I was feeling so poorly overall.

It has greatly helped relieve some of the worries of having HSV and I believe it truly keeps my outbreaks at bay for long periods of time. They didn't have this when I first got HSV and so now it's such a relief to know I can rely on Valtrex.

I was in great pain and using the toilet was agony. The blisters would sting like crazy and burn. My whole body was run down and no energy. Finally I was put on VALTREX and less than 2 days later I felt completely different, the blisters started drying up and I honestly felt so much better.

Treatment started the day the pustules appeared, cleared within the week, now taking suppressive therapy.
