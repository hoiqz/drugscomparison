Other	zelliebean, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	9/17/2012 1:41:43 PM	My cholesterol and triglycerides actually increased after being on medication for about 6 months so I won't be buying any more of it and probably won't finish what I still have.  I have also altered my diet and eat much healthier food than several years ago - have dropped 2 - 3 sizes in clothes and probably 50 pounds over last 2 - 3 years.  My cholesterol has always ranged from 220 - 240 since I was in 20's and am now 56.  Not sure what else I can do and I have not plans to take statin drugs.  This doctor is not insisting on drugs - he just says to watch diet.  My &quot;good&quot; cholesterol is in normal range as is the ratio, but the total cholesterol and &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol are considered to be borderline.
Other	FarHorizon, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Male	55-64	9/10/2012 10:15:23 AM	I quit Lipotor because of side effects including joint and muscle pain (severe).  I switched to non-prescription Cholest-Off and although it was effective for cholesterol, I have the same side effects.  I'm now discontinuing the use of this because of the severe side effects.
Other	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Male	65-74	9/8/2012 8:54:53 PM	I have been taking this for about one month. I quit taking statins due to severe leg cramps, plus I have been diagnosed with peripreral neuropathy which is also tied to statins. No leg cramps for the firs couple of weeks but now I am getting them almost as bad as when I was on statins. I have not had my cholesterol tested since using this so I cannot comment on that. Not sure what I am going to do at this point but I probably will not continue taking it.

Other	Loves cheese, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	55-64	8/20/2012 12:08:00 PM	I can't fully respond to the stars until I get my labwork done again. But I was on a prescription generic statin which did work - brought my overall cholesterol down from 290 to 199. It's side effects were loose stools and brittle fingernails. I have taken almost a whole bottle of Cholest off, often taking right as I eat or after because I forget to take it 15-30 minutes before, and recently have begun to have the same side-effects as the statin: Loose stools, sometimes with urgency, and brittle fingernails. I wonder if wine exacerbates this as the morning after I have 1-2 glasses I have a worse problem all the next morning. I mildly exercise, I am not over weight, I have never smoked and do not have heart disease in my family history so thinking of stopping all of these type of meds/supplements, but I would likely have to greatly reduce eating meat and dairy to keep my cholesterol lower. Red rice yeast did not lower my cholesterol but I had no side effects. Hoping the medical community finds that genetically high cholesterol without the other risk factors is ok.

I took 2 pills on day 2 and had dizziness any time I stood up or even took a deep breath. It is 2 weeks later and I still have light-headedness.
Other	gamecock girl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	55-64	11/17/2011 7:23:33 PM	Ignore the STARS. I have Fibromyalgia and I could not take cholestrol meds (more muscle cramps/don't need that). I started cholest off about 1 month ago, and now I have more intense muscle cramps in my thighs. I need to ask Dr about this. Now that I've read other comments about this I think that cholest off is causing the muscle cramps. 
Other	jewelryartist, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	45-54	10/4/2011 5:34:27 PM	My cholesterol has been 260 for years and I have tried 4 different statins.  I heard about Cholest-off and decided to give it a try.  I experience digestive difficulties to an unusual degree (I take one pill at bedtime, this may be my problem).  Since beginning the supplement I have lost 12 lbs. and have not had my levels checked.  Most days I am unable to leave home for running for the bathroom.  Has anyone experienced this degree of symptoms?

I had 6 months to improve my habits and avoid medication.  I started taking CholestOff, cut back on the junky foods and exercised a little more often. I didn't make any major lifestyle changes, just cut back on the foods I really knew I shouldn't be eating anyway. Six months later, my blood test results made me and my Dr. very happy. They were the best numbers I've had in years. No need for prescription meds. Everything should be fine as long as I refrain from my former bad food habits. 
Other	Tex, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	5/11/2011 12:07:38 PM	It really works, although doctors are skeptical of it's actual results. But, since I have taken this product my total cholestrol has been in satisfactory ranges.
Other	TimSez, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	3/29/2011 12:07:06 PM	My total cholesterol level has averaged 222 over the past 6 years.  I used Cholestoff  as described, twice a day from 15 to 30 minutes before meals.  Maybe 4 times per week I would forget to take the pills before going out to eat.  I used it for 3 full months before another blood test.  I did not make any other changes to my diet or exercise, because I really wanted to know what this would do all by itself, and my next approach would have been red yeast rice.  My wife made the comment that having to schedule my meals probably reduced my food intake, and that may have been true sometimes, but I noticed that I actually found myself eating cheese and red meat more frequently thinking the Cholestoff maybe would prevent the cholesterol absorption.  I'm serious, although I've never had a terrible diet, I wanted to see if this product could help give me some relief in terms of eating things I really enjoy (in moderation).  I was ready for some bad numbers because of that.  I was very pleasantly surprised when my doctor called me this morning and said, &quot;whatever you are doing, keep it up&quot;.  My numbers were:Dec 2010 before Cholestoff: HDL = 70, LDL = 148, Total Chol = 232, Triglycerides = 72, Ratio = 3.3Mar 2011 after Cholestoff: HDL = 64 (2nd best ever), LDL = 125 (best ever), Total Chol = 198 (best ever), Triglycerides = 47 (best ever), Ratio = 3.1 (best ever)I think that's awesome. I still want to know more about the safety of the product, and I am going to my Urologist to see what he says about the Calcium additives since I suffer from Calcium Oxalate kidney stones, but I plan to continue taking it and see what next year's numbers bring.  I also want to increase my exercise for the next round as I should.

I tried to tolerate for a few weeks and and is discontinuing.  Also the ingredients on my bottle includes Titanium Dioxide and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate which I don't believe should be taken orally.

Other	nonameleft, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	1	1	Female	55-64	10/1/2010 2:56:34 PM	I took this for about 60 days. During that time I saw many specialist and had numerous test run trying to find out why I was so sick. It never occurred to me that this supplement could be causing the problems - vomiting - couldn't eat - lost about 10 lbs that I couldn't afford to lose - stomach pain - very sick. When the last specialist suggested I stop taking all supplements I started getting better and realized Cholest Off was causing all the symptoms - it was the only new supplement I had added and then realized my sypmtoms started about the same time I started taking it.  I will carefully consider before taking supplements.  Terrible experience.  1st time I've ever read a blog or contributed.

The good news is that I'm losing weight.  I also was a little concerned because of the calcium carbonate, as I was told to steer clear of this because of kidney stones I have experienced.

Before this diagnosis my doctor was concerned with my cholesterol. I wasn't. She tried two different Statins and I argued more and more. My knees hurt and I began research. In short, this was the one thing we both could agree on because it works.  If it didn't she would still be pushing those lousy Statins.  I have no interactions problems.  The bottom line for me the product is easily found, relatively inexpensive and and has no negative side effects; which no other cholesterol medicine can claim. 
Other	Norm, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	55-64	8/26/2009 3:35:14 PM	Cholestoff lowered my cholesterol from 246 to 216 in 30 days.  NO question about it.  I had a violent reaction to Lipitor that almost killed me so statins are out of the question.  There MAY be a problem.  I have had severe foot pain and leg cramps, coincidentally, since starting the Cholestoff.  This might be completely, as I said coincidental, and may be specific to my make-up.  I'd strongly suggest you try it.  There is NO doubt that it works but be cognizant of my problem and go from there.  Good luck.
