Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/20/2011 12:07:42 AM	I had a cough that would not go away. This medicine took away my cough almost instantly.  I would have given it five stars but it left my throat and back of my tounge numb.
Stuffy Nose	0-2 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	5	Female	0-2	3/14/2011 5:46:35 PM	Prescribed to my son from 11-16 months to help relieve symptoms of croup.  Only give 1/4 tsp at night to help decongest and ease cough so he can rest.  Best treatment so far to help with symptoms.
Cold Symptoms	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/9/2011 2:48:11 AM	I have never been Rx this before but it works. It has a bad taste but you have to get paste that. However, my dr. prescribed it as an alternative to the codeine for night time because this was the strongest on the market that wasn't a narcotic...he mainly did this so I could function during the day at work. First morning I took it I nearly fell asleep at the wheel. When I got to work I was allowed to nap for about 20 minutes. Thank God I have an understanding boss...anyway, it made me very sleepy but it worked great at clearing my nose and ears and stopping my throat from hurting as much.

Cough	geegee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/15/2010 9:51:50 PM	I was given this to take for my cough and it works great.  I was looking on here to see what it was because I had never heard of it. Very pleased! Stopped my cough, runny nose, and sore throat. It's not the best tasting stuff but it works.
Cold Symptoms	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	6/3/2010 5:17:09 PM	This med was prescribed by the Pediatrician for my 3 y/o and 19 m/o for a viral/cold with cough &amp; fevor.  The 3 y/o tolerated it well; However, the 19 month old became very irritable, crying, hitting her head, temper tantrums, inconsolable, sweating profusely.  No rash or other normal things you look for in a reaction, but it had to be this med.  It was scarey.

Cold Symptoms	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	2	1	Female	25-34	12/31/2009 6:57:34 PM	This was prescribed for my 1year old, 2mL every 6 hours.  Immediately cleared her nose and stopped her cough, but made her so irritable and excitable she couldn't stand herself.  Uncontrollable crying, temper tantrums, and refusal to be held, put down, etc.  Wondering if the 2mL prescribed by her pediatrician was an overdose (stated by manufacturer to take 2.5mL for 6 to 12 year old) .  VERY concerned about this medication being prescribed by pediatrician for a 1 year old. Note:  previous experience with Benadryl produced similar side effects in our child.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/20/2009 11:39:15 AM	Dr. prescribed due to inflammation in chest and chronic sinusitis. Only one teaspoonful at a time proves strength of product. I only wish I could find a generic equivalent, as I have a very limited income.

Cold Symptoms	55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2		55-64	11/24/2009 2:44:18 PM	It did help my cough and congestion/stuffy nose, but caused my restless legs to worsen which kept me awake, so didn't get any more rest than I would have with the cough and stuffy nose to start with.
