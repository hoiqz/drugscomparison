Difficulty Falling Asleep	AZGirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	7/30/2012 4:42:07 AM	I did not feel sleepy but when I finally fell asleep I have extremely scary and vivid dreams!!! Of suicide and murders!!! Waking up after those kind of dreams are NOT the way I want to start my day!! I will never take them again.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Bugeyes, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	7/6/2012 8:27:42 AM	This med worked for a week and a half then it just stopped.  It just stopped.  Iquit taking it for 3 days then went back but cannot fall asleep for 4 hrs and that's with a pm pill added in.  I don't care for it and I paid a fortune for it.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	shports, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	5/15/2012 9:59:37 AM	This drug actually kept me awake.  so bad I called manufacturer takeda pharmaceuticals and described the affect the drug was having on me.  They said their drug is meant to help people fall asleep...not stay asleep?  HUH?  all the drug supply companies have some excuse for when their drug doesn't work.  I have always had good results from ambien.  If I wake up taking ambien I have NO PROBLEM falling back to sleep.  My doctor passed away from a brain anurism so I will have to find a doctor that doesn't mind helping me getting ambien when I need it.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Hana, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	2/22/2012 3:12:15 PM	Rozerem is expensive and there is no generic version.  It did not work for me and is too expensive even if it did work.  I could not take it after a high-fat meal and had to be taken the same time every night (per doctor).  Doctor also explained that this Rx would take awhile to build up in my system in order for it to fully work.  Sleep eludes me *sigh* &amp; I'm beginning to wonder if there is any insomnia medicine that actually works?  I have tried so many different ones but to no avail.Amitryptaline was the only Rx that worked really well for me but I gained 60 lbs on it otherwise I would still be on it because I did not experience any other side effects and it WORKED WELL and didn't require a high dosage to get relief!  ^_^
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	nlight, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	55-64	2/15/2012 2:00:31 AM	I started taking this drug because I was waking up 2 to 3 times a night and not going back to sleep over an hour.  I had not had a full night's sleep in weeks.  The first night or two I had no problems but as nights passed I not only went back to sleeping an hour or so at a time but I began waking up from vivid, weird dreams.  In the end I was waking up 3 to 4 times a night after dreaming and remembering the dreams and sometimes talking in my sleep.  I had to get off this med, it was making sleep impossible.  I've been put on Silenor and have taken it for 5 days and so far, so good.

Restoril &amp; an occasional sonata will do the trick. Unfortunately even with this combination I only get 4-6 hrs of restful sleep
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1		45-54	1/16/2011 12:17:18 PM	Rozeran was completely useless.  I've been taking it for 3 months and my insomnia has not improved at all.  I am still awake for 3 days at a time, and when I finally fall asleep I only sleep for an hour or so.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	too_scared_to_sleep, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	11/9/2010 5:38:54 PM	I'm only 13 years old and for years I've had sleep problems. Finally my doctor put me on this and the first night was great. I went to sleep at 10 instead of 2 or 3 in the morning and staid asleep. But then the next few days, I woke up more than I did without a sleep med. and even though I slept for only a few hours each night I've always been one to remember 2 or 3 dreams, but never experienced any nightmares. The second night on, I had multiple nightmares that were vivid and just horrible. I would wake up after having a couple and then would be terrified to go back to sleep, 'cause I was afraid I would relive them. I never take naps, but everyday (and even the first day) I was so groggy that I would come home from school fall asleep, skip dinner, wake up for an hour to do homework then take my medicine and fall back asleep. Plus, your extremely hot all the time. I have to say being mentally exhausted is much better than the mental experience caused from the night terrors.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Thom, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	10/7/2010 5:19:42 AM	Does not work until it builds up in the system I personally do not have 2 maybe 3 weeks to wait for sleep. I suggest ambien

I have taken it for over a year and really can't say it help's.  insurance pays 1/2 but still cost's $80 plus.  I only take it because I'm that in need of sleep.  Sufeer from anxiety.  Does not help.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	sleepless in La Mesa, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	6/29/2010 3:20:25 PM	I have used it for years, since I have to take something for sleep every night. I have not experienced any adverse side effects. It works OK but not always; some nights it just doesn't work and I have to take Ambien. Eating any high-fat food during the evening can keep it from working per the product literature. Also it does nothing to reduce anger or anxiety, so if that's part of your insomnia I wouldn't recommend it. In general it's a pretty wimpy medication, lacking the &quot;knockdown&quot; power of Ambien or benzodiazepines. However, I think it is longer lasting than non-CR Ambien, especially if you take 1 1/2 or two tablets.  
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	baker61912, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	6/5/2010 9:57:12 PM	I first started rozerem about a week ago. After the first night I told myself I would never take it again because I woke up about every hour. I had very bad dreams and at one point woke up and started seeing things. After reading post about the drug it stated people need to take it for about a week for it to work. I figured I would keep trying it because Ambien no longer works for me. The side effects did not infact go away they are worse. I have been haveing very bad dreams offten about death and evil things. It's very strange. I also keep waking up all night about every hour and it takes everything I have to get out of bed as well as function in the daytime. Lastnight I woke up and could see red things flying all around the room. Im sure the medication works for some but for me....I will never take it again. I do not feel right about it and feel it is a bad drug for me. I am going to fight it and stay off everything for a couple months and get back on ambien. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	jmoody, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	5/25/2010 1:00:20 PM	Love this stuff.  I have had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep for 5 years. At one point I was down to 2 hours of sleep a night.  Ambien CR just made me depressed and still did not address the sleep issues.  My doctor gave me 3 weeks of Rozerum samples to start with.  I was advised that it would take about 3 weeks to see a difference.  Once the sample were finished I did start to notice a change in my sleeping and it improved dramatically over the 4th and 5th weeks.  That was about 3 months ago.  Now that I can occasionally skip a day or two and can still sleep my doctor advised me to start taking it as needed only. Now that my sleep cycle seems to be working correctly I am getting some of the best sleep of my adult life.  Drawbacks are that like others I seem to be having more vivid dreams.  and nightmares.  But not so bad that I'm reluctant to take the drug.  Besides if I have a bad dream and wake up - I've had no problems going back to sleep.  The real issue I seem to have started having in the last 5 days are increased bouts with sadness and some depression.  Not severe but troubling.  I just have to remind myself that it was a side effect from the medicine and not me.  I've been off it for 3 days and am seeing an improvement though.  I know this stuff seems to affect everyone differently, but it has sure worked wonders for me.  The negatives I experienced were FAR outweighed by the positives!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	sss1228, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	5/17/2010 3:11:12 PM	I have Fibromyalgia/chronic sleep issues.  I have been taking different sleep meds for 10 years.  Was asked by my doctor to try Rozerem.  It helps me sleep, but wake up very tired, lasts all day, makes my pain from Fibromyalia worse, dry mouth, bad taste in my mouth and now  after 10 days I itch.  I am not taking it again. Last night was my last.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	NiteGirl351, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/15/2010 6:30:28 PM	This medication saved my life, or at least my livelihood. I have DSPS and have suffered with it my whole life (I am now 25). Not only does this medication help me fall asleep but when I wake up I actually feel awake, and I can function on a &quot;normal&quot; amount of sleep (rather than my usual 10-12hours)! I would recommend this medication to anyone with a circadian rhythm disorder. It's not a knock you out pill so you don't feel groggy and the studies I have found support the statement that it is non addictive. I've never had to up my dose or had any negative side effects. My only caution would be to take the lowest does possible as, with any other drug, the more you take the more severe the side effects can be.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/7/2010 12:23:09 PM	the doctor prescribed this after i have had trouble sleeping for a few weeks. i could fall asleep ok, but would awaken middle of the night and be awake the rest of the night. Taking Rozerem did absolutely nothing. Waste of money. (but luckily i got samples). On to something else i guess!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	fayemonroe54, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	3/31/2010 7:02:27 PM	I have had insomnia for over 20 yrs. I ran out of Seroquel so my dr gave me this as a substitute. It caused me to throw up blood, was awake every 2 hrs, caused me to pass out and ended up with a concussion, blurred vision, stomache pain. I wouldnt recommend this to my worst enemy. Take this so-called medicine off the market before it kills someone.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Sleepy, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	3/30/2010 11:19:12 AM	Severe obstructive sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty falling asleep, occassional insomnia.  This medication has helped me to fall asleep easily.  Still occassionally awaken during the night. Not groggy when I get up, but an hour after I'm awake, and throughout the day I am very, very sleepy.  This may or may NOT be due to the drug, as I have had sleep problems most of my life.  Hope to start a new medication to help me stay alert during the day.  I can drink 3 - 4 cups of coffee and a Red Bull and still fall asleep!!!

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	bmusic, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/1/2010 4:37:13 PM	Excellent product!  Why does the insurance companies give such a hassle for pre op approval!? This medicine does not cause sleep walking like the others. Since I am a professional singer this medicine does not dry out my vocal cords. It does take awhile for your body to get use to since for many of us had years of sleeping problems. I use to sleepwalk and get up and eat. ( i don't have a weight problem.)But you get your sleep pattern down, you can stop taking it. You only take it when you are having problems sleeping again.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Rockhead, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	1/21/2010 9:59:56 AM	At first this drug did absolutely nothing.  After being told to stay the course by my doctor it is the best sleep aid on the market!!  It did take a while to work-a full three weeks-hence my lower satisfaction score but on day 21 I slept like a baby and have ever since!!!  Outstanding!!  Just stay the course!!

I wouldn't take this after reading these reviews. I have had chronic sleep problems since my 20's and I am now 55. I was all excited about this stuff too. What a bummer...........

So far, it has helped me get to sleep, but I've had very vivid dreams and nightmares. It hasn't helped me sleep enough so far to make up for the nightmares, but we'll see. I'm going to give it a few more days. One plus is that with my two young children, it allows me to wake up and take care of the little ones without trouble.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	BillW, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	19-24	11/27/2009 12:41:53 AM	I have had CHRONIC insomnia for many years. It became a HUGE problem during the slow onslaught on my body, by my body through a list of auto-immune diseases; Colitis, Arthritis andCrohns, etc. You get the point. I've tried everything that functions the same as everything else out numorous times, during numouos emotion states. These conditions have developed intense pain throughout my body, along with extreme anxiety and panic attacks.Pros: If I'd have to: Easy to swallow,Cons: Cost of course. Every time my insurance campany has to pay hundreds on a script It was almost always worth. Not this one. The first night I took one tablet, absolutely no effect. not even possible placebo. Next day I took 2 with no effects. Third day I took Three. Still, nothing that can even be confused with any drug induced effects, ie tiredness, somnolence. The fourth day I took 5, and felt slight tiredness that wore off quickly. Retrospect: Not worth a penny or Office Visit, Taking a few 5mg Melotonin sold over the counter; I can get 2x180 5mg melotonin for $12 at a local, yet widespead billion dollar company. Taking a handful(around 15 tablets) has the same effect as taking around the same amount Rozerem. This is one of those grey zones that they are attempting to brainwash people and insurance companies to make billions off it. It's place as the FIRST NON-SCHEDULED hypnotic puts as a first attempt line hypnotic to prevent benzodiazapam addiction or bad side effects from other drugs also used for trouble sleeping. Summary: A good benzodiazepam combined with 4-12100-300mg25mg Diphenhydramine will do for most, it did me for years. My diseases brought along intense anxiety, which Diphenhydramine intensified. I'm now on Clonazepam and Tamazepam butStill take 150mg, anxiety free. It's the most effective hypnotic when taken in dosage of 4-12(100-300mg) 25mg Diphenhydramine. The same store as the 5mg Melotonin so cheap carries 200/25mg Diphenhydramine for only $4 bucks.(wallmart)
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	11/14/2009 10:04:42 AM	This medication actually kept me awake all night. It then made me feel like I wanted to sleep at 8:00a.m. the next morning. It also gave me a slight headache. I marked &quot;ease of use&quot; as somewhat difficult because of the need to monitor the type of dinner you have every night you take it.

Nothing has ever helped me.  I have taken handfuls of prescription meds combined with over the counter and herbal every night to the point of overdose and still cannot sleep.  I am awake every night pacing the floor watching the sun rise.  There are times when I am awake for 3 days straight only to fall asleep for less than an hour and I am awake for days on end.  I hate my bedroom.  I hate when it's time to sleep because I never do.

So far I have been able to go back to sleep without much trouble.  In the morning I do feel groggy, have a dull headache and my legs feel weak.  Not sure if I will continue the medication.

So, although my doc suggested I try this med for 10 days, I'm going to ditch it...as it does not even come close to being as effective as just 25mg of Benadryl - which is 1000th the cost of Rozerum

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	5/19/2009 8:40:42 PM	While it doesn't put you to sleep, it does make falling asleep a lot easier. I haven't gotten the side effects from it, like I did taking Ambien, however without a good 8 1/2 hours of sleep, I am still groggy in the morning and sometimes throughout the day. It's a bit better than taking an OTC medication, but for the price, I'd rather take Excederin PM or Tylenol Simply Sleep and get a cold shower in the morning. 
Difficulty Falling Asleep	MTL, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	5/9/2009 10:07:53 PM	This medication is akin to taking a Benadryl at bedtime.  I only take it sporadically, so I may not be getting the full effect.  I guess if you are scared of the hard stuff (like Ambien), this may be a decent alternative. But considering its name-brand price, I'd recommend skipping it and getting some OTC Melatonin or antihistamine instead.

It did take a couple of weeks of consitent use to really get the effect and you may also experience rebound insomnia if you were taking another drug but try sticking with Rozerem for the 30 days before giving up.  Also as stated if I have a heavy meal close to bedtime or drink alcohol then it does not work well but this is explained in the drug advice and medication warnings.

For years before I would not get a full deep sleep.  I would get up in the middle of the night and move around the house without even knowing it.  My husband would have to tell me to get back into bed and go to sleep. With Rozerem I have been able to sleep all the way through the night and my husband has been able to get a good night sleep also.

For the last twodays I've had MISERABLE flu-like symptoms, such as dizziness, nausea, chills, stomach cramps.  This stuff is going down the drain.It's the WOST !!!

Woke up feeling horrible. I spent way too much money for something that doesn't work. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/3/2009 6:51:29 AM	This med really helps me fall asleep every night. I take it at the same time every night and I've managed to get on a sleep schedule for the first time in a long time because of it. I still wake up during the night, but I can fall back asleep a lot easier than I used to. The only side effect I've had with it is that my dreams are much more vivid and life-like than ever before. It's like my dreams have gone from black &amp; white to technicolor! This is not a medication that can be used once in while, it has to be used on a regular basis to be effective. I skipped a dose one night and couldn't sleep for 2 days! As long as I take it every night, I can sleep.

I am having terrible nightmares that wake me up and then I can't get back to sleep.  I am stopping today.  This is crazy to put someone thru this.  This drug should be taken off the market.

At first it seemed to work, but now I find myself not falling asleep and staying asleep.  In fact I believe it is the reason for my recent episodes of anxiety/panic attacks.

The Rozerem does get me into REM sleep (dream stage/deep sleep). However,  I wake up after every dream.  I do not feel well rested the next day.  I worked a 16 hour 3- 11 pm and 11- 7 am shift a couple of weeks ago and took a Rozerem to help me sleep during the day after work and it didn't help at all.

She didn't tell me this at first and when I went back saying it worked ok she explained it better.  For those that expect a miracle in one or two days this is not for you.  Trust me when I say it is worth the wait.  You need to go to bed in a quiet enviroment which is what your body needs anyway to get a good nights rest.  I still here my kids get up at night and get up to go to the bathroom when I need to.  This is not meant to knock you out, just help you sleep.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	wanderlust, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	12/14/2008 3:32:16 AM	This pill is very expensive and did not work for me. It took a very long time (over 3 hours) before I even felt sleepy. It helped me sleep 3-4 hours and I felt like sleeping all day the next day. Maybe the best way for me to take this pill is before I leave work in order for it to begin working hours later.

My physician gave me samples of this drug and the first few days I could not tell that anything was different. After a week or so, it started working great! It still works great, but I am getting samples from my doctor because I cannot afford to buy it. I hope she continues to have enough samples until it goes generic (long time). I take it 30 minutes before time to go to bed as directed. I go to sleep easily. I do wake up once a night to use the bathroom, but I go right back to sleep. I wake up refreshed. No side effects, no drowsiness during the day. I think it's great, I just can't afford it.

Seems like the medication is trying to work today instead of last night.  Wish I could take the medication back to the pharmacy and get a refund..IT DOES NOT WORK!My opinion is that it is just another way for the company to make more money.  Tylenot PM does much better and costs a lot less!!  DO NOT BUY THIS MEDICATION!  IT IS A WASTE!

The differnce is you must take this pill 1/2  to 1 hr prior to when you want to sleep, then make sure you are in bed laying down, tv off, etc.. for it to work. Then you must take this pill the same time each night so you &quot;teach&quot; your body  to go to sleep aat that time.  It is not meant for hospital atmosphere as it is stressfull there and always being woken up, etc... This was not explained to me by my doctor but it was explained by a specialist when I was in the hospital.

Only periods when I start having very difficult time getting to sleep and have restless sleeping. It is taking longer for me to fall asleep but after I take it, but I sleep completely through the night which never happens for me w/o the medication. I do have some AM grogginess.

Took a few days to get over the daytime drowsiness. Price is the only reason I won't continue this med. @ $3+ per pill, forget it. My HSA will go in the tank at that rate.

Eating any high-fat food during the evening can keep it from working and it does nothing to reduce anxiety. In general it's a pretty wimpy medication; for me 16 mg is equivalent to 5 mg of Ambien (and I weigh less than 150 lbs.). Now that I'm withdrawing from Seroquel I really need 16 mg a night but my insurance won't cover more than 30 8-mg tablets a month so I am  kind of hung out to dry; I can't get off the Seroquel entirely and/or have to use Ambien when I run out of Rozerem, and the insurance people will no doubt give me a hassle about paying for Ambien too. Takada really needs to make a 16 mg strength of Rozerem.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	KMI, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	9/11/2008 2:34:43 AM	I have had trouble falling asleep for about 3 years. I've tried absolutely everything on the market... Ambien, Lunesta. Trazodone, Halcion, supplemental Melotonin, and others to try to help my sleeping issues. The last sleep doc I went to said I need to try Rozerem. He said it might not work for me right away, and I had to come off my Ambien slowly (while taking the Rozerem). Apparently it's ok to take with all the other sleep meds, there's no contraindications. I took both Ambien and Rozerem for about 1 month (I was supposed to take less and less Ambien by shaving bigger and bigger pieces of the Ambien pill with a knife each week). At the end of the month, I was only taking the Rozerem once/night and was sleeping! My doc says it regulates my sleep cycle. All I know is that I fall asleep every night within 20 minutes and I have never felt so great in the morning!! I have been telling all my friends and family about this drug, and wish I could talk to any other insomniac to share my story! I know what it's like to not sleep for years, and this stuff works! I can see the other posts, and you have to take it with other sleep meds if you're currently on them, or it won't work. I'm a changed woman, and wish every other insomniac could have my experience! Sweet dreams :)

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Babygirlie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	8/22/2008 9:57:48 PM	I have been taking this medication for about a month now but I seem to get up after about 2hrs. I also notice that ever since I started this medication I see things and get nightmares. I took Ambien in the past but it was making me very tired I was sleeping for almost 12 hours a day and constantly exhausted. Now I will stop taking the medication because I feel that the side effects are making things worse for me. I will consult my doctor to see if maybe I can get another medication because its been every nite were its 5am and I am either watching TV or staring at the wall. But everyones side effects are different. Hope it works for you because it sure didn't work for me.

Bewteen that and my hubby's snoring I asked for help. Took ambien for a few months but Dr. said it was not approved for long term use. I simply need help to turn off my mind. Got this and it kept me awake. I could NOT sleep with it in my system...kept me up for the entire night. Now on Restoril and it seems to help, although once it wears off I'm up.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	grlygrl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/17/2008 1:10:49 AM	This is a drug to take if you're nervous about taking sleep aids. I'm taking it because I actually went to a sleep Dr and he explained insomnia can be a chronic problem and may require long-term treatment. Since Rozerem can be taken long-term (without dependency or tolerance issues) it's the safest choice. I've been taking it for a few months (it took a week or so to work for me) and I fall asleep within 10 minutes! You have to give it time and not expect to be sedated... it will feel like &quot;normal&quot; sleep.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping		4	4	4			7/17/2008 12:20:36 AM	i have been using ambien off and on for sleeplessness but always felt drowsy for several hours after waking up, with rozerem i fall asleep nicely and sleep is good, when i wake up its like i havent even taken a pill, this is a great drug for me.  
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	JaneGrey, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	7/1/2008 1:04:20 AM	Like others who have posted, it takes me hours to get to sleep and even when I do, I can't sleep for more than 1-2 hours at a time. I get the strangest dreams. I wake up groggy, disoriented, sometimes dizzy and even sleepier than before. I want to sleep all the time now. Earlier tonight I tried to get some rest and wound up having a full-fledged anxiety attack -- I was shaking, my heart was racing and I was drenched in sweat. I do take a number of psychiatric drugs, but not one is supposed to have any sort of major interaction with Rozerem. I'm not sure what to do. My doctor said to give it twelve days to full get my body clock back on schedule, but I'm not sure I can last that long. I already tried Trazadone for insomnia, so I'm afraid he might think I'm drug-seeking. I guess I'll just have to wait for my next appointment to discuss it with him.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	6/24/2008 4:10:10 AM	Day 7 of taking this drug.  it's 1AM and I'm still awake, 3 hours after taking it.  Dr. advised I would probably have very vivid dreams, but don't you have to actually fall asleep to have dreams?I'm going to discontinue taking this drug.  It does not work at all for me.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	hotmomma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	6/23/2008 11:38:50 PM	I have been on this medication for 2 months now and feel it is a better alternative to Ambien. However, it gets me to sleep just does not keep me that way. I find myself waking up several hours later. I loved how the Ambien knocked me out but feel this is safer long term. I will continue to use this because what sleep I do get is better than no sleep.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Kimmi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/11/2008 11:39:22 PM	After using Ambien on and off for the last 5 years, I recently became nervous of the addiction potential of the drug. My doctor told me I should try the new sleep aid Rozerem, he said I wouldn't become addicted. My doctor actually had me take the 2.5 mg Ambien for a one week overlap with the Rozerem. (Apparently it can take a while for the Rozerem to take full effect, like an antibiotic or an SSRI?) So I stopped the Ambien after one week and have been on just Rozerem for about 3 months. I have never felt this great!!! i used to wake up really groggy after taking Ambien (would drink coffee all day long) and now I wake up feeling good enough to hit the gym early in the morning. I have been telling everyone I know about this drug... hopefully it will change someone else's life like it did mine. Good luch to other insomniacs
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	linam24, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	6/11/2008 3:28:12 PM	ive mainly been having trouble falling asleep, but sometimes staying alseep as well. ive been taking rozerem for a little more than a week.the first night, the pill worked its best! i slept a dreamless sleep. but it made my arms numb so i kept waking up to shake them out.a week later, one pill no longer helps me fall asleep. i guess i built a tolerance VERY quickly. 2 - 8mg pills help me fall asleep now. i still wake up periodically but am able to fall asleep again quickly.i have no morning grogginess or nightmares.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	rockerme, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	55-64	6/7/2008 12:31:29 PM	Seemed to work very well.  Problem with me is that when I woke up 9 hours later, I felt very tired and dizzy. The next night that I took it was the same. CAUTION: My ankles swelled to the point that I had trouble putting shoes on. Called My pharmisist who told me that this drug was most likely the cause. Good Luck to all. This drug is not for me.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	HappilyAsleepAtLast, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	5/26/2008 10:14:30 PM	I hadn't had more than a few hours of sleep at a time before I started taking Rozerem.  The first night I took it I slept better than I ever have. Eight hours, straight through.  After almost a month of nightly use, I still fall alseep really easily, and mostly stay asleep all night.  I still wake up every once in awhile, but not multiple times every night like I used to.  The only weird side effect I've experienced is that some nights, I find myself sort of dreaming before I actually fall asleep.  Almost like I'm hallucinating when my eyes are closed.  It's a little bizarre, but well worth a full nights sleep.  I've experience no drowsiness or grogginess during the day.  I'd recommend it to those that have tried Ambien and didn't like the side affects.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Katyinnc, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	55-64	5/22/2008 7:28:26 PM	The Doc gave me a few samples and this drug worked well, when I got a script for it, my Health Insurance REFUSED to pay until I tired Ambien, which was a nightmare. Went back to Rozerem, I have to take it at 6PM for me to get to sleep by midnight, so I have no idea what is going on, then during the day I am so tired, I am going to finish out the script and then see the Doc again, I am tired of being tired.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	4/10/2008 3:37:28 PM	I take rozerem as I'm turning off the light. I usually am asleep within 15-20 mins. I find it helpful to count things or people; i.e. countries in Africa or states in US alphabetically. Counting blessings is good as is prayer. After I'm asleep I'm relatively dreamless until the morning, after 7:30 or so. I wake up for pit stops but go back to sleep pretty easily. I like it okay.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Steve28, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	4/4/2008 6:42:56 PM	First night was ok, second night, it was one of the most nights of my life.. (literally).  I slept for one hour and the rest was tossing and turning!  Not to mention i had to work a twelve hour shift after that night.. i was so tired i thought i was gonna die.  Im taking Ambien CR and it is wonderful and keeps me asleep for 7 to 8 hours.. The rozerem tablets i had left went down the drain.

Well, after 2 nights I'm stopping this drug. The nightmares are horrible, I ended up staying awake to avoid the nightmares! DUH. Lethargic and groggy next morning.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Dacker, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	3/26/2008 1:45:36 PM	I have not had a high-quality night's sleep in years, mostly due to waking in the middle of the night or very early.  I fall asleep very easily.  I've been taking Trazodone for about 6 months with pretty good results and hoped for more.I discontinued the Trazodone and have tried Rozerem for two nights.  The results have been terrible.  I have had very fitful sleep for the first few hours, followed by a couple decent hours, then I awake and stay awake for about 1.5 hours before falling into fitful sleep for a couple more hours.I have a call into my NP for advice, but I don't want to take Rozerem anymore.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Jody, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	35-44	3/15/2008 10:22:49 PM	I'm on my 4th night with this medication. First night, it did nothing. I was awake most of the night, it was awful. The second night, I fell asleep, took a few hours thou, and when I woke, I was groggy and tired and just wanted to stay in bed. I remember having many different dreams throughout the night and usually I don't even remember dreaming. Last night, didn't seem that great either. Slept a little, but nothing spectacular. But today, I've been exhausted and in bed almost until 3pm on and off. I have tried Ambien, Ambien CR - both those gave me awful nightmares. I was then put on Remeron, Celexa, Klonopin and Trazodone. Nothing has worked great. This is now my last resort. I will give it one month - if nothing is better then - I will see what else there is out there to try.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	smoothjerry, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	3/15/2008 7:23:10 PM	The first night I took rozerem I slept like I had been drugged. I was in and out of a drugged sleep into the next day I couldn't get out of the bed. I continued taking the medication on the advice of my physician. That week I was feeling very bad, tired, nausea, headaches, neck pain and very dizzy. After taking 9 tablets over 9 days my right eye turned red like broken blood vessels and became very sensitive to light and certain movements of the eye. I stopped taking rozerem. It has been 4 days now that I have stopped taking rozerem and I still feel very bad, tired, sick to my stomach, dizzy, headaches, and the worst thing is my eye. It is still very red and has extreme pain to light and movement. Now I have to see another physician for my eye. I wouldn't advise anyone to take rozerem.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	65-74	3/11/2008 11:18:46 AM	Have read all the reviews. Perhaps some people who are disappointed are expecting it to work like other sleep meds? It is MADE to help people FALL ASLEEP...not continue to sleep through the night. It is also melatonin based...which for me, produces some anxiety and nightmares at times. And vivid dreams. I am still experimenting with it....only take it off and on but my MD told me you have to continue to use it so your body gets used to the change in circadian rhythims....I will continue to use it as long as I can....I wake up several times but do ge tback to sleep. Have found some tiredness during the day though.....

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	35-44	3/6/2008 2:56:52 PM	I have had trouble sleeping for years, and for the past year and a half I have been taking Ambien CR with great results, except for the fact that I go through a months supply in a little more than 3 weeks or so.  My doctor gave me a sample of Rozorem and I tried it for the first time last night.  While I didn't get nearly as good a sleep as I did with Ambien, and I woke up three or four times through the night, I did sleep about 6 1/2 hours during and 8 hour stretch, which is way better than I did with Melatonin or anything else over the counter.  I wouldn't recommend it to someone who has hard core insomnia such as myself to take on a regular basis, but I will be using it again for tonight and the next time I run out of CR.

I was so dizzy that I vomited and could not stand up until about 3pm.  I will never use this drug again.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	nightowl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	2/19/2008 2:45:58 AM	I didn't stay asleep on Rozerem and had to take ambien with it, so what was the point? After awhile, I began having vivid, disturbing dreams. I would wake up screaming, with my heart pounding. I was agitated during the daytime. This drug was horrible to take, and expensive, too. Now, I use a small dose of ativan when I need something. I can stay asleep for 6-8 hours and function during the day.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	halfadime7, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	2/18/2008 7:52:59 PM	Couldn't get to sleep, then would wake up 3 to 4 times every night.  Took the Rozerem, but it gave me a hang over that made me sleepy at work for several hours.  Tried to take it earlier in the evening, but still had the hangover.  Stopped taking it all together.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	2/14/2008 12:51:55 AM	I started itching within 15 minutes of taking Rozerem and itched for the next 16 hours.  fell asleep quickly but had very vivid dreams all night long, waking with a start every hour or so but went back to sleep quickly as I was so tired.  I woke to my alarm 9 hours after taking it and was so  exhausted I slept another hour.  Was exhausted all day.  NOT good sleep at all......I wake more rested when I only get 4-5 hours of sleep, and I slept 10 hours before I pulled myself out of bed.  Because of the dreams I never got into a deep, restful sleep.  Due to itching I was advised it would be dangerous to take another dose.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	bullockdawna, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	2/8/2008 3:50:04 PM	I have been on sleep medication for over 15 years, I've tried everything on the market it seems.  Rozerem was a wonder drug at first.  I fell asleep fast (within 30 minutes) and for me the best part was &quot;no dreams&quot;.  They say dreams are great, but they aren't when that is all that you do while you are alseep and then wake up feeling like you have spent the entire night watching a movie.  With Rozerem I was able to get to sleep, stay asleep and no dreams (at least not ones I remember).  The problem with this Rozerem is I would get real tired around 2:00 in the after noon and by 5:00 it was all I could do to drive home and not fall asleep while driving.  Guess it's bad to the drawing board.  I was taking the losest dose, if you are a person who can't sleep or you dreams all night, try Rozerem, at least get a sample from the Dr. You may not have the late day sleepiness I had.

I have had diabetes for over 35 years now (Type 1). I have great difficulty in falling asleep - I believe due to stress in my personal and professional life (bills, economy stinks, etc).

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1		45-54	1/23/2008 1:35:10 PM	I took Rozarem 3 nights in a row and could not get to sleep. It just doesn't work. My doctor encouraged me to try it a second time and the results were exactly the same. My sense is that my doctor cares more about his drug rep than about his patients. At least he gave me free samples this time.

If I did begin to drift, I would be jolted awake with frightening images or imagined sounds. I have been awake for almost three days. All I have to show for this medication is a splitting headache.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	hooty, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	35-44	1/22/2008 2:10:08 PM	Rozerem worked for me the first few times helping me fall asleep. I had very vivid dreams, not nightmares, but wierd. I also woke several times throughout the night but could fall back to sleep. Two nights ago I woke up after 3 hours and couldn't go back to sleep. Last night it actually made me stay awake like I drank a cup of coffee. I took 2 benadryl and fell asleep. I will not take Rozerem again. This is the fourth drug I've tried for sleep and I'm tired of being a guinnea pig. There has to be something that works.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Kelleymarie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	1/5/2008 12:17:00 AM	I have been on Lunesta for slightly over 2 years.  I developed a bad side effect from the medication so asked to go on a different sleeping medication.  My dr gave me samples of Rozerem.  The first night it took me at least 2 hours to fall asleep.  Then, ever hour or so I'd jolt awake from the most terrifying dreams I've ever experienced and was unable to fall back to sleep for at least an hour.  I'd wake up with my heart racing, gasping for air, and sweaty.  I'd wake up feeling like my head was in a cloud and was disconnected all day.  This went on for seven nights (I wanted to give the med a fair chance).  I finally had to stop.  I'm better off with insomnia... those dreams were horrible.

The first 2 days were not great but i'm sleeping better and better everynight. But, I also take 50mg of Elavil nightly. Ask your doctor for samples to try for two weeks. And, I don't for the violent dreams like other meds.

I was so relaxed and fell asleep quickly and slept a long time! However, I woke up with a bad headache, but feel as if its a small price to pay for the nice sleep I had. Try it! Although I know it hasn't helped everyone who tried it, it seems to be different for everyone, and it helped me!

My doctor has put me on Rozerem 8mg for the past week.  Unfortunately, I'm not getting the uninterrupted sleep I was hoping for.  Could you tell me if you make a stonger version of Rozerem?
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	compozr, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/25/2007 2:20:47 AM	This has really helped me get to sleep much faster.  It doesn't really help keep me asleep through the night, but I don't normally have trouble getting back to sleep in the middle of the night...just trying to fall asleep initially.  It also doesn't leave me feeling groggy in the morning.

I asked if I could try something else and was given samples of Rozerem. The first night I took this, I went to bed, and didn't fall asleep for at least an hour. I woke up an hour after that from a really vivid nightmare, and I had to wake myself up fully to recover from it. I went back to bed about 45 minutes later, tossed and turned for a couple more hours and when I fell back asleep, more nightmares. When I finally woke the next day, I was groggy, out of it, and the coffee wasn't helping so much. I didn't like the foggy feeling, I didn't like that it didn't really help me sleep and I really didn't like the fact that I've had some of the worst and most vivid and frightening nightmares on this drug. I can't take it again.

It stops my Anxiety so I can actually get some sleep.  It helps me a lot, since my Anxiety prevents me from sleeping.  Generally when I wake up, I'm stuck in a groggy state until I have eaten.

I am still trying to get over the effects of this drug that I took 20 hours ago. It didn't help me sleep at all.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Sunny from LI, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	11/5/2007 6:58:14 PM	This drug was my worst nightmare!  My insomnia was better before I took this drug.  It left me so exhausted and to my knowledge I did not sleep at all.  I would not touch it after one night.  I cannot describe how unbearable this one night was!  Awful Product.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Sherry,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		11/1/2007 3:40:57 AM	BEWARE!! I am also being treated for benign essential tremors and Parkinsonism-I have tremors in my right hand &amp; arm.  After the 2nd night, I awoke with my tremors worsened. After the third night, I had no contol whatsoever over my arm-the tremors were as bad as at their very worst. I am presently taking Requip for my tremors and it has been working very well for me. Thank God my doctor believes in samples!  I hate to think what I could have paid for this experience!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	10/31/2007 8:41:21 PM	My Dr. told me it would take using it 4x before it became fully effective which it took 3x for me.  It helps me fall asleep and if I wake up I easily fall back to sleep.  I am able to get up easily in the morning but it seems to make me feel tired through out the day.  I was using time release melantonin 300mg previously and I think I'll go back to it b/c it helped me sleep w/o feeling tired during the day.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/28/2007 8:32:22 PM	The first time I took Rozerum, I almost never took it again.  I don't know if it was me or the medicine, but I think I woke up every hour on the hour.  I fell back asleep quickly, but I still woke up.  My doctor told me to try it for a few more days, so I did -- and I am very glad.  It is funny that the commercials for Rozerum have that guy having bizarre dreams, because the only side effect I noted having was very detailed, very memorable, very bizarre dreams.  Not, by any means, nightmares.  Just really random stuff with a lot of detail.  I'd tried Ambien and Ambien CR with mixed results (they made me sleep for like 10 hours at a time).  Lunesta was a nightmare - literally.  I had one of those &quot;rare but serious side effects&quot; in the form of unmitigated rage.If I had to pick one downside of rozerume, it is that it lets me sleep when I decide I want to sleep.  If I want to sleep at 10:00 pm, this is a good thing.  But I was so tired for so long (and so used to napping whenever I could possibly fall asleep for a few moments), that I let myself fall into the trap of sleeping too much and feeling sluggish.  Once I realized that error, it was great.    
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	10/28/2007 1:24:51 PM	After taking Rozerem only one night and staying awake most of the night, that is the last time I will try it.  I felt wired until absolute exhaustion took over and I got about 4 hours of sleep.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/28/2007 12:29:15 AM	I should have taken the pill in the morning up so I COULD sleep at night, BUT instead I took it at bedtime and was I up all night and sleepy all day! This med made my insomnia WORSE!! Too expensive and does little to nothing!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	sb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	10/25/2007 7:13:14 PM	I tend to get sleepy about 10:00p.m. and sleep better, if I wake up, I can go back to sleep.  I usually get about 8 hours sleep.  
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	J, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	10/24/2007 6:55:33 PM	This drug is the worst. I had much better luck with melatonin (and even better with ambien). Not only did rozerem give me hot sweats and extreme nightmares/paranoia, it sent me into a massive panic attack. After two nights of no sleep whatsoever, I wouldn't take this again if you paid me.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Joanee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	10/21/2007 3:58:53 PM	It started working after about 4 weeks - but I have to be ready to go to sleep during it's window of opportunity...which for me is about 2 hours after I take it.  I also stay asleep - and if I wake up - I don't stay up.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	10/18/2007 3:55:46 AM	One night,one pill and I knew Rozerem was not the right drug (sleep aid) for me.  It DID NOT WORK at all.  I felt only slightly drowzy and could not get to sleep.  I believe that I had an adverse reaction to this drug.  I became very restless and could not lie or sit still.  I felt &quot;jumpy&quot; or &quot;twichy&quot; for hours.  These symptoms (feelings) lasted for at least 6 hours.  I had to take a medication (clonazepam or Klonopin) to counteract the adverse effects.  I believe that I eventually fell asleep from exhaustion, not from the medication.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	klgpoet, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/12/2007 4:50:41 PM	I was on an old anti-depressent called Remeron for 10 years. I have been an insomniac to some degree since adolescense. This became hieghtened to a degree after several traumatic experiences one at 19 and one at 30 years of age to the point I was not sleeping unmedicated for 7 to 10 days straight and having psychotic breaks occasionally. The Remeron caused major weight gain. Went fro 130 lbs to 180 top weight and no diet/exercise regime changed that. I was given Ambien and Lunesta and neither worked at all. In fact the Ambien increased Mania for me as I am Bipolar. When Rozerem came on the market I was switched at my request and have lost 20 lbs already. I sleep less than I did on the Remeron, from 6.5 hours to about 5 hours and dream a lot. BUT, this is still a better choice for my insomnia. I feel less druggy during the day like I did on Remeron. I am not missing sleep at all for even one day and I am losing weight easily with a healthy diet and good exercise schedule. So I am very happy. Also there is no risk for me of sleep eating which became an issue big time on the older medication. Rozerem also feels more natural and less sedative.

I am very irritable and unmotivated. Has anyone else had these effects. After reading the other comment that is very similar to mine, I'm going to tell my doctor I'm need to stop taking it. I fall alseep fast, but feel like I'm awake through all my dreaming. Weird!

My Dr. says it works differently than other sleep aids. I am wiating for it to help. I have a C-flex machine, and it does not help me stay asleep either.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	psycholovedeath, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	13-18	10/1/2007 12:47:02 PM	i have had trouble falling asleep before 5 am. since march. my dr. did nothing but put me on anti-depressants the first visit, which absolutly no one should be put on because it really messes with your entire body in a very bad way. but he   ut me on rozerem and it is doing nothing what-so-ever! ive been on it for almost 3 weeks and i found if i miss a dose i sleep better. this drug does not work, and quite honestly there is a drug OTC that is like $7 it is melatonin with velarian root and other herbs that does work better, so if you are looking for a cheaper (more effective) drug that is like rozerem then try Melanite...yu can get it at most healthfood stores or possibly GNC.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		10/1/2007 1:02:51 AM	Was like I had taken nothing,even with a double dose.The only thing I noticed was a weight gain.Don't tell me it wasn't caused by this drug because until using it I remained the same weight for over 10 yrs.After 3 mo. of usage my sleep is still horrid but I've gained nearly 15 lbs! After stopping it, I've lost the weight.I'm a tiny woman anyway so there's no way I'll believe this gain wasn't a side affect. My dr. concurs.They should list that as a side affect!I wouldn't have minded if it had helped me sleep!The commercials are very misleading,IMO.I also tried Lunesta,tho it really helped me sleep,the awful metallic taste it left was worse than not getting sleep.This IS listed as a side affect for Lunesta.I'm glad I read the comment here on Rozerem because I was beginning to think I hadn't tried it long enough.....but I think after 100 days it was simply a major ate of $.They should offer a refund. ;-)
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	stayathomedadinIA, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	9/29/2007 10:12:00 AM	My difficulty lies NOT with initially falling asleep, but with getting back to sleep after awaking in the middle of the night to tend to kids, or needing to use the bathroom. Falling back to sleep will often take 3 to 4 hours. This problem has gradually developed in the last few years, when my wife and I started having kids. I am only on night 5 of this med, but it appears that I am having more difficulties with the med than without it. Night one was a normal night, I slept fairly well. However the next day I could not stay awake. I expected to take a 15 minute nap, 2 hours later I was fighting to wake up. Night 2 was aweful. The initial fall asleep time was 6 hours. That day I forced myself to not nap. Night 3 was OK, but I woke up an hour early. I had no problem staying awake the following day. Night 4 I woke up 3 times. The last time I could not get back to sleep and just layed in bed for hours. Once again I could hardly keep myself awake the next day. Night 5 I got to sleep OK, woke up at 4 am to pee. I'm not at all sure I ever got back to sleep. Got up at 7. Its now 9 and I am just plain tired.Without this drug I will have bad nights 1 to 3 times a week. It has been less than a week and so far I have had 3 bad nights. I will give it a couple more days before going back to my doctor, but I am not at all confident that this drug is helping...it actually appears to be hurting.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	jenniferlee,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female		9/26/2007 10:36:08 AM	Very upset with results.  Did not help me fall asleep.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	9/24/2007 10:14:47 PM	I could not tell I had taken anything to help me sleep.  I was very disappointed.  Due to some health problems, it is critical that I get a good night's sleep.  I am already feeling the results after only 4-5 days of not getting the correct type of sleep, or sleep at all.

Caused me to be restless, made my legs ache, very difficult for me to fall asleep, I was sleeping better before I had started taking the med.  First night I took it, I slept like a baby, however, as I continued taking it I had found myself not being able to go to sleep and not even being able to stay asleep.  Quite dissapointed with the results.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping		1	4	1			9/26/2007 10:43:22 AM	No help falling asleep OR staying asleep.
