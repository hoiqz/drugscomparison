Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with Trauma-related Nightmares	Mandy Cake, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	45-54	8/4/2012 5:06:54 PM	I told my Psych that I would try Mini Press as he stated it would help with my Severe PTSD, nightmares/daymares/flashbacks.  I find I sleep 2 hours more however, instead of reducing my nightmares/daymares/flashbacks it has increased them.  The vertigo is horrible and lasts all day long so I can not function.  Trying to swollow the caps is hard for me as well.  Over all, Not a fan of this drug and am weening myself off from it.

Upon continuing the prescribed dose, the nightmares were gone.  The drug works amazing for combat PTSD related nightmares.  My quality of life has been dramatically increased as a direct result.

I take 2 mg before bed. I did experience some dizziness at higher dose, but have had no problems since dose has been adjusted. I find that I am able to wake up easily for my children during the night if needed (I also prescribed up to 9mg of melatonin for sleep). Panic attacks have been greatly reduced, although I do still have some anxiety through out the day.

I am happy with it, a little after taking it I do feel a little dizzy but it goes away after about 30 minutes. The only thing I guess that would be on the bad side is that it makes me sleep like a rock. It takes alot to get me up.

I am on a very low dose of 2mg twice a day. I used to move around at night,swing and kick violently at night. Lets say my wife didn't like it! Drug effect: stopped those symptom by 95% I also had vivid horrible dreams which this drug reduced 70%. No side affects....I recommend starting at very low dose first. In conjunction I take Valium 5mg three times a day PRN when I am in public. Minipress also decreased my need for Valium by 20%.  I am a retired paramedic and had never heard of this drug until a social worker recommended for me to look into it. It's a go for me.........and I have been on every medicine known to man until I was told of this. I recommend it!
