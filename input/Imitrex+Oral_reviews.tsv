Migraine Headache	VintageButterfly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/3/2012 11:35:57 AM	For chronic migraine. 50mg then if needed, 50mg more an hour later. Works pretty good, took my pain from an 8 to a 1 1/2 - 2. The only thing I do no like about it, is it gives me a tightening sensation in my neck and lower head for a bout an hour.

Migraine Headache	migrainerelief, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/3/2012 3:46:32 PM	I have been a migraine sufferer for over 30yrs now and since the last 10 years I have been using imitrex brand only,  it has worked wonders for me, I did have to increase from 25 mg  to 50 mg, but within 1/2 hr to 45 minutes I am a new person, no naseau or voimiting. But now my insurance doesnt cover brand imitrex and only covers generic imitrex, but I am not able to take the generic imitrex it gives me chest pain.  So now I dont know what I am going to take since it cost $276 for 9 pills. I love my Brand Imitrex...hopefully something else will be available....
Migraine Headache	 (Patient) 	4	5	4			6/30/2012 11:57:27 AM	My migraines are now in the form of what I call &quot;walking&quot; migraines, like walking pneumonia.  They're bad but without the nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.  Imitrex helps but I've become tolerant and need 100mg. 2x/day.  My doctor says I have to be weaned off it.  I may try acupuncture.  Nobody who doesn't get these kinds of headaches can possibly understand what we go through.  I'm 64 and have been getting migraines for 40 years.  
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	4/23/2012 7:32:32 PM	Was taking Zomig which worked great. Insurance only pays for imitrex now. It might hold back a migraine for about 5 hours then the next 12 hours I rest my head on ice. A useless medicine if you have had better medicine
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/10/2012 3:33:56 PM	I have been on Imitrex for a very long time. I have had migraines since I was about 12 and I am 34 now. The Imitrex has finally stopped working on my migraines but it has done a wonderful job for a a very long time.
Migraine Headache	Ramona , 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	4/9/2012 6:41:50 PM	I have suffered migraines since the age of 10. I was unable to get any relief until I was prescribed this medication. That didn't happen until I was almost 40 years old. It has been a life saver!
Migraine Headache	25-34 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	3/28/2012 3:03:02 AM	The only side effect that I have is tightness in my head. It relieves the pressure but my face feel real tight for about 40 minutes. Overall, it gets the job done.
Migraine Headache	alijuvette, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	3/23/2012 1:26:18 PM	I have had migraines for about 7 years now. They prescribed imitrex to me almost 4 years ago. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't which isn't the issue i have with it. The problem that I'm experiencing is that the side affects are maybe just a bad a the migraine itself. Every time i take it. I feel like my heads on fire. Like I'm being burned alive. As soon as i take it I try to go to sleep asap to not experience the side affect. I wake up super dehydrated from sweating and incredibly weak. I wish they had something that I could take and be able to function still. The doctor recently prescribed verapamil to me and it has worked wonders. I went from having 15+ migraines a month to 4 migraines a month. So for people with this problem I suggest you ditch the imitrex and ask for verapmil.

Also leaves you with lightheadedness nausea and reduced appetite.and the migraine never went away.

Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/21/2012 2:35:08 PM	Imitrex is fantastic ! I take the generic. I was on Midrin for years, but recently they stopped making it. And, as well as Midrin worked, it only worked when you felt a migraine coming on. It did nothing when you woke up w/ a migraine. But Imitrex does. Within 20-30 mins., head pain is gone. The only side effect is that my neck &amp; jaw feel &quot;clenchy&quot;, but it's very mild and subtle, and goes away within the 1st hour. Then, I'm headache free. I love this stuff ! I'm sorry to read some of the comments for whom Imitrex hasn't worked.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	11/29/2011 3:06:24 PM	The side effects (nausea, dizziness, stiff neck, and jaw pain) were easily as irritating as the migraine.  I was honestly unnerved by the severity of the side effects.  Worse, my headache was back after the pill wore off. I realize not everyone has this reaction, but a this was my first experience, will definitely look for a different solution.
Migraine Headache	ashleyhi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/28/2011 9:43:32 PM	Helped reduce the severity of my migraine the very first time i took it. The second time I took two pills 3 hours apart from each other. not only did it not provide relief it made me nauseous. These pills are very expensive, due to insurance i was only dispensed 9 pills at a time and they weren't effective.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	11/17/2011 5:20:48 PM	I too have had those nasty migraines and cluster headaches.  Finally I found a drug that worked BUT the day after I take Imitrex my pain is back.  Rebound headaches.  So I take another pill.  I can't live without the pill though.  These headaches are expensive. 
Migraine Headache	sallyq, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	11/13/2011 4:27:05 PM	I have used Imitrex successfully for nearly 20 years. It is very expensive. I get the 100mg tabs and use a pill cutter to cut them into 4-peices (25 mg each). I take one small piece at the EARLIEST sign of a headache and I can frequently abort the headache before the pain gets severe. Although it is hard to take the expensive tablet early enough, by cutting it into 4 pieces it costs much less and you are more likely to take it early. Directions tell you to swallow the tablet whole but it works just as well in pieces.

Migraine Headache	Headache Chip, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	55-64	10/3/2011 12:47:48 PM	I have suffered from migranes off and on for over 20 years now.  I take the 100mg imitrex tablets when I feel the first symptoms of a migrane coming on.  This is usually in the middle of the night.  I have tried so many medications and combinations and lately the imitrex has stopped curing my headaches completely.  My last headache, I took an imitrex and after waiting a couple of hours I went to take another imitrex and I found that I had taken the last one.  Feeling the headache coming back, I reached for an amerge and took it figuring &quot;What's the difference&quot;.  Within minutes, the headache was completely gone.  I feel this is potentially dangerous but I have done this again and it worked equally as well.  The only side effect I had was stomach soreness the next day. For some reason I have started having nightly migranes and I have tried to use ice packs and different medications so I don't get stuck on one kind but I made this discovery and I should talk to my doctor about it before it gets out of hand.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/1/2011 2:36:02 AM	I loved this product at first. With only one side effect (nausea), it seemed to be the &quot;miracle cure.&quot; Now, not so much. I've been taking it for a little over a year, and had to begin taking 2 at once to obtain relief. Now, not even 2 tablets work. It's a great short-term solution, but now I'm going to have to find something else.
Migraine Headache	Dorothy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	65-74	9/29/2011 2:55:25 PM	Imitrex is like a small miracle in taking away my migraine.  But in the last six months or so I have experienced not being able to retrieve common words. Noticed that at least two other people have like experiences so will definitely bring this to the attention of my doctor.  It was so comforting to know that others had this same experience.
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	9/25/2011 7:48:53 AM	I've suffered migraine headaches since I was 17, with all the symptoms: light and noise  sensitivity, nausea and vomiting, aura in the eyes.  I finally went to the doctor when the headaches were effecting my job to the point that I could not work.  He prescribed Imitrex at 50 mg. strength.  It has been a life saver.  I have suffered some of the side effects (tightness in the throat, swelling of the hands) but I will take those side effects any day as long as I can do my job. 
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	9/16/2011 8:39:54 PM	Since Imitrex came out and was dispensed in shot form, I have been prescribed this medication. Over the years many other new migraine products have come on the scene. I have tried them all, at least 6 times or more each. I always end up going back to Imitrex. I was on a long run with Relpax for a while until it just stopped working for me. Although Imitrex still does not stop about 1/3 of my migraine headaches, I still have not found anything out there to be any better. I am a staunch supporter. Do I like the side effects of basically feeling like I was in a car accident where every muscle in my body hurts afterwards? No. Do I choose that over migraine? Every day of the week. 
Migraine Headache	uscmeg, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	9/15/2011 8:22:07 PM	I have suffered from migraines since I was 12 and finally decided to get a prescription strength medication for them. I felt a migraine coming on today and tried my 50mg Imitrex (generic) for the first time. After 20-30 minutes I felt a paralysing, burning pain tingle up my spinal cord and explode at the base of my neck. Not only could I not move my jaw or feel my teeth, it felt like (and still does over 4 hours later) my skull, neck, shoulders, and chest were all on fire. My headache was immediately exponentially worse and the nausea followed quickly. My throat was incredibly dry and painful to talk once I could get my jaw open again. My ears feel like they're full of water and pressure. My whole neck and back, still very painful but less on fire, is stiff. My arms and hands had started tingling too and that has mostly worn off but even typing this is extremely hard for my motor skills; I feel frozen. My lips and face swelled up with the tingling and are slowly retreating after I took a dose of benadryl recommended by my doctor. I am an extremely healthy and fit college student and have NEVER had a reaction to any sort of medication until today. Needless to say, I threw out my whole bottle and my doctor is making me come in tomorrow so he can do bloodwork and scans to make sure nothing was permanently affected by this reaction. I have never been so scared in my life. I would not recommend this drug to a single person.
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/23/2011 10:56:10 AM	If I fell a migraine coming, I take a pill. I never leave home without one in my purse, just in case. Wonderful pill.
Migraine Headache	Alexandra , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	9/13/2011 2:57:03 PM	I took Imitrex for 1 to 1.5 years but then I started having memory loss.  Everyday thing and people I work with noticed before I did.  I was forgeting how to do my job. I was taken off of the Imitrex and can back to normal.
Migraine Headache	poptarts223, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	9/9/2011 9:44:48 PM	This drug was promised to me that it would relieve my migraines as long as I took them at the first sign of one. I took my first dose as instructed... didn't do a SINGLE THING to relieve symptoms, if anything it intensified my nausea and sensitivity to sound. At one point I thought I was going to vomit out my very soul!! TERRIBLE experience and I WOULD NOT reccommend this to ANYONE!!

Ask your doctor for &quot;Sumavel Dose Pro&quot; (along as you have been using Imitrex prior safely) and even for samples/ discount card/ &amp; leather carrying case! Works for cluster and migraine headaches within 5 minutes, no needles! Unbelievable.
Migraine Headache	motor, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	8/19/2011 2:12:55 PM	I have suffered migraines since I was 4 years old. I get 2 to 4 a week and have had them last as long as 38 days. The tablets dont seem to work for me as well as the injections do. I use the injections as often as I can according to my Dr. recomendations. The intitial affect is somewhat uncomfortable as it makes me body from mid torso up feel as though is is consticting severly. That said, the effect is short lived and after 20 minutes or so it passes and within 45 minutes to an hour I have no head ache. It works 80 to 90% of the time and I have never found anything that comes close, and in 40 years I have tried it all. The only thing is that now at the age of 44 years My Dr. said that he will no linger recomend it as it cn have effects on the heart in folks my age and older. So the only effective med for my headaches is no longer available to me due to age. THAT sucks!

I used it over an 18 month period for hormonally induced migraines which occurred before and after my period and at the time of ovulation.  The drug does as it is advertised.  It relieves the pain.  No one tells you what happens with long term use.  I developed symptoms that were entirely consistent with early onset Alzheimer's Disease - loss of memory and organizational skills, inability to read and write, etc. After extensive neurological tests I received a formal diagnosis from my doctors.  My doctor took me off the Imitrex and after 10 years many of my abilities have returned though my memory is still an issue of concern.  We notified Glaxo and the FDA without any response.  Please be very careful using this powerful medication.  Though Imitrex will relief the pain of a migraine, the longterm impact of this drug on the brain is profound and harmful.
Migraine Headache	rhi, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	19-24	7/12/2011 3:13:11 PM	I have had migraines since I was 12, and they range from completely unbearable with vomiting to very painful with no vomitin. I take sumatriptan 100mg as needed and for the past couple of years it worked good. Depending on the severity of the migraine &amp; at what point I took it, I could feel relief anywhere from 15 min to 2 hours. It always gave me a stiff neck &amp; tight chest but it was bearable. Lately though, within the past 6 months whenever I take one it actually makes the pain worse! My body hurts, my head &amp; neck are tight, I get chills &amp; cold sweats, and the headache never gets any better. I'm going to see about trying something new. Everyone is different. It is also expensive &amp; i can only get nine pills at a time &amp; lately i dont feel that this medication is worth it. What works for me may not work for you. If you experience these migraines like I do its definitely worth trying different medications to see what is best for you.

Migraine Headache	Jennifer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	6/27/2011 3:27:39 PM	I've taken Imitrex for approximately 5 years. It worked great at first with no side effects. Within the last 2 years, it will get rid of the migraine, but I feel like I have been physically beaten and my throat is sore, like I have been choked. Since it does get rid of the migraines, I put up with the side effects.

I have taken just about every drug on the market for migraines.  This is the only drug that gives me relief.  It may take 2 days in a row of taking the medication, but it has been a life saver for me.  I do take the 100 mg tablets.  I never exceed 2 pills in a day.  Most of the time one pill will give me relief.  However, the medication can make you tired and should really be taken when you can lie down for at least an hour.
Migraine Headache	stepharpatleo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	35-44	6/12/2011 10:06:33 PM	it's either a miracle drug or your worst nightmare - the injections worked well for me but when I was switched to the tablets for insurance purposes and, later, for patient assistance programs, I ran into huge problems - sometimes it took most of my migraine pain away but never all of it - I always experienced serious side effects, the kind that the label says &quot;seek medical attention, stop taking medication,&quot; and I never did either - this past week, though, I had 4 migraines spanning 5 days and after the third day, I felt like I'd been run over by a mack truck, thrown down a flight of stairs, and hit with a bag of nickels - it has taken more than 4 days to recover and I'm still not feeling quite right - I will never take Imitrix again - unfortunately, having had migraines for 37 years, I've tried almost every medication in every category and have never found anything that really works ... and has no or few side effects - having a migraine is bad enough but dealing with scary side effects is just not okay by me anymore

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	5/30/2011 11:06:11 PM	When I was working and going to school fulltime, I didn't have time to sleep off my migraine and had one that lasted three days.  I finally broke down and went to the doctor, and he gave me Imitrex.  Let me tell you, it knocked the migraine right out, but it knocked me out, too!  About four hours after I took it, I woke up, and the room was SPINNING like I'd gone out on a bender.  Be sure you have enough time to rest when you take Imitrex, because it will likely make you useless for a while!
Migraine Headache	purpledot, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/27/2011 11:42:22 PM	As a fifteen year migraine sufferer and many a weekend ruined, my dear friends said &quot;go to the doctor!&quot;  I finally met a physician who took migraines very seriously and listened carefully to my history.  He prescribed imitrex with weekly follow-up appointments and he taught me how to manage my headaches with this amazing drug.  It works and with his assistance, I learned the difference in dosage for me, the difference in taking the drug immediately at the beginning of a migraine and when to &quot;double dose.&quot;  It changed my life and, with annual physical exams, I keep the migraines controlled.  I agree with many of the respondents that this is a miracle drug for many migraine sufferers.  I am sorry for those that it has not been as effective.  Change your dosage, try another migraine medicine - but do not give up.  This is not aspirin.  Work with a doctor who cares about migraines and believes in drug management for this disease.  It is well worth the effort.  Take care everyone.

I wasn't sure if the 2 were related so the next time I had a migraine I took it again and while taking a shower I felt as though my skin was severely sunburned and my forehead was on fire. Weirdest feeling I have ever has and felt completely out of sorts. Considering I get auras with my migraines the whole goal for me is to not feel so disoriented so this was not good. I felt like I was going a little crazy. Will take in a emergency if I am out of my new script of Relpax. 
Migraine Headache	satisfied, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4		55-64	12/29/2010 12:35:12 AM	I try to take a minimum, 25mg pill if I catch the migraine early enough..otherwise, 50mg.  I take CoQ10 am &amp; pm and think it prevents palpatations, tightness - sometimes an extra if I have to take a second dose two hours later.  I don't think I could tolerate a 100mg all at one time dose.  The feeling of lethargy, being tired, etc I view as side effects of the migraine, not of the Imitrex.... 
Migraine Headache	LindaM, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	12/27/2010 9:35:33 PM	I was a long time Imitrex user.  I started using it when you could only get it in injection for.  I don't remember the dosage but I never took more that 3 pills total over a certain time frame.  With long term useage of it, monthly for years, I found my headache went away but felt worse from joint pain and tingling in my fingertips to feeling exhausted for a least a day after my last dose.  Finally moved on to other treatment options.

Other	TLCBUG, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/28/2010 9:42:53 PM	I suffered from Facial Pain caused by a deviated septum. The ENT and Neurologist made a point to try all NON-Surgical treatments first. I have previously suffered from migraines before and during taking a high estrogen birth control pill. The typical migraine I had went away when switched to Low Estrogen Pill. Now I am taking Imitrex to control the facial pain. Things I like. Its easy to take. Usually one does it. Things I don't like. The &quot;high&quot; feeling. I got REALLY sleepy and somewhat dizzy. I even found myself stammering my words. I also had aching jaw and neck. With periodic intense throbbing in my cheeks (where my Facial Pain is), neck and jaw, it last like maybe 7 seconds and then goes away to the aches. After the medication wears off...I feel fine. So I have chosen to use it VERY carefully! It is better than having to take 10 Aleive in a week. I can save it for the bad days and it gives me days of relief. I found that taking an Aleive with it kinda helps with the jaw, neck, cheek aches. This is only two weeks into the medication. I am trying to see if I can take one a week at night time to keep a regular pain away and take Aleive for the small aches. I am on a 6 month trial treatment to see if this will work. Also the Neurologist told me to NOT get pregnant while taking this. Anyone have any information on that?

I suffered with migraines where i could not get off the couch for days. Now i have great relief with Imitrex. One side effect though that i have is sexual arousal. It's like taking Viagra, although i never took Viagra. I don't have an uncontrolled erection at work, but this medication has this side effect on me.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	10/12/2010 8:58:18 PM	This medication is the first one prescribed for my migraines.  It works within 10 minutes.  However one of the side effects I have it the tightness in my neck, jaw and shoulders. I had rather have the tightness than a headache.  Another side effect that I have but have not seen it listed is when I touch my skin, it feels like my muscles are sore, or for lack of better words is my skin hurts.

Much better than a debilitating migraine. I work fulltime so I can't just go hole up in my bedroom and sleep them off. I wouldn't drive right after using this because of the dizziness. 
Migraine Headache	Rockygurl2, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	9/10/2010 7:15:19 AM	My headaches have not been diagnosed as Migraines, plus my PCP obviouly didn't read my chart as I have an inverted ST Complex, indicative of a previous heart attack I was unaware of.  Plus my family history is one where I have lost all four Grandparents to heart attacks, my Father has heart disease.  I also have CRPS, a pain syndrome where Imitrex should never have been prescribed due to it's vasoconstriction properties, which cause my CRPS pain to go off the scale, causing severe all over burning. I was given an IM injection in hospital for severe headache, and it took the headache away, however, the severe burning and increased heart rate and palptations scared me.  Physicians should be completely aware of a patients physican problems before writing a prescription that could cause a heart attack and worsen my existing pain syndrome where any drug that is a vasoconstrictor should never be prescribed. Very unhappy with results of this drug.
Migraine Headache	professor, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	55-64	9/5/2010 7:48:58 PM	I don't think I have migraines.  I do have a headache that no other med has helped.  The best med that worked for me was 10 mg Maxalt.  That is a wonderful migraine med.  BUT a change in insurance would have me paying $90 for 9 pills.  I have tried 100mg Imitrex {generic} since July.  I already have most of the side effects because of a chronic illness I have.  I am more cold now even in 80 degree temps in the house. The worst problem is a feeling of a headache the next day.  I don't know if that is caused by Imitrex or not.  A lot of my headaches are induced by stress so I take a pill as the headache is developing.  It seems to work but again it rebounds the next day.  Maybe a lesser dosage is needed?

I had chest pain, heart palpitations, arm tingling and warmness and dizziness all within an hour of taking the 100mg pill. Three hours after taking the pill no change in my migraine and there is no way I'm taking another dose

Very nauseated(sp?) I would get sick within 1 hour of taking the medicine, and sometimes more for the next several hours. I would NOT reccomend this medicine if it causes any stomach discomfort or naseau it is not worth the trade off in the end imo.

I've had very little if any side effects aside from some slight tension in my chest but nothing that is overly concerning to me.  It has been incredibly helpful in times of need.
Migraine Headache	Peachy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/16/2010 10:23:00 AM	I've suffered from migraines since I was 9 years old.  Nothing worked.  Prescription pain meds sometimes helped a bit, but made me sleepy.  I might have to stay in bed for a day or more.  I had nausea, but not vomiting.  All those years, I was afraid to make any plans or look forward to anything for fear that I'd have a headache.I had read about Imitrex before it ever came out, and kept asking my doc when I could get it. As soon as it was available in pill form, I tried it...and felt my pain disappear!  For the 1st time in my life, I was freed from that monster!  I buy 50 mg tabs and cut them in half.  My life now is as normal as anyone elses.  This med was a God-send to me.  It has truly changed my life for the better!

The 50g pill is usually enough for me to start feeling better.  I've only ever once had to follow it up with some pain reliever and have never had to take more than one pill at a time.  I do wish that it was less expensive!  
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/27/2010 6:18:59 AM	This drug changed my life like no other drug has.  I had debilitating migraines, which were giving me problems with work.  Ever since I have been taking this, I have been migraine free with the exception of the time it takes for the drug to kick in.  For me, this is about an hour.  I take the 100 mg pills.  You are able to take two in 24 hours though, and I noticed that I usually need to take both, although I usually don't take the second one until about 12 hours after the first dose (but my migraines used to last for about three days, so I might be a more extreme case).  I did have one strange side effect, but it only occurs after I take the first dose, and only for about two hours after that first dose:  my jaw feels tight.  It feels like I'm going to have trouble moving it, but I don't actually have trouble moving it when I try to.  I also noticed it makes me slightly drowsy, but if I take this with some coffee then I'm fine (the drowsiness is really not that bad, and feels nothing past normal tiredness).  But these minor side effects pale in comparison to a three day migraine, and do not significantly affect my day when I take this drug.  
Migraine Headache	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/19/2010 5:35:16 PM	I have suffered from migraine headaches for more than 20 years.  This is the only medication that has consistently delivered relief.  My Dr. first prescribed the 50 mg dose and that seemed to work for a while, but then upped it to 100 mg when my headaches evolved into the debilitating cluster-types.  The only drawback that I have is the typical one of being extremely sensitive to hot/cold temperatures...but, for those who know what a real monster headache is, this is only a mild side-effect by comparison.

Dont get me wrong I am very sensative to the elements afterwards. But its worth it. Its not bad feeling. Just notice heat and cold a little more.  It does seem like it takes between 1-1/2 hrs to 2hrs to take effect though. You got to give it time.  
Migraine Headache	jen8910, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	4/29/2010 6:59:49 AM	I've had migraine headaches for 15 years, at least one per week, and have been taking Imitrex for most of that time.  I started years ago with the nasal spray then was prescribed the 25 mg pills, 50 mg pills, and now I take 100 mg. but I cut them in half.  Seems like every 5 years my dose goes up which worries me.  I've tried other triptans, anti-seizure drugs (like neurontin), various herbal and nutritional supplements, but I always return to and rely on Imitrex. It gives me mild side effects, mainly nausea and frequent urination for about 2 hours after taking a dose.  I have gotten mild chest pains and numb-ish/cold hands before but these symptoms rarely happen anymore.  Sometimes Imitrex doesn't work and I have to get a shot of toradol (sp?) or take a narcotic.  Sometimes I take a break from Imitrex and rotate in other triptans like Amerge or Maxalt for a few weeks, when I feel like Imitrex is not as effective, like my body is getting used to it. But Imitrex works the best.  Without Imitrex life would be quite difficult, though I don't like the idea of being so reliant upon one expensive drug.  Also I worry about long-term side effects &amp; have searched the internet for info and found very little.

Imitrex is my miracle drug!!!  I take the 50mg and the worst side effect I have experienced is some tingling in my feet.  I find it is best to take the Imitrex and lay down for 30 minutes to an hour I am 100% improved!  The relief comes a bit more slowly when I can't lay down, but still works like a charm every time!!  Without Imitrex I would be a total slave to my migraines... this drug gives me a life.

Dr said it probably wouldn't work because I had the headache for a week and imitrex usually only works if given at the onset of the headache but IT WORKED. Made me have some strange sensations and also made my throat feel very tight but they went away after a few hours but getting rid of the migraine outweighed the negatives. Had another migraine this month so my primary gave me a prescription for the oral form and 20 minutes after taking it..headache gone..but still the weird sensations and throat tightness.

I was just prescribed Imitrex. I'd rather deal with the headache rather than the side effects. I had severe chest pain, tightness in my jail, and tingling down both arms. If I wouldn't have read the possible side effects I would've thought for sure I was having a heart attack. I'll never use this again.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	3/12/2010 4:38:48 PM	this drug always helped my headaches, recently, though when I had to start using it again, I got terrible pain in both arms, and some heaviness in the chest, made me anxious,  tried it again a few weeks ago and the same symptoms, do not like this feeling at all, then tried a sample of treximet, same exact thing happened.  yes headache left, but I don't think those side effects are worth it, I will not take again, and will tell doctor the next time I need something for headaches

Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	3	3	Female	45-54	2/9/2010 1:16:22 AM	I took the generic version for the first time yesterday when I felt a migraine coming on. The tablets have been sitting here and I finally decided yesterday morning, surrounded by family to give it a try. The list of possible side effects had had me scared from taking it.  I did feel odd for about an hour - light headed and a bit anxious so I laid down. After about 30 minutes I got up and felt pretty good. A bit spent, as one usually feels after their brain is swollen from a migraine, and tired, but no throbbing, nausea or light sensitivity as with my migraines. I will keep some on hand but because of the possible stated side effects, I will be hesitant to use it unless it is a really bad migraine and I need to be funtional.

I do feel tired after the headache eases which is about an hour to an hour and a half but it is well worth it.  I have tried the new Imitrex/Naprosyn but it does not work as well.  I have also tried generic and it seems to be okay. Lower price or coupons would be a great help!

I started taking Imitrex 3 years ago and it's wonderful, gets rid of my migraine usually within the hour.  It does make me feel a little funny after taking it, but that doesn't last.  I can even take this at work when a migraine comes on and I can still do my job.  I have tried the generic, because my insurance went way up on my co-pay for the name brand, but the generic just does not work for me.  After contacting my insurance company I had to get the Dr. to fill out a form saying that the generic doesn't work.  So guess I'll have to wait to see how much I'll have to pay for them after that.  I do have a slight heart murmur, so I try not to take to many of these, I will try OTC pills before taking the Imitrex but I'm so glad they do have this drug, before I would have to stay in a dark room with the washcloth over my face etc.  The Dr did give me some samples of Treximet until I can get this resolved with the insurance company, but after reading some of the reviews on that, I'm not sure if I want to take those or not, for me the Imitrex works just great!

Migraine Headache	ouch, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	11/22/2009 6:49:32 PM	This was like curing the disease by killing the patient. I had rapid heart beat along with a burning and sensitive skin that left me groaning with pain until I fainted. Definately no more migrane but they seem as bad as each other.  I won't take it again.
Migraine Headache	lovelyasiwanna, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	11/21/2009 1:53:28 AM	OMG! after reading some of the reports i feel alot better about taking this medication. I am a college student who just took the first dose (100mg) yesterday. For the 1st hour i felt strange heart racing and beating extremely hard only for about 5 mins then my skin felt sensitive and my headache kept coming and going for the first 1/2 hour, My throat was sore for about an hour but had no difficulty in breathing. I would have to say if you can get through the first hour of the side effects this drug is amazing. I never suffered from migraines until college i must say tho the side effects make you feel a litle off but the lasting effect is well worth it...I never felt so good!!! Headache free!!

I experience drowsiness, and tightness in my chest at times in the first hour or so after taking the medication.  However, I would much rather have the small side effect issues than 3 days in bed.

Migraine Headache	enjae, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/17/2009 8:13:16 PM	This is the first drug that has dulled migraine pain so I could function and/or completely alleviated the pain.  I used Imitrex by injection until the oral form was first marketed.  Users should be informed about the pharmacological effects of the drug that occur soon after taking it.  
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/15/2009 2:37:51 PM	A few years back I had surgery on my jaw and since then I have gotten extremely bad migraines that start in the jaw area and take over my whole head!  I finally asked my doctor about it since nothing over the counter was working and he prescribed me Imitrex.  I was worried it may make me drowsy or have some other side effect I couldn't handle but nothing!  It's wonderful!  One dose and within the hour my migraine is gone.  No more lying in the dark with a washcloth over my eyes.  It's been great!  I highly recommend it.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	10/14/2009 4:13:43 AM	i have had migrains for years and i have taken all kinds of migrain meds. i take midrine at first but if this doesnt work i will use imitrex the only reason i dont like the pill is because of my nausea and i could take something for that too but i sometimes get a migrain for days i already feel as though i take enough meds. i much perfer the shot it is very painful to take and causes scar tissue overtime but works immediatly and my migrains dont uaslly come back after a few hours very exspensive but nice to have one shot laying around for the one that just wont give. nasal spray did nothing for me.

Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	9/19/2009 4:10:34 PM	This drug is definitely a miracle. I take Elavil to monitor my migraines but when i do get one Imitrex works in at least 30 minutes, if not faster.  The only side effect i have experienced is that i cannot take as hot of showers as i usually would. Since the very first day of taking it I felt the hot water was burning my skin. However, it is one side effect i am willing to have.

Ok, I admit ever since my faternity days in college, I would occasionally have a night where we &quot;bing drank&quot;.  Now that I'm in my 30's I've noticed I get hangover much easier when I have &quot;a night on the town&quot;.  Last night started with saki, then wine, then gin, then beer.  Yeah, that's a prescription for a hangover.  Woke up with morning with a hangover, took an imitrex, went back to bed.  Woke up 3 hours later and I feel GREAT!  About to go for a run.
Migraine Headache	bilahn,  Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		8/27/2009 10:07:36 PM	For me - a true miracle drug. I can be practically on my death bed with a migraine - one 50mg Imitrex, and in 30-60 minutes the headache  disappears in a mater of seconds - like flipping a switch.NO side effects whatsoever. Never need to take more than one.  And now it is in generic, so you don't have to waste your time with insurance companies who want you to &quot;try something else first&quot;.  I know there are some for whom it does not work. It could be that what such people is not a vascular headache. Imitrex will not work for regualar muscular headaches. Not all vascular headaches are true migraines, but for me it works for all such headaches.

Imitrex has worked for me for at least 10yrs. The cost is ridiculous and I feel for anyone who dosen't have insurance to cover.50 mgs works for me so my Dr prescribes 100 mg and I cut pills in half thus doubling my rx.

I took imitrex that my doctor prescribed and it made me feel like my head was going to roll across the floor for over an hour.. I was at work and felt rediculous although after awhile my migrane did go away but im not really sure it was worth it im used to the migranes and not used to my head rolling off... im going to ask if there is somethign else I can get to replace it.
Migraine Headache	tanzer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	8/13/2009 12:09:05 AM	For the past 10 yrs, I've gotten classic, complicated migraines (visual aura, 1/2 body numbness, light/noise sensitivity, searing pain).  When I first took Imitrex, 50mg made the migraine stop.  Now I'm up to 2 doses of 100mg to get relief, but it still works.  The key is taking it immediately, but I don't always catch it fast enough, 'cause the aura is preceded by a vision difficulty that's difficult to discern.  I usually take the max (doctor-allowed) dose of ibuprofen at the same time as the 1st Imitrex, it helps with the pain.Imitrex can have some nasty drug interactions, and cause heart issues. 
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/12/2009 10:33:24 PM	I am a college student who only recently started suffering from migraines. When they started to become more frequent I talked to my doctor who prescribed me the a generic RX of imitrex called Sumatriptan Succinate 100mg tablets.  Within a half an hour my headache was gone but my skin became extremely sensitive.  At the time I was suffering from a sunburn and the medication intensified the pain so much the clothing touching my skin was almost unbearable. I am hoping it will not be as bad the next time I have to take a tablet. Other than the skin sensitivity my experience with this pill was good. I would recommend it to others.

However, when I this medication, I seem to have sore throat, my skin hurts (scalp, hard to get up from bed, entire mouth swells, etc.). So, when I tell my doctor's (Psychiatrist, Internal Med., and OBGYN) about it, either of them can't give me a satisfactory answer to my questions in regards to this medicine. So, my Internal Med. doctor, switch me to another migraine medicine and the samething happens to me! Also, I was wondering, if Im allergic to this medication (Obviously), would that affect me getting pregnant? Did it cause my body any harm? I hope someone can give an answer.....

What I have discovered over the years is that, as with other medications, Imitrex can require increased doses and then lose its effectiveness over time.  If  you have migraines and haven't tried Imetrix, I suggest you give it a shot.  Even though it is no longer working for me, it did for many years, and is still the most effective of all the medicines I've tried.  I'm still looking for one that will be as effective to replace it.

I take a half of a imitrex tablet immediately when I feel a migraine coming on along with a zofran (for nasuea) and that works quite well for me. I take the other half of the imtrex if needed. My triggers are wine and any kind of refined sugars I stay away from.  Once you leran your triggers and how to mange your migraines life becomes much more pleasant!

Migraine Headache	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	5/7/2009 1:19:54 AM	Imitrex brings the longed for relief I always hoped for. It is important to take it early on when you feel the pain. (train yourself to identify the difference between the start of a migraine and a tension headache). 
Migraine Headache	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female		4/30/2009 10:02:44 PM	I have suffered from migraines since I was 13, I am now 20 and have been taking Imitrex for 4 years now. I can only take excedrine for headaches, and when I get migraines I need to use imitrex. I feel like it backfires really bad at first. im in my bed for hours, my jaw feels weird, but pain intensifies, but I feel like in some people it makes it worse before better. I wouldnt take anything else, I have tried other medications, but overall, just give it time. Try taking excedrine on top of Imitrex and put something cold on your head/neck. It helps ALOT. I heard they are coming out with a newer Imitrex, called something else with out the symptoms. I would reccomend this medication to others, I know the pain is intense, it just takes time to go away, so be patient and hang in there!

I have had migraines since I was a child.  I am now 28 years old (male) and know how to manage my migraines.  I highly recommend sticking to the lowest does that works for you.  I was up to 100 mg but then switched to 50 mg and found that I can typically get away with the 50 mg dose.  Imitrex is now available as a generic drug which is great.  Also, you can take 2 Aleeve tabs for the same effect as their new drug (Treximet).

These drugs make me hyper-anxious, and my muscles start cramping badly, and my joints inflame. And in addition, my nasal passages itch like crazy. It even makes my migraine worse. My wife also gets migraines and has much better results than I with Imitrex. Your results may vary.

Migraine Headache	ImitrexedinIndy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/9/2009 3:16:34 PM	Response and side effect depends (I believe) on dose and planning.  Best response is to take a dose and lay down if possible.  Injection side effect can be much different that oral (use one or the other, depending) I get more side effects that are different with injection, but inj. works fast and is effective: plan to sleep. Use when things are really out of control. I've never had rebound. I have, though, used injection and then followed with low-dose oral with good result.  Higher oral dose (100mg tab) causes serious muscle pain &amp; every joint aches; decreased energy &amp; hypersensitivity to hot/cold: even hurts to take a shower! Low dose tabs, however almost NO side effects and no muscle/joint pain. I have found w/oral Rx that taking even 1/3 (chip off a corner or the triangle shaped tab) of a 25mg and &quot;titrating to symptoms/pain&quot; every 1/2 hour I get best effect with fewest side effects. By the way, mine start GI with abdominal pain and work up to a migrain within hours.  Its amazing: after the Imitrex, everything calms down and reverts to normal function. I also find it helps to do relaxation/release imaging after taking Rx and it seems to work to lessen tension and improve drug effect. Have tried Aleve: it definitely lessens muscle symptoms. Also noticed (this is weird) even part of 100mg tab =to 50mg or less causes muscle pain but  two of the 25 mg tabs together don't cause side effect of muscle/joint pain at all. I suspect something in the preparation in the 100mg tabs to blame for side effects and not the Imitrex. Regrets to all of you who found it unacceptable. Its been a life saver for me and all my sisters who suffer with menopause-related migraine.  OK that is it.

Although one severe side effect I experienced while taking imitrex was swelling of my throat. It was crazy I noticed everytime after taking it my throat got tighter. It was a horrible feeling although the migraine was gone. However I am debating on continuing Imitrex because of this side effect.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/13/2009 7:16:58 PM	I have suffered from migraine for about 25 years and had previously been told by doctors that they would not prescribe due to cardiac warning. I am only 37. My very first experience was with a shot in the emergency room about 1 month ago. This headache that landed my in the emergency room was by far one of the worst with violent vomiting, sensitive to any light. Within 20 minutes of my shot, I was walking out of that emergency room. It is a miracle drug for me. I have never been able to pin piont what exactly triggers my migraines, but at least now I can deal with them when they happen.

And the pharamcy was sure to highlight on my form THERE IS NO GENERIC FORM OF IMITREX, I'm not sure if there is a generic form for a higher dosage or the shots or the nose spray...but I do believe I will be talking with my doctor about finding something else less expensive.
Migraine Headache	Mrs30cal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	2/7/2009 10:17:10 PM	It is said that it is not suppost to make you tired.  I was out for two hours min. when I took even a half.  The cost was outragous even with insurance.  It caused my jaw to hurt to the point that I couldn't talk most of the day.  My doctor took me off of them very quickly.
Migraine Headache	cupcake7887, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	2/5/2009 7:20:16 PM	Imitrex was prescribed to me for migranes.  My dosage was increased three times because I was exceeding 9 pills in a 30 day period.  Needless to say this medication did not work for me, it did, however leave a huge dent in my pocketbook!  
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/28/2009 8:55:04 PM	I've been using Imitrex for 3 years now and I love it. It  relieves my headaches within 30 minutes. I'm assuming the people that say it's so expensive must not have any insurance or insurance that's not very good. Cause the generic form of this costs me only $15 per month. This is a miracle drug and I cannot live without it. 
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/21/2009 5:08:28 AM	I am 27 years old and suffer at least one horrible migraine per week. I began using Imitrex yesterday and its already working. I haven't been able to even think about going back to work until now. It's expensive but it's worth it to me. I did experience sleeplessness with this medication but my headache was completely gone for the first time in years!

I got to the point where nothing OTC would work. If you suffer from severe HA i recommend you talk to your doctor about imitex. Imitrex was right for me and helped me gain back control!

Other	Trackita, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	25-34	1/10/2009 8:50:18 PM	I was prescribed this for chronic headaches that I have 24/7 for months at a time.  This did nothing.  But hey, at least I didn't have any bad side effects.
Migraine Headache	floetic, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	1/5/2009 6:19:11 AM	I have suffered with migraines since I was young girl.  My doctor gave me samples of Imitrex.  I took it when I got a migraine and it felt like a loco motive was racing through my head.  It seemed to race the migraine rather than ease it.  It scared me. I never took it again. Now, I try to eat better and not work and stress as much.
Migraine Headache	Sally, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/3/2009 8:53:38 PM	I use to be on Torodol for the pain I would get in the back of my head, but, I guess my body had been so use to taking this medication after about 10 years, that it wasn't helping me anymore. I was then switched to Imitrex and it has been amazing.I have had excellent fast time from the pain with this medication. Really glad I was able to finally find something that gets rid of the pain so fast. Believing that I also have M.S, although I was told that the headaches have nothing to do with my M.S. That part confuses me a bit. Not sure what my migraine headaches are from though. Any help would be appreciated. TY

My Dr. first gave me tho 100mg tab, but I had some unfavorable side effects, racing heart, anxiety and so forth.  The next time I took a 50mg tab without the side effects, but still great results.  I see on here some people take Imitrex several times a week, my Rx says not to take more than 2 times a week.  Anyone else have this notice on their prescription?

The only draw back is that I sometimes get an upset stomach.Plus sometimes my muscles ache so I feel like I have been in a fight.But it's all worth it when my headache is gone. 
Migraine Headache	fmmack1306, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	12/26/2008 9:59:52 PM	I was very pleased with this medication.  It worked very well until recently.  Over the past year or two the medication no longer worked. The migraines changes, and the medication no longer gave me any relief. I believe it was due to how long I had been taking the medication.
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	12/23/2008 8:46:59 PM	I don't live my life more than 6 feet from an Imitrix tablet.  I need to be able to take one as soon as migraine symptoms begin.  The migraine sually starts with neck tighness, nausua then dull pain.  Without Imitrix, the pain would become unbearable and I spend hours in agony.    But with Imitrix, the symptoms are gone within 15 minutes.

I thank god this drug is on the market because my migraines are actually crippling.People that have had a bad experience must be allergic to the drug but i swear this is a miracle drug. One problem the drug cost way too much especially now since we are all having hard times. There is a generic out now that came out last month. As for Maxalt it also works for me but everyone else i know that has used this drug states it did not work for them. I know i work in Pain Management.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/9/2008 8:53:10 PM	I would not be able to function without this migraine medication. But, I went to get my refill and have found out that it is not available because a generic form has come out. This is going to cost me $240, I can not afford that.My insurance does not cover it. Imitrex needs to continue making their product.
Migraine Headache	Michelle, 35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		35-44	12/9/2008 6:14:59 AM	As long as you can take it the very second you feel it coming on IT WORKS GREAT!!! The problem is the price. $220.  for twelve pills that come in a pack that can't be separated into a few at a time. The drug maker should be ashamed!!

I had suffered for 5 years prior. I can't imagine what I would do without it! I have 3 chilren and work 50 hours a week. I had to suffer through work before, now I can live life without spending it in my room with ice on my head and all the lights out.

I was more miserable after I took the pill than I was before.  I was at work and had to crawl under my desk and sleep for two hours after I took the pill.  I will never take this drug again - I would rather deal with my symptoms.
Migraine Headache	aimless, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	11/19/2008 9:54:29 PM	If I am unable to take this medication at the very first sign of a migraine, it DOES NOT work. Today when I went to refill my prescription, the pharmacist said it would be $220 for 9 tablets. That is insane!!!! I usually have 4-9 days of migraine a month. Maybe 40% of the time 2 pills helps. It is debilitating, and I can not work, but I also do not have $220 every two moths to spend on drugs that most of the time do not work. I have had migraines fro 16 years, and been taking imitrex for 10+ years.

Migraine Headache	Spinspinsugar, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/19/2008 7:55:57 PM	I took my first dose of Imitrex aprox. 30 min ago. Just the fact that I'm able to sit here typing this is a miracle for me. I've had debilitating migraines since I was four years old and nothing else has ever worked for me. So far I'm not experiencing any side effects, I took a 50 mg dosage and am astounded that it actually worked. Even those side effects I've read about on this site wouldn't deter me from taking it, though. My migraines are always accompanied by severe nausea, vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, (my left eye sometimes even swells shut) as well as the intense pain and disorientation sometimes to the point that I am unable to do anything for myself, even walk or think lucidly. If it's bad enough, you know as I do that you'd do anything to relieve it. Anything. It isn't right for everyone, but I am 100% grateful and relieved literally to the point of tears.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/17/2008 8:49:12 PM	Imitrex has worked really good for my Mom &amp; I. We both suffer from Chronic Migraines. As soon as I feel the migraine coming on, I take it &amp; lay down for awhile and it usually takes it away after about 20-30 minutes. If I already have a full blown migraine, it takes some of the edge off. So either way, I'm pretty satisfied.

My dr gave me samples of each, but after reading side effects I am thinking I am just going to get rid of one problem and replace it with another. How bad is the throat/chest pain &amp; pressure? Tolerable or would you rather have a migraine. Email me at nicoleigh33@hotmail.com if you are open to sharing your experience with either drug. Thanks! Nicole
Migraine Headache	Only Once, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	10/7/2008 12:58:34 PM	For me, Imitrex was a miracle drug when it came to getting rid of a migraine headache. I took this medicine within 1 hour of having a migraine start and maybe 30 minutes later my migraine was gone. However, I started to feel very feverish and sore, almost as if I had a sudden case of the flu. Also, I experienced extreme nausea and stomach cramping. In the end, Imitrex got rid of my migraine in a hurry, but replaced it with symptoms that were almost as debilitating making it not much of a help at all.
Migraine Headache	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	13-18	10/7/2008 10:12:37 AM	I had the WORST experience with this drug. I was taking TOPAMAX at the time and when I would get my headaches my doctor told me to take Imitrex. I took it I believe 3 times and all 3 times It felt like my throat was closing up, I couldn't breath good, I felt nausea, and I felt like I was overheating. Not to mention my headache was alot worse.

Migraine Headache	Meta Marie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	10/5/2008 1:06:19 PM	I buy the 100 mg and split them.  My son read in a health magazine that imitrex can be taken with two aleve.  So I take 50 mg and two aleve.  Probably not a good idea to take two aleve without asking your doc.  Usually takes 1 hour to kick in but saves me money amd my insurance only lets me buy 9 of the pills a month so splitting them is cheaper and provides me with double the amount I am allowed.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	10/3/2008 8:27:27 PM	I have had severe migraine and tension headaches several times a week for several years now and Imitrex really has been a life saver.  It works best when I take it right on the onset of a headache and I take 100 mg tablets.  There are occasions where I have headaches so severe that more than one dose is necessary or it doesn't help at all, but that is rare.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	10/3/2008 1:12:41 PM	this drug made me feel ten times worse than my migraine. it caused me severe shortness of breath and made my throat feel tight. i will never take it again and i will never suggest it to anyone.

Migraine Headache	35-44 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4		35-44	9/21/2008 10:02:39 PM	I have had migraines/mixed tension headaches for 24 years. Rebound headaches were a problem in my teens.  When Imitrex came out I was very impressed by how effective it was.  I have been using it for about 10-12 years and I am now experiencing some problems with my migraines not easing up like they used too.  Also,  I have began to experience &quot;leg migraines&quot; with my regular migraines.  They only react to the statdose injection.  My best advice to anyone out there who has just started having migraines is to try and avoid taking too much of any over-the-counter meds such as advil,excedrin,goodies,etc...They work great if you have about four headaches per month, but for people with more you need a triptan.  Imitrex is great for about two headaches per week, but anymore than that and you risk being like me.  I am resistant to about everything.  That said, it still is the best thing going and far better than a visit to any E.R.P.S. One more piece of advice, please try and limit caffeine to one soda/coffee per day.  And if you are like me, Never eat chocolate before bed!
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/16/2008 1:04:45 PM	I was first given injections of Imitrex at the ER for a migraine I'd had for two days; by that point, I had tunnel vision and even the sound of my voice hurt. After three injections and about an hour's time, the headache was easing off. At home, I take the pill form (100 mg) and go to sleep. I'm usually already nauseous when I take the pill. When I wake up a couple hours later, my headache is gone. I may get a small rebound headache, but with a couple ibuprofen, it's gone.

Migraine Headache	elannco, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	9/15/2008 4:50:02 PM	This is a great medication! I take 25 mg with two Excedrin (my doctor okayed this) and that takes care of my migraine for the rest of the day! It also relieves any other pain I am having...neck, knees, feet, wherever. Occasionally I will feel a little draggy after taking it, but not usually. The effects seem to last for about 24 hours, as I will sleep well (a problem for me) all night after I have taken a dose. I do not like taking any drug, and at 68 years do not take any maintenance medications, so I think my system is especially responsive to any drug I do take. Have had migraines ever since I got married 48 years ago! Usually will last for three days, second and third day not so bad, might not require Imitrex. It's like what comes first...the chicken or the egg. For me, it's what comes first...the headache or the neck tension. I always have both, and Imitrex takes care of both.
Migraine Headache	interited migrain, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	35-44	9/13/2008 6:38:30 PM	I have been suffered with migrain and only take Tylenol or Midol but that did not help.  My doctor prescribed Imitrex a few months ago and it was like heaven opened for me.  However the headache usually rebound the next day so it take 3 days (3 pills) to guard it off.  Last month we went on vacation and I only got 1 pill with me.  The day after the headache rebounded so my husband took me to Walgreen but I was unable to refill.  The pharmacist then recommend Excedrin Migrain.  It helped a lot and I did not get any rebound heachace.  Now I take Excedrin instead.

Migraine Headache	darin, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	7/17/2008 3:44:33 PM	Have had migraines for about 20 years.   Tried midrin first, which was not effective at all.   Next tried Maxalt (another triptan) which was very effective.   Imitrex was even more effective.  It eliminate the headache 99% of the time within 1 hour.  Take it as soon as you feel a migraine coming.If you get an upset stomach, as I do, take it with food, if possible.  If it still causes an upset stomach, take the Imitrex shots.   They really aren't that bad.   The statdose pen is easy to use - it is NOT like a regular syringe.  You push it on your skin and press a button.
Migraine Headache	trbritt, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Male	25-34	6/25/2008 4:02:30 PM	Imitrex has never failed me. I deal with moderate to severe migraines on a daily basis sometimes. Many months, I will go weeks without a migraine then I will have one everyday for three or four days in a row. My migraines require the kind of power that Imitrex offers. The other great thing about this drug is that one dose will ward off my migraines for the entire day. The headache does not come back after it goes away. The side effects to this drug are slight, but certainly not nearly as debilitating as my headaches would be without this miracle drug.

This med helped if i could take it at onset of the migraine and then sit down and relax for a while.  Unfortunately I have my job does not allow me to do so.  Also, i would try to wait the headache out to see if it was a true migraine and by that point it was too late.

I have been on imitrex for about 6 months so far (knock wood) it has worked every time! For example today I had a major migraine, I didnt have my pills with me so I had to wait till I got home, I was stomach was so upset, the sun was killing me and I came home took one and within 15 min. I felt so much better!! I do get slight side effects, neck pain, a weird feeling on the bridge of my nose and tight jaw. Another side effect (I dont consider this bad) is it cleared my sinus! I am feeling a bit tired now but a migraine can casue this too! I am so happy I found this drug!

Sometimes even walking makes my feet ache.  But it's better than having a migraine.  What I have found really helps is to take a muscle relaxer with the Imitrex.  I take 10mgs of Flexerill and it helps with the side effects.
Migraine Headache	ldjohn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	6/3/2008 2:15:08 PM	I have recently in past two years began to have every quarter a hormonally induced migrane.  One being so severe I probably needed to go to the ER.  I have not taken this drug and spent $195 for 9 pills and after reading the reviews I don't believe its worth the risk.  Now I have a RX that I won't take.
Migraine Headache	kimberlybluebird, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	35-44	5/23/2008 8:24:32 PM	I've had migrains since I was a teen. Nothing ever helped me. I would be in bed for days at a time and even then I would get nausous, tremble, sesitive to light and smells. Imetrex does help at times, if I take it right away. I usually don't cause I want to make sure it's not just a normal headache. The only thing that really bothers me is the packaging. I can't open it when I have a migrain. I have to have someone do it for me.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/19/2008 9:43:49 AM	I just started getting atypical migraines due to a head injury I suffered last year. I took Imitrex for the first time this weekend. It was a miracle! All of my symptoms stopped within 10 minutes. I did sleep for 3 hours straight and felt like I had a hangover the next day but it was worth it!
Migraine Headache	umbersiii , 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	5/2/2008 9:40:34 AM	Imitrex works! within 20 minutes the pain starts to diminish,and pain  disappears within 40 minutes. It is important to take Imitrex promptly. 
Migraine Headache	mlingresham2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/1/2008 10:58:56 PM	I have suffered from migraines since I was 12 years old.  13 years ago Dr. gave me Imitrex injections and then nasal sprays.  The pills don't work for me as I generally throw them up.  Imitrex has given me my life back.  I do try not to use it unless it is a full blown migraine I wake up with, as there is a rebound effect to the medication.  Usually Excedrin, and a short lay down will take care of a headache that comes on during the day.
Migraine Headache	Male Soldier, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	2	4	Male	19-24	4/29/2008 12:44:32 PM	The medication works and takes care of what would be a really bad migraine but the way it makes you feel is horrible. I also dislike how it is packaged. It makes it really hard to get out when a migraine is beginning. At least for me.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	4/29/2008 12:37:49 PM	Imitrex is either a wonder drug or absolutely horrible. For me it was a nightmare- I took one for a migraine and while it cured the headache (mostly), the side effects were WORSE. My head, jaw, throat, ear, chest- everything got tight, I had trouble breathing, I was sweating so badly I soaked my sheets, and i got extremely dizzy and nauseated. All this on one 50-mg dose! I took it 24 hours ago and I'm still having problems with tightness and aching in my neck and throat, and I'm feeling extremely lethargic. Worse, I'm getting a rebound headache. I wouldn't take Imitrex at all, except it's the only thing my insurance will cover. Relpax works better for me with lesser side effects (not much less, truth be told), but I can't afford to pay for it all out-of-pocket.
Migraine Headache	cjensen, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/25/2008 10:43:49 AM	within 10 minutes of taking a 100 mg pill before the onset of a migraine, i experienced pretty severe reactions. my neck and jaw completely ceased up, my sinuses started burning and i couldn't lift my head. this lasted for about 2 hours and only started to subside after my husband gave me a serious neck massage (he confirmed all of my jaw, shoulder and neck muscles were completely tight.) i eventually got a headache anyway and slept for 10 hours. i'm so sad to have had this reaction because i had high hopes for this drug. but either the dose was way too high for me, or people with sensitive drug interactions, beware.

The medicine makes me sick to my stomach and I usually go to bed after taking it,  but it stops the headache.  I don't like the side effects and only take the drug when Advil doesn't cut it.

Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/30/2008 6:21:19 PM	I have suffered from migraine headaches since I was 16 years old.  Usually went to ER for a shot to relieve pain.  I am now 52, and for the last 10 years the pain has been so dibilitating that I would lose 2-3 days at a time from one episode.  Finally, 1 1/2 yrs ago, a doctor prescribed Imitrex.  It works like a miracle for me...I would rather have a few nasty side effects that don't last too long, and drowsiness most of the day, than to have days of unbearable pain.  The trade off is well worth it.  I am so glad I have this medication.  I see some of you have been taking this medication for 10 years or so.  I can't believe it took so long to find a doctor who knew what to give me.  
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	3/21/2008 5:37:25 PM	I took imitrex frequently for about 10 years and it did a wonderful job on my headaches. However, I did not realize at the time that it was causing a heart condition. Please be very careful with this drug. A good alternative is Fioricet.
Migraine Headache	susiesings, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/20/2008 3:08:16 AM	I have been using Imitrex injections and pills for about fifteen years now and am so grateful for the relief from migraines that it has given me.  I take the pills at the first hint of migraine symptoms and usually they will head it off.  If I wake up with a full blown migraine or if the pill doesn't work, I give myself an injection and usually have relief within twenty minutes, with no side effects.  It's like a miracle.  The only problem I've had is being able to receive help from insurance to obtain an adequate amount of Imitrex so that I don't run out.  Recently, doing a mail order from Medco has made it a little easier, but I still have to fight for it and keep after my doctor to help me.  It's worth it though not to have to worry about being too dibilitated to go to work.  Imitrex has definitely improved the quality of my life.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	3/19/2008 2:26:05 PM	Horrible side effects, almost ended up in ER.  Felt like I was poisoned.... my body hurt all over, felt dizzy when I stood up, like I had the flu.  Almost ended up in ER, had my doctor not said I would just have to sit it out. Will never take again
Migraine Headache	kcomfort, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/3/2008 9:45:59 PM	I have been suffering from migranes since I was about 12. I suffered through them because my family thought I wanted attention. Finally a few years ago I ended up in the ER and they PUMPED me full of morphine, sent me home with a script for Imitrex. I call it the miricle drug. It works wonders for me and I still get migranes so bad i want to go to the ER, but now it's gone within 30 to 40 minutes after taking the medicine. It either works very well for you or it doesn't work at all. I happen to be a luck one.
Migraine Headache	toughcookie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	2/17/2008 9:24:12 PM	I'm 24 years old and have had migraine/tension headaches since elementary school. I get extreme sensitivity to light, sound, and sometimes smells. I've tried every aspirin there is and nothing has worked. I usually just go to sleep and pray that the pain is gone when I wake, and usually it isn't! Sleeping sometimes makes it worse! I was prescribed Imitrex about 2 months ago as my first attmept to treat my headaches. It's horrible! It makes my headaches worse, causes extreme nausea, and the muscles in the back of my neck at the base of my skull and in my shoulders throb and tighten up even more than they normally do when i get the headaches. It's completely debilitating and I can't function once i've taken the pill. I have decided to discontinue using it and call my doctor and try something else.
Migraine Headache	mngopher, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/6/2008 4:38:12 AM	I started getting migrains about 6 year ago. I was going to the ER several times a week. Since I have been on Imitrex I have had to go to the ER once in about 5-1/2 years.For about a year they halso had me on Topamax to cut down the number of migrains. Since I have many other medical problems the wanted me off Topamax.Since they have I have not had to go to the ER at all.My insurance is also saying that they will only cover 9 per month, when for the lst 2 years they have been paying for 18 per month. I am requesting an exception to this with a letter from my Dr. Hopefully they will continue to allow the 18 per month. If not I am sure that I will end up going to the ER more often again. If that happens they will be paying a lot more for all the ER trips then they would for the Imitrex.There are months that  don't use the complete 18 but most months I do.I think this is a wonder drug.I do imagine that there are peope that can not take it because they have side effects but this is true with almost any drug on the market.As for me, it has been wonderful becuase I am not laid up with migrains and can go on with my life.
Migraine Headache	Lauren, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/30/2008 12:05:52 AM	This is my first time trying this drug and I had horrible side effects.  I will not take this drug again, this is quite frightening because on 12/22/07 I suffered from a Transient Ischemic Attack and then another one on 1/29/08.  After reading the Precautions, the TIA that I had was one of the things listed on the Precaution sheet.  Right now as I type, I can feel horrible from this pill.  This was why I always let my migraines run their course for fear of funky side effects ... guess I proved myself right.
Other	Rosemarie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/28/2008 12:51:18 AM	Before Imitrex was prescribed for my headaches, I would have to be taken to the Emergency Room for a shot before I could even function!  With the Imitrex, I can take one at the onset and usually don't have to take another one.  I am taking chemo now that triggers migraines and I have one 5 days out of 7.  Only Imitrex relieves them.  I am on Medicare with Rx coverage but my insurance co will only approve 9 tablets every 30 days.  While taking the chemo, that is not taking care of the problem.  What I need now is some kind of patient assistance with this medicine in order for me to function with my regular duties.  Hopefully, I can get some assistance because I have Metastatic Breast Cancer in my bones, spine, and lungs and I will need chemo of some form the rest of my life.  I am 66 years old now.
Migraine Headache	grandma, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/27/2008 2:49:39 PM	It was the miracle drug for me.  Migraines are generally gone in 20 minutes with 1 dose.  Have been using it for 10+ years.  Have had migraines since I was 19 years old.
Migraine Headache	mrsminette, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	1/26/2008 8:34:40 PM	I took 100 mg of Imitrex, and about 10 minutes I had an adverse reaction. I experienced facial paralysis, chest pain and tightness, then my face and head started to burn and tingle. My throat started to swell and I had trouble breathing. I started to vomit. All I could do was cry! I will never take this medication again!  
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	1/10/2008 2:41:25 PM	there was an adverse reaction to this med immediately upon taking it... i felt as if my brain caught on fire and my breathing became fast, chest pounding and eyes weak. i was pulling at my hair to try to ease the burning, and just covered my head with a large pillow until i fell asleep. when i awoke, the migraine was still there and i just felt dizzy. i couldn't stand, so i laid there another hour until i could muster enough power to stand. i don't negate the drug's benefits, it just didn't work on me.
Migraine Headache	tipshaw, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/7/2008 7:23:40 PM	I've had migraines for 20 years and nothing has worked to abort a headache as well as this.  Topamax helps limit the number of headaches I get, but can't eliminate them.  When I get them, 1 Imitrex works within 2 hours, and gives me a great boost of energy along with it.  With NO drowsiness or side effects.  It's changed my life.  I couldn't live without them!!!!

The drugs works everytime.  Only side effect is a tightening and tingling of my face and some moderate joint pain that lasts for about 45 min.  Even with good drug coverage this medicine is very expensive and I frequently run out before the insurance will cover more.

I switched over to Relpax in mid-Sept and since then I get them one at a time now.  Nothing else in my routine has changed, so it had to have been that.

The only negative thing I have found is that sometimes I feel overmedicated or like I have gotten off a amusement ride shortly after taking it but that wears off within a half hour and then I am fine. I do not recommend driving till you know your reaction.

Hate the cost.  At $20+ per tablet, it's not affordable without insurance.  
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/30/2007 1:50:54 PM	I was diagnosed with migraines in my mid-thirties and I am 55 now. Imitrex is the miracle drug of the century in my opinion. The only time I am debilitated by a headache is when I wake up in the morning and the headache has progressed too far for Imitrex to work.  That happens once-twice a year. Compared to multiple times a month, it's wonderful. I am very conscientious about taking the medication at early onset.  I had hoped once I went through menopause the headaches would stop, but while they aren't as predictable, I still have them.  I inherited them I believe from my great grandmother.  I cannot imagine what it was like for her back then with nothing but aspirin to handle the pain, nausea and vomiting! The cost is rather expensive, even with drug coverage insurance.  Hopefully a generic will be available in the future. The cost is manageable since I'm able to keep on working and cope with my headaches.

I am wondering if the ingredients in this medication could cause Liver Enzyme tests to be elevated, specifically (AST 45), should be 40. (ALT 66), should be below 40.  I only drink Beringer Zinfadel in small quantities during social occasions.  Could there be a connection.  My Dr. is having me come back in in one month fasting for more tests.  Thanks for your help.

Now that I don't have Prescription Drug coverage, I can no longer afford to refill.  The $10 coupons helped some, but they expired too soon.  I was only refiling the prescription every 3 months or so.  The price has been increasing lately.  Hopefully a generic product will become available soon.

My doctor decided it was time to try the imitrex and what a reliefe it was.  It made me feel very funny for about an hour but my headache was gone in less than 30 minutes.  I do have some discomfort in my throat for a while after I take it and I kinda feel like there is pop rocks in my head but it is worth it.
