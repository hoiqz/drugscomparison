Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation	Realtyman95, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	55-64	4/8/2011 2:18:54 PM	Started Multaq 10/09.  I went of rhythm about once a month for an average of 12 hours each time, during the 1st 12 months or so. But now I'm going out every few days and staying out longer (up to 10 days out recently). Ugh.  So it's obviously become less effective with time for me.
