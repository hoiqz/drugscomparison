I used to have to have them frozen every few months and it does keep them from returning as long as you take it as I had stopped hoping to not have to keep taking it but the warts started to return.

I have been having pain in my arthritic big toe, beyond normal lately; and my hips are hurting especially when sleeping.  I read an article about such medications (regular OTC) that cause hip pain, wondering if this is the cause of mine.  I've been to PT without relief.
