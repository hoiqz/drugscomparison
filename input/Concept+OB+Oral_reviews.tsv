Pregnancy		1	1	1			6/18/2012 3:25:15 PM	The two times I have vomited this entire pregnancy were the week I took Concept OB! And I'm 17 weeks along! CitraNatal is way better, even the generic brand from Target is better (on both stomach and wallet!)
Pregnancy	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	10/9/2011 8:45:13 PM	This is the worst prenatal vitamin I've ever taken. I took it as one of the samples and only this one gave me really bad constipation. I didn't constipate until taking it. Doctors shouldn't give patients sample prenatal vitamins either, since each one contains different %DV of vitamins. Concept OB has almost 5 time %DV of iron and if you are a small person, that can definitely cause severe constipation. I threw away the rest of Concept OB,and using Walgreen brand instead...
Pregnancy	PoloLoco, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	6/4/2011 12:25:26 AM	I did not tolerate this prenatal vitamin well. It caused me really bad constipation. It has a lot of iron it it and I think this is the reason. It has a really high amount of vitamins. It might be good for some people, but not for me. I'm high risk and beginning to take Neevo instead.

Prevention of Fetal Neural Tube Defects when Pregnant	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	10/8/2010 3:07:53 PM	I received a sample from my OB and my stools turned green and I became constipated because of the high amount of iron.  While I like how small (and easy to swallow) this vitamin is, I am going to try another brand or two because of the change in my bowel movements.
