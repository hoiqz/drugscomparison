I suppose it's nature telling me I won't get off so easy for the 35 years of liquid abuse I subjected by body to.'Mothers, tell your children, not to do...'

When taken correctly it actually works better than a pain pill. But, one still needs pain medication if the chronic panceatits ia as severe as mine is.

The Viokase helps my tummy pouch and small intestine absorb more nutrients from my foods. The only problem is remembering take the pills every time I eat, which is often. But my weight was down to 100# and now I'm up to 112# after 3 months of being on this .

However now Medico does not distribute it and I need to find an alternative that is as good as Viokase.
