I am being clinically followed at a VA hospital.  This drug, at 1mg, has taken me from being a person that screams at night, waking up my wife, cold sweats and torrid sleep, to now having a peaceful night of sleep and wonderful dreams.

I am up to 10 mgs. I suffer from PTSD &amp; Bi-polar. It seems to be working for I haven't slept with a night lite on for awhile. BUT I have had some side effects. Headaches,a very low sex drive. Which is causing problems in my marriage. That is why I am thinking of talking to my Dr. and see if there is something else out there. But on the other hand I am not afraid to go asleep at night. So what should I do?

It does seem to exert a physiologically calming influence along with my other meds and help me (usually) get a decent night's sleep. It makes me very drowsy, a desired effect.

I only take it in the evening with my meal. The reviews with the pancreas problems has me concerned and would like to find information on this

A unusual side effect i also noticed was a condition known as &quot;FORCED SPEECH&quot; when trying to concentrate in a social setting or even on the phone i had the effect of confusion and, in basic term, talked a million miles an hours.  Eventually this stopped, however i would not recommend this to someone who is also on psyciatric medication.  BAD STUFF, putting it basically.

Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with Trauma-related Nightmares	aubreyfam84, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	6/9/2010 3:30:41 PM	My husband is 34 and is on Prazosin right now. He has been on it for  almost 2 years. Last July, his Pancreas burst and almost died. They stopped giving him any of it in the hospital without weaning him off. He was in the hospital for 11 days. I just read the interactions for Prazosin and Tramadol should not be taken with it. He is still on both of them and is failure to thrive and still has acute pancreatitis. I want to thank deadgirlwalking for hr review. I wish I knew where you read about Prazosin causing Pancreatitis...I couldn't find it on this site. PLEASE email me if you can and let me know ANY info you have. I need to save my husbands life. I guess his DR is dumb, or trying to kill him, by having him take these drugs at the same time... Thank you-                        aubreyfam@yahoo.com

I reviewed the side effects list for this drug and realized that Pancreatitis was one of the rare side effects - I was hospitalized last summer for Pancreatitis and nearly died.  I also noticed that when I ran out and couldn't get a refill on it, the nightmares became even more severe than before taking the medication.  I am wondering if anyone has tried anything other than Prazosin.

I'm on 10 mg at night, but I think I might need to go up to keep the benefits of it going.  I am having some issues with palpitations, but it might or might not be related to this.
