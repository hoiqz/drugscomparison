Some days I take 4 per day, others I take none, depending on how my bladder feels that day.  I find it to be especially helpful to ease the &quot;burning&quot; sensation.  However, I have such frequent UTIs that the relief I get from this medicine sometimes masks the discomfort from a raging UTI.

It is sad when your phyiscan has not follow up with you about any other treatment, since this is not drug that can cure what is wrong with you. this medicine has affected my moods quite a bit, making me very sensitive. This is not good when you have to be around other people.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	7/22/2010 2:48:28 PM	No Insurance covers this, no other form of the drug yet company reams you on price! I have IC and and severe bladder pain and I need it after sex to try and prevent bladder infections. I get the WORST nausea with this medication but it's worth not getting sick. So I thought I would take it minimally. When I ran out of what the doc gave me for free. I was disgusting to see the company reams you on the price. No insurance covers it. So I am no longer taking it. I think it's disgusting to have to pay hundreds of dollars for a bottle of meds that stains the toilets so terribly and has so many side effects. If they would just lower the price I could afford to keep a bottle on the side and take it when needed. Thanks a lot Azur pharma, money grubbers! When people are in pain they get desperate and Azur likes to take advantage of that.

Difficult or Painful Urination	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/4/2010 1:54:07 AM	I have had life long problems with urinary pain (chronic sever infections &amp; stricture abstruction), this is by far the best medication out there. It is much better than Pyridium. If your doctor prescribe's Pyridium request Urelle, it is a much more effective, quicker acting and has less side affects. You have to suggest it because alot of doctor's are not too familiar with it.

Other	Lisa MO, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	10/30/2009 4:02:55 PM	I was prescribed Urelle to help with bladder pain/spasms, burning with urination from IC with Hunner's ulcers.  Was also prescribed hyoscyamine and ultram.  When switched to that protocol was up every six hours at night to go to the bathroom and in so much pain I didn't sleep for three days until I begged to switch back to what had been working better.  Urelle causes severe nausea for me as well as being ineffective.

After gall bladder surgery, I get intestinal spasms occasionally.  Urelle is like a miracle drug.  I take only 1 pill and the spasms and heartburn stop.  My gastroenterologist told me he has heard other patients who get the same relief and has been prescribing it for GI spasms.  I cannot live without this drug.  Who cares about the blue color as long as the drug works.
Difficult or Painful Urination	Paula, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/25/2009 9:53:29 PM	This medication is horrible. Four days after I was taking the medication, I started with rectal bleeding. In March I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. I believe that this medicine caused this problem because I was fine before that.
Difficult or Painful Urination	K, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/29/2009 5:17:00 AM	Prescribed to me for the development of IC as a result of endometriosis. It's been extremely effective and has never caused the nausea and vomiting that I experienced with prescription doses of pyridium. With respects to worrying about the blue staining, in my opinion, it's well worth the small risk in order to be pain-free. The medication is also very effective with pain associated to spasms during menstruation, particularly as drugs don't only work for specific areas of the body. The single thing that could be a problem with Urelle is cost - even covered by insurance, it can get quite expensive.
Difficult or Painful Urination	none, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/13/2009 12:52:14 PM	For some reason one year after prostatectomy, I started with some very painful urination and constant use of the bathroom.  I eventually ended up pretty dehydrated.  After a cyctoscope by my doctor to make sure nothing was wrong, he gave me Urelle on the directions of once a day.  In 30 minutes it took the pain away and allowed me to significantlly re-hydrate.  I have been taking it for three days now and once a day and it is working great.  Perhaps I am a bit tired but I was before I started taking the drug.  Pryidium was not effective.

Difficult or Painful Urination	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	4/15/2009 10:13:25 AM	This medication helped relieve frequent &amp; uncomfortable urination for about 48 hours while awaiting urine culture. However, even following instructions carefully, after 48 hours, frequency &amp; discomfort returned along with spotting. I also use Estrogen Cream to eliminate post-menopausal urethral dryness. Is Urelle competing with the Estrogen Cream to cause increased dryness? [Post menopausal urethral dryness can be just as problematic as a UTI!]

Thankfully I have had no bad side effects.  It has calmed my bladder, taken away the &quot;razor blade&quot; feeling and in conjunction with Vesicare I am finally feeling some relief after months of pain and taking every bladder medical test under the sun.  Pain went from a 10 to about a 2 to 3.  Very expensive though...but worth it.

Pyridium makes me very nauseous and doesn't work on the pain at all. The only thing that is disturbing is that my prescription insurance coverage doesn't cover this medication; it considers it non-preferred and doesn't even offer any alternatives. I don't think there are any alternatives, at least with all the ingredients that Urelle has. If someone knows of any alternatives, please let me know.

I tried other products like Azotine, which made me sick to my stomach. This is easy to swallow without the unpleasant taste of azotine.

The doctor prescribed Urelle for the bladder spasms caused by the stent.  While Urelle has done an excellent job of relieving the spasms, I experienced a few of the side effects.  Some of them were blue urine, irritation of the stomach, frequent urination, drowsiness, low energy, felt like throwing up, and weakness.  These were a satisfactory trade-off to be free of the bladder spasms.  
Difficult or Painful Urination	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	9/28/2007 3:07:48 PM	I was suffering acutely from a UTI.  I waited until I thought I couldn't take it any more to seek treatment.  My blood pressure was high due to the pain.  Within a half hour of taking the medication I felt so much more relaxed.  My blood pressure lowered.  Within a day, the urgency to urinate constantly subsided.  It turns urine a bluish green color which was actually comforting to me as I felt like I didn't have blockage, just an infection.
