Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/19/2010 5:22:01 PM	Got diagnosed with adult acne, which left me with 5-7 large pimples on my face at any given time. Took Retin-A and by the end of the month there was a noticeable clearing of the skin. After 2-3 months, my acne was completely gone. My complexion is now even,  there are no dark marks, and a fine wrinkle that was once on my forehead is no longer there. I adore this medication. 
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	8/24/2010 10:29:58 AM	I tried this product for an acne problem I have and my face started to turn red along with swelling and itching after my first time using it.  I also had a few spots on my back and arms that were red, swollen, and itchy as well.  While the drug information said that this type of side effect is rare, be careful using this medication.  If you experience any kind of reaction similar to mine, stop using the product and contact your doctor immediately.
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	13-18	7/20/2010 11:54:08 PM	I used Tretinoin cream for acne and at first I followed the directions. I washed my hands after using it. After awhile I got lazy and did not wash after as often. Eventually I didn't at all. My fingers became pitted, meaning that it looked like small chunks of skin just along the top had been cut out. My fingers became extremely sensitive to hot and cold, and turned blue and a light shade of purple. I went to see a rheumatologist and had blood tests done. It came back saying I may have Lupus or Raynaud's. Luckily, the rheumatologist told me to just stop using Tretinoin cream to just see if that would change anything. It did. The pitted fingers healed and looked normal in 3-4 months. The next blood tests came back normal. Now I just have slight sensitivity to handling cold objects.

Acne	qa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	1/13/2010 11:50:35 AM	I've been using the cream for almost a year it has helped the acne but the discoloration is still a problem.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	25-34	10/14/2009 10:53:54 PM	love love love this product.  it works by speeding up your skin's ability to shed dead cells.  and lowers the amount of oil your skin produces.  i used this cream with birth control to help w acne.  My skin has been clear for 8 months!  
Acne	tretinoin top, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	10/7/2009 5:43:41 PM	I really love this product. I can finally start holding my head up. I used to hold my head low because of my acne. Its really inproved my skin
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	4/12/2009 5:17:48 AM	I have been suffering with mild-moderate acne/blemishes for over 7 years now. I did notice that it becomes worse with makeup, so the best advice I can give would be to make sure its non-comodegenic (specifically talc-free--Physicians Formula is really good) or dont use anything at all--the acne flare ups are not worth it! It seems that my acne has gotten worse as I got older, for some reason, but the blackheads on my nose that I've had since I was 11-12 just dont seem to go away! I have tried absolutely everything from the drugstore, which is like 30+ products--only to be discouraged in the end. I've also tried a prescription; a combination of benzoyl peroxide and erythromacin--but that didnt work either, just left my skin burned and irritated. I havent used this to the recomended length (6-12 weeks) yet, but they were defintely right about it getting worse before better--was hoping that wouldnt be the case. But this definetly works better than my presciption and doesnt irritate the skin as much and doesnt flake or burn; but that was after learning the hard way; WAIT AT LEAST 20 MIN AFTER WASHING YOUR FACE BEFORE APPLYING, the skin has to be as dry as possible. Someone mentioned using it with a benzoyl peroxide face wash for better results; I'm currently using Cetaphil for combination skin, which I absolutly recommend because its extremely gentle and doubles as a makeup remover. Seems to be less irritating, so hopefully...after all those years, the results will be positive =)))
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	4/1/2009 2:25:00 AM	I have been using this medication off and on to help with my acne for almost two years, as part of several different skin care regimens. It is not a miracle-worker in and of itself, but can work very well when used in conjunction with other products. For me, it did a good job healing my acne and fading the scars, but did not do much to prevent acne forming in the first place. I would recommend it as one component of a skin-care regimen, but not on its own. 
Other	wvgal, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/10/2009 8:59:09 PM	I have rosacea and this works great on the bumps. I ran out and didn't use it for a couple of months and I realized how good it had been working and started back. In in addition it prevents my break outs before I start each month
Acne	Jess, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/16/2009 9:00:54 PM	I do recall the dryness when I began using this but, the dryness faded and gave way to a &quot;new&quot; me.  I use this in combination with a Benzoyl Peroxide wash and it works amazingly.  I never had acne as a teen but, since I have had children I do.  I am thrilled at the results from this product and anything that might help to prevent wrinkles is ok by me too!
Other	anne, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	65-74	12/16/2008 10:25:28 PM	Have had a reaction of a dry area. Perhaps I applied too much of the cream

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	4/22/2008 12:39:57 PM	I have discolored pigmentation around my chin area, after a few weeks i noticed color was coming back !! but i also noticed that if i skip a day or forget to put cream on, my skin drys out and turns red..hurts like a burn.. overall it works ...be very careful
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	13-18	12/17/2007 6:46:01 PM	This has worked for me but if I dont use it for a day or two, my skin begins to flake and hurt, and when i use it, it seems to be a relief. As if im addicted to it. Although it cleared up ALL of my acne, this is the only thing that seemed to work. One time i used the clean and clear acne control cleanser [the first out of three steps of the package.] because i didnt have any more of my usual neutrogena oil free wash, then i waited for my skin to dry like normal. and it burns really bad. it turned my skin red and flaky and irritated for 3 days. Tretinoin cream works for me, just be very careful with it
