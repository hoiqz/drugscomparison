Those feelings got better but still I was always aware that the ring was there, slightly uncomfortable. After Inserting the second ring, I started having bleeding after sexual intercourse and had a very disturbing discharge. I finally went to the doctor and was given clindamycin to treat a vaginal bacterial infection.  I was told that the Femring had caused erosion in my vaginal wall and it was removed immediately.  the dosage was too high for me and the ring was too big for me....   I have been given vaginal cream now to help with the dryness.  hopefully, this works.   I loved that the Femring gave me sexual pleasure again but understand that every person is different and in the end, it did not work for me.

I tried everything but until I discovered the Femring, there were no answers!  I had hot flashes, dry vagina (sex was miserable) and I always felt &quot;off.&quot;  Once I discovered the Femring and started using it, everything changed.  No more hot flashes, sex is incredibly fun again...I'm 55 years old and I have the sex drive I had at 25.  I am thrilled with the results; I have an active sex life; my boyfriend says that he can feel the ring occasionally but never enough to bother him and I never know it's in, except that intercourse is never uncomfortable anymore!  Greatest thing ever invented!

I have been on Femring 0.5 mg. for 4 months.  I just removed the Femring because I am breaking out all over my chin and feel very nervous - almost, but not quite like drinking too much coffee.  I think I'll go back to the lowest strength patch and figure out some way to keep it from falling off.

It has helped with my vagnial dryness and it has worked wonders for the my hot flashes. I really like using the Femring Treatment.

This past month, I developed intermittent abdominal, low back, and side pain with occasional vaginal discharge; escalated into chronic abdominal pain with fever, chills, nausea, and skin rash, with constant discharge. I removed and discarded the fem ring. Pain, fever, and chills quickly subsided; discharge decreased. White blood cell count had escalated. Apparently, my body was rejecting the ring as it was trying to embed itself. My gynecologist has prescribed an antibiotic suppository treatment for infection. It has been four days since I removed the ring; I have been on the antiobiotic for only one night, and have not experienced the low back, side, and abdominal pain as before removing it.

Within days my hot flashes disappeared. It took about three weeks for the depression to go away. It's been relatively easy to use but don't have anything to compare it to since it's my first experience with HRT. There have been a couple of occasions when I was constipated and strained bowl movements caused the ring to almost slip out. (I now always check before flushing.)Frequent external vaginal yeast infections have been uncomfortable but I didn't link it to the ring until just recently; the informational sheet provided by the pharmacy lists it as a possible side effect.  A replacement ring is due in a few days and I'll be tracking the frequency of my yeast infections.  The infections seem to happen every couple of weeks and are controlled with external over-the-counter yeast infection treatments.

Am now 58. Libido is stronger than ever, and vaginal dryness is non-existent, especially during intercourse. Enjoy an excellent sex life, including oral. The ring does not interfere with penetration, nor does my partner notice the ring. Only two minor cons: Nothing has ever helped with occasional hot flushes, including the ring; on two occasions in the past several months, after my partner has removed himself, the ring came out with him. My guess is that this may be due to the increased amount of moisture in the vagina.

Within 2 weeks of being on the ring I had a menstral that lasted 4 days. I had not had one of those in years, but I got through. I have also experienced some shoulder pain which is minor. I have been unable to sleep for the last 4 years and now I can sleep like a normal person. I know it's only been a month but it is working for me. No hot flashes at all at any point of the day. I haven't had any problems with having sex while having the ring inside. I am 37 and have a long hall ahead of me with hormone replacements. So far so good!

I started out at the highest dosage, but have since cut back to the lowest dosage.  No problems, I love this product, but it is pricey. I have RX insurance but stills have to pay 50.00 every three months.  I am 61 years old.

After just a day of wearing it, I had to take it out because it was so uncomfortable. I was always aware it was there. I wish it had been more comfortable because other than that, I really liked how it worked for me, better than oral meds and skin patches.
Other	VeryHappyFemRingUser, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/20/2009 7:57:07 PM	@39yo (1990)had hysterectomy retaining ovaries. 1yr later,blood test confirmed I was in menopause(trama to ovaries during surgery,often a side effect triggering menopause). Started oral Rx (premarin low dose). About 1995,dropped oral Rx &amp; moved to FemRing(after unsatisfactory trial of Estrace cream (cream worked but was messy).I have LOVED FemRing! Husband &amp; I enjoy oral sex and vaginal penatration sex without problem. Retaining it in place is good reminder to practice daily Kegal exercises. It maintains good vaginal moistness and I only had one yeast infection in all these yeears, due to taking Amoxicillin for sinus infection(won't do that again!).Seems to help maintain a healthy PH of my vagina with comfortable moistness. I was just told @ Sept 09 yrly GYN that I need to switch in another yr or two to the 'cream' inserted by application tube,since I am approaching 60yo and have been on HRT replacement long enough.I am not looking forward to the 'messy' cream discharge,etc. to continue to maintain comfort to the vaginal walls. I have no cancer history on either side of my family. I get yearly mammo's - always negetive and do self breast exams (in the shower during soapy breast washing)besides monthly or so in the bed.

My doctor finally made me stop it due to risk of breast cancer which runs in my family. I have been told by a breast surgeon that my age alone makes my chances of breast cancer more risky than the Femring.  However, I want to get back on it because my quality of life right now is more important to me. Having a wonderful sexual relationship with my partner is something I enjoy.
Other	hotmama,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female		5/19/2009 1:57:32 PM	I am 43 years old and had a total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago and have tried just about everything on the market, including bioidentical compounded creams and nothing helped.  Pills cause horrible mood swings and I have fluctuations on the patches and they do not last the time they are supposed to.  Fluctuations were horrible with hormone injections.  The Femring is the only thing that has helped me have any normal quality of life.  The .1 was much too much and made me feel sick but the .05 is just right.  The only problem is that my symptoms come back at about the 7-8 week mark.  The ring costs me a fortune but I will sacrifice it to feel good again after all these years of hell.  For the person who said their levels were very high, what dose were you on?

Finally went to a doc that measured my hormone levels.  Found my estrogen was 10 times the norm (600mg as opposed to &quot;normal&quot; 66mg).  With a familial history of breast cancer on both sides (yes, even my father got breast cancer) I was appalled that no one had suggested a quantitative measurement before this.  So, that's my suggestion to you all.... get lab work done regularly to ameliorate any chance of an estrogen driven cancer being whipped into a frenzy by insanely high levels when not monitored.

Within an hour of inserting the vaginal dryness was gone. I've not experienced any of the side effects and not having to take a pill on a daily basis is a big plus.

My doctor recommended this as an alternative. It helped with both, however it did not get rid of them. I also experienced additional sweating along the front of my neck, even though it was not the typical &quot;flash&quot;.  I never knew when the sweat would start and once it started, it would run down the front and back, into my bra, etc.  Night sweats also began getting worse.  The overall worse part for me was putting it in and taking it out.  I managed to get it in, but embarrassingly, I had to go to my doctor to get it out.  I can't be bothered with that for the future.  I'm going back to pills, but trying something other than premarin.

I tried it for 3 weeks - it gave me an infection and disrupted my sex life terribly as my partner &amp; I both enjoy oral sex.  If it works for you &amp; you don't engage in oral sex I could see it being a good product - but it gives you something I didn't think about before hand.

I never had children so things are small down there.  Most of the time.. no problem but before sex I have to take it out and remember to put it back later.   If I don't take it out then climax causes muscle contractions that cause the thing to abrade the inside and make me bleed.  A LOT.   Taking it out works but there is no information from the company that I can find to tell me wether or not this might impact it's effectiveness.  (I wonder because since I have been doing this some mild hot flashes have come back even though I do put it right back hours later.)    I realize that a woman my age that has never been pregnant is a relative rarity but we do exist and it would be nice if there were smaller rings.  I am told by my doctor who diagnosed this problem that if they made all of them smaller they would have a problem of falling out.    One size does not fit all though.     Otherwise this is the perfect solution.  It works,  You only have to remember to change it every 3 months and otherwise you have to give it no thought.  As you get older you end up taking more pills and you worry about impact on your kidneys, liver, etc.. from all of them.  This is one less thing to swallow and that has to be a good thing.
