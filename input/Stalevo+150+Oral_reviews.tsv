I had to increase the dosage from 3X daily to 5X daily. I was in constant pain and stiffness,since increasing dosage, I feel much pain free and more mobile. Hope I can  keep taking this dosage.

Q4h is an annoying schedule, but tolerable.

Dr. says stop. Wife says no worried husband will have ca.   Will stalev 150 mg get him by until we can get to another Dr.?  Has tried stalevo before,found sinemet was a better choice. Since my husband has been on sinemet for years it doesn't seem to help much.
