Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	shannonbz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/6/2012 12:55:47 PM	I am 42 and have two kids.  I was having very heavy and long periods.  I did have polyps removed and mirena was recommended by Obgyn.  The 1st period was about the same then the 2nd was shorter and lighter only about 4 days.  This has continued hoping they will stop all the way but happy with this result.  I feel so much better.  No side effects at all for me.

Birth Control	barrones, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	8/3/2012 5:51:46 PM	I decided to get Mirena after the birth of my son in November 2012. It did not hurt to get placed,but the was a long month and half of bleeding(heavy to light). Then I started to notice that my hair started coming out when I combed it. 71/2 months later the only side effects is that my hair is still coming out.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/31/2012 9:26:31 PM	I was had the mirena placed after being on the pill for about a year and a half and I loved it! No periods, no acne and no headaches/migraines... Unfortunately the only side effect I had was hair loss. In 7 months I had lost half of my hair, it didn't want to curl any longer and the volume was gone. Had it taken out and it's been 2 months and my hair is starting to come back

I  experienced so much pain when I had my Mirena inserted, then my periods stopped for 6 months, then came back with a vengeance. During the time I had my Mirena I experienced problems with cysts on my ovaries multiple times. Finally during my 13th month I started bleeding so bad my doctor had to remove my Mirena. I couldn't have that done again between the pain and the bleeding problems that was enough for me. I'll take a pill everyday.

I cramped horribly when they put it in and the cramping didn't stop for 3 months!! It was hell putting it in the first time because of the clamp that put on my cervix! Also, I'm 5'11 and weighed 135 lbs, now, almost a year and a half later I'm up to 150lbs and I haven't changed my diet or anything. I worked out all the time and still gained an incredible amount of weight, even with cutting out sugar. I think it's the progesterone because it's linked to weight gain. Anyways, I'm considering getting it out and switching to just birth control pills after only 1 year with it in because it's had more bad side effects than I want even though it's incredibly convenient and has led to more spontaneous sex. Do your research before you try it!
Birth Control	Happy Mirena User, 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		25-34	7/25/2012 3:35:20 PM	I love this form of birth control!  I am almost three years into my first device.  I have never had children, so the insertion process was painful, and the cramping lasted for several hours after insertion.  But those were the last cramps I have felt in the past 3 yrs.  Since middle school, I have had severe menstrual cramping that put me out of commission for at least one day a month.  This has meant having to using sick time, laying in bed during vacations, spending hours in the bathroom, etc.  I am 34 now, and the Mirena has completely changed this part of my life; I am so thankful.  I have never experienced weight gain, extra hair growth, acne, etc., as a result of this form of birth control.  All of these things I deal with regularly, and there was no change for me once I began using the Mirena.  Peace of mind knowing that I don't have to worry about remembering to take a pill or change something on a monthly basis is priceless!  I have about 10 girlfriends/family members/co-workers who also use the Mirena.  All are as satisfied as I am.  There are many complaints here about side affects.  None of the women I know who use it complain about any side affects. In fact, it is usually the opposite.
Birth Control	Middle aged momma, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/20/2012 7:27:46 AM	I have used this product for 15 years. Had the first one inserted after the birth of my 3rd (and final) child. Initial insertion painful and lots of bleeding but that was temporary and could have been impacted by only being 3 months after her birth. Devices 2 &amp; 3 no pain no bleeding. Relatively no periods in 14 years - no acne - about 10 lbs weight gain - minimal hair loss - until now. I am now 46 yrs. old and hair loss is really bad. Weight gain has been another 10 lbs in last 2 years, sex drive is none exsistent, and not sure where my body is regarding menopause. My hope is that removing the minera will fix it all. (my fear is it will not and I'll end up 50 and pregnant) I have loved this product, but sadly - I think I have reached the point where the side effects outweigh the benefit. It's time to find something else (sigh). 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	7/20/2012 12:28:22 AM	I had my Mirena put in almost a month ago. I'm 22 and haven't had any children. My doctor recommended I get it because I am anemic and she was concerned that I was losing too much blood during my periods. Surprisingly, when it was put in I wasn't in much more pain than my normal cramps during my period. But when the time came for my period to start 2 weeks later I started getting terrible cramps. Normally either a Midol or a heating pad would work to stop the pain, but even with both I was in so much pain that it was hard to get out of bed. I decided to look it up on the internet to see if that was normal and I came across a couple discussions similar to this one. It's a relief to know that the side effects I'm experiencing aren't all in my head. I've noticed terrible cramping, non-stop bleeding (lighter flow though), no motivation/extreme fatigue, depression... I have not ran into acne or weight gain but I'm worried that it'll only be a matter of time. I know everyone's body reacts differently and it may take a while to truly know how my body will adjust to the Mirena, but after reading others' experiences, I can't help but want the thing out... now! I suppose it's serving the purpose my doctor and I set out for by lightening my periods, but at what cost?
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	7/19/2012 2:40:40 PM	I have had Mirena for 6yrs &amp; although very effective in the birth control department, I can not wait to have it removed. Horrible embarrassing Breakouts/Acne its a daily battle. Nothing Helps. I have hot flashes @ 30Yrs old and my hair is falling out so much I use drano regularly to unclog bathroom drains. My period is almost non existent which is a blessing but I think it also has its flaws I am very emotional and lately extremely  depressed. No pain during insertion very happy with not worrying about birth control but I cannot handle the side effects any longer.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods		3	3	3			7/18/2012 2:45:04 PM	I received the Mirena 10/10 for heavy periods, and severe emotional behaviors. I could not take hormonal contraceptives because of my history of severe (daily prescription drug treated) migraines and my cycle was beginning to be unbearable. My last child was born in 07 and in 09 I began having reoccurrent bacteria vaginosis problems (consistently). Since the mirena, my labibdo remains high, no weight gain, migraines haven't increased, periods are much lighter, OH but there is a big BUT!!! Since 10/10 I will have what appears to be periods for at least 3 to 10 days twice a month and most of the time without any warning. Now the procedure was 20 mins but it was guided ultrasound, it felt a little bit more uncomfortable then a pap, holding my inhaling and exhaling when my doc told me to helped. Its something one has to weigh their pros and cons and the reasoning for using this device. I will say that I am exploring other another option that does not involve the use of any non/hormonal drugs,or insertions of devices. I am either going to keep the Mirena or go the surgical route.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/18/2012 12:29:00 AM	I am a mom of 2 girls ages 4 and 18 months. Just had my Mirena inserted today.  I was really worried after reading all of the reviews on here. It was not one bit painful.  It did not feel any different than my regular annual exam. My doctor was great and talked me through every step. At the begining of my my appointment I told him I was worried about pain.  He told me that if it was too painful we could just stop and come up with a new plan. Luckily it did not hurt and was very fast.  He then showed me how to check my strings. He gave me a chart to track my cycles for the next few months.  I have not had any pain or cramping at all.  I did have a little tiny bit of spotting, but I have been spotting on and off for the past week so that might not have to do with the Mirena any way. So far so good. I just hope I can ease some fears for others. If I get any adverse reactions, I will definately update my post.

Very effective method of birth control, but mood swings and depression have been a big deal for me the last five years of my life.

When I got it in it was like a little pinch, then some mild cramping that day. Would bleed some maybe for a month or so and then periods were lighter and ligher, only needed a liner for years and now no more periods. Yay! Not having to think about birth control is great.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	3N'sinMA, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/16/2012 11:13:38 AM	I was so nervous getting the Mirena due to all the negative reviews and I have been so sensitive to birth control pills; gaining weight; acne etc. in the past it was only in desperation I decided to take the plunge and go on the Mirena and I am so glad I did. My period was getting so heavy over the past year I became iron deficient, therefore loosing my hair and getting bald spots and lethargic every month not to mention running to the bathroom every 2 hours to change my tampon and pad from bleeding so much.  Insertion of the IUD was a little painful and spotting for a 2 days after then nothing. My periods so far are great; light bleeding and spotting and thats it. I wish I've done this sooner. Plus my sex drive had increased since being on it my husband loves it too. I can't praise the Mirena enough for giving back my life. Not everyone is the same of course but I just wanted to tell a positive story instead of adding to all the negative reviews that almost scared me away from getting the Mirena and almost missing my chance of getting my life back.
Birth Control	Meagan Taylor, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/14/2012 1:47:55 AM	I had the merina inserted today, July 13, 2012. It was extremely painful for me. I cried the whole time. My blood pressure was at 108 before we started &amp; after it was at 136. I was terribly nervous at first, I wish I would of listened to myself. I want it out, I still feel a pain inside. They say in the brochure that if pain persists after 30 min. consult your physisian. I am scared of the pain of it coming out, its shape, they are going to have to do more than just pull it out. My vigina is extremely swollen inside- its not a soft swollen either, it is hard. I am so scared! also I took a bath when I got home &amp; there was a dime size thing that came out, it is not a clot, it is tough like a muscle or something. I am going to go to the hospital tomorrow if I still feel this pain. I am a petite person &amp; my cervix is off to the side, so I am guessing by reading the comments this may be the reason I am having this big of a problem. :(

I spotted lightly for an few minutes other than that no cramping or heavy bleeding i hope it stays this way.
Birth Control	25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3		25-34	7/11/2012 4:40:11 PM	This is my second time getting Mirena. The first time was about 4 years ago and I had to take it out after the first couple of months because I had every single side effect. I decided to get it done again because I kept forgetting to take my pill every day. I had cramping from the very moment the doctor put it in and the cramping didn't go away for about 2 weeks. I still bleed from time to time and it doesn't last more than a couple days. I'm just waiting for more side effects to come, it's been about 2 months now and I'm satisfied this time around. I like that I don't have to worry about taking it every day, never mind every month.

Caused a perforated uterus and needed $15k surgery to remove.  Bayer is claiming this is a known risk.  I don't think people understand the true risks.

Birth Control	almichellea, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	6/25/2012 7:55:40 PM	I'm an almost 22 year old female- no children. I had my Mirena placed Friday morning, it is now Monday afternoon. During placement I had intense cramping... Nothing I would like to experience again soon but definitely something that is tolerable. I have had very painful to mild cramping since placement... Ibuprofen helps! I have some back pain and am tired but I had started my placebo pill week the day before I came in for placement so I know that I am on my period now. I have pretty heavy bleeding and mood swings like I typically do with my period. Hoping the cramping will lighten up by the end of the week... So far very happy although I am very uncomfortable.Well update if things change! Two friends(my age and also no children) are very happy with their Mirena's. One had pretty heavy bleeding for 3 months after placement- but she had an abortion a few weeks prior and bleeding is mostly due to abortion. The other had cramping and spotting- but no period since. I am a little discouraged reading about all these early twenty with no children reporting they had to have theirs taken out due to complications... staying hopeful!Good Luck!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	6/25/2012 11:45:26 AM	I had the Mirena removed 10 days ago after 7 months on it - and I'm sooo relieved. It was highly recommended to me by my best friend as well as my gynecologist both of whom are on their 2nd device. Unfortunately, I hated it. Reasons: 1. Worst skin of my life,I started getting one zit after another about 2 months into it after never having had problems with acne before (I'm 35). The skin was terribly greasy all the time and my face also looked puffy. 2. Facial hair growth (noticeable mustache and peach fuzz around my chin). 3. Bristly, extremely fast growing hair under my arms, in pubic area and on my legs. I went back on Nuvaring, which I'd used for 4 years prior to the Mirena and can highly recommend, and thank God after 10 days I look like myself again - skin and hair are back to normal. Unfortunately, the ugly discolorations from the zits are still there but fading thanks to Origins Dr. Weil Mega Bright Serum. From what I've read online, I believe my symptoms were due to excess androgen levels caused by the progestin-only hormone used in the Mirena. Personally, I will not recommend the Mirena to anyone. 
Birth Control	Jennifer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	35-44	6/24/2012 9:41:00 PM	I had mirena inserted after the c-section birth of my twins. I also had a vaginal delivery of my older son 3 1/2 yrs prior. I have had mirena in for over a year. So the good news is I'm not pregnant. So it works. But it's complicAted. Insertion was pretty painless but I started bleeding heavily on the way out of the office. Proceeded to have a heavy period for 3 months but could not use a tampon as I was breastfeeding therefore very dry vaginally. I proceeded to have random spotting every day for 8 months and still randomly spot. Everything is random and extreme now. I get a period every 3 months or so, and though I never need anything more than a reg tampon it can last two weeks. The only reason I can give for this is I breastfed my twins through one yr and still do am/pm. Breastfeeding thins the uterine lining as does mirena. So nothing can accumulate in there. It just falls out. Gross. Wish I got my tubes tied. Will be interesting g to see if things even out when I stop breastfeeding entirely.
Birth Control	NayPar84, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/24/2012 5:48:03 PM	So far I have seen that everyone who has never had kids had terrible experiences with Mirena. I have 2 kids and got the Mirena 6 weeks after I vaginally delivered my second child. I felt very moderate cramping while she was inserting it. After insertion, I had my cycle for about 3 or 4 days then it stopped. Since I have had Mirena, I have not had any complications, from time to time my husband will feel it, but that depends on the position. My periods are almost obselete. I have one 2-3 times a year and when I do, I spot lightly and it only lasts off and on for 3-4 days. I love my Mirena. I am still on the fence about getting a new one inserted, I want another kid and then I don't.
Birth Control		5	5	4			6/21/2012 2:48:32 AM	I got the Mirena over a year after my son who I had vaginally and it was the worst pain in my life. I couldn't even get up after. I laid there for at least ten minutes sobbing before attempting to stand up. My Gyno had a hard time placing it and said it's because I have a tilted Uterus and why it was so painful for me. Since then I stopped my heavy periods and spot sometimes. I cramp often on certain sides of my stomach and after sex. I've had it for over 3 years now. My boyfriend loves it and never felt it before. I really do love it but once my time is up I'm not getting it placed again because i'm too scared to go through that pain again and I have a high pain tolerance. 
Birth Control	ARK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/20/2012 12:12:21 AM	I'm 30 and have one child via a c-section. All these reviews almost talked me out of getting mirena, but I am so glad I did get it. Insertion was a little painful but no worse than really bad cramps. I had very light bleeding for a couple of days. The next month I had a light period for a little over a week and nothing since. It's been 3 months and I'm totally happy with mirena! 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	jevausie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	6/18/2012 4:50:56 PM	If you are considering Mirena, do NOT be scared off by negative reviews! Read on for details, but I certainly don't think there's remotely enough pain involved to avoid this device, at least not if you have a competent doctor!I'm almost 23, and - after extensive research - asked to be prescribed Mirena to treat my very irregular periods since suffering a second trimester miscarriage 2 years ago. The birth control aspect is a major plus. I had Mirena inserted almost 2 weeks ago, which is the only reason I only gave it 4 stars for effectiveness, as I haven't had it long enough yet to judge that.For those worried about the pain... don't be. Insertion was certainly not comfortable, but it was far from unbearable, at least for someone like me who has been pregnant in the past. For the record, I did not have any pain killers before or right after insertion, and it was performed 4 days into my cycle. Dilation of my cervix did not hurt one iota. The clamp used to pull the uterus into the proper position for insertion causes moderate cramping, so that wasn't too pleasant, but was not even as bad as period cramps. The only point where I felt even noteworthy pain was the brief &quot;pop&quot; when the insertion device made it around a bend in my uterus that had been causing the doctor trouble... that was a fairly sharp jolt of pain for a few seconds, but it wasn't tear-jerking or anything like that. As soon as the clamp, speculum, and inserter were removed, I felt nothing but very mild cramping which lasted one day and went away the second I took a Midol.I spotted very lightly (only a nickel-sized dot in a pantyliner every few hours) for the first week, and now only notice light traces of blood when I wipe. I have not had any pain related to the Mirena since. I cannot detect any side effects from the hormones. I can't feel the device at all, except for the strings if I check for them, and they're very unobtrusive. They even get softer with time.Mirena is great so far!

Birth Control	Jeanie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	35-44	6/15/2012 9:12:13 PM	Ihad Mirena inserted about 3 and a half months ago. I am 35, and I have not ever been pregnant. The insertion was uncomfortable, but I started having terrible cramping after about 10 minutes. These cramps lasted for about 4 or 5 hours. I lightly bleed almost all of the time now, and am hoping that this stops soon. In the time I have the Mirena, I have only had probably 2 or 3 weeks of not bleeding at all. If this continues, I will have it removed.

I never wanted it, but the 'alternative' she was spouting was getting my tubes tied - which is an an insane idea for a 24 year old. I agreed to insertion b/c I've always had heavy periods... BAD IDEA. It was inserted during my period about 6 months ago. Since the insertion, I've had a lot of trouble completely emptying my bladder (and have begun to leak), my genitals have swollen and itch and burn like the fires of hell, and my skin comes off when I wipe... Not to mention my mood swings make me dizzy. Apparently I'm having an allergic reaction - I'm getting it removed as soon as possible but there may be lasting effects. I HATE MIRENA.

Birth Control	Eng123, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/13/2012 5:13:35 PM	I got the mirena placed about three weeks ago!!!! It did cause some xrampin while being inserted but was nothing major and worth worrying about!!!! After the day I had no cramping but still experiance some spotting but the doctor said thats normal!!! My partner did feel it a couple times during intercourse but rarely is that a problem!!!! Overall its an excellent choice for birth control and I would recommend it!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/12/2012 3:51:59 AM	This did not hurt when having it inserted! My periods were very irregular for the first 3-4 months after. My only complaint....IT CAME OUT ON IT'S OWN after 3 years. I had no signs of infection and there was no explanation as to why it came out. I plan on having another on put in place. For me personally it was a great choice in birth control...2 kid's is enough for me ;) 
Birth Control	Dr. Heels, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/11/2012 2:30:08 AM	I got Mirena when I was 19 after I had my son and have had it for 5 years now. It is time for me to take it out and I am gladly getting a new one. My doctor put it in at my 6 week check up and it did hurt but it wasnt too bad. Afterward my body took some time to adjust but I ABSOLUTELY LOVED my outcome. My cycle had stopped completely! It may soud scary to some but for a person whos cycle was very long (7-10 days) and heavy (had to wear pads and tampons at the same time)I was more than happy. I did have occasional pelvic pain and my partner said he felt it alot during intercourse but other than that it's great! I have herd some horror stories but everyone is different. Based on my experience I would recommend it.
Birth Control	Jabasmo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/7/2012 4:59:54 PM	Alright...I don't know what everyone's deal with insertion is.  It didn't hurt AT ALL. I have a very very very low pain tolerance and I could barely feel anything. The dr did spray a numbing spray though. I also got it inserted at my six week appt after my baby was born. Initially I was going to do the paragard but after going over it with my dr, we decided mirena was best due to bad periods. I will say that I was extremely extremely uncomfortable for about five hours after insertion.  Horrible cramps. I was just thankful I am on maternity leave and didn't have to work after.   My advice  is to get some help that day if you have small kids.  
Birth Control	Lady, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/7/2012 2:40:10 PM	I had Mirena inserted 1 week ago and have not had any problems. After reading all the horror stories that people wrote I was having second thoughts about getting Mirena. Im glad I didn't listen and decided to go through with it. I did experience cramps after the procedure but not any pain and it only lasted that day. I only spotted for about 3 days. My experience has been a great one so far. 
Birth Control	Krissy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/7/2012 7:47:58 AM	Mirena was the perfect choice for me.  21 months ago at age 19, I had the device inserted.  I have never been pregnant, although if you have delivered children vaginally it does decrease the discomfort of insertion.  If you can schedule your appointment during your period, that helps a great deal, too, as your cervix is more pliable.  I had the quick procedure during my period and experienced a deep, cramp-like feeling during and then menstruation and cramps for about three more days.  Since then, my period has slowed so that I spot about three days every few months, and I have never experienced any sort of pain again.  Couldn't be more satisfied!
Birth Control	muffy_14, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	6/6/2012 3:35:18 AM	I am 22 years old, and never had kids. I had the Mirena inserted five weeks ago. The insertion was excruciating. I remained in a great deal of pain for 3 weeks.For two weeks the pain woke me up at night. By the fourth week I experienced bouts of extreme cramping. Crampiness continued into my fifth week checkup. As my doctor examined me, she realized I was in a great deal of pain as my fist clinched at my sides. She ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed that it was a bit twisted. I decided to have it removed that day. It turns out the IUD was twisted very awkwardly. The pain ceased immediately after removal.     
Birth Control	momof4, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/2/2012 10:01:19 AM	I wanted to comment on my experience with insertion because I have read so many &quot;horror stories&quot; and I thought someone should post if she had a good experience.I had mirena inserted at 2:10 yesterday afternoon.  I had just finished my period 2 days ago.  The appointment took 5 minutes and was painless.  My doctor talked me through every step of the process.  She did a pelvic check, used a local topical numbing agent (similar to what the dentist used before using the needle).  She told me to expect a cramp (never felt it) and then told my I would experience another cramp when the product was placed.  I asked her to tell me when she was placing it so that I could brace myself and she told me she already placed it.  I never felt a thing.  Afterwards, I had cramping for a couple of hours and spotted for the evening.  I woke up this morning and the cramping is gone and I am not spotting anymore.I should let you know that I have 4 children and all were delivered vaginally without any medication for pain.  Maybe that is why this was so simple for me.  I will let you know if I experience any side effects as time goes on.
Birth Control	 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		6/1/2012 7:28:30 PM	Hardly hurt at all, I think the &quot;pain&quot; has to do with one's pain tolerance. I've had two kids, and the Mirena was a perfect choice for me. The insertion was practically painless and I've had no complications at all. Very glad with my birth control decision.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Malia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/31/2012 8:25:18 AM	I got Mirena yesterday, insertion was not too bad, but after I got home for about 6 hours the cramping was horrible. It felt like I was having a miscarriage. The cramping has almost completely went away, only minor spotting that has stopped now. 
Birth Control	Jess, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/24/2012 10:50:43 PM	I have had my mirena in since Nov 2011. Whe it was inserted it wasnt any worse than a bad menstral cramp, and then it was over. Before I went back for my 1 month check up I could feel it move once in a while, but haven't felt anything since then. First couple periods were fairly heavy, but nothing out of the normal. Since then I might spot for 1-2 days every 2 months, but nothing else.Overall it has worked very well for me, and I don't have any complaints. And being a very busy mother of 3, this has been great.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	5/21/2012 8:35:11 AM	No previous pregnancies, intense pain/ cramping for about 2 minutes while being inserted and after that, just minor cramps for 3 hours. Taking Ibuprofen prior to insertion did not help.  Light spotting for first 5 days.

Other	monkeylove, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/17/2012 12:29:20 AM	I Just wanted to give my experience with the Mirena IUD. I am a very nervous person as it is and when my NP said that this would be a good option for me along with my mom I decided to go for it. First of all I have a LOW PAIN tolerance and am a big baby, but I did survive the insertion! The way it was inserted was over 3 total cramps the first one was mild and wasn't that bad, then the second cramp/part of the insertion was the most painful and I had to tell the doc to wait a moment for the 3rd cramp/part/insertion...after the second one you will probably want it done and over with so the third cramp was mild like the first. Overall the procedure was about ten minutes, very short!:) but it is painful like a cramp pain, and I did get a little light headed after the second cramp/part. Right after the procedure I was a little whoozey but was suprised with the fact i had NO cramping. Every body is different though but I even went to the gym the next day so far it has been a great experience and I do suggest it for women seeking an easy BC method. I hope this has been helpful and I hope this stays a positive experience. P.S. I have had little spotting as well. Also I have had no children. Women with children may experience less pain w/procedure. 
Birth Control	Me, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/16/2012 11:29:52 PM	I got the Mirena 6 days ago . Ever since I got it I have not stopped bleeding and have had bad stomach craps, back pain, nausea, and dizziness. I went to the doctor today to have it removed cuz I new my body wasn't adjusting to this birth control. When I got there right away the doctor is trying to make me feel guilty about removing it cuz it cost $850.00, but i was in so much pain I told her I'm sorry but I dont want it anymore. So when she goes to take it out it had moved down into the cervix and that's what has caused me pain. She then said that it was a good decision I came in. I knew something was wrong. I'm going to stick to pills. It was so painful when it was inserted the first time I thought I was going to faint. I'm not going through that again.
Birth Control	Mamamel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/15/2012 2:24:43 PM	Love, love, love, my mirena, I had it inserted in 2007 after my 3rd baby, it was uncomfortable.for a couple of days, I did have oeriods for first 2 years, very sporadic. I did have a few.cysts about 2 years in, but the benefits far outweigh the side effects. I have not had a period at all in the last few years, every now and then I will spot for a day or two (maybe every 6-8 months. It is time to have it replaced, I have been considering essure or paragard, but I love not having a period. FYI..Bayer/mirena offers a payment plan! Not a lot of people(even docs, mine didn't) know about this program, you make payments directly to mirena, then they send your device to your doc office with your name on it. All that you pay doc for is insertion!! The have a couple options, monthly and four payments. it is much more affordable this way, especially for those of us without ins.

Getting it wasn't bad. I went about 4 months before my body got used to it then all of a sudden periods went away its now may of 2012 and i have gotten a severe infection on my cervix, uterus, UTI, and cysts on my ovaries, also my string disappeared... severe pain during intercourse and I might have to have it surgically removed. The Mirena was great for me until this happened. I am worried this could affect me having a second child. I won't have it put back in. I guess for some women it works great as it did for me in the beginning... but for me now... NEVER again!!!
Birth Control	ljp, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/10/2012 12:49:33 AM	Wonderful experience! I have had mine for just over 5 years. It is officially time to have it removed and my doctor has reminded me that it is not adequate for birth control any longer. Based on my age and the fact I have no partner it would have to be an immaculate conception for me to get pregnant at this time. We believe I am probably post-menopausal but are not sure. I can leave it in longer if I want, I have had no spotting or periods since it was placed. I'm reluctant to have it removed for fear of having to start dealing with periods again. I think I want to test my hormone levels first to be sure that at least at that moment they appear to be p-m. I do recommend it for anyone with irregular, or heavy periods. My daughter got one shortly after I did and has only had mild spotting throughout her time on it. She had a little cramping  at time of insertion and still gets a little cramping now and then at her time of month but nothing like she used to. We both recommend it.
Birth Control	KaeBrae, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/7/2012 6:15:03 PM	I am SHOCKED to see so many horror stories!My Mirena was placed mid-Feb 2009 (over 3 years ago). I've had 2 kids (2007 &amp; 2009) by c-section...placement was uncomfortable, but not grossly painful and I was just a bit crampy the rest of the day, but I also only took Ibuprofen after my c-sections, no other pain meds (as a disclaimer for my pain tolerance). I have 3 days of spotting very month, without cramping. I check my threads every month and have no problem finding them. Mirena has in no way affected any aspect (mood, sex drive, ect) of my life negatively. I have a planned time frame for removal so we can have our 3rd and finally baby and after that I will have Mirena replaced until we make the decision about permanent birth control.  Hope this helps other women know that not everyone's expierence has been awful or scary!!

I am nineteen, gealthy and active. Insetrion was not bad but the year has beenvwry long with mirena. First off, my boyfriend is eight inches and always complains he feels the plastic hitting his penis. Sex has become incomfortable and some positions painful. Also prior to the iud I never had a single infection. This year I have had over seven (mostly bacterial vaginosis) now I am at risk for pelvic inflamamitory disease and am getting it removed. I would not recommend it.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/2/2012 5:36:24 PM	I got the Mirena IU 2 months after I had my son in 2007. I have had it in for 5 years now and today was the day I had to have it removed. I choose to insert a new Mirena IU. The pain was worse with the second time then the first, however, I also didn't take any pain medicine. I had no problems and honestly it wasn't that bad. I can have it in for another 5 years and I don't have to worry about anything. I have a check-up in one month to make sure everything is fine. My husband and I want to have another baby in about 2 years so we will take it out then. I still get my periods and they are light. I like the mirena because it doesn't stop you from having periods. I have always had my period every month. They were lighter and helped with cramps. I like this birth control because it still sheds the blood so it's not like for 5 years I have &quot;backed up&quot; blood. Sounds gross, but I wanted to make sure that wouldn't happen because I don't think its healthy NOT to have a period for almost 5 years. My doctor says I will most likely have cramps for a few days and that is normal. After a week they should be gone and have no pain. I LOVE it because now my husband and I don't have to worry and I don't have to stay up all night thinking, &quot;did I take my pill last night?&quot; 
Birth Control	adonal01, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	5/2/2012 12:18:19 PM	I had the IUD put in about 5 months after having my second child. The cramping and pain was so bad afterwards I was useless to my two kids the rest of the night. The following two weeks I had sharp flashes of pain that were bad enough to make me wince. My doctor had scheduled a standard four week check up after insertion of the IUD. In that appointment she could not find it. After the next two weeks of scheduled ultrasounds and x-rays they finally found it. According to the x-ray it embedded, as the Mirena website called it, leaving it sticking out of my uterus.  I then had to schedule an outpatient laparoscopic surgery for them to go in and take it out.  When they went in the Mirena was laying in my abdomen completely outside of my uterus and the hole it came through was already healed through.

Im young and want to be more active. I had horrible pain after getting it in but things got better after the first month. I found more I did in a day the worse id feel the next. I have been to the doctor multiply times for abdominal pain. I dont  like being touched anymore and im very moody. The pains I haave experience are to the point of my doctor recommendinng I go to ther E.R. I choose mirena bc im forgetful and cant remember  to take the pill and also cheaper in the long run, not mention it will last for 5yrs. I will be having it removed soon. The experience ive had in the last 6 months have not been what I  expected and I cannot deal with the constant pain fr another  4 yrs not to mention upsetting my fiance due to my mood swimgs and  not wanting to be touched. Im just not the same person annyone. Its changed my life. I hope all that choose to havve  mirena have a better experience than ivr had. 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/1/2012 9:28:49 PM	Just had Mirena put in this morning.  Was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews about the cramping and the pain of it being inserted. I think the best description of this for me was just uncomfortable. Nothing painful or that I couldn't handle. I did take a 600mg motrin about an hour before my appt. I haven't had any cramping or any other issues throughout the rest of the day. Hopefully the rest of my experience will be just as good.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	PeaSoup, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	5/1/2012 4:59:53 PM	I am 38, and have never given birth.  My doctor recommended Mirena for my long and heavy periods.  (My periods were 10-12 days long, and I would go through at least 2 boxes of super sized tampons.)  Honestly, the procedure itself was the worst pain I have ever felt, I almost passed out from it.  I was given a prescription for 800 mg ibuprofen to take during and after, it didn't help much.  The aftermath wasn't much better, I had moderate to severe cramping off and on for about a month afterwards.  I had light to moderate bleeding for 5 weeks afterwards.  I have now had Mirena for 10 weeks and I never thought I'd say it, but I love it.  I think I've had one period, but it was so light, I wasn't sure if I was spotting or what.  I haven't gained any weight (and I like to eat) and no complexion or personality changes like others have complained about. I don't know if it's relevant, but I didn't experience any of those side effects when I was on the pill many years ago either.So, in summary:  if you are considering this option and haven't given birth, see if you can get some kind of stronger pain med, and be patient with the cramps and bleeding afterward.  I have been very pleased and look forward to easier periods for the next 5 years!

Birth Control	Katrina, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	4/28/2012 8:10:59 AM	I choose this for birth control a year after I had my son. U don't like birth control pills and we were not ready for another baby. I had it the full five years and lived it as I had only spotting some months and other would go for several without having anything. When the time was up I had a new one inserted. It hurt worse than the first one taking it out then putting the new one in. A lot of cramping and soreness with this one that I did not have the first go. A year or so went by and I started having blood pressure problems, skin problems, and tiredness. Absolutely no sex drive!! My breasts got to where they always hurt! I talked to my doctored and they both said that the mirena wasn't the cause........ I wonder! I made me an appointment to have it removed and it came out the night before on its own!!! Also felt like I had to pee all the time!! Since its come out..... I have a general feeling of relief! It's hard to explain but I feel like me again. It's been two weeks and I'm hoping I can get off the blood pressure meds and get on with my life. It was a great option for me but I don't feel like the doctors were really honest about side effects! They ignored anything bad or negative about mirena!! Good luck ladies!!!!!
Birth Control	Cara, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/28/2012 5:48:07 AM	I've had my Mirena for almost 3 years now.. I do not recommend this method. My first year was great! My periods stopped, but then came the Cramping,depression,I can't stand to be touched hugged ect.. This IUD has really changed who I am.. Not to mention I was just diagnosed with Pelvic Inflammatory disease because my body is now rejecting it. I'm in constant pain. Intercourse is painful and I don't want it anymore. I cannot wait to have this thing removed, but fear that no other Birth Control is as affective as the IUD. I am in no means trying to scare anyone, just letting you know what my experience has been like. I am a mother of two.
Birth Control	NikkiMax, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	4/24/2012 8:23:23 PM	I got my Mirena placed 4 yrs ago, I was 25 and never had children, the implantation was uncomfortable and the cramping afterwards was severe. After the 1st 24hrs everything great, had very mild spotting maybe once every few month, never had any pregnancy scares, occasional breast tenderness, otherwise it was ok and didn't have any of the emotional side effects you get with BC pills.Unfortunately after the 1st year I started developing other side effect. I started getting very dark and thick facial hair, a small patch on my chin, then another, then the upper lip hair started getting darker. And I developed severe acne. Never had bad acne before, mild break-outs around my period, 1-2 deep cyst a year, nothing horrible, but now I have about 3 cysts a month plus multiple other breakouts. I was put on spironolactone, doxycycline, retin A, glycolic acid, etc, etc, etc, and nothing has worked - refuse to try Accutane due to the side effects. While I loved not having my period for 4 years and did not have to worry about taking pills or anything, the man hair and acne scars are too much now. I can't undo the damage that has been done. I have seen too many other women have this same problem so taking it out is my only option right now. I got it out today and a Paragard placed. Once again the insertion was very unpleasant and wouldn't recommend doing anything but lay around the day of and I have some mild spotting but I'm optimistic my skin will have a chance to heal. I'll post about my Paragard experience after the recommended 90 days to let my body acclimate. Hopefully my body will like this one better :-/ 
Birth Control	NatalieS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	4/17/2012 2:52:17 PM	I had my Mirena put in a week ago. I've never had kids so my cervix was not stretched. My doctor actually called it Ft. Knox. :) The insertion was very painful because of this. I would say extreme pain for 2-3 minutes. Once it was in and the clamp was removed, for the next 3 hours I had some bleeding and pretty significant cramps. Day 2 and 3 were good, with a steady course of ibuprofen. Day 4 had about an hour long bout of bad cramping but then fine afterwards. The remainder of the days I've had minor cramping, but have stayed on top of taking the ibuprofen religiously to make sure it doesn't get out of control. I've felt very tired over the past week and am not sure if it's from this or from a cold that I've had. Overall, things are going well, but ready to be off the ibuprofen and feeling normal. I was also really concerned about expulsion for the first 48 hours as it seems higher with kidless people. :) I checked my strings everyday and for those who are concerned about this, just because you can't feel them doesn't mean it's not there. Try repositioning and trying again or try again later. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/16/2012 2:59:26 PM	I gave birth to twins in December 2011 by C-section.  My first Mirena was inserted in March this year.  Insertion EXTREMELY painful, because my cervix never dilated, they had to dialate it in the office.  Once inserted, mild cramping for about 5 minutes.  My husband could feel the strings, so on my string check appt, instead of cutting strings, my GYN tucked them.  My husband hasn't felt them since.  Also, to reduce the side effect of spotting, my GYN gave me Loestrin birth control pills.  Took Loestrin for 10 days, and spotting has pretty much stopped.  All in all, I would recommend Mirena.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/15/2012 2:51:22 AM	I have had Mirena for the last 2.5 years and I love it. Yes the insertion hurt badly but I went home, took Midol, and went to sleep. The next day I was slightly sore but it was definately bearable. I have had a wonderful experience with it other than the insertion but overall it has been worth it. I plan to keep it in for the full 5 years and then think about my options then. But I would and have recomended it to my friends.

I have an extremely light period every few months but that's it! I have had no side effects. Def the best birth contol out there!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/12/2012 1:47:10 PM	I felt the need to post my experience as I almost didn't go through with Mirena after reading the reviews. I had it inserted on Monday. It was not the most comfortable experience, but it was not that bad. Intense cramping for about 2 minutes while being inserted and after that, just minor cramps for a few hours. Nothing that Motrin couldn't fix. When I woke up the next day, I was fine. No cramping, no spotting, nothing. I have not had any side effects. I have only had it in for a few days, but everything appears to be great. If I do get any side effects in the coming weeks, I will certainly update my post. I just wanted to share my experience because after reading most of the horrible reviews online, I was terrified! Every woman is different and you have to make the decision to have it inserted based on YOUR body, not other peoples reviews. 
Birth Control	thudson, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	4/1/2012 10:18:34 PM	i am looking forward to getting this device removed after 1.5 years.  i haven't felt myself for about a year and a half, I've been depressed, angry, on and off pain, 3 out of 4 weeks of spotting.  It's horrible.  I thought this would be a great way to avoid having to have a period, but it's not worth it...not to mention that I have to wear a light maxi pad almost all of the days of the month.  At least before mirena I knew I could go 3 weeks without any worry.  Not to mention that I experience quite a bit of pain before my period...seriously sharp unbearable pain.  It wasn't until Mirena that I started feeling despair and depression as well.  I kept chalking it up to lifes circumstances, or the weather.  But ever since Mirena, I cry at the drop of a hat, or feel sad over next to nothing.  This just isn't me.  I can't wait to be back to normal when I get this thing removed.

I am thinking seriously about having it removed, the side effects of never knowing and constantly having to carry tampons is so frustrating!!!!!!!!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	19-24	3/30/2012 1:15:44 AM	I got it about three months after giving birth to my first child and I wish someone would have warned me how painful it would be. I had intense cramping pain for about five hours after the initial insertion which eventually faded. My doctor checked me out a week later and I was told that everything was fine. I continued to get abdominal pain that would come and go, and the pain would differ in location (mainly left, right, front). I've had it for a year now and the pain is less then it use to be and usually comes right before I get my period (which is more like spotting than an actual period). I do have side effects: acne, weight gain, lowered sexdrive. And my poor husband gets bruises on his penis sometimes from it. I don't think I'll be having it for very much longer..

It did a good job on the birth control part, and my periods were not heavy, BUT they were light and never ended! Every month, I had my period for three weeks and one week without it. I also had a lot of pain when it was put in, but this was due to me never having children before.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/29/2012 9:41:03 PM	Iagave had mirena for over a year now and love it. I had mirena inserted 8 weeks after giving birth. The insertion was nothing to me. I did have spotting for the first 2 months but a panty liner was all I needed. After that my periods gradually stopped. My only complaint is that I have an annoying amount of the leukorrhea discharge lately but that may be from another prescription that I am on since I just recently started noticing it. Based on the reviews, it sounds like women who have had children before have been having better luck with it. It will continue to be my birth control of choice :)
Birth Control	marykate061989, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	3/25/2012 11:05:54 PM	I had Mirena inserted 5 years ago, a few months after the birth of my daughter. The insertion wasn't too bad. It felt like a severe menstrual cramp and lasted less than a minute. Afterwards, I had some cramping for about a day. I really liked the Mirena for awhile. Before pregnancy, I had experienced long and painful periods. The Mirena eventually stopped my periods all together. I enjoyed not having to think about birth control and not having a period. At this point, I would have recommended the Mirena. When I went to the OBGYN for a check-up two years after getting Mirena, the doctor could not see the strings. I had an ultrasound to confirm that the Mirena was still in my uterus. It was, but it had moved from where it was supposed to be. The doctor told me that it would still be effective although I could not check the strings. For the next three years, I worried constantly about this and about how the doctor would remove the Mirena when the five years were up. I went to my OBGYN four days ago to get the Mirena removed since I had it for five years this month. My doctor could not get it out during my normal exam. I was scheduled for a hysteroscopy, which I had two days ago. I took ibuprofen before I went in. The procedure was painful and lasted a little over five minutes. I had some cramping afterwards. I feel back to normal again today. I do not recommend Mirena because of my experience. I realize that not everyone has to go through this, but my experience was painful and very stressful. I have started Ortho Tricyclen Lo. I am so glad to have the Mirena out of me and I will never get it again.
Birth Control	Moon, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	3/25/2012 11:03:00 AM	Mirena is probably the best long term and reversible birth control method. No downtime, no weight gain problem for me. I no longer have to suffer a cramp during the first 4 hours of each period because I virtually have no period now. The only issue I had is the on and off light spotting that lasted for 4 months after inserting Mirena, hence I only gave it 4 stars in the Satisfaction category.
Birth Control	hailey , 25-34 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	4	4		25-34	3/21/2012 6:17:05 AM	I've had mirena for 5 years and just got another one inserted for another 5 years.I love it.insertion wa likeasuper intense cramp,but only lasted a minute. Bleeding was irregular for 6 months. But it started getting lighter and   less painful until it stopped completely or is virtually non exsistant. I would recommend it  everyone. I love not having periods anymore. And it works 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	jenn1006, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/19/2012 5:26:17 PM	I don't usually review products but i noticed a lot of reviews for mirena are negative.  so i thought i would let everyone know there are positive outcomes.  I got Mirena placed 4 weeks ago. had very light spotting for about 24 hours after placement and mild cramping.  The first 24 hours were nothing like my first 2 days of my normal periods, much easier.  I normally get large cyst like acne a couple of days before my period and these have completely cleared since the placement!  My skin is actually MUCH clearer.  I have had no cramping or spotting since the first 24 hours after placement.  Yesterday I had some very, very light spotting, breast tenderness, and mild cramping.  I was supposed to start my period 2 days ago.  As of today...nothing.  No spotting, tenderness, or cramping. I suppose i just had my first period after placement! Amazing!! I went from acne, 8+ days of heavy periods, extreme cramping, back aches, moodiness, etc. I can honestly say I feel better and have actually lost a couple of pounds since getting the mirena.  Just keep in mind everyone reacts differently.  There are those who are very greatful for Mirena. So far I have nothing negative to say.  I only gave 4 stars due to the fact I have only had it 4 weeks. So far best decision I have ever made absolutely life changing for me..

I can't fairly say there's a correlation because of too many overlaying factors.Disclaimer aside, my husband complained since insertion that he could feel the IUD during sex, so I had the strings cut shorter. We didn't have to worry about that problem, though, because my sex drive was so low (again, not saying there's a definite correlation). The IUD did embed itself and I had to see my gynecologist to get it removed (two general practitioners tried and failed), but it was painless and quick.The removal was 15 days ago. The first week I experienced spotting and then normal to heavy menstrual flow. On day seven, I began such severe bleeding/discharge that I couldn't go an hour without having an accident--even when I wore an overnight pad and a super absorbancy tampon. It's the sudden surge of the flow that makes the problem so uncontrollable. Nothing can absorb the huge globs fast enough to prevent them from traveling and ruining my clothes and my day several times over.I started a progestin pill two days ago (13 days after IUD removed) to control the discharge/flow. I am now dealing with less fluid and more globs. It's uncomfortable, frustrating, unpredictable... I have worked from home since Tuesday, when I had to deal with a junior-high moment in the middle of a 2 hour meeting, complete with a sweater tied around my waist during a humiliating exit. Not ok. I loved not having periods for 5 years, but after the removal and subsequent research, I can see many parallels with women's stories about side effects and experiences. I would never use an IUD again.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/15/2012 1:11:02 PM	Its been over a year since i have had it and i have not been dissapointed! The insertion process was not nice, at all (never have been pregnant), but it was fairly quick. I felt icky for about a week after. After 2 months of having it, i stopped having a period. It was weird to not have a period but now im used to it. The threads are in place and has been incredibly effective. I dont have to remember to take a pill, patch, or get a shot. I still get some symptoms of a period, every month (bloating, moodiness, water retention). Other than that, i've had no issues!! i love the iud!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	3/14/2012 6:35:07 PM	I have had mirena inserted 4 years ago after the birth of my first child. After giving birth to him, I was back to my pre-pregnancy weight. For the first few months after insertion, my period lasted 3 weeks out of the month and stayed irregular. I've lost so much hair, it was so bad that within a week, I could probably make a wig. After the cycles became regular I did notice the bleeding was much lighter than before, but my OB-GYN always had problems locating the strings. I also felt emotionally unstable, but I thought it was the baby blues. For the first 3 years, I gained about 10 pounds, not bad considering I was not all that active. From 2011 up until now I have put on an additional 15 pounds unexplainably. I am more active now than I have ever been (working out an hour a day, watching my diet), and I was only able to lose 5 pounds in 6 months. My weight constantly fluctuates, and I am almost always bloated. I also have hair in the weirdest places, like on my chin, my neck, and even around my nipples. My sex drive has decreased tremendously, and I am only 23 years old. With all of this being said, I am getting this evil thing out next week tuesday! I am hoping there are no problems getting it out, as my doctor said she has had many patients get surgery to have it removed, one patient in particular had mirena attach itself somewhere in her abdomen. While yes, this has done its job of preventing pregnancies (although I have also heard stories of it falling out during a heavy period and as a result, causing this person to become pregnant) and has helped my flow (it has become a lot lighter, although sometimes I have skipped months or have longer periods, which my doctor has told me was normal), I do not reccommend this to anyone who has had problems with other hormonal birth control. While everyone is different, I had a horrible experience with this and I can't wait to get it out!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Colipdx, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/13/2012 8:33:26 PM	I read tons of reviews of Mirena before finally taking the plunge. I had REALLY heavy periods after my period returned after having my second child. We had decided to stop having children and the IUD seemed like a good choice. I really wanted my periods gone and this seemed like the best solution on all fronts. I am VERY happy with my experience. I had it put in when my son with 10 months old after a V-BAC. I felt only very mild discomfort and had minimal cramping that night and tinges the next day. Very little spotting as well. My doctor had me come in as my period was ending, which is key to the minimal bleeding I believe. I am now at my first period post Mirena and I am THRILLED! I am basically only spotting, already. Amazing. Last month I had to use a super plus tampon each hour for two days and nights. Now I may only use two for the entire event! I feel so much better while on my period. I did have some period related acne briefly, and some intense carb/salt cravings. So happy I went this direction. I have not gained nor lost any weight and have kept a very close eye on it. I don't detect any change in libido either (higher if anything but with two children we are so tired it is hard to tell!)
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/13/2012 12:35:24 PM	I have had my Mirena IUD for 3 years now and still baby free :) The insertion was incredibly painful. The nurses did not tell me to take Ibuprofin ahead of time so I was in more pain than most. Once the cramping passed, I haven't had any more issues with my IUD. At my yearly check-ups my doctor checks the strings, and everything is fine. This method of birth control is so simple and effective. I will definitely get it again after my first baby.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/12/2012 10:59:22 PM	I found it to be the most effective birth control on the market . I had no problems with it  for the hole 5 years. I just had it removed and it was painless. I will be getting a new one in 2 days.
Birth Control	Stephanie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/12/2012 2:39:54 AM	I had Mirena inserted in March of 2011. The insertion was uncomfortable, but bearable. I had cramping afterwards for like an hour or two, but Motrin took care of that. I experienced light brownish discharge for about 4 weeks. After that, my period came super light every month. It never disappeared like I thought it would. In October of 2011, I felt the thread for the first time which alarmed me because I figured that if I hadn't felt it before, it meant that somehow it was not in its correct position anymore. Sure enough, a couple of days later I got a heavy period for about a week. After my period was done, the doctor pushed it back into place. I had an ultrasound and everything looked good. But after that I kept getting a period every month, and finally 2 days ago (March 2012) while taking a shower I felt the thread again. I gave it a light tug and out it came. I don't know if my doctor didn't put it in right, but now I am Mirena free. I plan on looking for other alternatives because the anxiety of not knowing whether the thing was in place or not was driving me insane. I believe it worked until October, but after that initial displacement, everything went downhill. From april to october i did not experience mood swings, or any PMS symptoms, except maybe some bloating. If it had stayed in place, I would have been happy with it, but it did not work for me. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/11/2012 10:34:16 PM	When deciding to get Mirena, most of the reviews I found were terrifying, or &quot;it works great, I love it&quot;. So I wanted to give a detailed review of my experience that has been uneventful so far (5 months post insertion), so other could know what to expect. I'm 26, no children. I had simple, incredibly regular periods that were average flow and short. For me, the insertion (during my period) was uncomfortable, but not unbearable. I bled lightly and cramped for about two weeks.     For the next two months, I spotted lightly constantly. I had never experienced spotting before and expected it to be light bleeding here and there, but it was a constant, thick brown discharge. Kind of gross, but a pantyliner was all that was needed. Also during this time, every few days I would all of a sudden get a serious cramp and would start bleeding. After about twenty minutes, it would just stop instantly. Sometimes I would be aware of a pokey feeling, although that may have been psychosomatic. During this time I feel like my moods got a little abnormal too, but not unbearably so.     After those first two months, I have experienced no cramping or bleeding between periods. At five months, I am still having periods. They are significantly lighter than before, but last longer (about 10 days, compared to 5 days before Mirena). My period &quot;side effects&quot; (PMS, cramping, etc) are also a little different than before. No worse, no better, just different.    The biggest drawback so far is that I have noticed a substantial impact on my libido. It was strong to start with, and it is still there, just... more towards the back of my mind than before maybe. The first couple of months I experienced difficulty with lubrication and reaching orgasm, which had never been problems before. I would say that in the last month that is starting to resolve itself and I feel like I've gotten my body back. I haven't experienced any weight gain, acne, hair loss, etc.
Birth Control	Angie028, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	3/11/2012 9:31:23 AM	My story started in August 2011.  I went to the eye doctor for a routine exam mainly wanting to get new glasses.  At the appointment some of the questions the doctor was asking I thought was a little strange but it was things that was happening to me and I was just ignoring the symptoms.  Losing my vision when bending over, dizziness, and headaches.  I started with the tests MRI (which was normal) Lumbar Punture (36) and blind spots in my field vision tests.  It was confirmed I had Pseudotumor Cerebri.  My next mission was to find out, why did this happen to me?  No doctor could tell me why so I started my own research.  I'm a CPhT at a hospital so I had alot of info at my fingertips.  I came across birth control and thought this could be a cause, since I had Mirena IUD inserted in October 2010.  All the literature on Mirena does not say anything about Pseudotumor Cereri but Norplant does.  They both have levonorgestrol as the active ingredient.  So I took this to the many doctors I was seeing at the time.  To my surprise no one wanted to hear what I was saying.  When I found out this info I made the appointment to have Mirena removed!  I am currently taking Diamox 1500 mg daily and it's been 5 months since having Mirena removed.  Other than the side effects from the Diamox (tingling sensations,ringing ears,tired all the time) I am getting better.  No one is going to tell me any different that Mirena was not the cause of Pseudotumor Cerebri.

I'm sure if works well for some women but know that these side effects are very real and are caused by the Mirena.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	3/9/2012 1:18:37 PM	OK for everyone who hasnt had a child do not get this. I went two days ago and was not nearly informed of the excruciating pain i was going to go through. I did not get any numbing or medicine and it was literally the most painful thing i have ever experienced and i have had a lot of procedures. it is day two and i am in pain all day still with horrible cramping. I wouldnt recommed this to anyone. hopefully it gets better but so far im miserable.
Birth Control	Micky, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	3/8/2012 7:51:27 PM	The insertion was incredibly painful. Had intermittent cramping and unpredictable bleeding for months. As someone else said, since I gained so much weight, was moody, had no sex drive and might or might not cramp and bleed, it worked GREAT as birth control. I could not get this thing out fast enough even though I really can't afford to go back on pills without insurance. It was that bad. 
Birth Control	crystala, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/8/2012 7:49:07 PM	R.I.P my Mirena :( I had it placed in 2005 when I still had good medical insurance and only had a $25 co-pay.  I have never been pregnant before, but the ob-gyn assured me that I was still a good candidate.  The worst part of the IUD was the insertion and the week or two following.  I was not given any type of pain reliever or numbing agent and forcing my cervix open was the most painful thing I've ever felt.  It was intense, sharp cramps, nothing like the light &quot;period cramps&quot; I was told to expect.  Once it was in it felt like the worst period cramps I'd ever had, X10.  I went home and took a lot of ibuprofen... and continued to do so off and on for the following two weeks.  I'm not sure if it's because I've never been pregnant or if it's that bad for everyone, but it was ugly.  Then came the bliss.  Once I adjusted to the foreign body in my uterus, I came to love my plastic &quot;T&quot; as it relieved me from the annoyance of a having period for 5 blissful years.  I had the occasional light cramping as if a period might be coming, but never had bleeding.  I saw slight pinkish tinge when I wiped a few times over the years but never a flow.  In April 2011, my Mirena's 5 year residency came to an end and I paid $110 to have it removed.  I desperately wanted to replace it with another, but my school district's insurance plan changed and I didn't have $1,400 to shell out... So I'm making do with the Camila pill.
Birth Control	SenoniMarie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	3/8/2012 12:04:45 AM	I got Mirena inserted about 2 years ago and for me the insertion part was not so bad bc my gyn numbed me up. I did experience a lot of cramping afterwards which had me laid up the rest of the day. Mirena is fantastic in terms of it does its job to protect you from pregnancy without thinking about taking something. For me, I've noticed an excessive weight gain which I cannot lose, my sex drive is non-existent and my partner and I are in our early 20s. I'm moody all the time and lazy and I do have irregular periods along with fluids which I'm pretty sure is abnormal bc who secretes that much? I certainly never did. I'm conflicted bc I like not remembering to take a pill or change my BC but at the same time my relationship is suffering plus it hurt getting it so I would hate to go through all that again. I would recommend it only bc everyone's body is different but I'm certainly going to speak with my PCP next month about all my issues with it.
Birth Control	GAtoNC, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/7/2012 10:47:48 AM	I am writing this as a follow-up to my review yesterday.  I had my second Mirena inserted just this morning- not bad AT ALL.  Evidently there is some kind of little device that holds your cervix in place (in addition to the speculum) while they insert the IUD, and I had some mild cramping whenever that was in place, but nothing that I would call truly painful.  The procedure probably took about 5 minutes.  I understand that women may react very differently, but in my opinion, the mild and short discomfort of having Mirena inserted is totally worth it, considering you don't have to worry about birth control for 5 whole years.  Hope that helps ease some peoples' fears!
Birth Control	GAtoNC, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/6/2012 4:13:33 PM	I had the Mirena inserted in 2007 when my first child was about 6 months old.  The procedure was mildly uncomfortable, but (for me) nothing incredibly painful as others have described.  I had some menstrual-like cramping that day but was able to go to work after my appointment.  I had spotting/light bleeding for about 3 months after insertion, and then, NO periods whatsoever until I had it removed in 2009 when we started trying to conceive again.  I was breastfeeding at the time of insertion, so that may have contributed to the absence of a period.  After removal, I had one normal period and became pregnant the following month with our second child.  I did not experience weight gain (I actually lost weight pretty easily when dieting/exercising) or any of the other horrible side effects that some have described, although there were 1-2 days per month that I would feel particulary crabby (I'm assuming this would have been my normal &quot;PMS-ing&quot; time if I had had a period).  Overall, I loved the Mirena, and I'm having my second one inserted tomorrow.  
Birth Control	Robyn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/6/2012 12:15:30 PM	I've had the mirena for almost 2 months now, I absolutely love it, the insertion wasn't too painful, about 10 minutes after though I had really bad cramping, it lasted a few hours that was it, the next day a little cramping just in the morning and that was it, I spotted about 3 wks not heavy at all, just wore pantiliners, still wear them everyday just in case, my husband could feel it the first time we had sex after I had it put in, sometimes I can feel the strings and sometimes not when I am checking it. I kind of did everything backwards after I got it inserted then I looked at the reviews I heard good and horror stories, I was thinking about having it removed but decided to wait and glad I did, everyones body reacts differently and I think pain wise it depends on your doctor. I have sooo much more energy then I did before my moodswings and crazy emotions from my other birthcontrol are gone, hope this helps everyone!!!

Acne that has scared my face, I never had skin problems previous to the Mirena. No sex drive and it is ruining my marriage along with my unexplained laziness and mood swings. Having sex has been painful but tolerable. Until 2 weeks ago and it was extremely painful followed by bleeding which I haven't done since my period stopped  3 months in. But this week was my last battle with this thing, extreme abdominal and lower back pain and I can not feel the strings. My husband also informed me that things didn't feel right down there when we had sex last week. I will have my mirena removed this week and my doctor will not talk me out of it like she did a year and half ago. I just pray it hasn't moved out of place or caused damage! 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	2/29/2012 10:14:07 AM	I had an allergic reaction to Mirena. Dizziness, nausea, lethargy, and forgetfulness. I had it in for 1 month and after 2 weeks the symptoms started. For the last 2 weeks they got progressively and scarily worse. I called the Doc yesterday and she brought me right in to have it removed. It's very rare for a reaction like this, but if you have any negative reactions to the drugs in the pill, you will most likely have the same reaction from Mirena. I know 2 women who love it, and 4 who have had it removed before 6 months from the side effects. Not great odds. 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	35-44	2/28/2012 8:38:58 PM	I experienced a lot of cramping after insertion. I experienced constant low-grade infection while wearing. I had gobbs of thick mucus exit my vagina after removal. I have urea plasma infection now, caused premature rupture of membranes in last pregnancy, constant infection problems!
Birth Control	sickandtired, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	2/27/2012 2:10:18 PM	I have had the IUD for 1 year and I loved it in the beginning because it stopped my monthly cycles all together.  I experienced slight pain when I had it inserted, but it didn't last long.  My problem has been weight gain and mood swings; I would have these prior to my cycles. Slowly I started gaining weight--I've done everything from Weight Watchers, exercising w/personal trainer, to diet pills and still has not done anything but GAINED weight!!  After trying everything, heard my friends bad experience, and read this site--I came to determine that it is the IUD that is causing me to NOT lose this weight.  I have an appointment scheduled in two days to have the MIRENA REMOVED.  I will be sure to update my progress once it has been removed!
Birth Control	Jeannie9979, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	2/26/2012 8:57:31 AM	I've had my IUD for almost 7 months. I have 3 children and we were on the fence about having another one in a few years. I'm awful about remembering to take daily medications and thought this was the way to go. The insertion of the IUD was easy, no discomfort or pain. It took around 10 minutes for it.  About 20 minutes after I had left my OB's office I began to have cramps, and heavy bleeding. Since I am breastfeeding my baby I had not had a period since he was born 4 months before, and the IUD made me have a 4 month long period that was all over the flow board. Some days it was heavy, and the next day I would be spotting. Once I had gotten past that first huge period its been wonderful. No issues with breastmilk supply, my son is 10 months old now and is primarily nursed, no formula.  My periods are irrgular, but that's not a big issue. I do have some night sweats, but I was having them before I had my IUD. Checking the strings is easy, they feel like fishing line so they are easy to locate. My sex drive is pretty low-level, but I believe my breastfeeding is the cause of that.  Overall its easier than taking a pill everyday, and my husband can't feel it when we have sex.  once I had gotten the first 4 months behind me it's been a breeze. So for me and my husband its been a good fit into our lives. He even 'helps'me check my strings, lol.
Birth Control	cmac, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	2/25/2012 10:59:50 PM	I have had a terrible experience with BC. I have been on 4 different types in one year. I would do great on the BC for about 3mo. And then i would start having my period in the middle of the month. I was on three pills and then nuva ring. I was only on that for one month because i knew that mirena was my best option. I was very worried for the insurtion becasue i have never had kids. It was painful but it only lasted a minute and then i had cramps for a few hours afterwords. (take ibvproven before)I didnt bleed very much but i still am having a regular period but it is very light that i don't even have to hardly use a tampon. It is frustrating still having my period each month but i love not having to think about BC. The only major side effect i have come across is depression only the week before i get my period. For me its a terrible week. I am a regular exerciser but during that time i have no ambition to do anything, workout, do house chores, and i react to everything, i am overly emotional. its like my normal PMS times ten. I have been waiting for these side effects to go away. Im going to ask my Dr. on my one year visit which is coming up in a few months. I will not take it out because i paid $800 out of pocket for it. I would recommend this to any woman who has a regular partner, my only suggestion would be to be aware of what you are getting yourself into. It is so hard to know how your body will respond. But it is a great way to prevent pregnancy. I have not had any weight gain. My acne is still bad even though i have derm face wash and lotion. I hardly ever have cramping and the best thing even though i get periods each month still is that they are so light. Would recommend to most.

Birth Control	acr2784, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	2/24/2012 11:25:00 AM	I have had the Mirena for six months. I always have back pain, cramps, and constantly feel bloated. If Mirena didn't cost me $1,400.00, I would have already taken it out.  My sister has had Mirena for 4 1/2 years and has worked wonders for her.  She has no problems. I thought it would work the same for me. Every person's body acts differently to Mirena, so it's hard to say how one would feel after having Mirena placed. My experience has not been good at all.  I also experienced pain when my doctor was placing Mirena in.  The nurse told me that I would not feel any pain. I felt a lot of pain! My doctor had a hard time putting it in place and tried more than 8 times before giving me a break to breath.  After my break, it took her twice to get it in.  I read that it might have been painful because I had a c-section and was not dilated as much. I can't wait to have this taken out of me!
Birth Control	fdaw, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/23/2012 1:18:15 PM	I have had Mirena for about a 2 months now.  I had a baby in November last year.  I was terrified to get it inserted and had myself very worked up and worried.  The procedure itself was not painful at all!  I had no cramping during or after.  But now I have been bleedng since i had it put in and it's pretty heavy.  I contacted my doctor and her nurse said to take Ibuprofen every 6 hours to see if that would help it stop. (that was 2 weeks ago)  It still hasn't yet.  And it is still pretty heavy.  I am actually waiting for her office to call me back now.  I'm a little worried that something is not right and I will have to have it removed, because other than this problem, I love it, and would recommend it to anyone.
Birth Control	nicole, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/22/2012 9:33:26 PM	I am a 23 yr old with no children, and when I started to date my long-time boyfriend I tried OrthoTryCyclen as a form of contraception and i hated it, I was angry all the time and I had no sex drive what so ever. I went to the Dr. to try something else that would be better for me. They put my on NuvaRing,after a while I lost all libedo, and I started bleeding a lot longer then i usually did. I started at a 2 week period and then it turned into 3 weeks, eventually i was bleeding non stop all month long. So i went back to the Dr. and they told me that I had only been on it for a few months and i needed to &quot;let my body get used to it.&quot; It was ruining my relationship with my boyfriend. The inside of my vagina was so sore and irritated that it hurt to have sex or even put in tampons. I decided to go to another Dr. and she told me to take out the ring immidiately. We talked about my options and at first I was hesitant about putting something foreign in my body, but after i researched every kind of birthcontrol there is, I decided that an IUD was best for me. My Dr. recomended Mirena over Paragard due to my heavy cramping and bleeding. I went that next week and got an appointment for a consultation at planned parenthood and the nurse and I determined that i was a good candidate. The Nurse wanted me to know the possible side effects before I had it inserted and it freaked me out, a lot, but it couldnt have been worse then what i was already going through, so i took the risk. That friday I got it inserted, it was really painful, but worth it. I had uncomfortable cramping for about an hour after the appointment, but i took a nap and woke up feeling much better. The next few days I had minor cramping but ibuprofin was enough to control the pain. My bleeding stopped after 2 or 3 days and i got my sex life back. I have had it in about a month now and i am very happy with it. I would recommend it to anyone as long as you do your research and know what is going on with your body. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/21/2012 5:23:46 PM	I wanted to discuss my experience bc before having Mirena inserted I searched the internet and saw mostly terrifying experiences.  I would recommend Mirena to ANYONE!  Insertion was slighly uncomfortable, but no worse than a large period cramp, spotting for about a week after that was intense along with cramps, but nothing that is unbearable (especially when you consider one week compared to 5 years of cramps!!!) and I am now into my 2nd month.  My period is very slight and no cramping.  I have totally forgotten it is even in there and love the freedom it's afforded.  I have had terrible weight gain with other forms of BC, so this was a large concern; so far no weight gain, no mood swings, no acne, no bad side effects at all!  My boyfriend cannot feel anything at all.  It was the best decision I've made about birth control.
Birth Control	Lemur, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/21/2012 8:56:37 AM	I am forty years old, I have a seven-year old daughter, and I just had Mirena inserted yesterday. I know it is early but after reading the boards I felt compelled to share my experience.  I read this board before getting Mirena and I was TERRIFIED.  I took ibuprofen beforehand, and when I saw the instruments on the table I thought I would pass out.  The entire procedure took less than ten minutes.  There was some cramping when the nurse swabbed my cervix and then when she inserted the IUD, but it was short-lived.For the rest of the day I waited for the pain, but it didn't come.  This morning I have had some dull aches, but nothing worse than period cramps.  The doctor recommended that I get it inserted while on my period, so I can't distinguish the bleeding and cramping from anything that doesn't happen during my regular period.I will post another time about any side effects I do or do not have.  In the meantime, I wanted to comfort those who may read this board.  Not every experience is bad.  So far, mine is fine; it was much easier than I anticipated. 
Birth Control	Jooooooswuck, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/21/2012 1:46:35 AM	I love Mirena! As a birth control I will never go back to any other form unless I absolutely HAVE to. I love not having to take a pill every day (since I'm ditzy and empty headed I don't really trust myself to do so), and I know that I don't wan't children anytime soon. I'm in a very committed relationship with my future husband and I currently have 0 children, aged 22. My Insurances covered the cost of the device and installation. I paid about $30.00 each visit to Planned Parenthood (The only place to around Delaware that would implant it). The Installation didn't hurt nearly as bad as I thought (or as bad as everyone online made it seem). It felt like a really bad pinchy cramp while they installed it but nothing that I couldn't tolerate with 800mg of just Ibuprofen in me. I've had ovarian cysts that hurt worse that having this implanted.The after cramps were pretty noticeable but to me it felt just like a regular heavy period of mine. I was able to still go shopping for hours after I had it implanted,and I was very nauseous but I found it worth it for Mirena. I had cramps for about a month, with slight bleeding but nothing too bad or nothing Ibuprofen couldn't handle. I didn't have sex for about three weeks after having it implanted but when I did, me and my fiance sore off condoms right away ;)It has now been a year and a half since I've had it implanted and I couldn't wish for a better birth control. I have almost no side effects (besides maybe sometimes a noticeable sightly smelly discharge right around the time of when my periods are supposed to start).As far as my periods go, I used to have really heavy VERY painful periods. Now I don't have any =)I spot when it's about time for my period is supposed to start, but it's so light that I barely notice it. (nothing a tiny little pad liner can't keep contained). I also cramp around that time as well. I would say my experience with Mirena is wonderful and I would get it again when my five years are up)
Birth Control	cowgirl, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	2/20/2012 2:10:41 PM	What a horrible birthcontrol to put out there.  If you never want children this is great... but I wanted to control when I would have my second child with ease.... well the mirena messed my left ovary up, causing two eptopic pregnancies and I am not sure if I will be able to concieve conventionally again.  I was irratible anxxious and very forgetful while using mirena. and I gained 20 pounds in a month...Do not use unless you absolutely don't want kids!!!!
Birth Control	boosarah1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/16/2012 11:03:51 PM	This is my second time using Mirena. I absolutely love it!! I don't have a period, no worrying about taking a pill everyday or going to the clinic for a shot. The only thing I didn't like about the Mirena was when it was inserted. I felt a lot of discomfort, spotted for a few days, and was a little bit bloated. My doctor gave me medicine to dilate my cervix and medicine for pain but I still felt the thing going in and it hurt. After the first few hours, I was back to doing laundry and going back to work the same day. I have had kids and I am not sure if I want more right now so this form of birth control is perfect for my busy life. I am not in a committed relationship so it was a bit difficult to find a doctor to give me the Mirena and I have had a previous ectopic pregnancy and I didn't want another one. I did the research and found that the possibility of me getting pregnant and getting an ectopic was higher off birth control than on the Mirena. I haven't had any side affects on it, just mild weight gain which I maintain by watching what I eat and when I eat. I just don't eat a whole box of cookies and I eat sensibly. I don't exercise much but my career isn't a desk job so I am on my feet a lot. I enjoy the Mirena and would recommend it to everyone. The other reviews found on here are rare because when I asked my doctor about them he said they don't happen very often. My hair is in tact, my periods are gone, my weight is fine, and my sex life hasn't changed. Mirena is a great birth control choice if you want something that isn't permanent that is long lasting and reversible that you don't have to worry about every day. It's awesome!! Good luck in whatever your choice is- and talk to your doctor. 
Other	ganae8, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	2/16/2012 7:28:15 PM	Hell is the first word that comes to mind when I hear the word Mirena. initially I liked it because it stopped my period and took the guess work out of taking a pill etc. about a year in I started getting panic attacks, heart palpatations never suffered it before. horrible insomnia, gained 30lbs with diet and exercise, burning arms and the back of neck, dry eyes, dry mouth, shakiness/trembiling, cramping, migraines and hot flashes/night sweats, Im in my early 20s so knew it wasn't menopause. Had it removed and lost 20 lbs within the first month and a half. got my hormones tested and im not ovulating and im now 8 months post removal, not making any progesterone, my adrenal hormones are through the roof. still working on regulating everything but these women who recommend the mirena keep saying about not listening to the negative reviews. I WISHED I DID. You may not have the negative reactions I have had but I don't think birth control is worth the gamble of getting a year of your life robbed from you. I also encourage you to go to curezone mirena side effects forum. if that doesn't convine you, nothing will. Take it from me, if you don't have your health, you have nothing. :(

I do not want children, never did, but I cannot do the pill anymore as I am over 35 and smoke.  Most doctors will NOT give it to you if you don't have kids, but I found one that would.  I am in my 4th year and no babies Ya Hoo!!! I also like that I don't get my period anymore.  I might get cramping and things like that, but no flow. I am grateful for the doctor that gave me this. My insurance would not pay for me to get my tubes tied because I have no children, but they would pay for this.  I have to get a new one next year. It was EXTREMELY painful getting it inserted, but it is the best decision I ever made.  I would recommend this device Merena version, to anyone.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/9/2012 8:43:16 PM	The Mirena coil is one of the most reliable forms of birth control.  Definitely a plus for those of us not planning on kids for quite a while. Curious and tired of the daily pill, I figured I'd venture to this option of birth control.  CONS:1. Insertion was one of the most painful experiences of my life.  I had my nose broken, back injuries, and other very painful occurrences in the last few years.  I'd say this was the worst though.  (Although it may also be attributed to the fact that my GYN didn't use a numbing agent, my uterus is anteverted, and I'm a nulliparous patient.) Took ibuprofen before the procedure - I could not imagine how awful it would have been without it. 2.  Cramps were so bad on the way home I had to pull over several times.  I had to deal with semi-severe cramps for the first week, and so, set a medication schedule to ensure my ibuprofen was always working.3. Although I have not gained any weight, per se, I am always very bloated.  I had problems with bloating before, but not to this extent.  I sometimes look 5 months pregnant, but with my stick-like arms.  Kinda funny looking, haha.3. Purely physical, but my boobs seemed to deflate after switching to Mirena from the ortho-cyclen.  PROS:1. Peace of mind.  VERY reliable form of birth control. Significantly more effective than the pill, especially if you didn't take it at the EXACT same time every day.2. First month period was significantly lighter than usual.  Following periods tapered off until no period!  Score.3. No daily pill-taking.4. Related to #3, but no mood swings or spotting from taking a pill late.  Now, I hear most people have spotting for the first three to six months after insertion.  Fortunately, after the initial semi-traumatic insertion, it's been smooth sailing post-first week.I think the pros outweigh the cons.  I would get it again, just with a different GYN who would care enough to try and make it a little less traumatic.
Birth Control	tia100, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	2/6/2012 3:39:34 PM	I did a lot of research on medication before having implanted in early October.  I liked the benefit of not having to worry taking birth control daily and not having to get anything else done for 5 years.  I had problems from the start. Insertion was painful but it did not last very long.  I have been spotting ever since I got the iud placed.  I had to go back to my doctor several times and complain and she gave me a supplimental horomone to stop the spotting.  I was spotting everyday that I was not having my menstral cycle.  So it seemed like I was on my period all the time.  The worst side effect ever was that my hair started falling out.  I thought it was stress so I tried all types of stress relief and vitamins to help it.  Finally my hairdresser showed me a blog where thousands of women have complained of the same thing.  Now I have a bald spot at the top of my head!!! I am having it removed in two days can not wait.  I have never had so many problems with birthcontrol.  Be AWARE!! I am a healthy 30 year old women without any health problems and the Mirena has not done nothing but cause me problems and grief!!! My advice to you do not get it!!!! Not worth.. the risk!!! 
Birth Control	sdylern, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	2/6/2012 10:14:19 AM	I had my little girl July 7th 2011, I am an RN and did my research.... thought Mirena was a great idea and had it put in at 6 weeks postpartum.  By 2 months postpartum about 2 weeks after having Mirena inserted I started having joint pain and stiffness especially in the morning. I attributed this to postpartum adjustment of ligaments, muscles and hormones.  WELL........at 4 months postpartum it had just gotten worse!!! I contacted my MD and she said this was not a normal postpartum symptom. She suggested I see a rhuematologist.  I had some bloodwork done and it was all negative.  My hair has also been falling out but this is a typical hormone transition symptom after pregnancy. Then I gained 15lbs but I had stopped breastfeeding so I attributed it to that.  All this being said my daughter is now 7 monts old, I have been eating 1000 to 1500 calories a day and working out at least one hour a day and cannot lose weight!!! My hair is still falling out, my joint pain and stiffness is horrible (Im 28 by the way), I cant lose weight, Im dizzy, nauseated and having the same symptoms as pregnancy (no Im not pregnant, Ive defineltly checked on that)!!! After searching the web Ive found that many other women have had the same problems due to Mirena.  I called my MD to have it removed ASAP, I hope to update this after I find if my symptoms get better.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/2/2012 4:35:38 PM	I have had the mirena just going on a year now and REALLY am loving it!!! I read so many reviews and was so scared going in to get it inserted but was pleasantly surprised, it was very uncomfortable for about 5 minutes and I did have some pretty intense cramping for a few hours after but nothing I couldn't handle. I went back to work that afternoon. I am 26, with 2 kids and am unsure if I am going to have any more. I have a period for about 2-3 days every 2 or 3 months, which is fabulous!! Even when I have them, they are VERY light. I have noticed I have had some acne, which is not ideal, but to be fair I can't completely say that is the birth control. I recently switched the brand of face wash I use, so hopefully that will help. Either way, to me a little acne is fine, considering the convenience this little thing has given me!! I have the sex drive I had when NOT being on any birth control, so it really is great!! I highly recommend this form of birth control.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Horrified, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	35-44	2/2/2012 2:21:50 AM	It's been 2 years since I had the Mirena inserted due to heavy and irregular periods. I started noticing about a year ago that I became very anxious and sometimes had panic attacks. My doctor put me on Cymbalta and that seemed to help. But then I noticed my hair was starting to fall out a lot more than what would be considered normal. At first I thought it was due to stress and some changes in my life (new job, move to a different state). It's now 1 year later and nothing has changed. It has made me a total &quot;basket case&quot; at times and my relationship with my husband is suffering. Thank god he is so understanding. My hair has thinned to the point that I am actually considering a hair transplant. It's taken over my life. I am getting this thing removed ASAP. I've heard horror stories from different people about the hair loss. Hopefully as soon as I get it out of me I will feel much better. If you have fine hair to begin with, DON'T DO IT!!!!!!
Birth Control	Moglie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/31/2012 4:48:40 PM	Insertion was uncomfortable but manageable. Had been on Nuvaring (no off time so no preiods) so luckily had almost no spotting. Haven't had any bleeding since insertion (6+ months) but I do still have cycles with less moodiness, less headaches, almost no cramps or intestinal fluxuations. I did have a slight increase of acne but it settled down. My sex drive is way up, my energy is up (from relief or hormones, or both, no way to be sure). No weight gain. Husband can feel the string every once in a while but not a problem. If it keeps up this way I will be getting another Mirena when this one is removed.
Birth Control	Deannamg1984, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/23/2012 5:04:33 PM	I have had no issues with Mirena at all. Before having it placed I did tons of internet research and was nervous because I found so many horror stories but I found just as many positive experiences so I went with it. The procedure to have it placed was rather painful (especially because I've never had kids) and I had bad cramping for a day or two after but nothing some ibuprofen couldn't handle. My periods got significantly lighter within the first 6 months and now I hardly get a period at all to the point where I haven't used a tampon in 2 years. I'm getting my device removed soon but only because I'm ready for children. My dr said I should be able to conceive as soon as the device is removed; unlike pills which remain in your system for about a month or so. I would definitely utilize this BC option in the future and recommend it to any one considering a long term yet not permanent option.

Birth Control	sunday985, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	1/21/2012 2:29:37 PM	I had such bad cramping and pain, I passed out during the insertion of the IUD.  I have never had children (45 yrs old).  So that may be the reason there was trouble getting through my cervix. After the insertion I was fine, very little cramping and I am pleased with the results. I will recommend that you ask for something for the pain.  I definitely will be when I get it removed.  I'm surprised they don't routinely prescribe it for insertion.

Birth Control	hey, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/23/2012 5:55:57 PM	So I cant say the &quot;effectiveness&quot; is 5 star yet because I just got this a few hours ago. I had to comment on Mirena asap. I researched reviews on getting this before my appt. I SO WISH I DIDNT!!!!! I almost chickened out. I am 22yrs old, engaged, and in med school. I know I do not want kids anytime soon -so figured this was my best bet. I have never had kids either- I have read alot of reviews saying its even more painful for people who havent had kids. 1st off the pain is like 3 seconds if that.It is also not like pain pain just uncomfortable. If you ever had a tattoo it wont be any where close to the pain. I feel great- no pain- no sickness- i do not feel it there. This is a great bc if you do not want to have kids. PLEASE dont get scared. I had myself so psyched out over nothing!!! I'll add an update later on how long terms things are going

Had it out and had the ablation procedure now back to normal. I would NEVER recommend.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Dissapointed, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	1/16/2012 10:58:06 PM	To anyone who has had Mirena inserted with no issues, I am so happy for you. But for me, this is the worst form of birth control, at least for my body.  I have had Mirena for a year now, and pain from the insertion was unbearable. But ob said it was probably because I had a c-section so my cervix had to tampered manually, whatever! I have bled more than half the time its been in.  I have a period every month like clock work, but it last 14 FREAKING DAYS!!!!! Where does that happen, I would have rather not gotten implanted. Sex drive, dont have any, weight gain....oh yes...feel like I am pregnant, all the time. Moody? Very, hair loss? any negative side effect you name it I got it, oh and because of the constant bleeding, I have constant odor, I am afraid to douche because of those side effects, but something has to give.  This birth control method is definitely not attractive and as soon as I am able to, this thing is coming out.  The only positive thing I can say about Mirena is that it has kept me from getting pregnant, other than that its the worst and I don't recommend it to anyone. FYI I was also told that if you haven't had birth control with high levels of progesterone, then Mirena inst for you.  Found that out 7 months too late.  Hope this helps.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	amanda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	1/16/2012 5:27:38 PM	I had my son in 2008 after that I had paraguard put in, in 2011 I took it out and got pregnant, I had an abortion and went to have the paraguard put back in the doc convinced me to put merina in she said it would help with my painful periods and the only side effect would be food cravings, well I regret the day I had that thing put in a few hours later I got the worst headache ever, my heart started to race like crazy, I felt extreme anxiety, horriable insomina, blurred vision, anger like no other I wanted to scream at anyone around me and depresson. I felt like I wanted to jump off a bridge I went insane. I went to have this thing removed the doc told me I was crazy that mirena dosent cause any of these symptoms I told her shes nuts alot of women experience the same symptoms, well a day later after having it removed my symptoms are almost gone. I had the paragurd put back in I will never go back to mirena I would rather have my tubes tied then go back to that nightmare.

Had constant cramping for 2 weeks.. my first period lasted 21 days. Just in time for vacation. weird discarge during the past 4 months, expecially after intercourse. Three days ago started bleeding extremely bad, large clotting. last night had huge clotting and with it the mirena came out. Now today the doctor tells me to stay in bed cause I am light headed from loosing to much blood.. taking 600 mg of Advil every 4 hrs for pain and to help slow bleeding..  and to top it all off Doctor said it was covered by my insurance.. well yeah only $200 .. so costed me almost $400.. when I was told it would only cost my co-pay.. ($20)Nightmare!!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/10/2012 5:26:23 PM	I had the iud inserted a month ago. The insertion was somewhat painful, but not unbearable. It only lastly  5 minutes. I had some cramping the first 2 days, then on and off for the last month. The worst side effect has been dull lower back pain. It was constant for the first week. I have been spotting as well. All in all, the side effects are worth not getting pregnant.

I have been bleeding almost the whole time. The few times that I have not bled, I tried to have intercourse with my husband and the pain for both of us is unreal. Needless to say we don't do it. I am moody, but maybe its because i bleed 24/7. I am so having this thing removed. it's not worth it.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Love the IUS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/29/2011 3:29:21 PM	I was on depo for ten years and decided to transition to the Mirena due to some negative side effects from the shot. I travel across ten time zones on a routine basis so the pill was not a viable option, and did not want the random bleeding from the implant. I read many reviews before getting the Mirena and almost backed out based on the negative reviews. I am so glad I went through with the procedure.I have not had children, but have a history of severe and demobilizing cramping associated with periods. Therefore, my pain threshold is fairly high. The insertion was not bad at all. There are two uncomfortable times during the insertion - one when the sounding is done and again when the device is inserted. The pain only lasted for about 20 seconds with each step. Thus, I found this to be very bearable. Who can't handle 40 seconds of pain? What probably made this event a non-event was the prep work I did before the procedure. First, my doc prescribed a cervix softener which I placed intra-vaginally the night before and then the morning of the procedure. Second, I took OTC pain medicine starting the night prior. Third, I found a doctor who had a lot of experience placing the device. Overall, these steps probably helped tremendously. It appears that the depo left my system very quickly, probably because I have a high metabolism owing to my 10+ mile runs every day. I note a normal cycle except my period last for about two hours each month, which is a tremendous relief from my long and painful periods.I did not have many negative side effects from the shot (same hormone as the Mirena), and do not notice any difference with the Mirena. The progesterone can aid in weight gain, but only by increasing your hunger. Thus, you must control how much you are eating and exercising while on this drug rather than simply blaming the medicine.Overall, long-term solutions such as the shot and Mirena have given me my life back. Don't be afraid of all of the negative reviews.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/29/2011 1:21:57 AM	I've had Mirena in for a little over 3 years now. There was some pain and cramping during the insertion but my doctor had warned me ahead of time since I haven't had a child yet and she made it a pretty nice experience, all things considering. My periods were pretty sporatic the first year but have calmed down ALOT since then. I now get 1-3 days of spotting every 6-8 weeks which makes my life so much easier. I ended up chosing Mirena because I just couldn't handle birth control with estrogen. It messed with my head and I became a moody mess! So far the only side effects I've seen are some mild acne during the winter monthes (but I also work outside year round and my skin drys out), a white discharge which isn't horrible but enough to be noticeable, and I've had a double cyst in one of my breasts. If those are the only symptoms, then I'll stick with this birth control for sure. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/28/2011 1:48:08 PM	I had the Mirena IU inserted 8weeks after my second child. The first 6months my mood swings were crazy!! My period stop and occasional bleeding here and there however each month i still got cramps, headache, mood swings etc.. with no period. After two years in i gain a total of 20pounds and my sex drive went away. I manage to keep the weight off with diet and exercise. Over all this is a great birth control. After my 5 years are up i will be removing the Mirena for safety reason and i want to be back to normal..

I'm 17yrs old no kids but I had horrible bleeding out bursts that lasted months at a time and I can say the bleeding slowed down by at least 75percent and no clots for the first time in 4 years. When I got it put in I lost about 10lbs within the first week. And the drs say that within 3 months I'll have regular periods and they might even stop too, the medicine is only for sirtent people. But as a young female j would recommend this to anybody with bleeding problems and before this the clots were sizes up to a small orange, and heavy bleeding were u could walk a foot without something happening. So girls if u had problems like me trust me do it and you'll do fine. I did have cramping and little pain but it's normal it went way after I think 4 days. And hey if u don't like it u can get it out but wait at least 3 months to c any changes before u decide. Thanks for reading!    :)

The weight gain(20 pounds in a month), HEart arithmia, Forgetfulness! After getting it out, irregular period for 6 months, and two eptopic pregnancies.  If you want more children I would not recommend the mirena!
Birth Control	Kayla Robertson, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	3		19-24	12/15/2011 6:59:26 PM	After being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder i was told by my DR that i was something i should try compaired to the pills. I had it put in last week and since then there is nothing but pain. I had to miss four days of work and have blood clots as large as a cantaloupe. My DR told me that it could continue for 4 months. Im thinking about having it removed.

I will admit getting it put in was pretty painful but not unmanageable and the benefit that it's given me has definitely outweighed the 15 minutes of discomfort! If you are looking for a long-term, no worry birth control I would strongly suggest giving this a try.

Birth Control	NikkiL, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/12/2011 9:10:40 PM	Very effective birth control, I love the fact that once you get Mirena you don't have to worry about it. It is a big sense of relief. I haven't had kids yet so the insertion was very very painful, I recommend that you take some Advil beforehand and have someone drive you home. After a couple days the pain from the insertion went away. I had spotting for a couple months just is normal. It has been about a year now since I've been on Mirena and I still have regular periods, they are very light-I don't mind having them still just for the extra peace of mind. The only negative side effect I've had is a decreased sex drive. I've had this happened when I was on the Pill too. Other than that this product is very effective. 
Birth Control	cookie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/8/2011 10:53:14 PM	Stopped my periods after 4 months (It's been 8 months since I've had a period, no sign of one yet). I LOVE this thing! I don't have to worry about missing a pill, getting an injection every 3 months, or having a weird plastic rod in my arm that everyone can see. It is low-maintenance and the most effective form of birth control available. I've never been pregnant (it's recommended for women who have given birth) and having it implanted did hurt quite a bit, but the pain lasted less than a minute so it was completely worth it. The only other downside is having to take pregnancy tests every once in a while to make sure (since I don't have periods). It was completely free at Planned Parenthood since I was 21 when I had it implanted (check with your location to see if you qualify for financial assistance!!)I will admit that lately my sexual desire has decreased and it's hard for me to get wet for sex and I am not sure that is because of the birth control or other factors (I am VERY stressed out from work) but I think that is important to mention. My acne hasn't cleared up any, but I never gained any weight. Even with that said, I'd recommend it to anyone who asked! If you start to see any symptoms, you can just have it removed. It uses the same hormone as normal oral contraception so I'm not sure if you'd have better luck with anything other than a copper IUD which makes your periods way worse. Try it for yourself! Personally, I think a cessation of periods is enough of a selling point. You can always have it taken out if you notice any negative changes!
Birth Control	mcald2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/6/2011 5:18:10 PM	I got the Mirena IUS inserted about 8 weeks after having my second child.  I am on medication for bipolar disorder which can affect birth control pills and this was a great option for me.  The insertion was painless.  My period has been eliminated since about 2 months after insertion with the exception of some spotting for a few hours every couple of months.  Some of the issues noted by other users may be due to insertion.  My doctor had alot of experience with placing the Mirena IUD and I really think that has contributed to my satisfaction with the product.

I had it &quot;installed&quot; on August 15th and have had every side effect. I've always had great complexion and now I have severe acne. Hair loss was getting worse. Bleeding constantly. Depression was getting worse. Removal is not as bad as installation that was TERRIBLE! Would not recommend it.

Doctor told me it wouldn't be painful, ouch ouch ouch it HURT. For the past five years I have been exhausted, sexual life decreased big time,pain during sex, dryness, UTIs, Infections, abdomanal pain constantly, and acne/hair growth thats just annoying. 6 months ago I went for my annual, asked the doctor about my sysmptoms, and told her I wanted it removed. She spent quite a bit of time telling me this was my best method choice (married, monogamous, no more kids), that I wasn't feeling the BC inside me, that I was just fine and dandy. I'm getting it removed next week, and will never ever go this route again. Ladies don't let them talk you into it, or talk you into keeping it.
Birth Control	rgregones,  Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		12/2/2011 4:01:57 PM	I loved having the Mirena. It completely eliminated my period for almost five years, and never having to think about birth control was very liberating. The only side effect I hated was the hair loss. In unpredictable cycles I had a mass fallout of hair. When it came time for removal I had to decide between no periods or no hair. I voted in favor of my hair.

After the 1st one was removed the 2nd Mierna was inserted during thae same DR's visit.It's been a couple of months since I got the 2nd Mirena and still no side effects. This method of Birth Control works for me.

I didn't have periods after that. I did have some cramping from time to time and complaints of my husband being able to feel it &amp; it hurting him. I can feel it sometimes as well, depending on how i lay, or if my son sits on my abdomen, or if I'm running/ working out - its uncomfortable but not unbearable. I LOVED not having periods, but after the 3 year mark, I have started having them again. I'm not sure as to why my body is reacting differently now and I'm not 100% sure I want to leave it in.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/25/2011 12:14:03 PM	I love this product. I am really sorry for those that it didn't work out, but it also deserves a review from a satisfied user. I've had a Mirena for 9 yrs, I'm on my second one. My periods used to be very heavy, now they last a day or too of light bleeding. I must admit that the first 6 months of use were a nightmare: cramps, insertion was very painful, spotting, etc. I was ready to quit. After 6 months, everything calmed down. I think it is a great birth control method, but you should at least give it 6 months before giving up on it. Oh, and I definitely recommend to take Advil (or something stronger) before having it inserted. It is painful and you are cramping for the rest of the week. 
Birth Control	Whit, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/23/2011 1:03:38 PM	At first I thought the Mirena was the best BC I have ever tried, but now 2 years later I beg to differ. I have gained 30 lbs, constant pelvic pain, weird bleeding, weird discharge, UTI's on a monthly basis, headaches, blurry vision, and bad depression/anxiety. I thought I was going insane with all my physical and mental health problems; but I have talked to mumerous other people that had the Mirena and since they have gotten it out, they feel 100% better. I am getting it out today :)

When i first had this put in, the cramping during my periods was worse. this lasted for about 5-6 months. Now however, my periods are shorter and the cramping has gone away. I am definitely loosing hair though and I have a decreased interest in sex. I have been getting worse headaches as well, but I got them before so I am not sure if this is due to stress or the medication.

Well, that was not the case, it was so painful to insert that I cried so bad that the doctor felt bad.  Cramp weren't too bad and starting bleedin and haven't stopped.  I go through at least 1 to 2 pads a day and my energy is sapped.  I also developed an infection and constant abdominal pain.  Finally had the darn thing taken out and am gonna switch to the mini-pill.

I have been bleeding and spotting ever since, i have headaches everyday and now my vision is starting to bother me. I'm giving this mirena 6 months to see how my body adjusts and if its still like this, good ol pulling out method will be my bc again, i hate pills and all this stuff anyway too many side effects for anything!

It was very painful when they put it in.  I did not cramp at all though. On the other hand, I have not stopped bleeding since I got it.  I mean it is a lot of blood too.  I am very moody and my hair is falling out.  I called the doctor and she said that the bleeding was normal.  She said I could bleed on and off for a year.  I also asked her about my hair coming out and she said that was not a side effect.  I am also so tired.  I can't even stay awake past 7:30pm.  I like the fact that you don't have to worry about taking pills, but this is a little too much.  There would be no way you can get pregnant or even have sex because you're always bleeding.

I have no energy, i havcent gained weigt but i cantseem to lose iteen with prescription diet pills, i have had 2 pregnancyscares because i get the symptoms of pregnancy as i did with my son. I have cysts on my ovaries that put in the emergency room twice. i go tothe dr in december and im scared of wat theyare goingto tell me because if no period is considered a severe symtom then im screwed because i havent had one in almost 2 years. I have absolutely no sex drive an i used to really enjoy sex and when we do have sex he catches the string or hitsd the mirena and its game over!! Im not surprised that ppl dont get pregnant on this. Ive had a lot more back pain since it was put in but i just figured that it was the stress of my son that did it now im not sure so ill find out soon
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	scool, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/12/2011 8:42:59 AM	I had Mirena placed yesterday afternoon after 30 days of research and indecision. My dr suggested this product for bleeding and BC. The reiews submitted were frightening to read and I almost decided against it. The insertion was not comfortable but I would not describe it as &quot;pain&quot;. Pain is when you ram your pinky toe into a table...that hurts. I had mild cramps for about 30 minutes and very minimal bleeding. I was on day 5 of my period and as of this morning it has stopped. My husdand and I went out to dinner with friends about an hour later and I felt perfectly normal. It is early in the process for me but I have a really positive feeling that this product will work for me. No periods? Worth a shot ladies! Don't be afraid to try it because of scary reviews. The worst part of it was being tense and afraid due to what I had read. My blood pressure was off the chart, but once my dr calmed me down by explaining everything that was going to take place it was easy breezy. Try it! 
Birth Control	Wicked, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	11/11/2011 11:55:59 PM	The insertion was fairly painful, but then again, I haven't had a kid yet, so that was to be expected. Since the insertion, I've had occasional cramping (earlier cramps were worse, now I hardly have them at all) and spotting almost every day. However, the bleeding is considerably less now than it was when it started. I have actually lost 7 lbs since I've had the Mirena put in, but I've also been eating healthier, smaller portions and avoiding food after 8pm. No abnormal acne, anxiety or depression. I can't say I'd do it again, BUT it beats taking pills every day!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	11/10/2011 9:41:05 AM	5 months ago I had the Mirenda inserted. Since then, I have had nothing but problems. Now, let me say first that I have always had acne and mood swings and I don't relate those to the Mirena. My problems were the more serious ones. Since I got the Mirena I always had headaches, backaches, stiffness in my back, pelvic pain, nausea, and irregular periods. Then I started bleeding when it wasn't my period and my pelvic pain became severe. I ended up in the emergency room. They told me I had a cyst. They actually encouraged me to keep the dumb thing in! I said no, I wanted it out. So they took it out. Immediately my symptoms started to disappear. Mirena was such a mistake and I will NEVER consider an IUD again. I hope this helps other women who have these symptoms or are considering Mirena. I know I needed advice the whole time I had it.

It was comforting when I read about others' experiences and I learned that I needed to just be patient to see how my body would react to it.  I have been very happy with this form of birth control.

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	morgan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/7/2011 1:31:44 PM	I decided to try Mirena out before performing a hysterectomy for endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome. I had my period for 7 consecutive months and was sick of the bleeding.My doctors recommended trying it out before surgery and I complied. However, I had the mirena inserted a month ago and I have been bleeding non-stop and the bleeding has also increased. I also notice a sort of heaviness in my uterus or pelvic cavity and have moderately painful cramps daily. I noticed that my mood has changed and have been more anxious and tearful. I have heard that it is normal and common for the mirena to penetrate the uterine wall and since I have checked placement, I was unable to locate the strings. I called my gyno and go in 2 days to get it removed. I am very unsatisfied with the results.

Went on it for abnormal periods and constant bleeding.  Had it inserted.  Still a lot of bleeding, clotting.  Had an u/s.  IUD positioned wrong.  Went back to Dr. She removed it and inserted another one.  Still the same problems.  Missing work because of pain and bleeding.  Called office.  Pain was horrible.They told me to come in, went to bathroom and Mirena IUD came out!!  I gave birth to an IUD!  Walked into the office holding it in kleenex in my hand.  Never again.

My doctor suggested Mirana. I starting having a medium flow shortly afterwards that lasted 30 days  not  spotting a serious enough flow where i thought i was going to go broke buying sanitary napkins. the second month they prescribed medicine to stop the flow it took 3 wks to kick in and then only stopped working when i was directed to stop taking the medicine. I am  considering  have it remove asap. I am not happy with it at all. I wished i had researched the side effects more. the constant bleeding caused me to be tired all the time and the  doctors could not  help at with the situation. I have fibroids they say is the reason for the constant bleeding,was not told it may happen. looking forward to a partial historectomy.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	11/4/2011 12:42:05 PM	I have had a paraguard IUD for 10 years. LOVE it. No worries at all about birth control. I needed a new one because they only last 10 years and my doctor suggested the Mirena IUD. It was put in in September 2011. I was skeptical but thought I would try it. The pain wasn't bad for me. Beats labor. I think some of the comments on here about the pain are WAYYY  over exaggerated. Totally tolerable for the 10 seconds it lasts. I have had 2 periods right on time and they didn't seem to be different than before. No other bleeding at all. I noticed about a month into it that I was snappy and nasty for a week or two but that went away quick. No acne at all. My problem seems to be weight gain. The nurse at my doctor's office told me more than 5lbs is very uncommon, almost like she didn't believe me. But the scale doesn't lie! I have gained 9 pounds in LESS than 8 weeks. Time to take it out. It's a shame because I was really hoping to do away with ovulating which for me is worse than a period. No such luck. I lost 30 pounds 4 years ago. I maintain my weight. I'm aware of it. I weight myself regulary as it took a lot to loose the 30 and I don't need any help putting it back on! The Mirena is coming out hopefully next week!!!! Going back to the paraguard. I was really had high hopes, though.

A week after getting Mirena I started to feel on edge very snappy (moody) next week I broke out with pimples which I never had ance in my life. Now I have a rash on 80% of my face. On top of all that cramps and spotting since I got the insertion. Getting this out asap..

At first, things were fine, no acne, mood changes, or weight gain. But over the past 2-3 months, my periods have gone from about a week long to almost the full month straight. I am currently on my second round of progesterone from my doctor to see if that helps the bleeding, as he is now concerned about anemia. My mood has changed from a usually upbeat person, to having bouts of depression frequently. The acne has gotten to the point where only prescription meds will work, as I have tried everything else. My sex drive by itself hasn't decreased, but the exhaustion I feel most of the time puts a damper on any intimacy. I am bloated all of the time, regardless of diet. I am consistently gaining about 1-2 pounds a month, even though nothing has changed with my exercise routine or diet. I was hoping these issues would go away on their own, but now I'm not so sure. I have an appointment next Wednesday to have it removed and get back on Nuvaring. I had high hopes this would work, as it allows me to not have to worry about birth control. I'm not pregnant, nor had any scares this whole time, but I'm tired of the acne and weight gain. I had no problems whatsoever on the Nuvaring, so hopefully my body will get back to normal once this gets removed.

The insertion was fairly painful, but I've never had a child, so that's probably why. The doctor actually accidentally pulled it out when trying to trim the strings and had to put in a new one all in one visit. The next month I had pretty bad cramps, but not extreme bleeding. I also developed cystic acne a month later. But it's now the end of october and it's starting to clear up, I'll have scars though. Make sure if you get acne you ask to see a dermatologist! No weight gain for me either. My periods hurt a bit more now, and I have a persistent pain in my lower left side, where my ovary is, from cysts, but they're normal according to my doctor. Overall, for the peace of mind of not having to worry about getting pregnant or remember to take a pill or something, I'm pretty happy with mirena.
Birth Control	Rienks, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	10/30/2011 3:28:16 AM	The insertion was painless, about 15 minutes afterwards started to get mild cramping. The 3rd day started with mild headaches, dizziness, moodiness, no sex drive and no energy. By the end of 1st week 1 headache every day with spotting. By end of 2nd week severe headaches that come and go hourly causing dizziness, blurred vision. Very upset and depressed, and now started a dry cough with a greenish colored flem. Needless to say husband took it out before it was in any longer. I may not want anymore children right now but this has been the worst 2.5 weeks of my life. Going to doctor on Monday to get this unexplained cough checked out. Would not recommend this to anyone. Finding information about this product was difficult before it was inserted. If i would have known all these side effects before getting it inserted i sure the heck would have never had it inserted. I have my fingers crossed that this cough isn't something serious and hopefully my body will be back to normal soon.

It wasnt painful to get inserted however I did have major cramping for a few days. About a week later I starting spotting and then it started to be extremely heavy bleeding. I also had blood clots about 2&quot; big. I kept the mirena in until October 2011. When I first got the mirena I was told there were little to no side effects, but throught the year I gained about 25 pounds, was severly depressed, started growing facial hair, constantly bloated, moody, and I also now have cysts on my ovaries.  My doctor is now monitoring me to see if all of my symptoms could of been from the mirena. Within 2 days I was feeling much happier and not depressed at all. So far thats the only change. Also while on mirena my thyroid has become inactive. I had my thryroid levels tested about a month before mirena and the results were normal. I was tested 6 months later and my levels were outragous as the doctor put it. So basically my experience was horrible and I would not recommend it to anyone.

I thought at first my weight gain was due to my diet and or exercise, but I did not change either part after getting the mirena. Then I did perfect my eating habits (I was already a pretty healthy eater) and excluded my occasional sweet treat and started doing more cardio (I was doing 3x a week and I increased it to 4-5x a week) and NOTHING worked still gained on average about 2-3 lbs a month.

I had horrible discharge and constant spotting for the first 4 months and acne(which i never had in my life). As for birthcontrol..there was no sex as I was constantly with pads and tampons!! So i guess it worked!!LOL  As for the last few months nothing has changed except my moods swings are making me feel like i am &quot;crazy&quot;.  But i am intelligent enough that its from the Mirena.  Still bleeding 2.5 to 3 weeks out of the month!!  I feel like the world is caving in on me and I feel like I am having panic attacks.  I have never felt this way before.  Also since I had it placed, my hair seems to be falling out like never before.  I think that its a good thing but I am just not able to have it in any longer.  Back in the day I couldn't take the pill either. I called and talked to my Dr and told her I needed it out ASAP!!  Hopefully things will get back to normal when I have it removed in a few days!!  My husband has been so understanding through this which helps!!Its his turn now!!  I am done!!

As I was unaware this had happened this lead to a pregnancy and an infection. Unfortunately the infection led to a miscarriage. I recommend against this type of contraceptive as the results were both physically and emotionally painful.

I do not know if it is the mirena or just my personality but i'm never happy anymore. I don't have sex drive (could also possibly be caused by being attracted to my boyfriend)... and i'm going through bladder infection right now.

Spotting is still random after a year and occurs 4+ times a month and still experience some pain.  While everything is random, the bleeding is super light (much better than a week of a heavy period) and do not have to remember to take a pill.  It is important to keep you doctor informed, as he/she should be able to help minimize the problems you are experiencing.

Since then I have had nothing but problems. When I first got it they told me i could have a constant period for 6-9 weeks. False, it last nine months straight. Now I dont have a period at all. I have severe cramping almost everyday to the point I have had to go to the hospital 3 times. Going to work has also been a problem. Im always tired and my body feels so drained. I do get acne once a month. As for weight gain I didnt gain any weight untill these last 2 months and I gained almost 20lbs. When having sex, I can only be in one position or im in constant pain. I do not recommened this for anyone. Im 21 and thought this would be an easy way to keep for getting pregant. It is, but the problems that come along with it are not worth it. Needless to say I am having it removed after 3 years and $600.

The insertion didn't hurt but, since then I've had cramping. I would spot for about ten days out of the month and get very bad acne for two weeks. I had zero sex drive and was always tired.

The insertion was painless and the recovery was mild, I had light spotting for a week or so. I read reviews that state some ladies get severe acne or weight gain however I havent noticed an increase in acne. Prior to the IUD I would breakout before my period which is still the case now. I feel that it is very important that I comment on the weight gain alot of women experience. Since inserting the Mirena I have lost 95 pounds - I work out and eat healthy so I cannot relate to the weight issues alot encounter with Mirena. I still get my period montly and have since I got the IUD. I am glad I chose Mirena as my method of BC and plan to continue using this product.

I am 32 and have never had children. They had to try inserting it a second time during the visit, as the first attempt didn't take. It was so painful for me, I almost passed out. The next two days were very crampy for me and I stayed on the couch. It took a few weeks to get used to the feeling of it, but that went away. Here we are almost three years later: although my periods are very light, my periods last about 9 to 10 days. Then I'm free for two weeks until the next one comes. I have facial breakouts for about two weeks around my period. I feel bloated for a good 2 weeks out of the month. The only pro (for me) for this device is that I am child free. I am 99.9% sure I don't want to have children and am not sure what else to try, as I can't see myself going through this any longer.

It was painful from day one and continues to be unbearable at times, it has been two months and the clinic insists that its &quot;normal&quot; and will go away. I'm still spotting, bad cramps and have no sex drive. I'm 26, that's just not right and its certainly not healthy for my engagement. Think I'll be going back to regulations bc. This is not working for me. I'll take ovarian cysts over this.
Birth Control	hazel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/16/2011 3:58:44 PM	I got my Mirena inserted 2.5 weeks ago. I decided I no longer wanted to be on the shot - sick of mood swings, wait gain, and more - after nine years. My husband has two children from a previous marriage and we do not want any more. After a lot of discussion with him &amp; my Dr., Mirena is what I decided on.My Dr. suggested I get the shot I was due for, then have the Mirena put in so I was covered for contraception, and in hopes I wouldn't have irregular bleeding. Everything has been great! The insertion was the hardest part, and it wasn't even that bad. Because I've never had children, my Dr. gave me a local (from which I did almost pass out), but I am so glad she did. I didn't feel anything after that. While she had me there, she did a vaginal ultra sound to make sure that the IUD was in the correct place. I took some advil when I got home - had some really minor cramping for the first two days. I mean, part of the reason I was on the shot and now this is because I have bad period and cramping, and this was nothing compared to that. Seriously just a couple of minutes of pain, and a little pressure sometimes, like when you have to use the bathroom. That was only for the first 2 days.I have not had any irregular bleeding, spotting, discharge, discomfort, or problems of any kind. I know I  haven't had it that long, or maybe it's from going right from the shot to this, but I really haven't had a single problem and would recommend it.I have a follow up appointment in about three weeks; my Dr. said if everything is still in place by then, I probably won't have any problems at all, and if I can get through the first few months it'll be worth it. Well, so far so good and nothing to &quot;get through&quot;.It is a little hard to find the strings to check that they're where they are supposed to be, but I think that will be easier with practice.Remember that people usually post the horror stories, not the praises!

I have had breast cancer 3 times which was ER.I was given Tamoxifen and developed pre canceruous cells in the uterus from the EH. I am now experiencing severe PMS among numeruous other problems. The Mirena is being used to decrease the lining of the uterus wall and preventing uterine cancer, which my Gyneacologist is pleased about but I find it hard to cope with as well as ny other health problems which are high blood pressure,oesteo-arthritis &amp; fibromyalgia which I have had for over ten years. I am 63 years old &amp; do not have any quality of life and my doctors do not seem to care and tell me that there are other people with worse conditions, which I know but this does not help me but make feel worse. I know I should try another doctor but I could not face a barrage of tests again and try new medications which do not seen to help.I have tried dozens of different medications looking for relief but have more side effects &amp; more problems.Could you please advise me what to do as iam at my tether.

Birth Control	mcamille23, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	10/11/2011 3:52:42 PM	I had the mirena inserted after the birth of my second child April 2009. No acne or mood swings have accompanied it... although the weight gain has not been subtle... I don't even know how much I've gained... at least 20-25 lbs.The insertion wasn't overly painful and my periods stopped almost immediately. Recently (about 7 oct 2011) I got a horribly heavy period and the mirena came out, accompanied by a great deal of bleeding and large clots. The doctors said I had a mild hemorrhage, but no perforation or any other problems. I'm debating having another mirena put back in because (other than the weight gain and the painful expulsion) it has been the ideal method for me. I hate having periods and I can't ever remember to take a pill. Don't know what I'm going to do yet, because I'm still bleeding from losing the mirena. I'm going to the MD soon to see what else is available... hopefully with no weight gain involved.

I have two babies and we are not sure if we want anymore so we didnt want to do anything that lasted forever. I was afraid to get the mirena because of all the horrible things i read about it. Let me tell u I hardly felt anything. It was only as uncofortable as a pap. I had minor cramping and spotting. I pretty much felt back to myself the next day. I havent had any problems with it so far. I am extreamly happy with this drug.

Other	netta3144, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	10/4/2011 7:45:39 PM	I got the mirena 9/23/2011. It was painful, because I have a fibriod tumor that was in the way and my doctor had to get pass that, but once he did that it was ok. I had some mild cramping,before the day was over the cramping had stopped. The only thing I have experience is acne, and my period is going into it's second week.Beside those two minor problems it is work fine for me. I think my body have to adjust to it.I will do another review after Oct 23 it will be 30 days.My doctor thought the mirena would help with my fibriods and my cramping.We will see.
Birth Control	Megatron02, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	10/4/2011 5:36:47 PM	I got Mirena placed on 9/16/11.  It was extremely painful, but my doctor had told me it would be.  He wanted to place it when I was on my period, but I had gotten it over labor day weekend when it was impossible to see my doctor.  I actually passed out after it was inserted!  It was the first time I had ever passed out ever!  But I think that was due to my not eating anything.  My doctor made sure I was okay before driving home.  I had cramps for the rest of the day, but felt much better the next.  Now it's been about 3 weeks and I started my first period after insertion.  It seems to be going a little long, and heavier than usual.  Other than that, I have no complaints.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/2/2011 9:58:57 PM	This is a Mirena success story - I have had Mirena for 3 months.  I have never had a child and am only 23 years old - most doctors only recommend it if you've had a child due to the pain of insertion and chance that it will fall out or move around, but my experience has been amazing.  The insertion process was about 5 minutes - the pain was bad but very brief, and worth the potential 5 years of no periods and birth control!  I just took a book to the Doctor's office and read a few pages to keep my mind off of it.The first 2 days were painful, just overall cramping from the insertion but nothing pain meds couldn't handle.Since then, I have had bleeding/spotting on occasion.  My first period was way lighter than usual (I had very heavy periods before Mirena), but also lasted longer (2 weeks of wearing pantyliners).  The spotting has only gotten better with time, and my periods are almost non-existent already, with mild cramping.On another note - I get migraines, and I did have a series of 5 migraines in 2 weeks that was probably due to the hormone, but since then no migraines at all, and I haven't had any moodiness, weight gain, or other symptoms that are reported for Mirena.Overall, this is a HIGH endorsement for the IUD - I am so glad I decided to do it, and the fact that I had never had a kid didn't seem to make a difference.  All is well and I LOVE not having a daily routine of pills.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	3	Female	19-24	10/1/2011 12:40:32 AM	I got the birth control in april 2009 after my child was born and I never had a problem until about 1 year ago it started as alot of yeast infections like crazy I had to go to my ob about over other month :( it smelled bad and they said only 5% of women on it get this infection that I was getting. So everythime they gave me pills to take that I would feel like throwing them up after taking them and they worked them a few weeks later it would come back. A few months ago I said to my self im tried of this and then found out I had no insurance! SO I have to deal with it till I can go get it out. weight gain cant lose it loss of sex drive and break outs!! I hate it i rather take my chance n take the pill

Birth Control	Anavanessa_R, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	9/27/2011 6:39:58 PM	Today was my appointment to have Mirena put in. I was up all night reading reviews and was undecided whether to get the Provera or the Mirena. I was on the Provera shot when I was 18 and I had bleeding for 6 months it was definitely annoying and I was scared I was going to bleed to death.... So serious. The procedure today was definitely nerve wrecking, I was just scared of how painful the IUD was going to be. My Dr prepped me and told me about ALL of the side affects. She used the speculum (ouch) then cleaned me up, she then pinched my cervix which was PAINFUL :'( FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES, she then inserted the Mirena cut the strings Un-pinched my cervix and took the speculum out WHEWWW what a relief that was, 10 minute procedure the most. After that we scheduled my follow-up for 6 weeks later to make sure everything looked good. Im at work right now and I feel completely ok like nothing ever happened. I am bleeding right now but nothing crazy. I guess ill see how it goes. Based on the other reviews Ive read i'm a lil bit scared now whether I should keep it in or not, but then again every woman is different. Hope my experience was helpful... *A.R.*

Birth Control	Syd30, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/20/2011 5:54:20 PM	Insertion was painful, since I have not had children. They had to dilate my cervix to get it in place, which was quite unpleasant. I had spotting for three weeks and developed a bad case of acne (this has cleared up after the 3 month mark). My first period after insertion was twice as long, but lighter than usual. Second period was very light, but lasted two weeks with on and off spotting thereafter (annoying). The main side effect that has remained is cramping. I regularly get cramps when I don't have my period. I also get spotting after exercise quite often, but it's not heavy. I can occasionally feel the device in certain sexual positions and sometimes will have spotting after sex, but not all the time. I'm not going to lie, the adjustment period sucked. Now that I've reached three months, I'm hoping my periods will taper off and the acne completely disappears. I have not had any noticeable weight gain, like others have said. I hope the long term benefits outweigh the short term discomforts. Especially since my insurance only paid for half.

I gained weight, developed major acne on my face and back, and was extremely moody.  I also did not have a period for the first four months, which was nice, and then had it for the remaining three months straight.  I ruined almost every pair of my underwear!  I now tell all of my friends that it was the worst decision I've ever made and I'm so happy to be back on birth control pills.

I was unwilling to go on regular hormone birth control (had tried pill, patch, and shot) because it had cause moodiness and severe weight gain in the past. Insertion was a little uncomfortable, but lets face it, no object the doctor shoves up there is comfortable. I did NOT have horrible cramps.  I spotted a bit but not hardly enough for a pantyliner. I did however, feel it moving around every once in a while for a few months after. It almost felt like a baby kicking, which was unnerving but after determining that I wasn't pregnant and the Mirena threads were where they should be, I happily enjoyed not having to think about birth control. I did NOT gain weight, I was able to lose 50 lbs after having my daughter. I had mild acne and minor anxiety before Mirena and these were not increased after insertion. I did have one episode of heavy bleeding that lasted for a week maybe a year after insertion. The doctor explained that this can be cause from buildup of uterine lining and it went away on it's own without the need for a heavy dose of birth control pills that my dr recommended. Periods have been mild, sometimes almost none existent. But I have been having them regularly. Overall Mirena is worth consideration, and ease of use is better with already having children it seems. The reviews are all over the board and some people have had bad experiences or side effects but the pamphlet will tell you about the possibility of those occurring.  
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Mrs. Osteen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	19-24	9/12/2011 1:21:13 PM	I had my Mirena put in after I turned 20. I know that I am young but was told it would be the best decision based on the fact that no other medication would control or help my heavy and painful periods. I have not had childeren and still do not and having it inserted was probably one of the most painful things I have ever had done. for the first 6 months I hardly had a period or very light bleeding, which was great however the cramps were the same if not worsened. It has caused me to be rushed to the ER twice to to rapid growth of cervical cysts and rupture. Which again is very painful. Now after almost a year it still hurts but I do not want it removed due to the rumored statement that pregnancy is extremely likely after removal. I want kids but not now! If you dont want to get pregnant I would recommend it, I have no doubt that while the iud is in me I will not get pregnant. Which I love, no worries on that part. However with my story I am afraid of it making me infertile (Cause eventually I want kids) and continueing to have long severly painful periods, with no bleeding. I just wanted to share my story because of how different it is, with my age and having no childeren.
Birth Control	LiverChick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	9/6/2011 10:41:36 AM	I want to share my both my positive and negative experiences with Mirena. I've had 2 kids, both C-section, so my cervix has never had a baby go through it. Having Mirena installed hurt a bit, but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle; I drove myself home and was fine. The first year or so with it was Great! My periods kept getting lighter and lighter. I didn't have to worry about birth control, the pills, or condoms. I thought, &quot;Who couldn't love Mirena?!&quot; Then, about a year after getting it, my periods stopped completely (YAY!!) No, not yay. Without the flux in hormones anymore, I became an emotional zombie, stuck in PMS b*tch mode. I lost all desire to do anything I ever enjoyed: playing with my kids, playing my piano, reading, even loving my husband. I didn't even want him to Look at me, let alone touch me or have sex with me. My kids were suffering form having a really mean mom, my marriage was suffering, I was suffering. I finally figured out that it was the Mirena and lack of periods causing all of this. I immediately had it removed. That night, I could feel a cloud lifting, my mood was changing! I'm getting back to my real life, laughing again! Enjoying my beautiful kids and husband! Life is good for me again. And I owe it all to getting RID of my Mirena!
Birth Control	Iud no way, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	35-44	9/5/2011 9:46:05 AM	It was unbelievably painful for the insertion 3 years ago. I workout daily and monitor my caloric intake daily. I gained 25 lbs since the merina was first put in. I am severly fatigued. This summer I was admitted into ER for pain in lower pelvis/ ovaries . Had ultrasounds but all looked fine! I started getting bad acne (that I never had before the iud).I did my research and learned other women on the iud had the same problems, even pain in lower ab/pelvis. I had the iud removed within a few hours the pain was completely eliminated!! I would never suggest this method to my fellow female counterparts. Just an awful experience. Please -women do hour research before choosing this method.

That was until I had the Mirena inserted.  First, insertion was excrutiating, but after an hour I was fine.  Within a month I had a blister on my gut? turn into a horrible staph infection.  Antibiotics (AB) for a 2 months along with trips to a wound specialist.  While recovering from that, I got pneumonia, with double ear infection and strep throat at the same time. Never had any of those.  3 mos after insertion, I start raking at my labia,first thought it was yeast, dr. said it was female eczema, itching still continues and have been prescribed 3 diff creams with only temp relief.  Multiple sinus infections, and the start of bronchitis when I couldn't breathe, more (AB).  11 mos after insertion (Now) have a UTI that will not heal, and have run out of AB, 10 days worth.  Called dr today and am having it removed in 4 days.  Aside from the infections, zero sex drive, cannot lose weight, severe backaches, extreme hairloss(as told by my stylist), very emotional, I rarely spotted and had minimal cramps.  I had my tubes tied when I had my twins, but had Mirena inserted 6 mos after because of terrible bleeding.  Im very glad it works for many women, but w/o sounding dramatic this device will kill me lol..  For those of you who want this for the same reason, consider novasure, for bleeding, that will be my next option. jmcfaggan@gmail.com  I put my email because I want to know if anyone else has gone thru some of this, feel free to email me and share your experience

I bled nonstop thru to the next months period with no let up. I figured that would be worth it once my period stopped completely. I have yet to know what september's menstral will bring...I'm hoping nothing! I went for my check up and was told I needed an ultrasound. Got a call that ultrasound came back with no detection of placement so I needed to return once again for a physical check of proper placement. The doctor said he could see it and I shouldn't worry yet some of the side affects I have dealt with thus far have me seriously questioning my choice! Since insertion for one my poor husband has had to deal with the painful stabbing from the strings even after being cut...definitly not the best choice for a well endowed man! I have had over 11 debilitating migraine headaches since insertion which is a lot in a month any migraine sufferer will atest! Periodic cramping that has me still questioning whether this device has worked its way thru my cervix into my abdomine offers no peace of mind! I hate my period but I will only give M two more months to prove its worth or else its outta there!!

It was indeed very painful and I bled only a couple hours. I had it inserted on sept 7 2010 and on my follow up oct 3 2010 I had gained 10 lbs!!! I had a cycle in oct and nov and did not get another til april. I gained a total of 25 lbs with the Mirena. In june 2011 I took a pregnancy test bc I had gained 7 lbs and I was pregnant. I did lose the baby but started having lots of pain with the Mirena. I had it removed and i didn't feel a thing. I bled for a couple days after and then stopped. Its been 7 weeks and I still havent had another cycle. And no I'm not pregnant.

I bled for a couple weeks very lightly in the beginning. I haven't had a period in over 3 years, just some spotting maybe once a year or so. Mirena does make me very moody and irritable at times though. I do experience some cramping every now and again. Overall, it was worth getting

I have never had any of these before this IUD was placed. And all within a year? No energy, weight gain, dull backaches, were enough-made the appt today to have it removed..  I will not recommend

Birth Control	cjones, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/30/2011 9:05:27 PM	I had the mirena inserted after my 2nd child was born. It was put in at my 6 wk checkup. I felt that I wasn't warned about how painful the insertion would be. It was VERY painful and it continued to be painful for a few hours afterwards. The following day the pain was gone and I had very light spotting for a few weeks, then nothing. I'm very satisfied and happy that I don't have to think about birth control for 5 long years. Five years is a long time in comparison to a few hours of discomfort. I recommend.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	sarah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	8/28/2011 11:27:34 AM	I worked at a women's clinic for several years and spoke to many women who were very happy with this method. But after reading so many negative reviews of Mirena (that almost discouraged me from getting one myself), I decided to add myself into the chorus of voices that have had a positive experience with this form of bc.  This is not to invalidate the bad experiences some women have had with this method, but to let women interested in Mirena know that bad experiences are a small minority, and overrepresented on this site.  I have  suffered with dysmenorrhea for 20 years, since my first period, and was not only looking for a highly effective bc, but something that could help manage the pain (monthly vomiting, diarrhea, occasional fainting). Mirena has done that for me.  My first period has come and gone, and the pain was cut in half.  I imagine it will continue improve. I do want to say that while the insertion was fairly easy for me(I had a shot of lidocaine in my cervix, which also helps dilate it), the first month (especially the first week) was definitely uncomfortable. The cramps never got as bad as during my period, but they were definitely no walk in the park. Schedule your insert at a time when you have few demanding activities or work for at least a few days. But in the long run, I'd do it over again in a heartbeat.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	MommaGina, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/28/2011 12:55:01 AM	I had the Mirena inserted on Aug 10,2011. Today is Aug 28 and I have been in the hospital for a full week because of blood clots in my lungs that can;t be attributed to anything else but the Mirena IUD. My body expelled the device in a huge nasty blood clot 4 days ago. Thankfully that was not painful, and I feel much better after it left me. The gyn at the hospital says she has never seen this problem with Mirena before, but my regular Dr has reported my problem with the IUD to the FDA. I DO NOT recommend this product.. I am seriously thinking of finding an attorney. 
Birth Control	Britt, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	8/26/2011 4:16:19 PM	I got Mirena in Dec 2010, I had it removed Aug 2011. Overall I didn't have near as many side-effects that I read about in the reviews. The insertion was painful, my doc told me it would be more painful for me since I'd never had children. It sucked, but some Ibuprofen and a heat-pack took care of it in a day or two. I had a few light periods the first two months and then after that no period at all, some very light spotting every once in a blue moon.The biggest annoyance for me was the occasional cramping. It wouldn't be more than the usual period type cramps so it was tolerable, but it definately got old after a while. I experienced slight weight gain, especially in the last few months. I am a very active person and it was definately out of the norm for me. There were some bouts of minor depression, but is was usually in relation to stress at work or family issues, so something that would normally upset me just got to me a little bit more than the norm. And yes, the lack of libado was definately there occasionaly. I decided to remove Mirena after my husband I decided it was time to start our family. Removal was painful but quick, it literally felt like a spasm in my gut with a sharp cramp, but after that I've had no problems. I've started a cycle, probably as a result of removing the BC. Overall this method works well, but you have to know your body and what you can handle. It's great for folks who have a hard time remembering to take the pill, or in my case developed DVTs/clots on the pill. I don't think I'll go back on it, but I would reccomend it to folks who have a busy lifestyle, and dont want to worry about things like this. 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	35-44	8/25/2011 4:05:48 PM	I had the Mirena IUD put in 6 months ago and had it removed today. It was incredibly painful when they put it in. I felt I was not properly forewarned of that! I had cramps for the next several days. No periods for the first few months but severe cystic acne. Finally found out this is easily treated with Benzoyl Peroxide.Then came month 6 when I started having anxiety, depression and the worst PMS ever. That was enough for me. The removal it out was easy, barely felt it. Feeling nauseous now so I'm hoping that goes away soon. 
Birth Control	Jsosa86, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	8/24/2011 7:05:56 PM	I had the mirena put in a few weeks ago, just after I had my third baby. When the doctor was putting it in it felt like I was in labor again. A couple hours later I had the worst cramps ever. So at the time of my 2 week checkup to make sure it was in the right place. It WASNT. I had to go for an ultrasound only to be told that is must have falling out. I do not recommend.

I did not experience any side effects and my periods stopped which was wonderful! When my husband and I chose to have another baby, we got pregnant on our first try!
Birth Control	kim, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	8/21/2011 10:47:00 AM	i had the mirena inserted when my daughter was 4 months old, &amp; kept it in for just under 5 yrs. it was removed in 10/2010. my gyno tried to convince me to keep it in longer, but after several conversations with friends in the medical field, i was nervous. the first came about as i was complaining to a friend about all the issues i had been having, &amp; she said, you have the mirena, don't you? &amp; i replied yes, why? &amp; she said those types of complaints are becoming more common with mirena users. so i had it removed. that was pretty painful, my dr said the tissue had started started to grow around it. initially my periods were ok, after not having one for so long, it was easy to handle. but last month my period was 2 wks late. the only other time i've been late was when i was pregnant. there was no chance i could be pregnant. i did some reasearch on the internet, &amp; found a forum where hundreds of women ranging from 19yrs old up age 45, all stating that they were either premenopausal or had already gone through menopause, stating they had all had the mirena, &amp; it was the cause. of course, i started to panic. this month my period was on time, but extremely painful &amp; mostly clots. i will not try the mirena again, &amp; i urge everyone who would like to possibly have children in the future to be extremely cautious. unfortunately, i do not have health ins right now, so i am trying to just wait it out &amp; be hopeful.

Very few periods and light spotting every know and then. I did experience being nauseas the past couple of months. The pass couple of days I have been feeling little flutters in my abdomen. I am feeling like I could be pregnant but from reading other reviews I have seen similiar symptoms except the fluttering. It will be five years in January since i had the mirena inserted. As long as Im not pregnant now I will be making an appt. to get a new one.

When the doctor inserted it there was pain and I did bleed just a little bit. After that my period COMPLETELY STOPPED!!! I didn't notice any side effects up till now! I couldn't figure out for the life of me why I was sooo depressed, nervous and anxious right around the time I would normally get my period! I've never had high blood pressure but I do now, never had trouble breathing- I do now, NEVER got headaches I get them all the time, acne is HORRIBLE, I don't ever feel like having sex, and I've had a few panic attacks! There is no other logical explanation for my behavior other then MIRENA! Do you or anyone you know have the same problems?? I feel like I'm going crazy! I haven't seen a doctor yet but after researching the side effects of Mirena all the problems  and side effects that I've had were ALL listed! It's not worth it anymore! But I will note the only good thing about mirena is that it's  been nice not having to worry about taking a pill everyday and not having my period
Birth Control	TBM, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/15/2011 7:01:43 PM	I, too, have read many unsatisfactory reviews on the Mirena birth control method. I am about a year and a half into my second Mirena and I love it! Insertion and removal were both pretty easy for me, felt like cramps. The main thing is to relax while it's being inserted and removed. After my first was inserted, my first period after lasted three weeks...no joke. For the first year, my periods lasted about two weeks, but they eventually got shorter, lighter, and far between. Now, I may spot a couple of times per year and not even enough to wear a pantyliner. When my second Mirena was inserted, I never experienced the three week periods like I did with the first one. I only felt a little like I had morning sickness every once in awhile. My nurse-midwife explained to me that my uteran wall was already thinned, so with the new progestin in the Mirena was going straight into my system and making me feel that way. Since then, I feel fine...just have achy breasts every once in awhile. I never feel it, however, my boyfriend does complain on occasion that he can feel the strings and they sometimes hurt him during intercourse. When that happens we either change positions or I've learned that I can tuck the strings around the side of my cervix. My Mirena really is the best thing I have ever used for birth control. I have never had a pregnancy scare on it, or ever worried that I may become pregnant, I was told that as long as I can feel the strings, it's working. My nurse-midwife told me that she hasn't seen any failures on it and she has been practicing for as long as it's been around. 
Birth Control	Crystal, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	8/15/2011 12:45:39 PM	I have read so many horror stories on the mirena so I thought I would share my experience to help those who are thinking about trying it. I've only had my mirena for 6 days so far but I am very happy with it so far. Insertion was not painful at all, a little cramping but if you've had children it's nothing compared to child birth. Spotted for 2 days afterwards. Also had a headache the first 3 days but now I could be happier. It is perfect for me since I've had bad problems with every other bc I've tried. 
Birth Control	RaiderFan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/14/2011 11:22:55 PM	I had Mirena put in about a week ago. It was uncomfortale at most but only lasted a few hours. By the next day I could not even feel it. I only bled for two days. After having our son my Husband and I have decided we are not quite ready for another child and having this gives us a great peace of mind.  Sex was not uncomfortable at all. We could not tell a difference. So far I would recommend having this inserted. 
Birth Control	lauren, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	8/11/2011 6:32:29 PM	Mirena has been a mixed bag for me. I have had it for 18 months, and it is perfect at preventing pregnancy. However, the side effects have been so bad that I've scheduled an appointment to have it removed. I have terrible mood swings that have almost destroyed my marraige, very decreased sex drive, minor weight gain,  and cystic acne. On the upside, I no longer have periods and I don't have any cramping or discomfort. I'll have to find something else that works without turning me into a monster.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Txgal, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	8/10/2011 12:58:10 AM	I had a Paraguard IUD but switched because I had heavy periods (pre-dating Paraguard). Everything had seemed to be fine. I've been having trouble losing weight and just blamed it on other life changes. I finally recognized the correlation of symptoms to the Mirena. The posts even support my hair loss being attributable. I am scheduled to have it removed in a couple of weeks. I noticed another review saying she felt like being pregnant. YES! I have felt that way, too. My stomach is even rounded and I somewhat waddle, just like when I was pregnant 5 years ago.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/8/2011 3:00:00 PM	Insertion was agonising, but subsided after about an hour. Bled for 6wks on &amp; off. 3mnths later I'm ecstatic not to have extended bleeding. Only downside is bleeding after intercourse, no pain though. Lasts for a few hours so makes me self conscious.
Birth Control	Would not recommend , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	8/7/2011 10:15:47 PM	I opted for this after my third child - insertion was more painful than 16 hours of pitocin contractions with no epidural! I begged them to stop after their third attempt but they got it in on the fourth. Bled for the next month and a half. After that it was okay in the period department - random spotting and cramping but that was it. As time went on though bleeding after intercourse got worse, sex drive was declining and couldn't lose weight to save my life so chose to have it removed after a year and a half. No pain at all on removal and nurse midwife was surprised I'd had it in as long as I had - she's had a lot of complaints about it. I would not recommend this product. 
Birth Control	REDLADYJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	35-44	8/3/2011 5:29:16 PM	I have had the Mirena for almost 5yrs and in the process of getting it removed next month and contemplating tubular ligation on insertion of a new one. During insertion it was uncomfortable but tolerable.  Since I have had it I didn't experience much discomfort up until last year.  Generally, I am in pain during and after intercourse and bleed as if I am on my cycle. My cycles have always been light in the past but were unpredictable so I always wear pantiliners as a precaution.  I do cramp now more often, have gas and bloating, headaches and get my cycle several times a month which lasts most times 7-14 days but are very light.  I do have an occassional heavy cycle.  Also, I can feel pressure in my pelvic area at times and pain.  I have gained 30lbs over the last 5yrs and have been having a hard time losing it, I am always fatigued and sluggish. I have had several bacterial infections and attribute it to the mirena since I never had them in the past. I am losing hair but fortunately its not noticeable at this point. I am not trying to say that mirena is not a good product but I am having more issues now than in the past.
Birth Control	Ruby, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	8/3/2011 1:13:41 PM	I got mirena put in 3 years ago. The insertion was painful but tolerable. I bled very little and had little cramping. After about 6 months i stopped having periods completely. I loved not having periods! However, after the first year i started gaining weight and i was a very active person always exercising. Then i started having 2 to 3 periods a month!! me no likey!! So I went to my gyno she said everything was fine, the mirena was in place and she put me on birth control pills to straighten out my periods. I also started having TERRIBLE pelvic pain that sent me to the er several times. Turned out the pain was caused by ovarian cysts. I get them consistently since having the mirena. Also sex sometimes hurts and I bleed after. My boyfriend gets poked by the strings and he hates it. So since the mirena i've been gaining weight, can't sleep, very fatigue, pelvic pain, body aches, muscle weakness, hair loss,and headaches. But the doctors still tell me it's not the birth control. But after reading these reviews how could it not be!
Birth Control	NurseBailey, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	8/2/2011 3:33:25 PM	I'm a nurse, and I've had the Mirena for right at 3 years, and the first 2 1/2 years were great! Very few periods, the ones I did have were 3 days or less. But the last 6 months have been AWFUL. Pelvic pain, mostly on my right side in the area of my right ovary often feeling like heavy cramping and muscle spasm, painful intercourse that has caused bleeding, and now my periods are lasting 2 or more weeks!! I went to have the device checked by my family doctor, and part of the device has fused to my uterine wall...so now I have to have it removed, possibly surgically in three weeks. Also, I have four other friends my age with this same device, and we've all experienced continual hair loss throughout the time we've had these devices. I'm the last one of my girlfriends to get mine removed. I believe the Mirena does it's job, because I have not gotten pregnant within the last three years. My husband only complains occasionally of being able to feel it during intercourse. BUT...I think it should be taken out after the first two to three years. Most of the reviews I have read and people I've talked with, and in my own experience as well, this device is great for that period of time. It seems the side effects begin to show up fairly quickly after that time. Hope this helps!!
Birth Control	angelsoul8908, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	19-24	7/30/2011 12:55:01 PM	My daughter was born August 19, 2009. I had mirena inserted April of 2010. It was painful, but nothing compared to giving birth. It does its job as I've not gotten pregnant to my knowledge and my periods have been shorter and more spread out. The things I do not like is a very long list I regret to say. First off, Sex at some angles hurt alot not to mention my husband has been scratched many times. My sex drive does not seem has high as it was pre-mirena, which sucks because what's the use of having an IUD, if you don't feel like having sex as much? Once a month or so, I feel as if I am pregnant, I've been having cravings, butterflies, pain, bloating, fatigue, and weight gain. I know those are some of the side effects of mirena, but should I really be feeling something moving on the inside? At times I'm certain I'm pregnant but when I go to the docter, the urine test comes back negative. I've been so tired lately at at times it's hard keeping up with my 2 year old. Has anyone else felt like they were pregnant? I know the exact feeling seeing as I've already been down that road. lol. If I were giving a second shot, I would have used something other then Mirena. The side effects are just too much. Though I'm constantly fighting with myself if it's bad enough to worry about the hassle of getting it removed. Has anyone had similiar problems?
Birth Control	Meli, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/29/2011 4:12:59 PM	I recently got mirena inserted on 7/27/11. I have to say I was pretty scared to get it done, reading all these bad reviews but I still decided to give it a try. Getting it inserted did not hurt at all,took about 5 mins, had no cramping just a little bleeding which stopped in couple hours. I forget I even have it in.  I haven't had any problems. So far I'm happy with Mirena. 
Birth Control	tamprtch, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	7/29/2011 3:37:52 PM	I went today to have the Mirena inserted.  I took 800mg of ibuprofen 1 hour prior as recommended. The doctor began the process, the cramping and pain was tremendous for me.  He said he didnt think I would  do well with the Mirena even if he could finish the insertion because he thought it would cause me severe cramping every month with the pain I was having just with insertion.  So he stopped and I didnt get it.  It has been 7 hours and I am still cramping and bleeding just from him clamping the cervix and beginning the dilation of the cervix for measurements of the uturus.  I don't know how anyone can do it without being knocked out first.  I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia years ago which does  cause overactive nerve  sensors and the pain threshold to be less. 
Birth Control	Queenqbh, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	7/28/2011 10:24:39 PM	I had my Mirena inserted 6/16/2011 six weeks after having my first child, Implanting the Mirena was painless compared to natural child birth lol. My boyfriend has no problems with the threads and he has a very large package. My fingers are to short to reach my threads so my boyfriend checks for the threads periodically. Mireana may be the best birth controll i have ever tryed. I havent experienced any of the horrible side effects mentioned on this site.I love my mirena so far, if anything changes i will be sure to write a review.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	7/28/2011 11:43:22 AM	I got the mirena 7 wks after giving birth and had it for 7months. I had it removed because of the drastic changes that accured around the 6month. I had bad cramping, horrible mood swings that seemed like never ending PMS, i started gaining weight and this all made me feel so depressed and my husband was really having a hard time understanding why i was so bitchy all the time! I let this go on for about a month before i put it all together and made the appt. to have it removed. I immediately felt better the next day. My sister has had it now for 2yrs and has had many of the same issues but the dr. talked her out of removing it and is trying an antideppresent to help with the mood swings but she also has had the weight gain and cant seem to work it off. i know everyone is different but just keep all the side effects in mind before getting one for yourself.

I started having bad migraines, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, decreased sex drive, mood swings in dec '10 Went to the doctor in feb '11 discussing my symptoms and they gave me some pain meds and nausea meds. Which helped for a little bit the meds made me feel wierd like i was on autopilot. So i went back again, gave me different meds, which i couldnt take upset stomach along with my regular symptoms then i kept having this pain, and hardness in my lower left abdomen, painful sex, doctor said my cervix and uterus were swollen, cramping, just horrible pain and very annoying. went to the doctor again she told me i had a pelvic infection due to mirena and if i keep getting them it will decrease the chance of conceiving later on in life. (i want more kids :)) I take 2 different meds 4 times a day for 10 days  i see a little improvement, which didnt last long. I had the worst migraine ive ever had in my life and vomiting so i go to the hospital, waited for 5 and a half hours finally got seen by a doctor, he gave me and inflammation shot and a pain killer for head. i was feeling great, the next day the inflammation hadnt wore of yet, had no pain it was amazing... even though i had slept allll day long, the next day the paion had returned, I decided to go to the doctor and demand they take this stupid thing out which they did, had slight spotting little cramping, that day i started the nuvaring, which is effective, but i am still having painful sex, pelvic pain, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, mood swings. If anyone else has had any of these symptoms, or a relief for this please let me know. Thanks
Birth Control	kat, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	7/26/2011 10:07:36 AM	I got the Mirena put in about 6 months ago, 7 weeks after having my baby. the insertion didnt hurt, i actually didnt fel it at all. it took about 10 min tops to insert. i do recommend taking some sort of motron before appointment to ease the pain. after insertion i had a 32 day period, wasnt really expecting that. but after that was finally done i rarely have a period. its not monthly and when i do have a period its light, not even enought to put a tampon in. although intercourse has been at times a little painful, but not too bad (not enough to want to remove it) the mirena overall has been awesome! i have never been able to take any other kind of birth control. it always made me sick, too much hormones in it i guess. and i could never remember to take it. so this is great for those of you who cant remember. and my partner has never complained about being able to feel it.

It is reliable &amp; you don't have to worry about forgeting itbut it has caused painful intercourse, my husband can feel it &amp; sometimes scratches him, I have had a hard time controlling my weight &amp; that was never an issue before &amp; caused my skin to breakout which wasn't an issue before either.

Other	Sugarplum77, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	7/25/2011 2:00:03 PM	I had the mirena fitted in April after being told that it was great,I have 4 children and am not planning any more so this was a perfect solution,I had it fitted whilst having a biopsy on my womb so I felt no pain and recovered quickly.I didn't think I had any issues until I started loosing hair.At first I didn't make ant connection,but found it hard to figure why I had never suffered alopecia before,after researching I found that one of the side effects of the coil is alopecia but it is not noted on the information booklet as only 1 in 20 women suffer,I have now got 3 huge bald patches and half an eyebrow missing,all in the space of 3 months,to say I am shocked is an understatement,I have also been for my first check to find that the strings are missing so now I am awaiting a scan to find it before I can ask for it to be removed!,I have never felt so let down by a contraceptive and can't wait to get rid of it,I'm glad it works for a lot of women but for me it has failed miserably,I'm not likely to get pregnant because I feel so ugly,not because of the coil it's self!...just please be aware of ALL the side effects,I wasn't when I had it put in.......I wish I had been.

Now I have pain in my pelvic area often, and swelling. Ive had to go to the hospital for the pain and ive seen my gyno, but both say everything is fine. Hopefully itll work itself out because my doctors arent doing anything and arent concerned. I really wouldnt recommend getting this form of birth control if you arent ready for the pain that comes with it.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	7/20/2011 5:42:14 PM	 I have had the Mirena for 3 years now. Heavier menstral cycles and painful intercourse for me from day one. I feel so miserable with this birth control method. I've had pain so severe that Ive had to go to the hospital. 
Birth Control	MeeCee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	7/18/2011 3:51:48 PM	I have had Mirena for about a year and a half. Before getting it I would recommend you learn all that is involved with it. The day of implantation, you should take the strongest pain med your doctor approves. I had what felt like contractons the first day and some discomfort the next two days. I also experienced mood swings in the months following my procedure. The only complaint I have is that I never seem to stop spotting. I have to wear a pad everyday. There are even days when I think I'm having a period. It's affecting my sex life with my husband. I am thinking of having the Mirena removed and returning to Depo. 
Birth Control	Emily, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/14/2011 11:15:08 AM	I had the Mirena inserted 6 months after having my first child.  As for the insertion experience, I didn't experience any pain.  (Then again, I had it inserted post-baby, so my pain threshold has increased dramatically.)  That being said, I did experience a slight visceral reaction (which if you've never had it, can only be compared to a wave of nausea), but it dissipated after a few minutes.  I experienced intermittent cramping for 2-3 days, but nothing that required OTC medication.  I spotting for about 3-months afterwards, so I wore a pantyliner almost always, even though it was barely enough blood to change it more than once or twice a day.  After 3 months, I began experiencing intermittent periods that lasted about 3-5 days, but they were much lighter than before AND I experienced no bloating, cramping, breakouts, etc.,  that have always been associated with my cycles.  Eventually, the period is supposed to cease all together, for which I am incredibly thankful.  (Especially because they are associating higher rates of reproductive cancers with woman who menstruate regularly for decades with no interruption.)  Regarding sex: My partner has never been able to feel them and they have caused me no discomfort.  Overall, the Mirena has been an extremely positive experience.  I usually forget that I even have it.
Birth Control	Charis, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/13/2011 7:16:31 PM	Im 26, have had Mirena for four years, and I love it. Yes, insertion was painful. I think the doctor who did my insertion was not very experienced with IUDs because she cut the strings too short. You're supposed to check that it's in place after every period but I can't feel the strings; however my doctor checks it every year with ultrasound and says it's fine, it's in the right place. Over time, Mirena changed my periods from a moderate flow to light spotting. I haven't needed to use a tampon in years. My overall experience with Mirena has been a breeze. I haven't had any of the nightmare side effects that some of the other reviewers experienced. I recommend at least trying Mirena if you're looking for an easy, highly effective birth control method, and are in a monogamous relationship (or are very good about using condoms every time). Research it and see if it fits with your lifestyle. For me, getting Mirena was the best possible decision to make. My boyfriend (now husband) and I knew I needed to finish graduate school and get a job before even thinking of having kids. I never want to be in a situation where I'd have to choose between ending a pregnancy or having a baby before I'm emotionally and financially ready for it. Mirena has made birth control a no brainer for me.

I have had three periods since I got it put in 6 months ago. The first one lasted 6 weeks but it was light spotting. Since then each has just mostly been light spotting and lasted less than a week. I hardly cramp now and my face is clear! I love not having to worry about taking a pill every day or getting pregnant. It's carefree birth control! love it!
Birth Control	Tam, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	35-44	7/13/2011 12:27:59 PM	I first had the Paraguard inserted in 2008 and had it removed just 6 short months after, due to heavy, clotty, painful periods. I went along with my dr's suggestion to try Mirena, and I am scheduled to have it removed in two weeks. Over the last 3 yrs, i have and still currently experience fatigue, cycles that 1) last for two weeks and heavy, 2)random, or 3)spot for weeks on end. Even after having the strings trimmed, my significant other still feels them. I have had at LEAST 3 yeast infections this year alone, odor, and brown yucky discharge. I never had a problem with acne, but this has my face looking like connect the dots. All my personal experience...need I say more??
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	7/12/2011 8:26:37 PM	I had the device put in on May 5, 2011. It was a painful insertion but bearable. My experience with the Mirena has been hell. I went from a 3 day period pre-merina to bleeding everyday for 2 1/2 months. (flowing like a water fountain) I currently still have the device in and am taking birth control pills as well to slow down the bleeding. I researched and spoke with others prior to getting it and heard nothing but good reviews....my body just seems to wanna reject it. I plan to have it removed really soon.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/10/2011 4:03:46 PM	I got Mirena about 3 weeks ago. Insertion was extremely painful, and i cramped only pretty bad for 2 days, but then only slight cramps. I didn't even spot. But then I tried to have sex. I was unaware that the &quot;strings&quot; that hang down into your vagina are long metal coils. My boyfriend can feel them during sex and they are extremely sharp and painful.My doctor supposedly trimmed them all the way back, but we could both still feel them.I had my Mirena removed after having it in for 3 weeks. I immediately felt a mood change and saw more acne. I had slight cramps the entire 3 weeks and towards the end was cramping during sex.  I knew deep down that Mirena was not right for me but felt I had no other choices. The pill had given me high blood pressure so I needed to take something without estrogen. I can see how Mirena would work for some people, however I think it really depends on how you and your partner are shaped. My boyfriend is a little on the larger side and also uncircumcised, which I think has something to do with it. There is no way that something like Mirena could work for everyone. I would also appreciate if the Mirena pamphlet was more upfront about what kind of &quot;micro-filaments&quot; they are using because it's not really clear that it is a metal coil. When I went to have Mirena removed the doctor lectured me and tried to guilt trip me into keeping it. So i'd say really think about all of the consequences and what is right for you and your partner. It's one thing to start and stop a pill or a patch but it's a completely other story having something implanted into your body that hurts your boyfriend, and not being able to remove it. That was the worst feeling. 
Birth Control	oscardagrouch, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	45-54	7/9/2011 2:48:24 AM	Im 45 and went on the mirena when I was 41. I think it is great for birth control - but I am beginning to wonder about the side effects. I also have to consider that I moved countries and went into a new career all around the same time as beginning to use the IUD. I have been suffering with depression pretty much since arriving in Australia.  This also happens to be about the ame amount of time I have been using a mirena. - I have highs and lows. The other thing is in the last 2 years I have put on alot of weight and have no motivation to exercise anymore, and I use to be very active and currently I do a very physical job.  I will be replacing it soon but will discuss more my experience with the doctor and perhaps there will be better options than just the mirena for me. I am not ready to 'neuter' myself by getting my tubes tied. But I dont want to have any more kids. Really what WE WANT is a contraceptive that has NO side effects except that it gives me heaps of energy and  makes me feel FANTASTIC!!! - anyone working on that at the moment???  
Birth Control		5	5	5			7/8/2011 8:47:35 PM	I would recommend it in a heartbeat. I have had it for 2 yrs now. Insertion was hardly painfull, it felt like a pinch at the most and no weight gain. I was told that it would decrease period flow at the very least, if not eliminate it totally. That's exactly what has happened. I've maybe had 2 periods since and they were extremely light, never lasting more than half a day.  I find it hard to believe that it can be felt during intercourse since it's in your uterus. I hope this helps your decision.
Birth Control	scared , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	7/8/2011 1:14:00 AM	I decided to post a review because after reading several, the only reviews I found are of recent users. I had mine put in 3 years ago. It was painful during insertion,  but tolerable. For most of the time I have used mirena, I have been satisfied, although my spouse can feel it during penetration. I am currently experiencing severe pain after sex, for the second time. I regret getting it and plan to have it removed immediately. The pain is bad enough to call 911!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	kathryn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	7/6/2011 7:16:20 PM	I had the Mirena inserted in March 2011. Insertion totally painless and troublefree. I spotted for 2 months, then had hardly any period. HOWEVER after 3 months, I detected a large, hard , thick area in my breast. Was NOT there previously. Went through some scary biopsies and it was benign, however, I realized that if you read the Physician Insert (rather than the Patient Insert- they are different!) that Breast Cancer is listed as a possible side effect. My psychiatrist also strongly recommended getting it removed. So I am next week. I'd rather have a hysterectomy than live with those risks. 
Birth Control	mstxnkc, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/6/2011 4:39:08 PM	I had my IUD inserted six weeks after my second child in 2007. I chose to use Mirena after extensive research and found it to be the best one for my situation. I have not experienced any unusual pain since having it inserted. My periods became lighter and lighter over the course of three months until they stopped all-together. My husband cannot feel it during intercourse. I will be taking it out next summer and will use Mirena in the future for birth control. 
Birth Control	dogluvr, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	7/5/2011 4:35:15 PM	After reading a LOT of horror stories, I decided most people only write negative things. I decided to try Mirena. I've been on Hormonal Birth control for 12 years straight. I'm 28 no children or pregnancies. But, I smoke and my Doctor wanted me off all the hormones. It was painful to get inserted, I cramped for a day, and now I'm fine. I've had no pain, no spotting (though I've been on birthcontrol so long it could be my lining is thinner which stops bleeding. I haven't had a period in 3 years anyway). But my husband and I can't feel it, I go for my check up in 2 months, but so far so good. Oh and I lost about 3# the first week. :) Just try it ladies, if it doesn't work for you, take it out. But, if you've been on the pill for a long time like me, remember some of the side effects are from your body being OFF hormones for the first time..... I would reccomend this to other women as a form of worry/hassle free birth control
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	1	3	Female	25-34	7/5/2011 4:16:28 AM	After reading some of the comments, I find it necessary to write about my Mirena...I have it in for about 3 years &amp; I pretty much debate daily whether or not to take it out. Fortunately, I haven't had any acne problems or yo-yo weight issues, but have been plagued with occasional but painful cramps. Before getting the Mirena I never had a yeast infection, now I average about 2-3 a year. And sex hurts...which is a freaking bummer. I don't doubt it's effectiveness, I'm in my 30's &amp; super fertile (pregnant twice, once on NuvaRing &amp; the other on the pill within a couple of months) so my options were pretty limited - my doc recommended &amp; I agreed. However, now that I know what I know I probably would have never had it put in me. The other thing that annoys me(I've noticed this being mentioned often) is that my doctor as well turned the whole conversation around, asking me what I was doing differently &amp; that in no way possible was the Mirena causing any of these symptoms. I think at one point she said that it's still early, but it's been 3 years now, and I'm sure the little thing is causing my discomfort.
Birth Control	Unsatisfied,  Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		7/3/2011 10:59:19 PM	This is the WORST piece of garbage ever invented.  I would not wait until worse side effects occur, get it removed immediately.  Don't let the doctor talk you into keeping it, I was miserable for six weeks.  Side effects i had included, bleeding, painful intercourse, hair loss, insomnia, and hives.  (Also it was uncomfortable when i sit down.)I really don't know why doctors push for you to keep it, remember its your body.
Birth Control	No Regrets, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/30/2011 2:24:10 PM	I had my Mirena IU placed approximately 12 weeks after the birth of my 1st child.  I have had no regrets.  Placement was no more painful than a Pap Smear and while I did experience some mild cramping post placement a single dose of Advil solved that.  I never had any spotting or bleeding.  I have not had a &quot;period&quot; since Nov 2007 (the month prior to conception of our son) -- I expected this since I was breastfeeding at the time of placement but did take pregnancy tests monthly for the 1st year just in case.  The Mirena had no adverse affects on my breastfeeding or milk supply.  I have not experienced any additional weight gain and have actually return to my pre-pregnancy weight.  I will be having the Mirena removed next week as we try to conceive our next child -- but I will definitely consider using the Mirena again.   
Birth Control	LadyDee27, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	6/30/2011 1:10:17 AM	I had My Mirena inserted 6/13/11. I was nervous getting it put in but my doctor talked me through the process which felt alot like menstrual cramps. Afterwards I got dressed and took Tylenol to ease my pain. As soon as I was about to leave I started feeling weak like I couldnt walk I felt nauseous and my pain was concentrated on my left side and I couldnt sit up straight. I ended up being in the clinic waiting room for about 45 mins waiting for my meds to kick in contemplating on having it removed right away. Thankfully pain subsided and for the first few days i had mild cramping and very light bleeding. After a week and a half I started breaking out on my face shoulders back and chest(bumps the size of a head on a straight pin) nothing horrible. I noticed I'm alot more tired now and I'm basically bleeding all day every day and the cramps are worse than before(I had a heavy flow before Mirena) and the clots that I'm passing are just ridiculously huge compared to before. The sex hasnt been affected...hopefully it stays that way but its very annoying bleeding all day and half the night and cramping all the time. I'm really trying to hold out and see if it gets better as time goes on and I'm hoping I get to be as lucky as a few ladies who stopped getting their periods. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	6/29/2011 11:58:09 AM	I had the mirena put in April of 2010 for heavy and painful periods. That was the worst decision of my life!! The insertion was HORRIBLLY PAINFUL! The worst pain I've ever felt. I was in pain for weeks before I felt the tiniest bit of relief. The cramps and back pain was unbearable.I couldnt even sit down! On top of that, my bowels were a mess! I have IBS and it was all out of wack - severly constipated and pains in my stomach. It then switched to severe diarrhea. It got so bad I had to see a GI specialist. I felt like I was having constant problems and constant pain.I was still cramping and bleeding 6 mo later. I had the placement checked and cultures done to rule out infections. I also gained 8 lbs instantly and it was impossible to get rid it. I couldnt exercise w/o having terrible cramps. I also had constant headaches, lasting for a month at a time. After 1 year, my period had regulated somewhat. I could not use tampons as they were uncomfortable and had to deal with pads. The cramps were still bad - 2 weeks out of the month. My sex drive was completely gone and if I did have sex, I usually bled afterwards, cramped or was uncomfortable. I finally found a doctor who would help. She did an exam and found a large cyst on my ovary. I had to have several ultrasounds to monitor the size. The cyst continued to grow and not break down so my doc said it was time for the IUD to come out since cysts are a side effect. I had it removed 3 weeks ago - it was completly painless!! I barely felt anything! It was an immediate sense of relief! I was put on the pill to help break down the cyst. I have already lost most of the weight. My stomach feel great, my moods are better, my sex drive is coming back,I have energy again, I'm not in any pain and I don't feel like I'm going crazy anymore! So far getting the mirena removed was the best thing I could have done! I def. regret ever having it! The pain and side effects are NOT worth it at all! I WOULD NOT RECCOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE

My pelvic area has pains that I've never felt before! I have longer periods it seems that it won't ever stop, I hate it n my bf does too we can't ever have sex like we used to because as soon as my stomach cramps(3-4 times a week) I bleed sometimes it stops other times I bleed for weeks straight. I am having mine removed before I go crazy!

I have 2 children and wanted  a good birth control. I had continual cramping and was on darvasets to ease the pain nothing took it away and I bleed for 14 days straight every 28 days. To top that off if I even attempted intercourse my cramps got unbearable to the point of rocking  for a day in bed trying desperately to ease them. I had it removed 7 months ago and I my periods are all messed up I still have the extra 15lbs. I gained on it and I have mood swings worse than I have ever had in my life. Oh and I am a true red head. Apparently according to my anesthesiologist that means I am an alien and normal meds wont work on me.

The insertion process was horrible. I got cut on my cervix by my feeble old doctor. I also experience heavy cramping and bleeding after. My usual periods are 3 days long, no cramping and not very heavy. I since have had irregular and messy periods, here today gone tomorrow. I am always cramping, angry and not to mention inserting a tampon(the smallest one being an ob ) is painful. I have been told that my husband feels the strings every time we have sex(which is like 1 time after 4 months), its just too painful for us both. He feels like he is getting cut and I feel my insides being turned out. I can't take it! I also bleed heavily after sex and my stomach hurts for hours. I can't help but think its been put in the wrong place. I never want to get this again but I do need to find a dr here to get it removed.

The very next day I woke up thinking I had had a stroke..my eye wouldnt blink, mouth hung down on one side..I had Bells Palsy. I was told it was not due to the Mirena(but I wonder)I have continued to suffer from nuerological ailments and severe pain since that time. I also suffer from recurring infections in and around my cervix. I am having it removed to give my body a chance to heal. In all fairness, my sister also has the Mirena and completely loves it without problems
Birth Control	our bodies are different...,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female		6/20/2011 3:18:28 PM	AFter having my second child I was on the mirena for almost 5 years but took it out few months early. The process to put it in was painful b/c the first insert it didn't go in properly so my doctor got it in the second time around. It was great to know that my husband and I didn't have to prepare to have sex but through out the 4 years my sex drive began to decrease. Depression, weight gain, cramps(no bleeding until the 4th year). No, I wouldn't recommend this. I know every women body will react differently but most of the women in my life that are on this are either on mood medication or dealing with acne.

I never had a yeast infection until I got this IUD in after my second child. I finally had it removed today after I got my 3rd yeast infection within a 5 month time frame. I also gained weight and did not have a sex drive.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/15/2011 12:48:17 PM	I Had the mirena in for 5 years 2 months and just got it taken out today to have a new one put in.  I must say, the 2nd time around is alot more painful than the first.  It took longer due to the fact they had to take the first one out which let me tell you, feels like they are pulling your uterus out, then putting the other one in almost made me pass out, not quite sure why this is but I'm hoping that was the worst of it.  It was so perfect before.

For the first year I still had normal periods with cramps, After the first year my periods stopped however I would still cramp SEVERELY once a month like I would for a period (only without the flow). That lasted about 2 years. Then about a year and a half ago I started bleeding again, except it was VERY light and would only last about 2-3 days, even though the cramping would last 5. I would say that the SEVERE cramps were the only problem I have had with Mirena, but I am going to get it removed next week which is a few months early but that is only because my other half had a vasectomy and I no longer see the point of putting myself through the cramps if I don't need birth control. I'm not sure yet if I will go back on the pill or not to minimize period flow....

It hurt like hell! but my period also stopped yesterday. Today was the only day that I could get it inserted. The doctors warned me of this so I took pain meds before going. I have been resting for the whole day but at this point i just feel like Im having period cramping. I believe I should be ok by tomorrow. I am a little scared bc I keep reading about people and there partners feeling the string. The whole point of this is bc I am in a long lasting relationship and we recently got tested together and decided not to se condoms any more. I really hope this isnt the case bc the poking will damper the moment! I have never had children and I dont want any anytime soon so I figured this would be the best option. I hope it goes well! cheers to 5 years
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	6/6/2011 8:28:05 PM	Im 22 years old and I had the Mirena put in about a year and a half ago about a year after my first child. Before I got Mirena I had very heavy periods...pretty much my whole life. After mirena I had regular some what light at times periods for about a year. In the past two or three months I have recently been having no periods, but brown spotting instead. Kind of freaky. Not to mention Im constantly having cramps ....mostly in left side the whole time ive had it. Discharge....bloating....weight gain...bacterial infections...everything changed until I got it out. Needless to say i was not satisfied. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	6/5/2011 8:05:48 PM	Hi im emma, im 19 and i just got my mirena put in a couple weeks ago, before the mirena, i found out i was pregnant, went to an abortion clinic and chickened out when i found out it was twins, decided to go back only to find out they were both not alive so they gave me 2 needles in the butt and pills to soften the cervix and i had my very painfull misscarriage. They strongly recommended the mirena 5 year IUD, I got one from my doctor and went back to (choice in health clinic)Putting in the mirena was the worst expierence ever, insertion hurt like no tomorrow and after it was complete i passed out and had a seizure.I was sore for about 3 days, 3 weeks later im still spotting with random bad cramps
Birth Control	Kimberly, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	6/3/2011 8:50:06 AM	Well I had Mirena inserted a little over a month ago (because I can't have any other birth-control) and I dont know how to feel yet. It was very painful for them to put it in, and then I HURT all the rest of the day (crampy). These cramps lasted much like a period (3-5 days). Now it's not so bad. However, I do still occassionally get cramps though. And my husband swears that it &quot;pokes&quot; him sometimes during intercourse. I go back for my &quot;check up&quot; in 2 weeks, so we'll go from there I guess.. :)
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/3/2011 8:36:49 AM	I had it placed in march 2011, It was not painfull like others had explained. Not even a pinch! A couple of hrs i did expierance some mild to moderate cramping for just the night and it was gone. My periods were always super heavy and that is a thing of the past! I spoted for a couple of days for the first 2 months then it stoped. sooo nice : ) I havent had any of the scary side effects like some women have reported. I did have maybe a hand full of random cramps but it has stoped (3 months) My husband nor i can feel the &quot;threads&quot; I think the girls who had pain while insertion had it done WRONG. you shouldnt feel really anything! my dr filded the &quot;threads over so you can feel them but they don't &quot;poke&quot; your partner. Overall i am very satisfyed with the mirena so far. I do have some breast tenderness,(little) which is normal for hormonal birth controll users. I had some moderate bloating b4 it would of been my period. then went away. I recomend it to girls who have had a child because your uterus is been subjected to objects being inside. To the women who had problems with it, you are prolly sensitive to the hormane AND the dr, who put it in didn't do it right!!! I do recomend you take the day off of work or other activites the day you have it inserted, so you can ajust to the IUD. I would deffinatly get another if it continues to be great like this : ) 
Birth Control	trieditall, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/2/2011 9:34:29 PM	I had tried several birth control methods and they all made sick (vomiting, nausea, dizziness) After having my first child I decided to try the mirena since nothing else worked. I have had it for over 4 years and I love it. No nausea or vomiting etc. No &quot;bad&quot; side effects, the only side effect is I dont get a period! that is a plus to me! I am due to have it removed in a few months and I having only one child is will 5 by then I may try to have a second child, but if I decide not to, I will definetly have another mirena put in for the next 5 years! I love it!
Birth Control	Xx_lc_xX, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/2/2011 9:58:51 AM	I'm 24 and I chose this type of birth control b/c I'm horrible at taking the pill and horrible at using even the Nuva-ring. Also, I am temporarily living abroad and this is the easiest and most effective choice for me. I read a ton of reviews before deciding to go this route. So far, after a little over 5 months, I am really happy I chose Mirena.The insertion took about 15 minutes and was a little awkward and hurt a bit because of the cramping but not unbearable. I took some Tylenol before going to the appointment like my doc told me, drove there, had the insertion, bled a tiny bit into the panty liner they gave me, drove to a holiday work dinner with a bit of discomfort but survived. It took about a month for the cramping and uneasiness to go away but now, I don't even realize it's there.A bad thing about this is that my skin has been breaking out by no longer taking the pill and being in a different environment. That's a downside but the best part about Mirena is no more periods! Each month, I may have a little brown discharge but don't need panty liner or tampons or anything.I plan to keep Mirena in for the whole 5 years and hopefully afterwards, I won't have any problems getting pregnant if I want. I heard some rumors that you shouldn't choose an IUD if you haven't ever been pregnant but I guess I will find out if that's true in 4.5 years. Wish me luck.

I've had morning sickness and other pregnancy symtpoms for the 2 years I had it. After a few short months it got lost in my uterus, but I didn't have insurance for removal. I worried all the time about it, until last week when it was removed. The procedure was the WORST pain ever, worse than 3 childbirths, worse than a bad kidney stone! Now, a few days later, I have an infection from the procedure, which involved a night of teriible pain, vomiting, diarrhea and such a high fever I was delusional. I thought this would be the easiest birth control with no side effects, but this ordeal is not worth it! I wish I could put up signs everywhere telling women to never risk it -- you may not have these problems, but it's just not worth the risk in my opinion. If I'd known of these possibilities, I never, ever would have chosen it. It's easier to have a baby than go through that removal and infection!
Birth Control	Ms. Crawley, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/1/2011 12:47:32 PM	I love Mirena and would recommend it to any female seeking long term birth control medication!  It was a bit uncomfortable to have inserted but not unbearable.  I had no problems with pain afterward.  It has dramatically decreased my menstrual flow. I haven't suffered any of the side effects mentioned by other reviewers. It's great!
Birth Control	amy lane, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/1/2011 1:29:14 AM	I have been on mirena now for almost 5 years must have it removed in sept.  The day I had it &quot;installed&quot; I went to the dr at 10:00 that morning and went to work that afternoon at 2:00 pm.  Huge mistake.  I should have called in sick and not went that day.  After that day, it did take several months for me to feel &quot;normal&quot; again, but i have stopped having periods.  For that part totally worth it to me and not remembering to take a pill daily.  I am still trying to decide if I should get a new one in sept.  or to try something else.  I would consider getting my &quot;tubes tied&quot; but that would mean having periods every month. blah.  (P.S.Does anyone else still &quot;fill there strings&quot;? I no longer can and my husband has never complained about it bothering him)
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	5/29/2011 9:35:14 PM	I got Mirena 7 months ago, due to extremely painful periods. I am 25 and have no children. Getting the mirena was very painful but the pain did not last long. I have had cramping with the mirena but nothing in comparison to before I got it. I would only recommend this to someone who is doing it for period issues and not just as a birth control. No weight gain, depression, or libido change. Although I do seem to get more headaches.

Birth Control	Amy , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	5/25/2011 9:52:01 AM	I have been on Mirena for 8 months and have recently decided to have it removed. I have experienced a myriad of uncomfortable daily symptoms that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy including: extreme lower back pain, daily spotting/light flow for the first 4 months and sporadic spotting since, nausea during my &quot;period,&quot; weight gain, sporadic acne, weird discharge, depression, and decrease in libido. It also changed the taste of my breast milk causing my infant to reject the breast. My milk supply simply dried up exactly 2 weeks after insertion even with the help of drugs and supplements to boost my supply. My doctor basically told me to &quot;tough it out&quot; because the symptoms/side effects subside after 6 months, and that there was no evidence that it effected breast milk supply (I don't care what the drug company says, it does). I am on month 8, and the symptoms have not subsided. I have NEVER had any side effects with any other type of birth control I have tried in the past. I would encourage women to do some serious research prior to having this device inserted. I felt I was talked into it by my Dr. and insurance company (who paid 100% on Mirena, but will not pay a significant amount on regular birth control pills)due to cost effectiveness and trendiness. I really feel like having the device inserted was one of my worst decisions, and I am just praying that I do not have any permanent issues due to my decision.
Birth Control	brandie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/18/2011 7:40:39 PM	Ok so I got the mirena after trying all and i mean all of the birth controls out there. Depo had to be the absolute worst way ntoo much weight gain in a short time wow! The iud has a little pinching feeling for like two seconds which you can ask for local anestesia, i didnt though. compared to painful messy smelly periods and having to remember pills,which screws up your relationships because you cant even relax thinking you might get pregnant when not ready, mirena iud is awsome. I wished I had placed this long time ago after years of trying all the other methods.  The only thing that i have noticed and it could not be thi iud is after six months or so started tom have insomnia. Which i am now finally being treated for because i jump in myn sleep and cause myself to get out of my sleep patterns, we dont know if its associated with the hormone from the mirens(levonorgestrel) ,i believe its called.n its a low dose, oh forgot to mention, the hormon is centralized for the reproductive part of our body unlike a pill that goes through our blood system first. This is centralized for your ovaries,uterus. Hope it works out for you, as much as it did for me and my family, good luck to all !!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/17/2011 11:47:01 PM	After reading others reviews about mirena I was very nervous about it but still had it inserted because I like the idea of not having to take something daily. It was kind of hard for me to find a doctor to place it because I haven't had a child yet. The only pain I felt was when my doctor was measuring my cervix otherwise everything else didn't hurt it was just uncomfortable. After leaving the office I experienced cramping for 3-4 hours after but that was it and then sometimes I feel spontanous cramping that feels just like period cramps and have experienced occasional spotting. I would highly recommend this to someone looking for birth control and is like me that would forget to take a pill everyday.
Birth Control	maryjane, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	5/17/2011 4:22:16 PM	I wanted to write a review because I was absolutely petrified to get mirena after reading some of the stories on the web.  I have always had painful periods so honestly, the insertion wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  yes it hurt, but only for a moment and it was nothing worse than what i go through on a monthly basis.  I've only had mirena for a little over a month now and i have been spotting a lot but i'm going to give it another two months because not worrying about having to take birthcontrol everyday is worth it.  The cramps come and go but again, I suffered horrible period pain for years so it is bearable.  i got nervous i would gain a ton of weight but so far so good.  I've kept eating right and going to the gym and doing yoga regularly.  every woman is different so of course we will all react differently. 
Birth Control		5	5	4			5/13/2011 4:30:38 PM	I loved the Mirena, had it inserted shortly after the birth of my first child.  I can't recall any related side effects, and while the insertion was mildly painful, I was fine by the next day.  I lost all the baby weight and an additional 10 lbs, so it did not cause weight gain.  Unfortunately, my husband had problems with it because he would feel it poking during intercourse.  I'm surprised no one else has mentioned that.  The GYN shortened the wires, but they were still bothering him, which obviously hampered our sex life!  After 6 months I had it removed and was pregnant 6 weeks later!  Now after my second child I'm using depo, and the side effects seem much worse than Mirena had been.  I'd recommend it to anyone, and wish I could go back on it!

I finally made the decision to have the IUD removed after visiting my dermatologist due to severe acne (something I have never had before).  My dermatologist told me that Mirena is the cause of the acne due to the type of hormones being released.  I also experience daily lower back pain , headaches and decreased libido. I have also been mildly depressed and gained weight. 
Birth Control	Lauren, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/12/2011 12:02:24 PM	The first three months were really hard for me until my body got used to the IUD, Iam a really petite women who has had one baby. The first month my stomach was bloated, and I had really bad cramps. I debated if I should remove it or not, so i spoke with my Gyno and she said to give it a little longer. So I did, and I'am glad I did, no problems since.

It was one of most painful experiences of my life. While walkIng to the room I said tO the nurse I'm really nervous she said oh it's not that bad; she was wrong. After the horrible experience of the insertion a few weeks After I got the worst cramps I ended up going to the er where the male RN thought it was my appendix after I tOld him what was bothering me 5 hours after I went hOme with a script for naproxen i finally got the mirena out today and let me tell you how happy I am. DO NOT GET THE MIRENA UD!!!!! Plus your significant other can feel the strings the hang down so sex if not even enjoyable.

I have no sex drive, gained 30 lbs., horrible mood swings and forever having my peroid.  I dont know what to do.  I'm 28 don't want to have kids but dont want permant fix for a few more years till I'm really sure.  Seems all birth control has horrible side affects.  I cant deal with being chubby crying all the time.

Awesome not having to remever to take a pill everyday and also being able to intimate with my Husband anytime with no worries. Just had it removed after 4 years for planning of baby #2. Really heavy bleeding with clots. Hopefully this is normal. But, I will get another after the next baby!!!

SO nice to not have to think about taking a pill every day or shelling out money every few months for birth control.  i no longer get my period, but will occasionally have very light spotting.  I am 28 and dont have any children and was heistant to get an IUD, but my OB/GYN told me she had 2 daughters in thier 20's, both childless and both use mirena so i figured if she believes its good enough for her children, its good enough for me!  I cannot say enough great things about this birth control.  I know some people have had negative side effects, but everyone reacts to different things differently, and I think its definatley worth trying!

Birth Control	mom on mirena, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/22/2011 12:56:03 PM	I haven't &quot;used&quot; the mirena yet, but my Dr. told me that it is more effective than tubal ligation, so I trust it.It took about 2 minutes to insert and was done with my annual pap. Insertion was a little uncomfortable, no more than having my cervix checked before my son was born though. I had a rough evening, very tired afterward, but the next day I awoke rested and with very little bleeding. Barely spotting. No headaches, a little disorientation and dizziness, but that's typical for any procedure with me. I think Mirena will be so much easier for me than the pill.
Birth Control	AmandaR, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	35-44	4/19/2011 7:12:26 PM	I have had mine in for the full five years and am having it out tomorrow. It worked well as a birth control, although I believe in the last year it has not done such nice things to me. My arms and feet have started going numb....for no reason whatsoever. I have become so full of anxiety there are days I can barely cope because I feel in a panic. I have NEVER EVER had any anxiety whatsoever. I have major lower back pain almost every day and feel like something is sometimes sitting in the pit of my stomach. My sex drive has not completely gone, like others', but it has slowed a bit. I also have the acne and have gained weight and CANNOT lose a pound to save my life. I had no idea until recently looking up others' side effects, that Mirena was causing these issues. 
Birth Control	arlo16, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	4/19/2011 1:59:53 PM	I have been happy with the mirena for almost two years until recently I have been overly emotional for the past year. I have been on antidepressants before for anxiety and truly don't want to go down that road. I take no other medications, and have tried to rule out everything. I have had a weight gain since, even though i have lost weight prior and kept half off, i have more facial hair (not like the bearded lady! lol), acne is like I am thirteen again! I exercise 3-4 days a week, drink plenty of water and watch what I eat. This is the last thing I can think of! Anyone else out there go through this?  I am almost to the point of getting it out! I don't have children, and if I was to get pregnant at this point in my life I would not be upset! Anyone else out there?

I had a baby in July of 2010. I was on a bcp to get my period going in september and that was the last period I had until March 2011. I had a yeast infection and then started spotting. I had a week off and have had a period since. Today is April 17, 2011. I have been having a period since March and it gets light and heavy without stopping. I am tired all the time. I am moody and have back and stomach cramps with a pain that goes through my vagina. i am bipolar and on Lithium and Zoloft and now these meds are not working very well. I have gained over 10 pounds. I am 19 will be 20 in July. I have two children. I have been thinking my problems were from the Lithium but now after reading these reviews I think it is the Mirena. I was told that I could breastfeed with it by my OB/GYN so I did for aproximatly 6 months and now I am reading that you should not do this. I stopped nursing in January. I am deciding wheather or not to have the device removed.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	4/15/2011 2:39:38 PM	I had the Mirena inserted in Feb. after a pregnancy had to be terminated and have become quite scared after reading all of these brutal stories. Insertion was a bit painful and I had cramping everyday for about a month .. sometimes slight and then others intense. I do have some strange cramp like pains here and there but nothing serious (I do have an extremely sensitive cervix/uterus so I think it's my body adjusting to a something being in there). No full period yet but I spotted for the first time a few days ago, which only lasted 1 day. I'm super concerned about the weight gain (although I'm dieting right now and down 5lbs .. yay). I haven't noticed any other symptoms yet but I am really thinking about having it removed. But when I read the &quot;good stories&quot; it puts my mind at ease, somewhat, and makes me want to stick it out.  But so far so good. Fingers Crossed!!!!
Birth Control	Mirena lover, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/15/2011 12:07:40 PM	I got my mirena in only two days ago, but I have to say I was very nervous about the pain I keep reading about. The procedure only took about 5 minutes. I felt a little pressure (like i do with a pap) and then the slightest little cramp, that I could barley even recognize as a cramp that lasted a sec maybe 2. I only had bleeding that day and was done by the next. I feel great and the relief knowing that I'm protected without thinking about it is so nice. I hope this helps.By the way I have had a couple of children, so I think if you have not (your uteres never been open) then you may experience more cramping (heavey menstrual cramps) and may bleed longer (like a period). So get it done at the begining of your period.
Birth Control	BAND MIRENA, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/14/2011 2:56:56 PM	My Ob/Gyn advised me to use the Mirena..So after delivering my 3 child I had it inserted which was the WORST MISTAKE EVER!!!! Just like others, it was a little painful at first &amp; I bleed for a while but then it stopped for about a year.. I was gaining weight like crazy, very tired all the time... then one nite I became very swollen almost simliar too toxcima..my family &amp; freinds suggusted that I get to the ER right away because it looked like signs of congestive heart failure with the way my legs were sweeling. So after many tests it was found that I was 17 weeks pregnant &amp; unfortunialy the heartbeat stopped (Doctors say it had to have just stopped) because the baby was normal size as a 17weeker would be. My husband works in the union up north &amp; the kids and I are in our home in Florida so according to all the dates it happened when he came home for our youngest 1st Bithday... so since I havent had a period for a year we never had a clue... the hospital sent me home and said I would just have to walk as much as possible and wait for the fetus to come out. It was horrible, 3 weeks later it finally did. I begged for the ER to remove the IUD &amp; they said to go to the doctor who put it in! I called him and explained the situation and all of a suddon they now dont except my insurance(go fiqure)and they would remove it for $300....what a joke...I would never ever in a million years recommend this to anyone!!!

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	4/13/2011 8:14:05 PM	I had my IUD removed about 2 years ago and have not been able to get pregnant since. The main reason I had this removed, was because it shifted while inside and everytime I would bend over or just simply walking i would have sharp pains.  Also, the day I went in to get it removed they almost had to take me to the operating room to get it out. I had to go to 2 different doctors because it was so hard to find.  The pain was worse than labor!!! I had to get a shot in my cervix after an hour of the doctor trying to find it! I would not reccomend getting it!
Birth Control	25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		25-34	4/12/2011 3:36:54 PM	I think that every person is different and you need to take that into account when you review a product. Also take into consideration other things that may have cause what you are considering adverse side effects of the drug. I have been on Mirena for almost 2 years and don't have a single complaint. I haven't had the headaches, migraines or weight loss that many others are complainging about. Everyone is unique and so are their interactions with medications. My doctor told me that Mirena was very similar to the medication in Depo Provera which I was on before I switched to Mirena. I wasn't having problems with the Depo, but my doctor wanted a new birth control method because of the length of time I had been on Depo, and it's effect on your bones from long term use. I was happy with the Depo, but switching to Mirena has definitely made my life easier, and scheduling appointments for a shot ever 12 weeks is history. I am a complete Mirena advocate. In three more years, if I still don't have an interest in more children, then I will use Mirena again. GO MIRENA!!!

I have not had a menstral cycle in three years. I have had severe fatigue, headaches, and gained 30 pounds. So emotionally unstable it almost cost me my marriage.....but I am not pregnant.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	4/6/2011 4:00:16 PM	I've had the mirena for about a year and a half.  Everything was going well until I started getting a discharge.  Then approx. 4 months later, I noticed a horrible smell coming from my vagina and the discharge. I am happily married and have never encountered such an awful weird smell so I was very nervous about it all but discovered it was vaginosis and thought it was really weird since I had never had anything like this before.  The antibiotic seemed to have worked but here we are again about 2 months later and I think I have it again.  I've setup an appointment with my doctor to get checked out but I'm going to ask her to remove it.  My husband is really upset with the whole mirena idea and disagreed with it stopping a period alltogether since our bodies were made to have a period at least once a month.  I think I'll just stick to birth control pills to control my blood flow and cramping, this isn't worth it.
Birth Control	lkj, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	4/6/2011 11:55:15 AM	Very effective in that it's been three years and I'm not pregnant :)I would not recommend this birth control to women who have had problems with previous bc methods. It caused me to have migraines, weight gain (about 30lbs), constant fatigue, lower back pain, cramping and spotting at least two days a week, not to mention daily bleeding for the first six months it was in. While the Mirena has been in I've felt perpetually pregnant, mood swings and all. I do have a history of unpleasant side effects with bc, though. So as I said before, if you haven't really had problems with other methods I would definitely recommend this to you because it is so convenient.

I like the idea of not worrying about taking a pill or inserting a foam before or after sex. I will have it replaced after the 5yrs. I've had mine for 3 yrs already . Very happy !

I had horrible migraines and headaches that lasted for days on end. During each month, I had a headache 20 out of 30 days. I had dizzy spells, fatigue, and mood swings. When I had it removed it was awful. I bled severely for days. Now that I have been off it for 6 months I have almost no headaches and have not had a single migraine, no longer fatigued or depressed. I am 100% back to normal.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	3/31/2011 7:08:50 PM	For 3 years I experienced abnormal monthly spotting, after many different treatment options, and OBGYN's my Dr. recommended Mirena. I had my first one placed in December 2007. While this IUD solved my abnormal spotting, I started to bleed during and after intercourse. I visited my Dr yet again to find out after an ultrasound that my IUD had infiltrated through my uterus, subsequently I had this urgently removed. My Dr. and I decided that since this was a &quot;rare&quot; complication that we would wait 1 month and insert a second IUD. So April 2010 I had another Mirena inserted. All was well until December 2011 and I had mild abdominal pain, which did not resolve. I found myself in the ER with severe pain on Christmas Eve. Turns out my IUD caused me to have Pelvis Inflammatory Disease, a very serious condition and potentially could cause infertility, Yet again my IUD was removed urgently. Among these potentially life threatening conditions I also experienced throughout the 4 years while having my IUD's severe acne, daily mild headaches, and low sex drive. If you are thinking about a Mirena please take my experience with these IUD's and perhaps re-think your decision. I'm a 26 year old Registered Nurse, and hope one day to have a family in the future. It's not known at this point if Mirena has hindered my ability to conceive.
Birth Control	mirenafog, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	3/29/2011 9:58:29 PM	This product does NOT have enough side effect research! After having the Mirena for 3 months, I had estrogen levels of a man, followed by months of horrible acne,severe mood swings (very scary &amp; not typical for me), dizziness, ringing in the ears,joint pain,sensitivity to light, pallor,fatigue,dry skin,hair loss,confusion,mental cloudiness, palpitations &amp; an episode of temporary vision loss....to name a few. The worst part is trying to explain side effects to your physician on a product that &quot;does not have side effects.&quot; I felt great before having the Mirena. I was very active &amp; healthy. After the Mirena, I lost my libido, nearly lost my relationship with my husband &amp; could have possibly lost my job due to the mental cloudiness. I had it removed 2 weeks ago &amp; I'm starting to feel &quot;normal&quot; again. My mental clarity has improved greatly &amp; physically, I feel wonderful. I've figured out how this birth control works....you feel to horrible to have sex &amp; the physical side effects are unattractive (ie.weight gain,acne, hair loss, facial hair etc.) I will never use another product by Bayer. Thanks for marketing the &quot;perfect&quot; birth control to unsuspecting women.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	monkey, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/29/2011 4:56:46 PM	I had been bleeding for 5 months when i finally had an ultrasound performed. I had 1 fibroid said the doctor. I had it removed, I still bled. I had Mirena inserted 3 weeks later to stop the bleeding. I wish i would've listened to my instinct and not had the Mrena inserted because I have: sudden shortness of breath, chest/jaw/left arm pain, confusion, sudden dizziness/fainting, pain/swelling/warmth in the groin/calf, tingling/weakness/numbness in the arms/legs, headaches that are different from those I may have experienced in the past (e.g., headaches with other symptoms such as vision changes/lack of coordination sudden/very severe headaches), slurred speech, weakness on one side of the body, vision problems/changes.Oh, and when I went to the doctor, she said it had nothing to do with the Mirena. She tried to prescribe anti anxiety medicine. I knew I wasnt crazy so I went to 2 different doctors since. Not 1 doctor agrees with me that Mirena has an adverse affect. Went and had another ultrasound performed....(only 1 and a half mos. later) I have several fibroids left in my uterus. Mirena does not work for me and I would take an accidental overflow in public  over the side effects i am experiencing. It is very painful for me too. 
Birth Control	anonymous40, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	3/29/2011 1:42:01 PM	I am writing as a follow up from my post on 3/3/2011. I proceded to have the tubal ligation. I have already lost 5 lbs and have noticed that I don't retain as much fluid. My depression has lessened. I am glad that I had it removed, however a tubal ligation is permanent. Make sure that you do not want anymore children and remember that any birth control method that involves hormones can have side effects. Why can't we take pills WHEN we want to have a child and not the opposite. (Just dreaming)  :)
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/29/2011 11:30:17 AM	DEPRESSION! the only reason I don't like this IUD, but it's a very dark deep and sad reason... (no acne, no weight gain, almost no period). never had depression before and don't have it now, after removing it!

I had the worst mood swings, still long if not longer periods, I had hot flashes, mood swings and my memory was like an 80 year old woman, the insertion was god aweful pain and not to mention I had insominia and anxiety. I am so happy I had it taken out that was painless and I have better energy now and instantally feel so much better. I am sleeping through the night for the first time in 3 years. I would not recomend this to my worst enemy! I can only say the only good thing that came of it was not being able to get pregnant, other that that nothing good to say!!!

Last week I discovered I was 7 weeks pregnant. My dr. tried to remove the device......didnt happen!!!! As of now, They are not sure where the mirena is at. They can only see a piece of it on an ultrasound. They do not know if the baby will survive.  This is the most awful experience I have been through! Do not use this product!!!!! 
Birth Control	cringinglover99, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	3/27/2011 11:06:08 PM	I started this birth control in hopes it would be effective and it would be easier to keep up with instead of taking a pill everyday since I had just had my son.My doctor recommended it so I thought it would be okay. I had a constant period for 5 months and I thought I was still bleeding from having my son, and not b/c of the mirena. But now I know different. I am a lot more moody, and get upset over little things. I am already heavyset so I don't really notice a lot of weight gain, but I know over the two years I have had it I have gaind 20 pounds. I am unsatisfied during sexual activity, it hurts me and my partner. I was told neither of us would even notice it during intercourse, what a lie. I guess it does keep you from getting pregnant if it makes you cringe at the thought of having sex. I want to get it removed as soon as possible. I am really hoping it has not affected my fertility b/c I may want to have another child one day. I also want to comment I have very light periods and no cramps and before mirena I had very heavy periods and constant cramps. SO that is the only true benefit of mirena for me, but I believe the cons outwiegh the pros for this product. If anyone is thinking about this product for their birth control I would recommend using something else like the nuva ring or shot.

No pregnancy, Light to very light periods. no change in appetite/weight. No change in mood swings. possibly a decrease in libido.Overall satisfied
Birth Control	BirthdayGirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	35-44	3/25/2011 11:36:24 PM	I was 35 when I had Mirena inserted and had no children yet.  They say to wait until you are on your period to have it inserted.  I was at the middle-end of mine which may have been an issue but I've never experienced such pain in my life.  I'm not squeamish or weak, but I think not having given birth before and not being earlier in my period made this shockingly painful.  My lower abdomen was swollen for several days and I also had mild cramps discomfort.  This all subsided within a a month and for the most part, Mirena is a second thought.   HOWEVER, I am one of those women who still get their period on Mirena.  While it is light, it lasts, including the spotting at the beginning and end, on average 10 days.  Also, I've noticed SIGNIFICANT (I went up a cup) breast size increase in general and during PMS it's out of control.  I also noticed that I'm significantly more emotional before my period.  And while I've had some life changes (I've moved from East to West Coast and don't walk as much)  on Mirena, I've gained a good 10-15lbs that's been impossible to lose.  I've always been able to maintain my weight within 5lbs before Mirena and now even increasing my exercise for the past three months and being very regular about it, weight loss is incredibly difficult.  I got married nine months ago, and for a month before the wedding when I crash dieted (eating VERY little and mostly vegetables/liquids) I was able to lose 15lbs but I was seriously restricting myself (which I gained back eating normally again).  I have healthy eating habits otherwise and indulge occasionally, my eating habits are similar if not better than my pre-Mirena days.  I am now 37 and it's exactly two years since I've been on Mirena.  I don't know if it's just age and my metabolism slowing down, if it's not walking as much but I've never been so frustrated with my body.  I've been on lo dose pills before and I seem to have more control with my weight.  Any others with similar stories?      
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/25/2011 12:53:20 PM	I had the Mirena inserted 3/11, it started working right away!  The flow of my current cycle was lessoned to just two days- the day I got the IUD and the next day. I need to comment on the pain because many of the reviews scared me.  The pain was MINIMAL.  I did not even winch.  I have had worse menstrual cramps that last a whole lot longer!  Go in with a positive attitude, ask questions and relax.  So far I love the Mirena.
Birth Control	ruja09@verizon.net, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/24/2011 10:03:46 AM	For about a year before I used this birth controle I had been looking for something that would work without me having to remember to take a pill or go into the clinic every three months to pay for an injection. I  wanted to make sure that if I didn't have medical insurance due to job loss or unemployment, that I could still prevent myself from getting pregnant, and this was the best choice. My Husband thought so too. Overall I am very satified with my choice, and for someone with anemia it sure helped me have a normal bloodcount. However I did have disy spells maybe a year or so after insertion,I wuld have hem on and off and then i had my wisdom teeth removed and it stopped so I don't beleaive it was due to the birthcntrole. I hve read others reactions to this drug ad wonder if some ofthese woman made sure they followed the directions before use . usually ifyou donot follow the directions or advice given side affects can be serious!
Birth Control	Paula Lester, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/21/2011 7:34:15 PM	The Mirena is very effective if you do not want to think about birth control everyday.  The insertion hurts like hell (no exageration).  A few days later I began having headaches that lasted for days, some progrssing to migraines.  I had it removed after 6 months.  I have 3 kids and had no problem with fertility; however after the mirena I've had 3 miscarriages back to back. My husband curses this thing everytime a commercial comes on.  I'm a mediacl assistant at an ob-gyn's office and I've seen horrible complications (even tubal pregnancies and women having to get hysterectomies because of movement in the IUD).  All of this is what scared the crap out of me and had mine removed.  I would suggest if you're completely done having kids, but if you want more, I would suggest just taking the pill.

I had mine for almost 2 1/2 years.  I gained 30lbs and have been extremely fatigued.  I had mine removed 3 days ago and am already starting to feel more like myself.  The Dr. told me they have had several people with these same side effects and complaints.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/20/2011 1:18:15 AM	While there are many things I have loved about Mirena I am not sure it is worth the side effects. Not having a period in college at all was great, especially as an athlete and being prone to anemia. I originally got it to prevent passing out from cramps and it worked great for that too. However I have less energy and am quite sure that it is from the IUD. As I weigh less than 100lbs this is no surprise, almost any dose of anything would be too much for me and these are a one dose fits all answer. It too over a month after I got it before the cramping wen down but after that it never came back =)
Birth Control	happylife, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/15/2011 12:55:45 PM	I LOVE it!!! I'm on my second one. I had the 1st one removed after 5 years and had another one inserted at the same time. It's the best thing since sliced bread! I never have a period. I had one for about 3 months when 1st inserted then no more. I only get tender breast around the time when I would have my period. I can not feel it in there at all. I tell people all the time I will probably have one in till I hit menapause. It's great.
Birth Control	Chris, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	3/15/2011 10:59:27 AM	I chose this birth control plan so that I wouldn't have to keep up with pills. I got it after the birth of my second child. A little painful when inserted. I had the cramping and I was bleeding for a while. The bleeding then turned to ocassional spotting which was really annoying but its been a little over a year and I don't have my period at all. I don't have any of the side effects (maybe just a little moody but I am bitchy anyway). Overall I love it and will do it again after my 5 years are up.
Birth Control	jessi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/14/2011 11:34:43 PM	When I got Mirena back in December I was told I MAY have spotting between periods which would be light and would go away after a few months I was also told my periods would get lighter and shorter and may even stop. I have been having periods that last weeks at a time and are heavier than before having the IUD inserted. I have had horrible cramps which I did not have at all before have the device inserted. I wish I would have stuck with the pill which is what form of birth control I have chosen for the past almost 10 years. I had no idea this would be this much of a pain in the ass... literally. I am nauseous all the time, hungry constantly, severe abdominal pain, headaches, pelvic pain, pain during intercourse, and general all around discomfort. None of this I was warned about by my doctor beforehand. I was told I would not even notice it and neither would my husband... HUGE LIE!!! I have horrific mood swings, depression, swelling in my legs and feet, pain in my legs. Basically every side effect possible. I wish I would have never gotten this done and that I would have done research on my own instead of taking my doctors word on something. Won't make that mistake again. I am calling my doctor tomorrow to make an appointment to come in to have it removed, if they can even remove it and don't end up having to have surgery to take it out considering my doctor cut the strings that they use to remove it too short!!! So thank you to the makers of Mirena... You have made the last 4 months of my life hell... I would NEVER recommend this to anyone!!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	3/14/2011 3:55:57 PM	I have only had the mirena for a week, and wish I had read some reviews before getting it done as well. I have to say through the insertion was not painful for me. I do have one child though, but felt more like a pap smear. I havent had any severe side effects thank GOD, but I have experieced headaches, dizziness, cramping and bloating and back aches. No bleeding as of yet. Hopefully that will all go away. Will keep you posted after a few months. 
Birth Control	kimdm, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/14/2011 12:48:30 PM	I got the Mirena about 2 1/2 yrs ago and I really wish I would have done my research first. Horrible decision! I have had pretty much every side effect and then some. Horrible mood swings, ZERO sex drive, uncomfortable intercourse, horrible acne, depression, chest pain, breast pain, abdominal pain, extreme fatigue, increased anxiety, increased headaches, dizzyness.  Need i say more??  I had no idea the Mirena was the cause of all these problems until recently.  I have had many tests run to determine why I was having all these problems and no one could figure it out. I am having it removed next week and I am thrilled!   
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	3/11/2011 12:59:15 AM	I had the Mirena inserted in January (not even two months ago) and it has been nothing but hell since then! The major thing is the bleeding, I have been bleeding non stop since getting this. I have head aches all the time and I am always hungry and am severly depressed and am a raging bitch. Things before that would irritate me that I would blow off and ignore turn into huge arguments when I was never like that before. I was having some cramping but was something that I could ignore and it would go away but as of today I have had cramping all day and it just keeps getting worse. i wanted something that was worry free and effective but this is not the answer! I am gonna get this thing taken out and try the paragurd. Taking things that have hormones in it is just not good. I am even scared to look at a scale because I know I have gained A LOT of weight because of this! I wish I woulda have read the reviews before hand. The doctors make it seem so simple and so worry free but I have learned your best bet is to read other peoples reviews and listen to them. I have not seen one good review on here about this! So for those of you thinking about getting it DON'T DO IT!
Birth Control	DaniP,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		3/10/2011 10:57:37 AM	Horrible! I only had it in for 3 days before I started having problems. I have to have it surgically removed because I was 1 of 1000 woman who had a problem with it moving. Somehow it moved and became posterier and is causing me a lot of pain. This pain starts in the front of my pelvis and shoots towards my back side. I had an xray done and it showed that it moved quite a bit. They then did an ultrasound on me and a pelvic exam and they said that it was nowhere to be found! Now it is somewhere in my abdomin. I am definitely no getting it inserted again. I wish I would have read reviews about it before I decided to do it. I am on bed rest now and its really hard for me because I have a 2 1/2 year old and a 6 week old baby. The doctors don't know when they can fit me in to get it removed...the pain meds aren't helping and I am miserable!
Birth Control	Chele, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	3/8/2011 2:37:35 AM	I had the device placed 11 weeks after my son was born. I wanted a method that would not allow me to make spur of the minute choices about conception. My husband and I previously chose two pregnacies based on little planning, and I suffer from severe postpartum depresssion.            I hated the placement procedure... had no idea I would be so miserable with cramps.... and it was uncomfortable for about 6 weeks after: I often felt it.   I stuck it out, though, and was thankful that I did. I love the worry-free effectiveness, and that I have no menses to speak of. I have a normal red-blood cell level for the first time in years.     I plan to have another placed soon, as this one has been in place over 5 years. It may not be for everyone, but it certainly is for me.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/6/2011 8:01:30 AM	I tried this birth control for nine months.  I have my period for the first two months.  Then I did not get a period at all... which was nice!  I had it removed because I would feel sharp pains during intercourse or just every day movement.  Not only that but at first I was really depressed and then I became even more moody.  JUST was NOT for me!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	3/5/2011 6:22:14 PM	I got mirena inserted over a month ago and two weeks after having it inserted, my uterus pushed the iud out thus causing me pain and extending my period for two weeks when it usually lasts for 5 days. I thought that this was good idea at first because I wanted a bc I didn't have to worry about but now I realize I was better off with the bc pills. Mirena just isn't for everybody. I'm getting mine removed because I'm just not comfortable with it anymore. Good luck to those who still want to use it.
Birth Control	anonymous40, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	3/3/2011 10:08:32 AM	It works well for the prevention of pregnancy. The insertion was somewhat uncomfortable, however within the year since its placement I have become more depressed. I have also gained 25 lbs. without change in my diet or activity level. I am thinking about having it removed and having a tubal ligation performed.
Birth Control	LiZay, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	2	Female	19-24	3/2/2011 1:55:04 PM	I just had Mirena put in yesterday &amp; I was really excited about deciding to go through with it. I was talking to the Mid Wife about having it done &amp; she made it sound so easy &amp; carefree! and after reading all of these reviews I'm really regretting my decision! i didnt expect all of pain &amp; bleeding. I do NOT want to gain anymore weight &amp; don't want the loss of hair! I really wish i had researched before i made my decision!!!
Birth Control	sunmoo69, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	35-44	3/2/2011 11:33:49 AM	I have had Mirena for 5yrs now and I can say it is a very effective form of birth control, since I am on my period at least twice a month.(little bit of sarcasm) I was already on anti-depressents but did find that my depression got worse.I can't say it's the Mirena, but there are some pretty good arguments to say it might be. I also have hair loss and have gained weight, but again I can't say it's the Mirena.It was very painfull to have it inserted, especially since they put it in and had to take it out to reposition it.Not a good experience there. Every person is different and will have a different experience with some similarities. I had back problems prior to using Mirena and am on some medications that hairloss and weight gain could be side effects, so, again I can't say 100% if it's being caused by the Mirena. It is time to have it removed and I will either have another one put back in or will go with Paragard(after doing extensive research first). I am over 35 and smoke so I am limited to what forms of birth control I can use. The side effects are worth it to me because I do not want to have children. Talk with your doctor and let them know some of the concerns you have and if you do use it, then just let your doctor know if you experience any difficulties. Communication is the best way to go and informing yourself is empowering. Because I don't want to get pregnant and I can't use traditional birth control that could cause blood clots, I am willing to deal with the side effects and that is the decision you will have to make for yourself. Godd Luck to everyone.

No birth control needed as I had a tubal ligation 10 years ago.  Slight cramping when it was put in, spotting for the first month, since then, absolutely nothing irregular happening.  For me, this was one of the best decisions I have ever made.  I will gladly have this replaced in 3 1/2 years

Birth Control	gracie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	2/24/2011 6:28:48 PM	Wouldn't recommend to anyone!  Had it put in in '07 (very painful!) and wish I had started reading these posts sooner. With an average weight gain of 20 pounds per year since then, male-like hair growth on my lip and chin, and hot flashes, I'm having it removed next week. I just hope these side effects go away...they are definitely not worth the nicety of not having a period!

I didn't want to have anymore children soon, so I figured the 5 year plan was perfect. The insertion was extremely painful. My doctor even gave me a shot in my cervix to numb the area which also hurt, but even after it was so called numb I felt like he was ripping flesh!! Terrible experience. So now on and off bleeding for about 5 months then everything was perfect for about 3 months. Now I feel tired all the time started having vaginal discharge everyday all day which caused a yeast infection. I'm miserable and am going to take it out!!!Remember that everyone is different so some people will not respond to the IUD as well as others. So it might work for you , but not me. 
Birth Control	ana, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	2/23/2011 10:52:17 PM	The insertion was not painful for me. Having my cervix checked by a dr while being pregnant hurt much worse. The first week was fine, just a little spotting. Then the bleeding started and hasn't stopped. It's been almost five months now. I have gained all 20 lbs back that I lost after giving birth. My doctor gave me an ultrasound and prescribed birth control pills to stop the bleeding(which hasn't worked). I have horrible back pains and cramping, my dr told me it's not the Mirena. After reading all of these reviews I am definitely having it removed asap!

I was a happy energetic person before I started it and once on it. I became depressed, moody, no sex drive, and bled off and on nonstop. It also gave me Bacterial infections and the smell it gives off is horrible. If I was asked by anyone if I would recommend it I would strongly advise against it. I finally had mine removed a month ago and am now on the road to recovery.

Birth Control	twinmommy09, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	2/17/2011 2:15:38 PM	I had this inserted after I had my twins (first children), that was in Feb. 09. Since then I have very little to no bleeding at all. But I have experinced acne (never had before) and hair loss. And I had really thick hair before. I get really bloated, which is something Ive never experinced in my life. My boyfriend has even mentioned to me that Ive become a bitch since Ive had it. Im usually a fun care free person and dont care to be angry or argue with anyone. I also have little to no sex drive, and Im usually a very sexual person. Im considering have it removed due to how it has made me feel and not to mention some of the things my boyfriend is worried about. He has heard alot of bad things about it. I would say try it if its causing you troubles then have it removed asap but if not its really a wonderful thing.

This medicine has made my life a living hell.  From rashes, mood swings, migranes, to weight gain.  This is absolutely the worst experience of my life.  I had a different or all symptoms daily and my anxiety for eating was uncontrollable.  I finally read many negative stories about this birth control and went to the gynecologist to have it removed.  it's been 6 weeks since and I not only became the same lovable mother and wife, but the migranes went away and have lost 13 lbs. since.  I urge people out there to be very careful about this iud because it can ruin your life!
Birth Control	clovergirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	2/15/2011 10:45:06 PM	After having my daughter in 8-2009 i decided to get back on a birth control regiment, pills were either making me gain weight or grow facial hair so my doctor suggested mirena. i stayed off the pills for a few months before having mirena inserted and managed to get down to my pre baby weight of 135, after having mirena put in i spotted for about two months before my body started adjusting to the implant. I noticed i started gaining weight, so i altered my diet to less meats more fresh raw vegies, and then the bf mentioned to me &quot;Honey, i think your gaining...&quot; Not long after the spotting started. Then i started getting cramping and pains, the final straw was when i felt like i was in labor, and went to the hospital. They couldnt deterine anything conclusively (small town hospital) so now i have to go to the doc's and see why. I know its the mirena, i;ve never had anything happen like this before. it makes you blimp up and get moody, the pains are random and severe (darn near crippling) and i've actually feared for my future. I just hope this thing doesnt leave me barren, i know my bf has his heart set on a son some day. Thanks mirena, you've really done the job.
Birth Control	wxgirl87, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	2/15/2011 4:22:35 PM	I had the mirena placed after having my son. I chose it because it sounded like an easy form of birth control. After I had it placed, I bled for 6 weeks straight. I also had severe cramping and abdominal pain. I have also gained a lot of weight and lost a lot of hair. Overall, I am not satisfied with Mirena.  I would not recommend getting it.
Birth Control	acrawfo5, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	2/13/2011 4:53:35 PM	Ok, so I had the mirena for a while.  At first i was singing the praises, and then like 1.5 years into the birth control, i felt like a chunky monkey.  And i knew it could be me eating too much, i mean, you cant eat to make your breasts bigger (im sure if you could there wouldnt be a need for breast augmentations).  And I didnt want to do anything.  I was depressed.  Now, keep in mind, i didnt think i was depressed until i realized what i was missing out of life.  I cannot WAIT until i lose the mirena weight.  I have never been pregnant, so when people would ask me if i was, and i had to reply, no its actually the opposite, it kinda sucked.   SO, unless you have an EXTREMELY active lifestyle, and exercise regularly (because i'm sure most of us do), i wouldnt recommend the mirena unless you want to gain weight.  But, i didnt get pregnant, and I didnt have periods all the time (but i didnt know when they would hit either) I'm not on the nuva ring again.  Its the lowest dosage birth control that you dont have to take everyday, in my opinion.

Birth Control	Lovely1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/12/2011 6:30:57 PM	There was very minimal cramping after insertion and I had spotting pretty much everyday for the first month, but after that things are great.  When I have my period I only need to use a liner because it has lessened my flow considerably.  The only thing that I wish is that it is a little more afforable.  My husband and I enjoy our sex lives knowing we are safe.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	KJ, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/12/2011 4:08:59 PM	I am a 31 yr old who has tried multiple BCPs and Nuvaring.  I have had Mirena placed in Sept 09 to control irregular bleeding which I'd had since age 12. It wasn't a question of IF i'd have breakthrough bleeding during the month, but when. I'v had both irritability and depression during the month with the best days being 1-2 days after it starts. I fought w my mom a lot and she could always tell when I was on my period during a fight and when I wasn't. I've taken multiple pills including: ovcon, desogen, ortho-tricyclen, demulen, mircette, and yasmin.  NONE helped with my mood and some made it significantly worse and none completely stopped the breakthrough bleeding.  Nuvaring was wonderful for my moods and regulated my cycle, but couldn't keep me from bleeding during extremely stressful times.  On Mirena, I've had my period maybe four times and it's super light.  The BEST thing about it is that my moods have improved dramatically.  I've cried less times in the last year than since my period began.  Once every few months vs. once every few days.  I give a tolerability a reduced score because the migraines are way worse although infrequent.  They were rough the first few months as was the spotting.

My hands and feet are always tingly and swollen.  I have never had oily skin before, and now it is awful!  I also feel the strings sometimes which is extremely uncomfortable.  My fiance has also felt them too!  I am calling to have this removed ASAP.  I have only had it in for 3 months!  I miss my birth control pills.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	2/11/2011 8:34:14 AM	I am a mother of three, a doctor, and a runner so I have a busy life.  Since having the Mirena IUD placed I have gradually developed a lack of energy to run which is disappointing because it is my stress relief.  Three months after having it placed I now am experiencing insomnia.  I now also have frequent headaches that I never experienced before.  Last but not least, my sex drive is gone.    I have read other complaints and while this is a great choice for many, it does not work for some.  I plan for removal today and hopefully I will be back to myself in the very near future.
Birth Control	lb, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	2/9/2011 11:04:53 PM	Well here it goes... I had mirena for almost five yrs. After I lost my baby weight almost I got it put in, then gained more than i weighed when i was pregnate. I am a very happy go lucky person.... realized not with mirena. I just got mirena removed because I wanted to see for myself it was mirena that was making me fat, miserable, and not to meantion nooo sex drive which was driving me into the ground with my husband because I didnt want to be touched. I got mirena removed and it's been 2 wks. Since then I have lost 7pds and have energy!!! I will mention the mirena crash im still not over which makes you still moody BUT im not as moody as i was with it in so i cant wait for it to be out of my system for good. I will say the upside to mirena is that I didnt have a period for 3 yrs and when i had it removed the red demon came with avengence from not being here for 3 yrs. I feel like a new person. Im happier getting skinnier and love life more and more each day. I do recommend if you think mirena may have affects on you to see about having it removed because for some ppl it works great but for me and couple of my friends it did not. Im ready for my life to be back on track and I am on a pill birth control and dont even notice I take it because it doesnt have side effects like mirena. But like i said it works for some and not for others so dont listen to the the doctor if they say the side effects are not from mirena like i heard for 3 yrs because they were VERY wrong. I hope this helps!! Also the removal was nothing like the insertion!!! I did have a little pain because they had to scrap some of my cervix to find it which was pain but nothing like insertion or the pain ive been through with mirena in.
Birth Control	tmac2325, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/9/2011 12:01:59 PM	I had the Mirena inserted in March 2008 after I had my first child. I opted for this form of birth control for the convenience and the plus for me, from what the doctor said, there would be &quot;little to no periods&quot;. I must say the convenience of the IUD is great; however, til this day I have had consistent problems. My cycle is very light, in which I only need to use pantie liners which is not half as bad. Now the negatives...a few months after having the Mirena myself and my boyfriend noticed a foul odor coming from my vagina. Come to find out I had a bacteria infection (never had one before). Took medicine and that cleared up...a few months later I have been discharging none stop, mind you it is now 2011 and it hasn't stopped. The discharge has an odor to it and it comes all times of the day in which I have to wear pantie liners daily because I never know when to expect it plus it soils my underwear. During intercourse you can really smell it which is quite embarrassing. My boyfriend says it doesn't bother him as much but it bothers me. The odor is horrendous. Another negative is I am extremely tired (this has been ongoing for 3 years as well). Not sure if it is my eating habits or just the IUD but I was full of energy prior to the insertion. Finally I have had enough, had an appointment with the doctor today to get it removed and to my surprise..they couldn't find the IUD. She tried and tried but nope, the strings are not visible. I had to get an ultrasound to see if it was even in there and it is just too far in my cervix for them to reach. Now I am currently waiting to see what options and expenses I will incur to get this thing out of me. I am not trying to deter anybody from getting the IUD but I definitely would not recommend it to anyone. Maybe I am just the unlucky one because my sisters and friends say they have not experienced the problems I have. This was definitely a lesson learned and I will never have anything inserted inside of me again. 
Birth Control	redrock, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	2/8/2011 2:56:33 AM	I have had the Mirena for nearly three years; however, since becoming involved in a long-term relationship in the last year with frequent intercourse, I have experienced bacterial vaginosis regularly (twice a month).  This is not only a nuisance, but is beginning to be a real damper on intimacy.  Note: I'm in my mid-40s, was on the pill for years, and have maybe experienced a bacterial infection a few times in my entire life. While I am thrilled not to have had a period in most of the time I've had it in place, I'm having it removed next week.  I just hate the bacterial infections!

Birth Control	Yvette, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/30/2011 11:21:55 AM	I first posted about Mirena on 12-8-10 with symptoms of weight gain and severe depression.  I am normally a very happy upbeat person and couldn't understand why I was so depressed I just didn't want to get out of bed.  After reading these other helpful postings, I decided to get it removed (before I tried going to a Dr. for depressi0on medication).  BEST decision I've made.  Within 3 days the depression started lifting, within 3 weeks I was back to my normal happy self.  Now that a month and a half passed of not being hngry all the time, I'm starting to lose the weight I gained.  I can't believe my doctor said she'd never heard of any of the side effects I was describing.  Mirena may work for some, but it is disaterous for others.  So glad the effects were reversed so quickly!  Whew!   Life is good again!!!!
Birth Control	futuremrscollins, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	1/27/2011 9:11:49 AM	Me and my fiancee have been together for about two years. We are waiting on getting married because of college this also means that we are waiting on children. I found out about Mirena in the summer of last year (2010). I had been on the pill and found out that it was causing a lab misread with my thyroid tests. Since I want to effectively keep check on my thyroid I needed another option. My nurse at the health department told me about Mirena. It was a simple appointment which I was instructed to take a medicine that would dilate my cervix (since I have not had children). I am not going to lie it did hurt. I did not get out of bed for three days after the procedure. I have had one period since August 2010. I am happy with the drug and I would never get it removed but from time to time I have serious lower back pain along with abdomen pain. I know that it is due to the Mirena. I would recommend this method for any couple that did not want children right away. Me and my fiancee are very happy with the results that we have received with this method.

When it was first put it i got an infection, but it cleared up within a week. Since then I've had no problems. Until I had it taken out I did not have a period. After I have this baby I will be having it put back in. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	1/26/2011 11:04:03 AM	I got mirena put in 7 weeks after i had my second son. Ever since then I've had horrible migranes, pain during sex , and little, if any sex drive. It's been one year, and I've been talking to my OB/GYN about all of my problems and we related it to post pregnancy symptoms. It wasn't until yesterday that i talked to my MD about my symptoms and he informed me that Mirena is probably causing them all. The other two symptoms I can deal with, but the migranes which I get about once a week for 3 days are debilitating. I hope and pray that getting Mireana taken out, which i am doing ASAP will stop all of these things. If you've had problems with this try what i'm trying next. ParaGard is a hormone free IUD that still lets you have a period. I'll update. 
Birth Control	Christina88, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	19-24	1/25/2011 2:43:09 PM	I got the mirena in may of 08 after my son was born.. I took Ibprofen as my doc suggested before I got it in.. It hurt really bad I couldnt walk I only lived a mile so I forced myself to drive home.. sat in the tub and took a percocet still didnt help. After that passed I spotted for almost 3 months. I had a ton of side effect coming from a person who has never had side effects from medication before. I got really bad acne (which I had also never had) vaginal discharge with a nasty smell. I gained an extra 30 pounds after having lost all my extra baby wieght before insertion. I got really moody and the number One reason for NEVER reccomending this is I am no longer able to take anything hormonal.. I have alopecia areta its a kind of hair loss you can look up on here it is an autoimmune disease. It went away not too long after I got the Iud removed and the proper medication. but if I take any sort of horomones my hair will fall out again I have about 1/3 of the hair I had originally.

I have been pregnant three times previously, and was VERY fertile.  I haven't gotten pregnant in the time, and have had no serious side effects.  I LOVE this product.

Birth Control	Chicky, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	1/16/2011 2:37:55 AM	I had mirena inserted in 08/2009. The insertion was painless. I experienced slight cramping the first 5 days. I was spotting everyday for about 9 months so I called my doctor. I requested to have it taken out and to get on a different form of birth control. My doctor preferred that I kept the mirena in and also get the depo shot(it was given to me in my stomach) to see if that would help stop the everyday spotting that I was experiencing. That was in 05/2010. In 08/2010 I began experiencing nausea everyday. I went to the emergency room that month to have everything checked out and they said that it was in place and sent me home with nausea pills. As of last month I began experiencing severe abdominal pain, dark/heavy bleeding, and still the nausea. I went to get checked out once again. They cannot find my string. Its no longer attached to the mirena. Because of that I now have to have it surgically removed. With my own personal experience I advise women to not use this as a contraceptive.

The inseration was practicly painless and very very quick. I had some cramping and spotting for the first two days but the cramps were very light. I didn't need any meds!! My side effects include no period mood swings and light depression. Nothing I can't deal with on my own. Truth is ladies everyone takes the same thing diffrently!!No two women are the same. I do suggest that you do your research and weigh the pros and cons.I do miss my period but i'm hoping it will return.Good luck everyone.

It has been wonderful...very little pain after it was initially put in. My periods (even the cramps) became lighter and lighter until finally (after about a year) I only spotted a couple days a month and had/have no cramps at all!  I didn't gain weight and since I got the IUD my skin has actually became more clear than ever. From the other reviews I have read not everyone has had a good experience, but to each is their own. You never know until you try.

Insertion was not as painful as I thought it was going to be.  I gain 15 pounds right a way,nausea and acne.  But that was to be expected. I couple of months later 02/2009 I started to get sluggish,fatiqued,feelings of depression, lots of interest in sex etc.  So I went to the Doctor to get on depression meds to help with the symptoms of depression. Then I didn't think it was the IUD.I started to get inflamation of vagina and vula. This last time lasted a week.  Then I started researching and found all my symptoms all relate back to the IUD Mirena.  Next week I have an appt to have it removed.  If I wasnt having the inflamation, I probably keep the mirena since I am being treated for the depression.
Birth Control	lindalou, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/11/2011 10:19:31 PM	I had the Mirena placed a week ago and I have had no problems or issues at all. Insertion was easy and was out of the office quickly. Very little cramping that night and the next day and no other side effects. Don't let the other reviews scare you, insertion is not bad at all and I was surprised when it was done because I went in to the office terrified after reading others experiences. I am so happy to have a birth control that I do not have to think about.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	1/11/2011 1:11:53 PM	I had this IUD placed in 2008.  I love not having periods (I've only had one in almost 3 years).  I love not having to worry about birth control.  I hate my hair falling out, breaking out all the time, cysts (no prior history), pain on my right side for most of the month.  As soon as I get health insurance again, it's coming out and I'm going back on the pill.  At least 5 of my friends had it in and I've lasted the longest.  They've all had it taken out within six months.  Not having periods has really made me put up with a lot, and I've finally snapped! I wanted this to work so bad.

I wanted my tubes tied but i was not old enough so the iud seemed perfect. A couple months after i had it i started gaining weight and my mood swings were terrible i was depressed and everything else. I went to the doctor and explained my issues and told them I was still having my period every month and they were more painful than ever. I was went on 3 diff depression meds at diff times, nothing helped. I read reviews about the mirena and saw I wasn't alone.  I got an appt with the obgyn and had the mirena removed.  I am still having some mood swings and other problems but not like before.  I have lost 20 pounds in a little over a month since having that removed.  The doctor told me when he removed it that it was sliding out and had probably started a couple months after I got it, the same time I started having problems. He said that from where it was coming out it was releasing the hormones too fast I was having more hormones from that then when I was pregnant with twins! and this had went on for a year and a half.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	1/6/2011 9:24:15 AM	Had Mirena inserted Mar.2010 for heavy periods not bc. I am 45 years and no children. Soon afterward got severe pain - bacterial infection and ovarian cyst. My periods did get light, but spotting lasted 7-10 days. Developed headaches, oily skin and hair, all of which I never had. Also hair loss/no sex drive. Gained over 10 pounds and cannot lose it. I feel bloated and get cramps all of the time. My doctor does not think any of this is related to Mirena, but I had her remove it anyway. May be great for a younger woman, but I'd rather deal with the heavy periods.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	1/5/2011 9:06:33 PM	I am on my 4th year with mirena, On Jan 1st 2010 I found out that I was pregnant (Yes with the Mirena still in place.) I found out that its an eptopic pregnancy. Needless to say, I miscarried on my own and I have had two Doctors try to remove Mirena and ist lodged in my Uterus. I need to have surgery to have it removed. When the Mirena was placed intitially my fiance could feel the mirena. It was much discomfort to him and myself. Choose wisely, I know some medication is for some and not for all. just some words for the wise. 
Birth Control	Trish, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/5/2011 8:01:22 PM	I have been so happy with the Mirena.  Other than the discomfort of having it put in, no side effects.  I have gone 4 years with no periods, just light spotting once every three months.  Love it and will be getting it replaced in a few months.  
Birth Control	Lisa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	1/3/2011 6:08:05 PM	Please do your research before choosing this form of birth control. I have had the mirena for 3 years and have had nothing but horrible side effects. The pain and swelling in my abdomin is starting to become unbearable. I went to my ob/gyn last week, and she checked for an infection and found none. I am moody, chubby and in constant pain. I also have a vaginal odor that I try to mask with femine spray daily. I told my ob/gyn this and she told me to douche with plain water...??? Don't choose this!
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	1/3/2011 12:08:58 AM	I had the Mirena inserted 3-2-2010. I have menstrual migraines so cannot most other forms of bc because it will increase chances of stroke. Insertation was quick &amp; somewhat painful, but doable. My periods have gone from 5 days to 8 which suck. The 1st 4 months, though they were lasting 2-4 weeks. I am still on the fence about this product for me. I think I am also more &quot;blue&quot; feeling &amp; a lot more emotional. I was hoping my periods would stop &amp; therefore my migraines would go away, but not yet. I will give it a few more months to see if things even out, if not, I will have it removed. I think the important thing to remember is that with every product, some work great for people &amp; others it's not so good. I think that not all of the side effects have been disclosed by the company, &amp; that's not good. I was excited to get &amp; not have my period anymore &amp; hopefully no more migraines! I usually do not experience side effects to meds or have allergies so there was no reason to believe that this would not work out great for me. Best advice I can give is just to really educated yourself &amp; not by the Mirena website, but by users.  If you get it, keep a diary of when u get your periods, how long they last, &amp; anything &amp; everything that you're feeling or experiencing.

Birth Control	angel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	1/3/2011 9:15:14 PM	I had it put in in Feb 09 and have been tired, very moody, and no sex drive at all. I bleed for 2-3 weeks out of a month on and off through out the month. They are heavier then before. Sex is painful now and it wasn't before. I lose clumps of hair at a time. I have complained to my Dr and he dismissed it. I have a appt tomorrow with a different Dr to have it removed. Hopefully things get better.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	1/4/2011 8:54:07 PM	I had the the Mirena placed in Oct 2010 because I am breastfeeding which limited my choices.  After having four children I thought the procedure was easy. The following day the cramps started and have continued on and off for three months.  It is sometimes uncomfortable to have sex and my husband can feel it in some positions.  I feel like I have my period everyday because I have mood swings and food cravings.  Besides the ten pounds I have gained, I feel bloated and my pants hurt me.  I have bleeding on and off also which is bearable.  After I wean my baby, I will be setting up an appointment to have it removed.  And the good: I'm not pregnant again and it is easy to use.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/2/2011 6:55:40 PM	I selected this birth control as I am a bit forgetful when it comes to taking pills. I was also told that it helps with heavy and abnormal periods. I actually have had no change in my abnormal periods. In fact, I think that my periods have gotten heavier since using this. I bleed heavy for 4-5 days soaking a large pad about every 2 hours. The only downside is this problem otherwise I love the IUD.
Birth Control	Mbear, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	1/2/2011 12:57:41 PM	Insertion was a bit more painful than I thought but nothing more than a pinch. A bit of spotting occured the first week or so after insertion. It's been 3 years now since I've had Mirena in and I've had maybe 3-one day periods throughout. Aside from the bit of weight gain I've endured from it, I believe it has surved it's purpose well. I am extremely satisfied with the product. The only problem I'm dealing with now is the added hormone. I didn't think that it could cause other problems during normal menstrual cycles. Talk about getting a double dose of hormones! I've had pains in breasts for 4-5 days now during ovulation period. Going to doctor to see if Mirena is causing this painful swelling. If so, could this lead to other side effects?
Birth Control	tinkerbell, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	12/31/2010 4:27:50 PM	I have had the Mirena IUD for four years now. I have had severe side effects but have had normal pap tests and labs for all those years. I have had severe pain on my right side &amp; back for 2 &amp; 1/2 years. Have had several visits to er &amp; numerous tests. I just found out out I have a severe infection in my abdomin which was caused by my IUD breaking off @ the arm, ripping thru my uterus and lodging into my cervex. I have to have surgery to remove it &amp; bc of the severity of the infection, possible hystorectomy. I have three children and did not plan on having any more, but that was my choice. If I have to have a hysto done, then my choice is gone. I trusted my physician, trusted the IUD and look where it got me. I am in such severe pain I cannot get outta bed to take care of my children or function. Before anyone decides to get this, PLEASE, PLEASE do your homework!!! Go online &amp; research the problems not being disclosed by the maker. You'd be supprised by the amount of women whom have had innumeral problems with this device. There are several class action lawsuits being brought against this maker.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	DIDN'T WORK FOR ME, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	12/29/2010 6:49:09 PM	45 year old mother of 3 who was experiencing heavy bleeding and horrible cramping, I opted for the Mirena in lieu of surgical procedures.  The device did solve the problem of bleeding and maybe one or two partial cycles and nothing since for over two years.  Upon 1st annual pelvic check up the strings to the device could no longer be located.  We then had to do an ultrasound to check for possible expulsion and learned it was still in proper place.  Thus leaving me to pay in full for the ultrasound cost which was deemed not medically necessary.  Now I have been advised I am menopausal and the device needs to be surgically removed in the operating room.  Possibly deductibles and other expenses I never took into consideration upon getting this device.  Seems that strings retraction is a common occurence, maybe this should be mentioned prior to placement so costs could be considered in the event of this happening.  After reading some symptoms others have written I feel I have been symptomatic for many of the mentioned and also wish I had done more research prior to listening to my doctor who I really trust.  Look forward to getting this out as early as possible in 2011 and hopefully not experiencing some of the unwanted symptoms.  BEWARE of hidden costs and ask your physician if this is a common complaint with others.  Never hurts to ask, even though when I reported my dissatisfaction to the manufacturer they mentioned they cannot comment on incidence due to HIPPA privacy policies.  Not a happy camper right now and would NOT recommend this product to anyone more or less friends or family.
Birth Control	TLleigh7767, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/29/2010 10:43:27 AM	Birth control could not be any simpler, and the side effects (for me) weren't bad at all. Insertion was painless and I can't even tell that it's there.
Birth Control	B. Original, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/28/2010 5:24:54 PM	After reading these reviews...I wish I would have read them earlier...I had my Mirena inserted almost 5 years exactly, having it removed in 2 wks. I just wanted to share my experience with the newbies. Insertion was fine, a quick prick and it was over. A few cramps and that was it. Disadvantages: WEIGHT GAIN!!! I am not a pig, I once asked a doctor if it made you gain weight, she said no, but I thought it was weird that I had it inserted 3 mths after my babies were born, which at that time I was back down to almost regular weight, but after the Mirena, I picked back up every pregnant pound! Didn't know depression was a side effect, but after reading these reviews, I concur! First, I thought all my side effects were regular things for new moms, but it happened too quick and had no other cause; however, I will say...it did what it was supposed to do...My children are 5 and they have no little brothers or sisters, so I'm satisfied with that...but the weight gain SUCKS!!!! And now, that I think about it...decrese in libido. But after my removal, I'll let you know if any of these things change.

Birth Control	Kayla, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/28/2010 12:32:25 PM	mirena overall is great, but when i first had it put in it was worse the labor pains!!! but after a few hours i was fine. had a lil bit of spotting then i didnt have a period or cramps for about 6 months!!! it was great!!! now i rarely have a period just spot every now and again. but overall great i would recommend this to anyone who is forgtfull. but if your good at takein the pill every day i would recommend you stay with that. 
Birth Control	Audrey Hulsey, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	35-44	12/28/2010 12:14:38 AM	There is a reason the Mirena is great for birth control:  it kills your sex drive.  I've had the Mirena for 4 months.  It's coming out next month.  I can't stand it. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	chrissysue6, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	12/20/2010 2:18:28 PM	I am 43 I have had 2 children but husband is fixed so no use for birth control. I got the Mirena because of heavy bleeding and clots, I also have fibroid tumors, and my OBGYN thought this would be a prevenative measure to a Hystorectomy. Not, I have had it a yr, gained 40lbs, cramps like when I was 15 and no motovation and my sex drive is worse than ever, almost completely gone. The insertion was painful but I survived, cause the first piece it the procedure broke and mind you I clearly feel this is my luck so the doc had to start all over. It did cause my to have heavy bleeding for about a week and it has stopped my clotting periods. I have had the acne, cramping pain during sex,swollen ankles worse than my granma and break throu bleedin constantly and back pain that is very irregular for me with head aches often. It will be removed after christmas. I have many ppl that like and dislike the same. I just clearly feel that I am not a candidate for the product and so just do your research before the procedure.
Birth Control	starlilly, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	12/19/2010 4:26:05 PM	Overall I have been very satsfied with my experience using Mirena. i think its really important to keep in mind two things regarding side effects with this product: 1 - things like acne, irregular bleeding, long periods, weight gain, ect...are all very common with the pill as well! I used birth control pills for over five years before getting mirena and experienced a fair amount of issues including cystic acne, cramps and headaches, and irregular bleeding. 2. Also, many people who get mirena do so within months of having a baby. Symptoms after pregnancy and giving birth naturally occur, like hair loss, and hormone fluctuations after childbirth also contribute to weight gain and other side effects. Im not saying these things cant occur from Mirena, but such things are just a fact of life with birth control and life events with women. as far as the insertion procedure, i would compare it to a pap smear. certainly uncomfortable and sometimes mildly painful, but quick and bearable. for me the entire insertion took maybe 3 minutes tops and was nowhere near as bad as i was expecting. I had mild to moderate cramping that day and day after. my normal period came when it was expected, however I have been spotting irregularly for about three weeks now. To me though, for FIVE YEARS of effortless protection against pregnancy, I will gladly deal with some light spotting for a few weeks! also have not experienced any discomfort since the initial insertion, and no pain durring sex. Overall I would definetly recommend this to anyone, we simply just have to keep in mind that all things have pros and cons, and with the IUD i beleive the pros greatly outweight the potental side effects 
Birth Control	Queen B, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2		19-24	12/14/2010 11:25:55 AM	I decided to use the mirena because I didnt think I would be able to remember to take a pill everyday and I thought it would be the easier option. I dont have any complaints with the insertion of the mirena, it went smooth. I was on my cycle when I got it inserted and I bled for about 3 weeks, which was very annoying. I have been using it for 4 months now and have gotten my period one and it has helped my period not be so heavy. It has caused my hair to fall out more, and recently I felt a mass in my pelvic area which was painful and caused cramps. It also has made my sex drive lower, as well as my boyfriend saying it he can feel it while we are having intercourse. I am considering the removal because I do not want to go bald and I dont want any cyst forming. I have never had any problems and always have had normal paps. I recently had a baby 6 months ago and had a normal pregnancy. I just wanted to share my side effects.
Birth Control	yvette, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	12/8/2010 2:44:15 AM	I am a mother of two kids and I wish I had read the patient reviews before I decided to get Mirena. Even if I had, I, like many of you probably would have discounted them.  The insertion process was exceptionally difficult-- with my doctor becoming very stressed and frustrated and having to insert some contraption to stabilize my uterus. It was very painful.  It took about an hour, and my doctor said she was thankful I was on my period, otherwise she could not have inserted Mirena at all.   The next three weeks were also problematic.  After the first week and a half of extreme pain I finally went to the ER thinking that the lining of my uterus had been perforated (punctured).  After all the tests, I was surprised to find that everything was okay with the IUD.  I am not a wimp about pain.  I have degenerative spine disease so I am in pain every day and often in extreme pain.  The pain from this IUD was bad enough that I went to the ER.  The second problem is the resulting depression and weight gain.  I am normally a very happy upbeat person, but have been consistently depressed since I got Mirena, and now it is so bad that I was considering going to get depression medication(!)  The ironic thing is that there hasnt been any change to my life, and there is absolutely no reason for me to be depressed.  In addition, I have been hungry ALL the time.  It used to be that I would have a crazy appetite for a few days before my period, but now, that is the norm.  Ive only gained about 8 lbs, but that is by fighting it all the time.  Im thankful for all your reviews, because otherwise I would not have been so sure it was the Mirena.  For those of you who are blaming the victim in your reviews, be thankful you have not been adversely affected, but never assume that their (our) symptoms are not real.  I will have the Mirena IUD removed in the next few weeks and I will report back.

I still had a light spotting for 3-4 days every month but very tollerable compared to what I  was dealing with before. After 2 years I had it removed ( not bad at all, similar to the contraption the use for PAP smear removal) I had it removed November 10th, today is December 6th, I've expirenced very sensitive breasts both last month and again now (last month I grew an entire cup size) I'm not sure if its from stress or from d/c the Mirena, and I have taken 3 tests since and am not pregnant (so far). I definatly would get another in the future, price per year its well worth it!!! My will-be-husband is quite large and said he never &quot;felt&quot; the strings during intercourse, I had no worries about forgetting to take it, and when I would spot, it became like clock work every month same day start. Saved money on feminine hygene products ( bought 1 box of reg. tampons lasted 3  months vs. 1 month... I was a heavy bleeder) I would reccomond this for any woman to at least try, If you're expierencing constant pain CALL YOUR DOC!!! The Mirena could've shifted and is puncturing your uterus.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/2/2010 4:26:58 PM	I hate the bleeding in between periods. well actually i dont even have much of a period, but i get alil bleeding once a month for 3 days on and off though. Not really heavy, spotty. Other than that its great. I'm not sure if this affects weight but it's been hard as hell losing the last few pounds of baby fat.

There's just times that I really cramp really bad! Oh and I spot at times too. And I'm now goin through a divorce so having this a plus!

I like it because I don't even have to think about it! However I have spotted for about 3 months now. I've had a few days without anything, but mostly very light spotting and horrible cramping. Not to mention the nausea! I have gained about 15 pounds and look bloated all of the time. I'm sluggish and fatigued! I would not recommend this product to anyone!

Birth Control	swarebear, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	11/27/2010 3:17:18 AM	I had a baby in sept2010. She was 8wks early and spent over the first month of life in the nicu. because of this i didnt get my iud til nov. It hurt getting it put in but wasnt unbearable(id recommend taking ibeprofen or tylenol befor hand!) and i started spotting for the first few days it was in. Then the spotting turned into full blown gushing and hasnt eased up any. Im breastfeeding, wich had stop my bleeding til i had the iud put in. not only does my bleeding seem heavier each day, I have horrible mood swings. And i get migrains every few days. I constantly feel like vomitting and always tired. my breasts hurt and my milk supply seems to be lowering. And the hormone gets passed thru my milk which my dr didnt tell me. Plus Im having trouble breathing and my heart randomly flutters which makes me dizzy. Luckily i havent experinced the weight gain or acne yet. Im giving it a few more weeks to see if it works the kinks out but if not im having it removed. O and my hair has started to fall out. It is a really excellent form of bc because you cant get pregnant if you dont have sex, which isnt possible for my fiance and i while i have this in. NOT HAPPY AT ALL!

I've gained about 20 lbs though and it's ben hard to lose it... And I get my period at times very light for 3-4 days and sometimes for about a week (and yes after a year I still get my pd) It's a great method of birth control because u don't have to worry about taking in/out or taking it a specific time!

However, I have experienced so many side effects from Mirena! Some months my period could last 3 days and be extremely light and others my period will be so heavy and last for a week. I have constant headaches, cramping, fatigue, nausea, and definately mood swings!!!!Mirena serves its purpose but unfortunately it is at a cost.

Birth Control	jay, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	11/15/2010 2:49:43 PM	I had the mirena inserted 10/21/10 and although it's only been nearly a month I'm afraid I'm experiencing some of the side effects previously mentioned. For the last week I've been spotting and I've gained almost 10 pounds. I feel very, very sluggish/moody and my abdomen has expanded considerably. I was so excited about getting the mirena because my husband and I have a 4 yr old son and since we're in our early 40's we've deciced not to have anymore children. I know I have to give it more time to really decide whether it's the right bc for me but so far, I am not a fan. :(

I expected this to last up to 6 months, but this is ridiculous.  I can't even tell when I am actually having my period.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	11/13/2010 11:37:57 AM	I just had this put in 6 days ago... It hurt a little upon insertion, I bled for a few days then it stopped. For the past 3 days, I've had what feels like a urinary track infection. I called the doctor, and he called in med's to help and he said it's common for this to happen, if it worsens then we'll take a look on monday.. I called him on a Saturday with the problem, he called back within an hour.. I'm not pleased with the product so far, but I'm not against it either.. Remember ladies, anytime anything foreign is put into your body, there are risk factors. I expected to have some problems, a UTI is minor if this b.c does the job for 5 years.

(That is ur bodys way of self cleansing but this month right after my period ended I started having an odor and slight discharge I am in a monogamous relationship with the father of my child so I dunno what's going on.

Birth Control	lilmomma86, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	11/8/2010 12:24:19 PM	I had the Mirena put in on my 6 week check up after having my daughter and the insertion wasn't painful itself, but the fact that my OB/GYN gave me a shot for pain in the cervix that itself hurt like heck. and than it's been a month and I haven't stopped bleeding. I feel like I'm a victim of this crap IUD. The pro to it is I'm not pregnant, but than again I haven't been sexually active and really no desire to be! Also I'm breastfeeding and since I had the Mirena put in my milk supply has gone down noticeably. I don't like it so far but maybe it's too soon. I'm going to give it till next month and if I'm still bleeding I'm switching to the patch or something because this ish is ridiculous!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/6/2010 11:19:50 PM	Mirena is hands down the best birth control I've ever used.  I have had mine for five years and plan on getting another one inserted when I have this one removed.  The insertion is a little uncomfortable, but I don't think I'd go as far as &quot;painful&quot; - I didn't think it was any worse than a regular gynecological appt/pap test.  I haven't had any periods or even spotting since I started using Mirena (no periods for 5+ years!!!!) which is a huge benefit in my book.  No PMS symptoms either.  And of course I haven't gotten pregnant.  I didn't experience lots of headaches, weight gain, no blood clots, no cramping or nausea, etc.  And you don't have to remember to take a pill every day or put on a new patch or ring every week - forget about it for years.  I would HIGHLY recommend Mirena to anyone looking for very reliable (it's been proven to be more effective than getting your tubes tied!) and hassle-free birth control.
Birth Control	Nychole, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/3/2010 9:51:59 PM	I have yhad the Mirena for just over two years now and I love it. I love not having to take the pills anymore. I also like the fact that my cycle consist of a few spots every other month. I definitely recommend this drug to a women. Everyone's experince is different, but mine so far has been GREAT!!! Now Im looking to remove it next year on my third year to have my last baby and then have another mirena put right back in..
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	11/3/2010 8:05:22 PM	It's easy.  The first few weeks aren't great, with very heavy spotting, but overall worth it.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	11/1/2010 2:18:41 PM	I have had Mirena since October 2006. It is supposed to be effective for five years. At first, I missed my periods, but now I started bleed in June for two weeks straight and spotted thereafter until I got an appointment with my doctor. He gave some patches to use for a couple of weeks, he said that would stop the bleeding which did for some time. Now I made another appointment for today because I think I might be pregnant. I had an over the counter pregnancy test that came negative, but I feel movement on my belly. This product is supposed to be effective for five years, but I do not think that is the case, nor I think it is as they say over 99% effective. I can tell you this is not a good feeling at all. If not pregnant, hopefully I can get it remove. I do not think it is worth the trouble I am going through.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	10/29/2010 10:04:54 PM	I had mirena put in because I was loosing my medical insurance.  Having it inserted was very painful because I have not had children.  My doctor had me take a pill to dialate my cervix so she could get the mirena to fit properly.  I experienced a few days of painful cramping after the insertion.  Having not to take a pill every day was nice but the side effects weren't so great.  I had a major loss of sex drive, pain during sex, cramping (not on my period), and vaginal dryness.  However, mirena did help my acne and kept my period fairly short and light.  So you take your pick of side effects.
Birth Control	angbek, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/27/2010 9:17:46 PM	I've had my Mirena IUD for over 2 years now, and I still love it. I had horrible cramping for the first day or two, but I haven't had a period since! I've had occasional spotting and mild cramps, but nothing like before the IUD. Unlike other reviews, I've had no change in my sex drive, my weight, or my acne. I love my IUD and will get a new one put in after we have our first child (planning for 2012). 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Duch56, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	10/27/2010 6:15:25 PM	I had the Mirena IUD inserted six weeks ago for abnormally heavy periods.  My periods lasted two weeks out of four and the bleeding was so heavy, I became anemic.  Insertion was a breeze--I had no pain at all.  There may have been a little cramping here and there after the first day, but not enough to be notable.  Since I have had the device, I have had a period for five of the six weeks which I'm not thrilled about, but the bleeding has ranged from light spotting to a light flow.  As for side effects, I do have them, but they are all positive:  I have an increased sex drive and my sleep has improved.  I have not gained weight or experienced moodiness. I'm hoping that the spotting curtails in the next few weeks. My 24-year old daughter has used the device for birth control for 2 years and she loves it.  No periods at all and nothing to remember.  As for side effects, perhaps she has a little acne, but that's a small price to pay.
Birth Control	MinnieMe, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/25/2010 1:47:37 PM	I had Mirena put in after my first pregnancy scare after my son was born. My gyno said it wouldnt hurt HOWEVER we discovered that my uterus was tilted and he had to physically hold my cervix opne with his hand and insert which was going thru the WHOLE PROCESS OF LABOR AGAIN!!!!.I literally sa in my car and cried because i went through that pain the second time with no baby coming out. Since then i have gained alot of weight and my acne does get a little bad. My periods are months apart and i only spot for a day. There are extreme benefits and negatives to put up with but its a peace of mind, but in my case when its up I may just be ready for my second child!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	10/25/2010 12:15:36 AM	I had my Mirena put in back in 2006. Since then I have had nothing but trouble. I've had server pelvic pain and went threw my fallopian tube and caused an abscess on my fallopian tube and ovary. I had to have surgery to have them removed. My mirena was found by x-ray and CT scan in my abdomen close to my rib cage. I am going to have to have another surgery to have the mirena removed because my doctor claims he didn't see it on my CT scan.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	10/22/2010 3:30:25 PM	I am very bad a taking pills so this was the perfect birth control for me...well i thought so. When I had Mirena put in, it was very painful for me. I had bleeding and pains for almost 3 weeks after. Finally when the pain is stop i was fine for about a week. The first time having sex with mirena in was painful, I had pains up by my belly button which i thought ok that normal maybe next time would be better. Next time my boyfriend and I had sex there was no pain we were excited that was on a Friday nite. Come Sunday morning I went to the bathroom and felt something when i reached down to see what it was, it was my mirena! So the next day I called my doctors and they couldnt believe it. I was seen on Thrusday by my doctor who laughted in my face in told me &quot;You must have pulled it out, becuase they just dont fall out&quot;. As she checked me I told her when you go on Mirena wedsite that many woman have had the Mirena fall out. She contuied to be  really rude to me we tried to talk about other methods of birth control i could try. Because i did not want to go though the pain of having another Mirena put in. So i would Never recomend Mirena to any one...But like they say Everyone is different! Forgot to Mention that I had Mirena in for less than a month!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	10/21/2010 10:02:56 PM	When I had my Mirena IUD inserted I was spotting and cramping for the first six months, after that the cramps stopped. After the first year so did my period. I love not having my period but there is always a CON to just about anything. I have had terrible headaches, mood swings, deppresion, vertigo, weight gain, hair loss, pain during sex, loss of sex drive on top of other symptoms. It has been great to not have a period or worry about getting pregnant but it has affected my family and I in other ways that I dont think its worth it. Having mine taken out asap so I can have my life back.
Birth Control	LadyMcLean, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/21/2010 12:22:59 PM	I had my second Mirena inserted in September 2010 with no issues.  My dr. always does insertion in the middle of the menstrual cycle when the cervix is 'soft' so the pain was minimal.  I felt cramps, pressure, cramps, then it was over in about 5 minutes.  Make sure your dr. does the insertion before the end of your menstrual cycle.  I did experience some acne issues while waiting for insurance to approve my Mirena.  My dermatologist prescribed a few things and told me within weeks of the Mirena being put back in I would see a miraculous improvement in my skin condition and she was absolutely right.  The 10lbs I gained was gone within two weeks.  With my first Mirena, I did get the ovarian cysts (painful enough for me to end up in the E.R. and being prescribed Vicoden).  That was the worst of my experience with it.  
Birth Control	cici, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	10/19/2010 4:25:45 PM	I have just had my mirena removed (few weeks ago), and am now having constant gushing bleeding.  It's is horrible!! I had 4 months of bleeding when it was put in. Horrible side effects and I still kept it on because they said it would stop eventually.  Well some of the side effects did get better. But now I am going through this bleeding thing all over again and it is horrible! 
Birth Control	Happy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/19/2010 4:10:19 PM	After reading all the horrible reviews of this IUD I was a bit nervous about getting it but in my circumstances I had little choice.  My blood pressure is estrogen linked so all regular BC pills had to be done away with and the 2 years of progesterone only pills and shots were horrid.  Due to the blood pressure, getting pregnant for me is too much of a risk for a massive stroke so this is what we decided on.It hurt being put in and it took nearly 20 minutes to get it right, even with the local they gave me, but it was explained to me that my cervix and uterus are about 1/3 the size of most women!  Yeah, didn't know that going into this but it was just pain.  It passed after a few days.  I only had spotting for 3 days and have not had a period or spotting since it was inserted 3 months ago.  The occasional cramp yes but nothing else.  My sex drive is very much increased compared to 15 years of various pills and shots.  I don't have this dryness issue everyone is complaining about. I've started loosing the 30 pounds added by the Depo shots, the whole body acne from the shots is going away.  I feel better.  My blood pressure has stabilized.My only complaint is the bacterial vaginosis infection that comes and goes but I'm ok with that one side effect.  It's easy to treat at home once you know what it is.If you are considering this IUD, don't get scared off my all the negative reviews and by all means don't blame every little thing on it either.  Every hormone change causes a few issues until your body adjusts.  Talk with your GYN and consider all the pros and cons before deciding. 
Birth Control	candtrip, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	10/18/2010 11:25:15 PM	I have to say I was warned by a couple people not to get it inserted. I figured everyone is different and I have a high tolerance for pain. It was so painful getting it put in and the bleeding seemed to last forever. It was okay for a little after that. Then BAM!!! Migraines every other month, really bad cramps, mood swings,pains all the time and NO SEX DRIVE! At first I thought it was because my body was getting back to normal after having A child. I thought it was just my body getting back to normal after having my second child. No the symptoms are getting worse. I started fainting happened a couple times this week. I'm getting it taken out on Monday. DO NOT even think about getting Mirena. Its not worth all the side effects
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	10/17/2010 6:53:39 PM	Like others I experienced minor pain at insertion in October of 2009. Afterward my pelvic area hurt when I walked something terrible. That eventually wore off but I still experience painful cramps even when its not time for my period. I have horrible mood swings. No problem with acne though. They say it doesn't cause weight gain and that is not the truth. It does. I like that I don't have to remember to take pills or take out that Nuvaring on a certain day/time but is it worth it? No. I plan to have it removed next month. Yes the flows are much lighter but I find my cycle is lasting twice as long as usual. My husband absolutely hates it! I think I'm heading back to the Nuvaring. \
Birth Control	Happy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	10/17/2010 1:22:28 PM	I've been on Mirena for nearly five months.  Insertion was so painful I nearly passed out but it only lasted a minute.  For the first two months I had some very painful cramping.  I would suggest people get a perscription for strong Naproxen (Aleve) because once I got that it was bareable.  After two months things got much better.  Now I have a light period every 6-8 weeks with minimal cramping.  There is some spotting which is a bit of a pain but I just wear a panty-liner during those times.  At this point I'm very happy with Mirena but am glad the first two months are behind me.  
Birth Control	hopeless, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	10/15/2010 5:37:26 AM	I put the Mirena in June of 2008.  August of 2008 I started to have acne breakouts 1 by 1 which was not so bad.  2009 it got worst it started turning into big cystic pimples all on my chin.  Also at the start of the Mirena I weighed 105 lbs size 1 &amp; 3. 2009 to now I am 132 lbs, have really bad acne on my face, neck, some on my chest and back, I have really bad hot flashes, cysts on my ovaries, and now I can't find the string!  I now have severe depression because of the side effects!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	10/14/2010 4:03:06 PM	I had Mirena inserted at my 6 week post partum check and didn't feel a thing. However, the side effects have been awful. I've had acne problems that I never had before, mood swings, depression and NO SEX DRIVE. I had it removed today which was less painful than having a pap smear and I am so glad to be rid of that stupid thing!
Birth Control	linzo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/8/2010 4:41:41 PM	ive only had it for 6 weeks now so far so good. sure the insertion hurt but i was warned and only had severe cramping for 45 minutes afterwards. i had it put in at my 6 week post pardum check. i had been bleeding since i gave birth and a couple days after the insertion it was gone i havent had any bleeding or spotting since but im still breatfeeding so i think that has something to do with it. since i just had a child my insurance max out of pocket had been meet so i had to pay nothing for the mirena which for 5 year birth control thats great. i also had a very heavy period before with severe cramping so any little side affects that might come are worth it to me.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	5pinkfairies, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	10/8/2010 10:57:30 AM	I had the Mirena IUD put in because I didn't have very good luck with the depo shot. Days after getting Mirena I got my period and I have had it ever since, that was three weeks ago. I have been bleeding very heavily and have had very large blood clots. I went back into see my doctor and was given a shot that I was told would help stop the bleeding. The blood clots stopped but the bleeding is still very heavy. Now for the last two days I've had a pinching feeling where Mirena was placed. This has been miserable. Between the Depo and Mirena I've had my period for 9 weeks. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/6/2010 11:39:28 AM	I chose Mirena over pills or shots because I have high blood pressure and didn't like the risks associated with other birth control methods.  I had Mirena inserted in Feb 2008, about 4 months after the birth of my son.  The insertion process was no more painful that a pap, but I would recommend taking a few Tylenol just to be sure.  I did have some cramping and very light bleeding for a couple days. I also experienced some fatigue, joint pain and body aches.  It felt like the early stages of pregnancy again and I thought it was the drug taking effect.  After about 6 months I was feeling fine and was period free.  After about a year I was still feeling good and started getting a period again.  It was very light and lasted for about 4 days.  I just had Mirena removed yesterday because I will be getting married and want another baby.  The removal was simple and pain free.  I didn't even know it was out until my doctor showed it to me.  I did have mild cramping yesterday, but today feel comepletely fine.  When the time comes I will have another Mirena inserted.  I was very happy with this product. 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/6/2010 11:16:44 AM	its been very good for me,but ive put some unwanted weight on,but other  than that its great,ive had it for almost ayear now.
Birth Control	baf, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/5/2010 4:14:29 PM	I just thought Id like to give the point of view from a person who has had her IUD for 4 &#189; years:I feel like I'm the only person who has LESS acne and FEWER migraines since the Mirena was implanted. Both my acne and migraines were based on fluctuating hormones and the Mirena helps smooth it out. I noticed these benefits within the first year of implantation.  I do plan to get a new one when the time is up!   The only downside is that I think it may have slightly impacted my libido (and I mean slightly). Its so subtle, its hard to tell if its the Mirena, or if its just in my head. Note: for me, the frequent spotting became less and less after the first few months, but I was still getting very occasional spotting up until a year after implantation. Same with the cramps. After the first year, Id get random spotting (but only like one drop) maybe only once every few weeks. Now I never spot at all. The cramps still come around, but again, its only once every few weeks, they are very light, and they only last for about 5 minutes. Really not a problem and ten million times better than the bad cramps and periods I used to have before this! It is strange (but wonderful) thing to not have had a period in such a long time!
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female		10/3/2010 4:24:09 PM	This has worked for me so far because there is just no guarantee. However when having intercourse there are times that you can feel it which are an ext ream disadvantage. It honestly feels like you are being stabbed and pinched.  An it does the same for him as well. Just something that should be seriously considered.
Birth Control	bonbon, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	35-44	10/1/2010 11:24:21 AM	I have had this in for almost 2 years and have had absolutly NO SEX DRIVE!!! It's great not having a period but it is really putting stree on our marriage. Having it removed on Monday!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/29/2010 2:06:15 PM	Absolutely love Mirena, yes the insertion was a bit rough, which my provider told me ahead of time.  No more periods or cramping at all, do not need to worry about taking a pill everyday either.  Can not feel it at all.  I did have one child before, it suggests not to get it unless you have had one.  I wish this would have been out years ago.  Thanks!!
Birth Control	gisele00, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/29/2010 11:33:43 AM	I had been on Depo-Provera for 7 years prior to getting Mirena, but the bone loss was becoming an issue. Yes, the day I had it put in was pretty rough - the procedure itself was very painful, but only lasted about 3 seconds when they measured my uterus and 12 more seconds when they put the Mirena in. My GYN said it was the easiest insertion she's ever done in someone who'd never given birth. I got dizzy and nearly passed out in the elevator on my way out because &quot;my uterus had never been manipulated before.&quot; The cramping afterward was severe enough to keep me in bed all day. The next day was a little uncomforable, but much better. Insurance covered it 100% because it's an &quot;implant&quot; and not a presciption, which was an excellent bonus. Free birth control, no periods, no babies... for 5 years!! I highly recommend it if you can get through the insertion (take something to bite down on, and have someone drive you).
Birth Control	mdhr, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	9/27/2010 11:41:55 PM	I am 35 and do not have children. I do not want children and so I got Mirena. It took two tries to get it implanted. I hurt horribly for about two weeks. My doctor told me to give it at least six months to take. I am on my sixth month and honestly don't think I can take any more. My mood swings are absolutely intolerable. I have the worst acne on my face and back that I have ever had in my entire life. My skin is oily and out of control. My hair is oily as well and stinks. I have never had these symptoms before I had this inserted. My husband was excited for the 'no more periods' that was promised. Yeah right. My PMS is the WORST it has ever been, not to mention my breast tenderness/swelling is so bad that I have been putting a heating pad on them. I have NEVER had to do that before. My doctor and her nurse made this form of birth control seem easy and carefree. That is not the case!
Birth Control	jackieee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	9/23/2010 8:47:28 PM	i DO NOT advise anyone to use Mirena! i have had nothign but problems since i have had it inserted. Unfortunately about 7 months ago i had an abortion, i was on birth control &amp; i happend to get pregnant! A kid just didnt work with my full time busy work schedule! I had the Mirena IUD put in the same day as my abortion &amp; i have had non stop problems! the first day my cervics was dilating due to the mirena being in place! i couldnt move because of the pain! Now many months later i am having stomach problems, lets just say diarrhea for a week randomly is not my fortay? i got checked for any other sort of problem &amp; the doctor came up with no solution... i did NOT have any bowel problems before this! now i have ABSOLUTELY no desire to have sex.. my boyfriends not taking that too well.. i have Mood swings like you couldnt imagine! my breasts always hurt, abdominal pain to the extreme i can even feel the pain in my hips &amp; back at points, i dont have a period which i love! but the headaches, decreased libido, bowel problems, eye problems, abdominal pain, extreme tiredness &amp; weakness is NOT WHAT I HAD PLANNED! i have an appointment monday to have this removed &amp; boy can i NOT wait!!! I think taking the pill or another route is the best thing possible right now cause i cant handle all this trauma... let alone all the time i have had to take off work thinking something else was wrong with me?? BYE BYE mirena!
Birth Control	 Female 	5	5	2	Female		9/23/2010 5:11:45 PM	Well, at first I loved it.  I had some mildly painful insertion (mainly the measuring) and cramps for 2-3 days afterwards.  The cramps continued for about 2 months on and off, especially after sex.  Then the periods were gone (and all spotting) after about 2.5 months.  Then rolled in the side effects.  It's gross, the oily skin, which was never an issue for me.  The back acne is also horrifically disgusting.  The low sex drive and the moodiness is also terrible.  I feel like I've had PMS for over a month.  I have also gained a good 7 pounds out of nowhere and they won't come off.  I'm really going to have a serious conversation with my husband about removing it.  I think this thing is really strange with all the delayed side effects.  At least Proactive is working to control the outward skin symptoms for now.
Birth Control	RNmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	9/20/2010 11:11:00 AM	I had Mirena placed by my physician in January 2008 and immediately experienced a negative change in my mood - within just a couple of weeks did a complete 180 change.  I am still having mood swings - although not as severe, horrible acne (I NEVER had acne prior to insertion - my husband teases me that I am just reaching puberty), anxiety, have zero sex drive and intercourse is painful, loose at least a handful of hair daily (comparable to hair loss after childbirth), have gained roughly 40 lbs since insertion even with eating healthy and daily exercise, and have had issues with abdominal and pelvic pain/bloating.  I have had ultrasounds done to check for ovarian cysts and other underlying conditions that could be related to the abdominal/pelvic pain - physicians have found nothing.  On the upside, I have not had a period since January 2008 - zero spotting and no need for pantyliners or tampons, can't feel the strings or intrauterine device, and am not pregnant (but you have to have sex to get pregnant - I have ZERO desire...very frustrating - I am married and luckily have a wonderful, understanding husband).  As far as insertion is concerned - it took maybe 15 min total office time, some cramping and bleeding, but overall not bad - what I had expected it to be considering the physician was inserting a foreign object into my uterus.  I am an RN and had heard wonderful results from colleagues and friends, but unfortuately, the negative symptoms are more of a burden to my life.  I have made an appointment to have my Mirena removed in a few weeks and hopefully will see a marked improvement in both my mental and physical state.  I urge anyone considering Mirena to weight the benefits vs risks that fit into your lifestyle and discuss your options in detail with your physician - each woman will have different side effects based on her bodies ability to adjust to the hormonal changes induced by Mirena.

I have had it for nine months and have spotted nearly every day, with incessant cramps since day one. I'm sick of living on Aleve and having to use period protection every day. I will have it removed soon.

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Deb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	9/16/2010 8:14:58 AM	I have been reading horror stories about some people's experiences with Mirena, and I have to say I have not experienced any of these problems.  Insertion was a dream - no pain, no discomfort, no cramping, no use of ibuprofen... and the nurse had warned me.  I had Mirena inserted about a month ago.  I have had light to moderate spotting the last couple of weeks, slightly heavier this week since this is the week of my period.  So far, this is WAY better than the extremely heavy periods I was having.  But, its also early in my experience.  Time will tell, but so far so good. 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	9/15/2010 10:42:40 PM	DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!! I will admit I am one to not go write reviews but I have to on this prodcut. I had the mirena inserted a month ago after the birth of my second child. I went for the one month follow up and doctor could not find it or see it in ultrasound. Was sent for xray and it is in my abdomen. I have to have surgery!!! I can't believe it!!! This product should be taken off the market. I was told about side effects but never told that this could happen.

I couldn't take birth control anymore due to my age and my blood pressure. I had heavy periods as well. Mirena was not comfortable to have placed, but after three months, the cramping stopped, my periods stopped and I had no side effects. My sex drive is better than ever and I have had no pregnancies. I would highly recommend Mirena. I am not looking forward to having it removed, as the strings did move up into my uterus but the doctor said he will just have to use a tool to extract when I want it removed. So if you are thinking of trying it, I think you should!! Don't listen to all the side effects of others, it is good to know because I researched it long and hard before deciding but everyone's body is different.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	25-34	9/13/2010 11:58:51 AM	Had this placed after the birth of my 2nd child. Skin is disgusting, libido is ZERO, mood is very &quot;off&quot;. Going to have removed this week. Very easy form of birth control, but the side effects are not outweighing the benefits at this point.
Birth Control	19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	1		19-24	9/12/2010 11:18:48 PM	I had the IUD inserted in June 2008, after the birth of my twins. At first, I liked it. The cramps weren't that bad. The spotting ended a couple of months after it was inserted. I didn't have a problem. However, I did notice some changed in my body and myself shortly there after. I have no sex drive, I am constantly exhausted, I have daily pain in my right hip, acne, severe mood swings (they are bad enough that my husband has told that either the Mirena goes or he goes), depression, on the rare occasions of sex my husband can feel it, and I have had more headaches than when I was in high school and needing glasses. It was been aweful! The weight gain has been horrible. I was 191lbs when I delivered my boys and I started out at 123lbs. Let's just say only 11lbs of that baby weight has gone and I am active and I eat right. It's not going anywhere! My best friend had one after she had her daughter and she gained ALOT of weight. After she had removed, she's lost so much weight. I am having it removed ASAP! It's not worth it anymore!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/8/2010 2:24:41 PM	I went on Mirena because of my heavy periods and also because i was sick of taking the pill everyday at the same time. Now i had it removed 2 months ago and i would like to have another bab how long will I have to wait before i get pregnant?
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/7/2010 4:24:39 PM	I had this inserted when my second child was 9 months old. It wasn't painful at all. It was an uncomfortable feeling much like what one feels when having a pap smear. The whole process took 5 minutes. I had some spotting, but this has been much better than the side effects I experienced while taking &quot;the pill.&quot;

Great product overall!!

Used it for 5 full years, had maybe 3 periods, no side effects, i guess i am part of the lucky 10%! ready for another 5 years, although not thrilled about the insertion but after 2 birth, this is a piece of cake!Totally recommend it!!
Birth Control	Mslisa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	4	Female	35-44	9/1/2010 4:13:53 PM	I had Mirena inserted in April 2008. I have one child and I had been on the pill for 20 yrs. My Doctor suggested it and I was totally not interested. I researched it and was confident enough to try it. The procedure was uncomfortable to say the least, there was some pain but not severe and it was over in 5 minutes. I considered having it removed after about 4 months. I was having severe cramps that brought me to my knees, they were brief but hurt like hell. They stopped me in my tracks, I stuck it out and the cramps (contractions) stopped over the next month or so. I have not had a period since. I still experience spotting once a month and some cramps. Today I experienced the severe cramping again this is usually when I get my period. It was bad and lasted 10 minutes I took some tylenol and I had to lie down. I plan to address this with my Dr. But over all it has been good for me. I still have PMS, but no side effects at all and no regrets..
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/1/2010 2:44:57 PM	I had terrible cramping for the 5 months that I had the Mirena. I have never been pregnant and partly got the IUD to avoid the pain of labor, but the cramps were way worse than normal menstrual cramps. I've been told by mother that they sound very similar to contractions, and I was having them more than weekly. I was living in fear of aggravating my IUD for 5 months. Certain sex positions, vigorous workouts or even sitting slouched guaranteed cramping later. The extra % the IUD provides as contraception was not worth it for me and I am sooo glad I had it removed. The doctor that removed the IUD told me that either my symptoms were rare or were not related to the IUD, but I am a nurse and I know my body. I doubt I will ever try any IUD again, especially since 3 Doctors (the one that put it in, the one that took it out and my primary doctor) were less than honest or upfront with me.

I the insertion procedure was not painful it was the cramping that followed that was horrible! It was so painful that I passed out and vomited.  I have had it in for 2 years now and have not had a period for the last year and a half.  I have had considerable weight gain even with exercise. I am an avid runner, running everyday and my diet has not changed but I continue to get bigger. I feel like I am constantly pregnant.  My breasts have increased in size.  I get intense side pain/cramping which my OB/GYN assures me that it is just ovarian cysts that is common with an IUD.  Which how can ovarian cysts be common?? I am seriously contiplating having it removed because the symptoms are not going away.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/29/2010 6:52:03 PM	I had this inserted after the birth of my son and was initially very pleased.  However, I ended up with an ectopic pregnancy that resulted in surgery. Now, I would need another surgery in order to have another child.  This definitely did not work for me.

I am either considering mirena or essure.  I haven't heard too many good things about mirena.  I can't find any reviews on essure. Does anyone know anyone that's had it done?  I have two kids and not looking to have anymore.  I know essure if permanent.  I want something permanent without surgery.  If anyone could help me out I would appreciate it.
Birth Control	girlsx2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/25/2010 2:22:34 PM	I had my Mirena inserted in Jan 2009. It was not painful at all. But I had just had my swcond child in Nov 2008. I had one period in Feb 2009 but that has been it. No weight gain. I actually lost about 30 pounds. But the only thing I have problems with is yeast infections. I seem to be getting them on a monthly basis since January 2010. I'd rather have a period. LOL! But everyones' body is different so you don't know how yours will react until you try it. And everyone has a different pain threshold. It is definitely the easiest birth control I have ever tried. Like one reviewer said &quot;give it a year&quot; and if you don't like it, then have it removed.

The mood swings, fatigue, abdominal pain, head aches, vaginal odor, cramping, no libido and tremendous amount of weight gain is almost too much. I am going to my doctor to find out about having it removed. After seeing what I am going through, my husband is now very willing to have a vasectomy. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Winnerie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	8/23/2010 9:27:17 PM	Due to prolonged heavy periods (heavy flow for 5-8 days) I became extremely anemic.  I had the Mirena IUD inserted in December 2008.  For the first year, I had irregular periods, but they were very light.  I also experienced hair loss, which has since stopped, and weight gain (almost 40 pounds!).  The biggest complaint I have is with the icky brown discharge that just won't let up.  And now, I'm suddenly having a slightly heavier period every 2 weeks.  When I'm not experiencing a &quot;period&quot; I'm going through brown discharge.  Needless to say, I'm dealing with a lack of sex life.  No fun for me or my hubby.  I'm tired of the discharge and the constant need for a light/regular tampon or liner.  I'm going to the doc tomorrow to see if there's something that can be done.  I went through a 2-week course of estrogen last winter that helped for awhile, but that has since stopped.  While the Mirena IUD has been great for slowing down the bleeding, it has caused enough side effects that I'd consider taking it out tomorrow if I could.  My husband has had a vascectomy so birth control is not an issue.  I've had 3 kids, which is probably why the insertion did not hurt at all--no worse than a pelvic exam.  In fact, I don't remember much about that.

Swollen ankles, huge breasts that feel tender and like lead balloons, mood swings, uncontrollable itching all over my body, dizziness, palpitations, and headaches every day. I look pregnant and feel horrible and ugly, i was a UK size 12 prior to having this fitted 5 years ago, and was for most of my life except when i was pregnant. I am now a size 18 and eat healthy and i just cannot seem to lose any weight. I am now going to have this Mirena coil removed....my advice, if you are thinking about having one fitted......don't!!!

I'm 19, child-less, and have had the IUD for almost 2 years now. i did not have problems until summer started. My mood swings and libido are horrible. I'm so disappointed because I love not having to worry about blood. But this is ridiculous!

I would advise u to take a pain reliever before the procedure. There was spotting for 2 days after. Also spotting after a day off from intercourse.  Some slight cramp-like feeling sporadically. Contrary to info on the internet, my lover did not even feel the string/thread nor did it interfere with intimacy. Love it. 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	35-44	8/18/2010 11:10:57 PM	Placement was extremely painful and I had cramping for about 2 weeks.  Then slowly the cramping and lower abdomin pain got worse and worse.  I ended up missing 2-3 days of work a month.  I found out I have Ovarian cysts caused by the IUD.  The only relief I have been able to get is with accupuncture, however I'll have to continue with 3 to 4 treatments a month, or have the IUD removed.  The IUD was inserting in September of 2009 and I have tried it for the last year.  The string has also caused sores on my husband's penis during sex.  The longer the IUD is in, the more painful sex is becoming for me.

I had a little discomfort afterwards but nothing compared to after birth. Since having Mirena, i am tired alot and my husband can fell it during intercourse. I bled for about 6-7 months stright after having it put in, then went to regular periods without the cramping, which was nice. Now my periods are shorter but still regular. i haven't experienced crazy side effects, but sex is half the time uncomfortable and i have no sex-drive at all, except spirts of horniness. If someone asked me if I thought they should get it, I would say it depends on what your willing to put up with. It's not for everyone and the reaction to it differs with every woman. Before going to your OB/GYN's office make a list of ALL the questions you have because you are sure to forget when you get there.

Although I do love her with all my heart I was only 17. Well after her my doctor put me on the pill again, insisting would be my reminder to take it because he &quot;was against Mirena&quot;. Well, I got pregnant but unfortunately lost the baby. This time I went to another doctor and she agreed that with my busy schedule working full time, raising a child and trying to go to school, Mirena was just what I needed. And guess what no more babies. I have had none of the negative side effects other that slight weight gain but I just increased my workout. Oh and if someone gets nervous about the first doctor, don't worry he just doesn't get commission off Mirena. So he gave me something not for me....

Insertion - obviously uncomfortable, but manageable.  I had bizarre side effects at first - hip pain of all things, as well as cramping and bleeding.  My boobs bacame non-existent (which I didn't mind - they've always been a C - down to a B).  It has now been over a year and within the last 10 days, I have put on 7 pounds, my boobs are HUGE - and so sore - I need to wear 3 sports bras to bed so they don't move, and I have been bloated and cramping the entire time.  I swore I must be pregnant!! Test was negative.  I made an appointment to get it OUT!!!
Birth Control	Kimberly, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	8/13/2010 3:09:56 PM	I got my IUD put in December of 2005.  Although it wasn't horrible going in, I had lots of bleeding for the next 6 months.  Then my periods became an on and off thing (I'd go 6 months without one and then get one).  I have had regular pelvic exams and each time they said it was still in there right.  I had an ultrasound today and they couldn't find it.  When they finally found it on the ultrasound it was way too low in my uterus and they don't think it was giving me protection at all, so they took it out.  OH MY!  The pain was HORRIBLE with it coming out.  I still feel like garbage 3 hours later.  I will never get an IUD again, I'll stick to the pills.  The pain of it coming out definitely wasn't worth the almost 5 years I had it.  To me, it felt like giving birth again, which wasn't a great feeling..
Birth Control	Erica, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/11/2010 1:32:44 PM	i was so nervous about getting the IUD after reading all of the horrible reviews... but i have had it now for about a month and i cannot be happier w it. The insertion was HORRIBLE and very painful. I cramped and bleed for 1 day after. then no pain or spotting for a few weeks. I went to the dr and he checked everything and said it was perfect. i have been spotting now off and on but no pain or cramping at all. I'd say my only complaint is not knowing when you are going to spot. Overall, i am completly satisfied.
Birth Control	sarah87, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/10/2010 9:29:37 AM	I had the IUD inserted 3 1/2 years ago and have loved it ever since. Insertion was easy, no more uncomfortable than a pap, and only had light spotting each month for 2 years, now no periods at all!!! However, after reading some of the other reviews, I am wondering if some things I have been experiencing are because of the mirena. I have had no sex drive at all since I had my daughter and got the IUD. I am exhausted all the time, everyday which says can be a side effect too. I am also wondering how it will effect my ability to get pregnant at the end of the 5 years. Has anybody ever stayed on it for that long who can tell me if it caused difficulty getting pregnant or not?
Birth Control	dlwnov, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/9/2010 5:35:00 PM	I got the Mirena Aug. 2005, Shortly after I had my 3rd daughter. The only 2 problems I had was the first time my husband and I tried to have intercourse, he felt the &quot;the string&quot; he described it as a bee sting. and shortly after i could feel what I thought was the end of the IUD. I went to see the doctor he said everything looked ok. I have not had any problems at all. I very rarely had periods when I did they were short maybe a day or two and very light flow. Now after 5 years I have had a regular monthly period for the last 3 months my doctor said its because there is probably no hormone left and all the crappy symptoms that come along with having a period have returned. I would recommend it to any one. I will be having mine removed in Sept 2010. I am sad because I no longer have insurance on myself and it will cost $1200 to have another. So I guess it's back to the pill again:(

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	ac, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	8/8/2010 11:11:58 AM	I had Mirena for 3mos,,,,the worst 3 mos I can remember!  I am 48 and have endured long painful periods last couple years and decided to give this a try before ablasion surgery.   Within first month I gained 7lbs!!  I excercise like crazy and get nothing from it because of the mirena.   In last 3mos, maybe only a few days where I have not had spotting.   I have been PMS'ing for 3mos, and after reviewing my last 3mos, I see I am one of the less than 5% that has had about every side effect.   I would rather have my old life back and deal with the periods than all the side effects from last 3mos of &quot;hell&quot;.  I am having it taken out this week, would have actually done it myself with the mood swings, but I overcame that!I now know why I sleep so much including needing an afternoon nap or a grande expresso everyday, have had acne breakouts, weight gain (my watch is tight on my wrist!!) and been so depressed.I wish everyone better luck than me with your Mirena....guess just not for me.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Natashia86, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	8/6/2010 6:27:11 PM	I just received the Mirena on yesterday. My doctor gave me to pills one to relax me and one to open up my cervix. It was extremely painful. I am 24 years old with no kids. I bled afterwards and was in so much pain when I got home. I took two 800 mg ibprophens which helped a little. After I showered I have not bled at all. It may take some time for my body to get use to it. I am still experiencing mild cramps but other than that I am ok. Every womens body is different and no two people will experience the same thing. So if you wanting to try it, you will have to take the risk of trying it on your own and see how it affects you.

Birth Control	bethm1310, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	8/6/2010 6:02:05 PM	I was put on Mirena shortly after I had my son at my first OB/Gyn check up. It was pretty painful for the insertion of the IUD. Afterward i was dizzy and had the sweats. Almost three weeks later I began to have really painful cramps and checked my strings that came out of my cervix and I could feel the plastic tubing also. I called the OB and they told me to take it out, that it had come out of place and needed to be reinserted. When removing the IUD I felt nothing. this was scary to me becuase it is used for birth control and if you cannot feel it comming out besides cramps how would I have known? I went back on the pill immidiately after the removal and will NEVER get the IUD again. I know someone who has had it grow into their uteran lining and had to have it surgically removed. For those who are seeking this IUD for birth control I do not recommend it.

When my ob/gyn said most people take tylenol before the procedure, I thought maybe that was just for period-like cramps. I regret not taking a 24-hour advil or a vicodin before. Right after the procedure I had severe cramping. I couldn't drive so I pulled over, got a drink from a gas station and waited until the advil kicked in. After 45 minutes, the cold sweats and cramps subsided. Because I had a miscarriage and not a full delivery I was given a pill that dialates the uterus which helped with insertion. I can feel the strings as soon as I enter my finger into the vaginal canal. I have a romantic evening scheduled with my sweetie next week. Hope all is well by then, but I'm concerned about the strings interfering with intercourse. I will keep you posted.

Birth Control	Emily, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/2/2010 9:38:46 PM	I had the Mirena inserted after my first child in  Jan. 2006. I had a heavy period the month after and have not had a period since. I just got it removed in July 2010 and am completely happy. I never had a period or heavy cramping, nothing to complain about. I am 27 now and we are trying for another...wish us luck!
Birth Control	Trish760, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	8/2/2010 2:41:23 PM	I am 23 and have a 2 1/2 year old son, I had Mirena inserted 29 April 2010. I am horrible when it comes to taking pills on a daily basis. I tried Depo (whew the weight gain!!), I had the patch, and the ring. I was so excited when I first saw the commercials!! I hesitated on getting it right away, I knew two people who had it inserted and were not happy! Finally I decided I really wanted it! I have had it approx. 4 months now, I was told that these syptoms are not part of mirena, but I am not conviced. The insertion was painful, but to me worth it! I only blead for 2 days. My periods are so light, about 3-5 days. I was constipated for over a week after having it inserted! I was told it couldn't be from Merina(I was completely normal before). When I went in for my two week check up I told my doctor I could not feel the string, he said it's fine that when it's time to remove it they will not have a problem. Well, the last 3 weeks or so I have an my pregnancy symptoms! I have ONLY had heartburn when pregnant!! I will be taking a test, but can't figure out how???? That is really my only thing, that now I have those symptoms. My partner &amp; I can not feel it. It only hurt the day of insertion and cramps the day after. It has been the easiest thing since minute rice! But maybe too good to be true????

I did not want anymore more children. Of course there is a little cramping when it is first put in, but other than that I have barely there spotting maybe once every 2 months and a some breast tenderness. It has been wonderful!!! 5 years without worrying about a pill or a period is fantastic!
Birth Control	Anonymous, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/1/2010 4:58:02 AM	After switching birth-control pills three different times, I decided to give the Mirena a shot after talking to my OB/GYN. Since I have not given birth, extra steps were taken to make sure that the insertion went smoothly and painlessly. However I experienced severe cramping afterward, but this is normal considering I haven't had kids.I still have light periods, and have broken out a few times. I still have cramps every so often, but considering the hormonal drama that is birth control pills, I'd rather deal with the pain. What is great is the fact that my libido jumped with in a few weeks of being on the Mirena and there isn't any stress about being spur of the moment.The only thing that would make this perfect is if I didn't cramp any more. But for the most part, I am glad I have the Mirena. However, it is NOT for everyone.

It has been great for me up until now. I never had a period, cramps, or any problems with it. Now... I have started having horrible cramps, tiredness, very hungry all the time now, I feel like I am depressed now, crying all the time for no reason. I have also started having spotting. I am going to try to get this thing out as soon as possible!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	7/30/2010 12:05:38 AM	The placement of this IUD has been the hardest part about it thus far.  I was not prepared for the horrible cramps I experienced; having my labor induced was much easier!  I've only had it for six weeks and so far this is my only complaint.    
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	7/29/2010 1:56:44 PM	I got this in August of 2008. At first I had occassional spotting, but it was better than my period. Now after almost 2 years and reading the reviews, I realize that I have memory loss, constant crying, cramping in my calves (like a charlie horse), acne out of this world (never had acne problems before), breast tenderness, and my boyfriend can feel it/is irritated by it, etc. Recently I have started to develop weekly UTIs(never had before) and/or bacteria vaginosis, followed by a yeast infection from the meds. Going to the Dr today and hopefully this thing is coming out. 
Birth Control	ahlewis85, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	25-34	7/28/2010 11:22:22 AM	I got the Mirena IUD 8/2008 after I had my second child. Before receiving the birth control I was normal I had a regular period and I was not over weight. Within 6 months of the birth control my body just begin to act so different. I was very moody, just all around upset. I didn't want to have sex I was just a complete mess. So I went to my doctor and he talked me into just keeping it. So I did and it is now two years later and nothing has changed. I have seen a great weight gain I went from 120 to 180 pounds. I work out and eat right. I am just so upset with this product. I strongly don't believe that this is for every women out there. I wish I would have really researched this products before I allowed it to be inserted into my body. Another thing when you have the Mirena inserted it actually grows into your body it becomes apart of you so when you take it out it does hurt. I would not suggest this to ANYONE. :-(

Birth Control	mercrombie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	7/24/2010 11:15:50 PM	I had my IUD placed at my 6 week check up after my 2nd was born. I just had it removed less than a week ago. The positives: no pill to remember, my husband and I did not even notice it, it prevented pregnancy, no change in sex drive, no period, no weight gain. The negatives: there was a change in my body odor, no period(just felt wrong), felt bloated all the time, and finally(the deal breaker for me) no weight loss. After hiring a personal trainer and changing my eating habits, I only lost 5 pounds in 3 months.  Also, after having it removed, I have felt very sluggish, no energy what so ever, and my period has returned. I hope this review helps someone out there.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	sandra, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	7/19/2010 11:18:19 AM	I had Marina for about 8 month.  Few days ago I got it remove. In the end of second day, I started to bleed with big blood clots. I was about to go to ER.  I got Marina  to prevent heavy periods,  but  while having it,  I experienced  very painful  breast  (enlarged  two sizes up) , gain 10 pounds in first two month , hair loss and  constipation, that I end up having a colonoscopy ,which it did not show anything that would cause   such constipation. Also, after five month a mammogram and ultrasound showed that I have a lump in my right breast. It did not show any lumps a year ago in a mammogram. I'll have another ultrasound after six month.
Birth Control	Breanna, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	7/18/2010 10:26:22 PM	I got it when my daughter was 2 months old (9/06). I had light periods that lasted about 3 days up until December. Then they were non-existent. I had minor weight gain, no acne, but my sex drive didn't really increase or decrease. At least not until I had it for over 2 years. After I hit that mark it seemed my libido soared. Right before my 3 year mark in May I had really bad cramps to the point that I couldn't even stand up straight. It July I had to have it taken out due to interference with work and life. Even though I had problems after almost 3 years I started having problems, It was worth having and not worrying about a pill or patch. All I can say is that you decide and choose what works for you.
Birth Control	Brenda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/16/2010 6:57:20 PM	Placement was a breeze....I don't know why so many say how painful it is.  Its not, so don't let that scare you into not trying it.  I just got mine put in today and it is painless.  I will check in after some time goes by to let you know how its working for me.  But so far I am impressed and excited not to have to remember to take a pill everyday.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/15/2010 12:51:30 PM	I was previously on ortho tri cyclen for over 10 years prior to trying this method. On the pill, I was having longer and longer menstrual bleeds every month and a complete lack of interest in intimacy. I had Mirena placed about 2 months ago. The placement was painful, but mercifully quick. For the month following it's placement, I had very light spotting on a daily basis (only a pantiliner needed) and pretty significant cramping, especially when I did anything physical. The cramps immediatley stopped the day I started my period, which was lighter than in the past. During this second month, I have been experiencing more spotting on most days, although I have had a few days here and there without any bleeding. Little or not cramping most days this month. I have had a return in desire for intimacy and my partner did not feel anything when we had intercourse. Intercourse was a little odd for me, but I think that it was more psychological than anything. I have not experienced any weight gain (I've actually lost 4 pounds since it was placed), no emotional outbursts, or acne. My doctor explained to me that there is an initial adjustment period of 3-6 months with this device and once that time is up, the spotting should cease and my periods will be very light or nonexistant. I have also never had a child. Overall very happy so far, despite some initial discomforts, but figure it will be well worth it to go through 3-6 months of minor issues to hopefully have 4.5 + years of easy, good birth control that will allow the return of my sex drive and lessen or eliminate the 8, 9, 10 or more day periods. 
Birth Control	Kandi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	7/14/2010 11:15:09 AM	Insertion was extremely painful &amp; only a week later I'm back @ dr getting placement checked b/c thread is barely outside of cervix &amp; hurting my husband when we have intercourse.  Very painful for me as well- sharp/dull pain on rt side of low pelvic region. Doc is about to do ultrasound to double check.  We'll see what happens; trying to stay positive, but it's hard when a device that I meant for birth control is preventing me from even doing anything that might get me pregnant:-(  
Other	klmrcx, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/14/2010 1:37:21 AM	So I a thiry-one year old mother of one who has just had a kidney transplant and was told that having a child on my meds would most likely result in major birth defects for the baby and possible death for me. My daughter is my miracle due to a high risk pregnancy so I went to my OB and asked for a tubal. I was told that Mirena would be a better and safer choice, so I agreed to have it placed. Immediately I began having severe abdominal pain that felt like someone was kicking me. My doc said to relax and lay down for as long as I needed until I felt better. After trying several times to get up only to realize that the pain was much more severe and that my leg had gone numb, I started having nausea and feeling like I was going to pass out. For two and a half hours I layed in excrutiating pain until finally my doc asked if I wanted it out. I said yes and immediatly I had relief. The pain and nausea was gone and I had the feeling back in my leg. My doc said that I was the first person she ever saw that had the serious and someimes rare side effects. I am now scheduled for the tubal.

After spending over an hr reading these comm I will b making calling my Dr. ASAP, and hopfully she will hv a solution for aleast1 of my issues(sex drive#1) cause this is the best B/C ever! Outside of my lack of sexuall motivation.
Birth Control	bridgette, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	7/13/2010 8:15:34 PM	I'm 19 and childless. I've had my mirena for a year and 7 months now. I was fine until last month, when my mood swings got severe and I lost my libido completely. I've been dating the same guy for 3 years now, and he's noticed these changes too. I'm going to try to wait it out and take care of myself in the meantime, but if things don't go back to normal, I may have it removed. I almost thought I was depressed again but I'm pretty sure it's just PMS. I've never had bad PMS before, so I'm very disheartened. I also have strange under-the-skin acne, unwanted black hairs, and ovarian cysts. Even my skin seems different. I think I tan easier and repel mosquitoes better because of the hormones. I could be completely wrong about that. I will say that I was once completely enamored with mirena because I never had to worry about anything menstrual. I still appreciate the benefits. I don't have to buy tampons anymore! It alleviates a lot of stress. But my recent experiences are making me reevaluate my decision. I'll write back later. 
Birth Control	MrsLC, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	19-24	7/12/2010 3:13:54 PM	I had this placed for 2 1/2 years now. In the begining it seemed okay, other than the continuous cysts on my ovaries. Then developed horrible cramping, constant spotting, and mood swings. I have lower abdominal pain often and feels like pressure, I went to the doctor and they said everything was okay. I'm just gonna wait it out and see how the next 2 1/2 years go, if I can last that long.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/9/2010 5:09:45 PM	I was on Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo for several years.  There were times when I would forget a pill and have to catch up which always lead to panic attacks come the time when I expected my period.  So I finally decided to try Mirena after seeing the commercials.  I do not have children.  I do not want children, so this is a good option for me since I'm not so positive about not wanting kids to get my tubes tied.  Anyways, the insertion was painful.  No doubt about it, but it is quick and the pain subsided quickly after the procedure.  I did have some minor cramping in the days following along with spotting during the first 2 months.  It was hard getting used to not knowing exactly when my period would arrive the way I did on the pill.  However, my body seems to have fully adjusted now and I am getting a period each month for about 3-4 days, very light.  I do not get cramps.  I have no discomfort during sex, nor does my fiance.  Thus far I am completely happy with my decision to use Mirena as my birth control.  It has been effective and easy.  I never have to think about it other than to check for the strings every couple weeks, though I check more often just out of paranoia.  I would recommend.
Birth Control	isaacsMama, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	7/7/2010 10:53:30 AM	Well, I had worte on here before that I wasnt happy with this IUD, due the the weight gain, headaches, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, mood swings...and the list goes on... Just and update. I went to the doctor to have it removed ( after insisting and arguing with the dr) and come to find out that the IUD is MIA. Yup, my dr. couldnt find it. After doing an ultrasound, looks as though it is imbedded in my uterus and I will have to have surgery to have it removed. IF all goes well, I might be able to have another baby, however that depends on the amount of scarring my uterus will now have from this method of birth control. I really regret ever getting this inserted.

The first 6mths is great but after that its down hill...I thought it was just me being a wuss after having a baby but after reading all these reviews my symptoms are EXACTLY the same!!! NO PERIOD - but I have IBS symptoms, low back pain, abdominal pain, cervical pain, feel the IUD moving causing pain,  weight gain, teen-age acne, dizziness/light-headed if I bend over, cramping, PMS, mood swings, severe hunger around that time of the month which is whenever it chooses to come(that is all the symptoms w/o the bleeding), fatigue, leg cramps,soreness all over, MIGRAINES ~ THE WORKS!!!! These are symptoms outside of the normal &quot;that time of the month&quot; BEWARE OF THIS IUD. These are all things I never had before. Think this all the way through before you get this one ladies; the after affects may not be worth it.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	7/7/2010 12:14:22 AM	I am 21 years old, never had a child, and had Mirena placed about a month ago. I did a ton of researched, and its important to know that talking with your gyno is the best way to go about deciding if its right for you. The first week or so I barely spotted, and had a few mild cramps that went away with a few asprin... So far I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS.. i was worried i couldnt feel my strings, but after searching, and a return doctors visit i was reassured that everything was fine! The insertion was easy, my doctor walked me through it. and well ive had no negitive side effects besides small cramps. I reccommend Mirena to almost all my friends!
Birth Control	isaacsMama, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	7/6/2010 12:41:51 PM	After having my son last year, I decided to have the Mirena IUD. After reading up on it and talking with my doctor it seemed like the best thing for me. However, shortly after getting it, i noticed that I started having headaches and migraines like Ive never had before, I also started to get dizzy at the most random of times and with that came nausea and sometimes vomiting.My husband even thought for a short time that I was pregnant yet again but i wasnt. My doctor brushed it off as &quot;my body readjusting after having a baby&quot;. I also noticed that I began to gain wait and had a very hard time losing little if any weight at all. (during the 6weeks after i had my son, i lost 23lbs. all of which I gained back within 3 months of having the Mirena IUD). It has now been a year since I've had the Mirena inserted and I am still struggling to lose the weight, having headaches and mood swings. I will be going to the doctor soon to have mirena removed.

No more periods, no yucky weight gain, no decrease in sex drive (all side effects I had with pill and Depo shot). Insertion was a breeze b/c my doc took multiple precautions to make sure it was as painless as possible (numbing shot, numbing spray, Motrin, and a cervical dilating pill). Few days of general tenderness afterwards, and after a few months of &quot;settling in&quot; where I was cramp-y on occasion, things are great and have been since. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a super easy, super effective birth control!

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	6/25/2010 6:34:56 PM	I have a five year old son and after a couple a years of not being on birth control (just being &quot;careful&quot;) I decided to try Mirena to ease my mind. It seemed like the best thing out there because it's simple.. no extra time or thought put in. Well.. I started having lower back pain (which Ive only experienced while in labor), bloating, 10 lb weight gain, mood swings, my husband and I could feel it during intercourse.. &amp; nothing pleasant! I realize everyone is different but to me the benefits do not outweigh the side effects/risks. Also, I have a friend that had an IUD and after being in severe pain found out that she had Pelvic Inflammatory Disease.. so needless to say had it removed. She has two girls (4 &amp; 6) and since having the IUD removed has had two miscarriages. Her first two pregnancies happened first try.. now two miscarriages?? IUDs are not worth the risk!!

To have it put in was not to bad. 3 large cramps but my Dr. gave me valium before the procedure. Its been a month and I have not stopped bleeding or passing clots. I get waves of cramps that make me sweat and dizzy along with lower back and pelvic pain. I feel like Im in a constant state of PMS. Im moody and sooooo very drained. Im sleeping up to 13 hours a night and always want to nap. I have IBS/Colitis and I &quot;think&quot; its causing a flare. Im hoping in time I will even out and start to feel better?

I ahve never had issues with a Birth Control and i have had 95% of the side effects including the serious contact your doctor side effect with this IUD. Many of my friends have had issues as well from lumps in the breast to cysts on their ovaries. I'm worried that this is were it is leading but i can't get it taken out because no doctor takes my medicaid and it cost several hundred dollars. I would NOT recommend this IUD to anyone. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/22/2010 5:15:34 AM	I am 21 years old, and have a 11 month old daughter. I have only had Mirena for 10 days now, but so far so good. The insertion wasn't bad at all. Actually, after talking to my doctor before insertion, I was very nervous about it. My doctor told me to take IBUprofen before the procedure, and that helped. My doctor warned me about all of the possible side effects, and frankly I think it is primarily your responsibility to ask questions and find out important details of anything that is going to be inserted into your body. I do not think that you should get mirena without asking all the questions and doing a little research to determine if it will be right for you. The insertion wasn't bad - just felt uncomfortable and crampy - and only took about 10-15 min all together. I am still bleeding, but am hoping it will stop soon, as my doctor said it was just my uterus cleansing, and should stop in a few days. I will update again after a while, and I hope to still have positive things to say. Good luck to all of you!

It was great the first couple of months. The first year had real light periods that lasted like 1 day and was every 6 months.Now going into year 2 havent had a period for a year now. I keep headaches, vaginal discharge with odor, pain in my uterus off and on every once in awhile, when I am supposed to be having a period my breast are extremely sore. I cannot sleep at night, I am always tired and moody. There are times that I am crying and I have no reason to be feeling like that. I get diareah every now and then. I stay depressed. I vomit sometimes. I swore I was pregnant once. But yea I hate it and as soon as I can I am getting it removed!

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	35-44	6/17/2010 2:43:26 AM	I had my IUD inserted in Jan 2010.I have had bleeding/spotting almost every day since then. I get about a 5 day break per month and then right back at it. I am experiencing bad side effects. Very bad fatigue, extremely bad mood swings, Acne like never before in my life, and cannot lose weight for nothing. I am very active. 5-6 days per week for about an hour a day. I run, I cardio train and watch what I eat and cannot shed a pound. I will be calling my DR. in the morning to see about having this thing removed. Works for Some but not for everyone.

That was 2 yrs ago and I am now so glad I made the decision to have it placed. Many of the reviews are terrible and downright scary. The insertion was very painful as I have never had children. I had light bleeding for about 2 weeks after insertion, then spotting for 8 months after. I have not had a period since(love)! I have some minor cramping at the end of each month, when I should be getting my period. I have had some side effects but nothing I won't or can't deal with. Mild acne and some facial hair growth. I have my acne under control with the right skin care. I was worried about the decrease in sex drive many had reported. This was the problem I encountered with many of the pills, this is not the case at least for me with mirena. I now have an increased sex drive for once in my life! I use this for very heavy periods and birth control and could not be happier with it's effectiveness. Everyones bodies are different but this has been great for me!

It was very painful getting it put in after my daughter was born.  Then i had an xray and was told my iud was sideways but it was still &quot;ok&quot; had cramping very badly.  Now after a year and a half I went in for cramping and found out that it is now in my pelvis!  I am told i now need surgry to have it removed!  I do not want it again!  Very painful
Birth Control	ethansmom, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	6/14/2010 2:28:05 PM	I had the Mirena inserted 6 weeks after having my son and had it removed after 2 years of having it. Insertion was a breeze as was removal and not having to think about taking anything or getting shots was great. However, I hate the fact that almost every doctor says there are no side effects from removal and not really any when the Mirena is in. There are obviously many people who experience symptoms and I think doctors should tell women this from the get go. They make a lot of money off the product which always leads to negative information being omitted. My story: I didn't have a period on Mirena (after some slight spotting the first few months), no big change in sex drive or moods. However, from the time I got it put in I had severe cramps that would come and go, often so bad I thought I would pass out and couldn't move, felt like having my son all over again. Went to the doctors multiple times and all said it couldn't be my IUD, it was probably IBS that just happened to start the day I got my IUD. Over the two years the episodes got further apart but still happened a couple times a week. After getting it removed I have not had any of the cramps except right after removal which weren't bad. I have had terrible headaches since getting it removed however. Hoping they will go away since it's only been out about a week now. Many people experience a crash after getting it out but usually fades by two months, usually sooner. I am bothered that my doctor told me there were no side effects with getting it removed when there clearly are for many women. 
Birth Control	snbmomma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	6/13/2010 7:26:35 PM	I, like most was nervous about trying mirena. I finally did after our last child was born almost 4 years ago. It was uncomfortable during insertion, but no more than a period cramp. I have not really had a period, just occasional spotting. My sex drive is gone..as in in non-existent. This drives my husband crazy. Then a few days ago I made an ER trip due to kidney stones. During my trip they did a CAT Scan of my pelvic/stomach area. The next day the ER doctors called me back to tell me that my IUD had dislodged itself and was growing into the side of my uterus. I was then informed to see my doctor immediately. I have my appt tomorrow, and am scared to death about what is going on in my body. So now am looking at the possibility of having my uterus removed! No more kids for me...period! Hoping and praying this does not happen. I am 30 years old and have never had a surgery in my life!    
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	6/11/2010 12:42:39 AM	I am 21, married, and I have a daughter. I have had mirena for a year and a half. I got mirena 6 weeks after I had my daughter. It was painful have put in, but after a few hours the pain subsided. I continued to breastfeed, and lost around 25 pounds, within three weeks after I stopped breastfeeding (while excersing, eating right, and actively working) I gained 15 pounds. My acne tripled. These symptoms have not gone away. I still cannot lose the weight although I haven't gained anymore weight. I am constantly depressed and it gets worse at times. I am constantly tired no matter if I sleep all day, and some nights I cannot sleep at all. I feel discomfort during intercourse, if I feel up to intercourse at all. I will say that I haven't gotten pregnant, at least this drug is good for that.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	6/3/2010 2:34:11 PM	I had the mirena inserted in march of 2008, six weeks after the birth of my second child. During insertion there was minor cramping. A couple hours after it was just an uncomfortable feeling in my abdomen. I am satisfied with the mirena because it is easiest most affective birth control method. However I have experienced some side affects, constant yeast infections, discharge and oder. I almost never have a period and when I do I spot for maybe half a day then nothing for 3-4 months. I have little patience with my kids, and with a 2 year old is never good. I am definitely having this removed and going back to the pill.

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Bad Experience, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	6/1/2010 2:29:06 PM	I was 44 years old and my doctor recommended Mirena to control heavy menstrual bleeding. At one month follow up appointment, my doctor discovered the device had shifted out of position so she removed it and re-insert a new one, which meant I had to endure the pain and discomfort of the procedure again. Less then three months later, I had a very painful and uncomfortable menstrual cycle and the device came out on its own.  My doctor said this has never happened to any other patients she had.  I am very disappointed with this entire experience.  I will not recommend Mirena to any one.  
Birth Control	robyn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	5/31/2010 10:15:41 PM	I have had Mirena in for just over 2.5 years, it was great for the the first year and half.  Rarely had periods.  Slowly over the last year things have gone bad.  Over the last year I have been much more PMS-y, increasing all the time.  For 2 to 3 weeks I am either bloated, constantly hungry and eating, fatigued, sleepy, mood swings, depressed, anxiety and thinking I am crazy.  Then it will go away and i will get a light period for 2 weeks followed by spotting.  I get irregular spotting all the time.  I get bad lower bad fatigue and cramps that run through my quads.  I am very active and extremely healthy so this is not normal.  I have lost sex drive over the last few months.  I have had many yeast infections over the last year.  Sometimes the mirena gets bumped during sex which is very painful and leads to further abdominal pain.  After reading other reviews I am hoping my symptoms are due to Mirena as well.  Will be getting it out in a couple weeks and I am hoping things will change after that.  Insertion was awful, I almost threw up and did faint.  Hoping the removal will be better.  Mirena has been 100% effective as a birth control though.

I have had no periods since having it in. I have gained about 15 pounds though. The only negative things about it is the painful insertion and the gaining of weight.

I love it. I only have cramping the day I am spotting and that's it. I have a day of spotting maybe up to 3 every couple of months.  I agree with prior postings, you have to give your body time to adjust to it.  I have not gotten pregnant and no major side effects.  It has worked fantastic for me. Ladies give it at least a year then decide if you like it or not.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	ALM, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	5/22/2010 1:57:46 AM	I had Mirena inserted in Oct 2009. It did resolve my issues with heavy periods however, after several months of spotting, I have been left with a discharge. In Feb 2010 I had a really heavy period in which I lost a lot of clots. This prompted a visit to my GYN. An ultrasound in March 2010 found that I had now developed cysts in my right ovary, my fibroids had grown and my uterus went from being 8x8 in Sept 09 to 12x8. My 2month follow-up in May 2010 found that the cysts have almost doubled in size, the fibroids have grown more and my uterus is now 16x8. Based on blood tests, I have no sign of cancer. My visit to the GYN Oncologist today ended with the decision to remove my right ovary and uterus. The doctors have NOT said that these problems are related to the Mirena however, I did not suffer from problems of this magnitude before the Mirena. I discovered my fibroids in 1996. 14 years and 2 children later, they remained slow growing and unproblematic with the exception of the heavy periods. The rapid growth occurring in my body at this time comes without definitive  explanation however, I find it questionable that these problems began shortly after the device was inserted. I think that Mirena could be a great fix for most women with heavy periods. Unfortunately it just wasn't for me.

Or i am finally put two and two together. Because i didnt have any of these things wrong with me just 3 months ago.. My back hurts a lot. My legs ache, and its not just the muscles, its like my bones are hurting. I get explosivly angry for no reason. I cant remember some stuff. I have loss of sleep, but yet cant fall asleep sometimes. I get dizzy, and feel way bloated. Like my body just swelled up, not just a weight gain feeling.

First 6-8 months normal periods with medium cramping. Next 6-8 months heavenly (no periods)! Year 2- irregular bleeding often, bleeding after intercourse and excersize. I pushed it off as being similar to first 6-8 months. I read some reviews, could still feel the strings, etc. My Husband could feel the IUD during intercouse since day 1, sometimes it hurt me during sex, like it was being pushed. Mood swings and general loss of patience, acne like I'm back in high school or worse, slight loss of sexual desire, paranoid I would bleed everytime we had sex. Not fun. Tiredness, fatigue, loss of appetite. The last 2 months were hell. I bled for 3 weeks, stopped for one, and then bled for 1 month. I finally went to the DR and at first glace everything looked fine, upon further investigation she found it was slightly dislodged and the wiry strings were in a huge knot. She said her notes said she cut the strings 4cm long and they were more like 6-7cm. She recommended that I take a break from the IUD and we decided to try out the Nuva Ring. So far so good, I have lots of friends and family on the Mirena and Paraguard IUD's and they love it- I just wish it would have worked for me! Just make sure you pay attention to your body, if you think it may be off a little or side affects change, get it checked :) Good luck!

I was told this was the best thing ever by my doctor. When he put it in it hurt so badly. I cramped and bled for about a week. Since then I have tried several diets,etc. none have worked..I keep gaining. Im ALWAYS starving when that is not normal for me, I have facial hair, CONSTANT yeast infections and terrible back and abdominal pain. I have developAnd they caused large cysts 5-8mm. Ive had to go to the hospital on several occasions for the random pain in my abdomen. They never find anything but the cysts. I have spent alot of time reading reviews and i have come to the conclusion that I need to get this thing removed. My psycho mood swings have gotten worse and worse. I have NO patience. Im snappy and angry all the time. I dont even know who i am half the time anymore. Im fatigued and depressed. I have no reasons to feel this way but i consistantly feel this way since i started on this. i think a year is a fair amount of time to make a choice and I have decided that this is NOT for everyone. And I think ill go back to Nuvaring. Less side effects and still pretty easy to use. 
Birth Control	myndles, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	5/10/2010 1:59:05 PM	the first time i used the Mirena was Sept 2008. within 6 months i got pregnant on it. i dont remember any symptoms, so i went ahead and tried it again because of the easy use. I have had it for 2 months now. I have already gained 10 lbs. Worst acne ever, headaches, cramps, nausea, facial hair, increased appetite, bloating. IDK if the benifits of the easy use outweigh the side effects. I think I am getting it removed real soon!
Birth Control	KG, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	5/10/2010 11:18:18 AM	I've had the Mirena since Oct. 07.  I thought it was a miracle form of birth control.  I was wrong.  I am a very avid exerciser - avg. 6-8 hours a week of circuit training, tennis, yoga, etc.  I eat very healthy also.  I gained 10 lbs. over the past two years, yet despite dieting and being incredibly active, I could not get my weight to budge.  I also suffer terrible memory loss, aka &quot;brain fog&quot;, can't remember anything.  I have awful mood swings.  I have no patience for my kids and husband who are amazingly easy-going.  I don't sleep at night and I'm always tired.  After meeting with a nutrition counselor regarding the weight loss portion of my problem, I started looking into hormonal changes in 40 year old women (my age), which led me to looking into my Mirena.   WELL, the blogs I read ASTOUNDED me.  So many women experiencing the exact same symptoms!  I could not believe that I never put everything together.  I had always assumed each issue had its own cause.  I lot of it I just attributed to turning 40!  I'm getting my Mirena removed in two weeks and am praying that this is the answer.

For the first year I had a period at least 2 weeks a month.  I got horrible acne (never had EVER in my life), extreme hair growth on my face, loss of hair,  vaginal dryness with infections and discharge.. My doctor wanted me to wait it out b/c it would get better but the cons are out weighing the pros.. I plan on having it removed asap.

Now nothing I have had Mirena for one year and I LOVE it now!! Give body time to adjust and I hope you love it as much as I do!!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	5/5/2010 7:55:35 PM	I have had the Mirena IUD since April 2009. The insertion was the hardest part about the whole process. And even then it wasn't THAT bad. I've had 2 children and it took about 6 minutes. I did have cramping and it did hurt. But compared to child birth it was nothin.I would compare it to bad period cramps. Today I have a light period and 1 day of cramping.Other than that I can't tell I have one. My advise: GET ONE. You can always have it removed later.

Birth Control	hendo4, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	5/4/2010 11:52:28 PM	I had the Mirena inserted after the birth of my 2nd child. I thought it was perfect. No periods, basically no cramping and worry free. I kept the IUD in for 2 yrs and then decided to have it removed because of 20 lbs of weight gain (over the 2 yrs- this can be done normally as well by  a lazy person like me), facial hair ( I got 1 chin hair and I was shocked- I'm 26 yrs old- it's too early!), my sex drive is decreased a lot and the worse part- my acne. I have never had as much acne as I have with the Mirena. It's been 1 and a half wks since I had it taken out and my acne is literally gone. My face is so clear. I have lost about 1 and a half to 2 lbs in that short time and I and my sex drive came back quickly as well. I'm happy without it. I chose to go back to the pill but I am taking a long break from everything except condoms for at least a few months. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/28/2010 5:28:39 PM	I opted to have Mirena inserted because I have endometriosis, and since suffering a blood clot in 08, I am no longer able to use any of the more practical methods of treatment (like the pill or the nuva ring).It hurt like HELL...so much, in fact, that I could not go through with the entire procedure. I only made it through the 1st measurement and had to stop my doctor. I could not stand the cramping and burning pressure in my cervix and abdomen. I have no children, and I've heard that it's far more painful when you haven't had any, but he never warned me that it would be so painful.I will not get mirena now, knowing how difficult and painful the insertion is. I wrote this review for others to know--It is not a gentle procedure as it is described. Be advised, it can be very VERY painful!
Birth Control	Fifi1976, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	4/28/2010 3:45:39 PM	I have had Mirena in for a little over four months. Getting it put in was painful....and I have had two kids. The positives: Very effective birth control as I have not gotten pregnant and short, light, almost obsolete periods.The negatives: I still have severe cramps, not daily but often. I think I have noticed a little facial hair beginning to appear. My hair is slightly thinning, and I have gained 20 pounds. At this point, I am not sure if the positives outweigh the negatives. They say give it a good six months to let your body adjust to a foreign object inserted inside you, so that is my plan. I will keep Mirena at least two more months to see if my body will adjust....otherwise back to the pill.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	4/23/2010 10:17:02 AM	This medication is super easy to be on, cuz you don't have to think about it. Placing the device was slightly painful, but my doc recommended that i take pain killers 30 min prior... so that helped. I've had no period since I got it, which is nice. The only side effect I got is monthly infections. I got both yeast &amp; bacterial at the same time. I was hopping that my body would adjust and get better, but after reading other reveiws and just knowing my body, I'm going to go have it removed. I say its worth trying, because it does work great... but trust your body and if it doesn't feel right or if there are side effect, get it out :)

Cramps are gone, no PMS symptoms, no bloating and I feel great. But remember it is a foreign object you are inserting into your uterus, you body needs time for it to adjust.

Birth Control	Happy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/19/2010 3:23:13 PM	I had the Mirena insterted about a month ago. Although a little uncomfortable to have it put in, as I have never had a child, it was definatley tolerable. I had cramping for a day or two but was still able to do everything. I have had ZERO side affects and love it. You must trust your Doctor for insertion. I would reccomend this to anyone. No one from my Doctors office has had any issues either. :0)
Birth Control	AshleyB, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	4/15/2010 11:57:04 AM	Not having periods or having to remember to take a pill was great.  But then I gained over 20 lbs over 3 months, got acne, and started growing facial hair.  Soon after that, I developed recurrent/chronic vaginal itchiness/abnormal discharge.  I had the Mirena removed after just over 2 years because I couldn't tolerate the side effects.  I think the convenience factor makes it worth a try if you're willing to risk the sometimes embarassing side effects.
Birth Control	kittymerkat, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/14/2010 2:37:38 AM	I was on Depo for about 8 years, went off of it so I could have a baby (took about a year to get pregnant) and then had the Mirena inserted 6 weeks after my son was born at my normal post-partum check with my OB.  I had no pain with the insertion (likely because I had just given birth 6 weeks before), have had only occasional light spotting since then, and other than a vague sense that something is there from time to time in my uterus (not really cramping, just a weird 'is something in there?' kind of feeling) it has been worry-free and 100% effective. I don't know how long it might take to get pregnant after I have it removed for our attempt at a second child, but my provider has said that once it's out, it's out, there's no &quot;tail&quot; period.  If you can tolerate Depo, have had a child recently and want worry-free birth control, I highly recommend it.
Birth Control	KM826, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/12/2010 8:14:06 PM	I just had the Mirena put in today so I really don't know how effective it is but according to the research I did it seems to be the most effective form of birth control out there. While doing my research I read quite a few reviews about how much it hurt. It didn't hurt, there was mild discomfort during the procedure, and afterwards I felt some mild cramps for a short while. The procedure lasted no more than a few minutes- some people have said that it lasted as long as 15 minutes. Before I had the Mirena put in I was really afraid that it would hurt and was anxious about it but the procedure really wasn't that bad. I think the major factor as to whether or not the procedure goes well for women is their doctor. Fortunately for me, I have a good doctor who knows his way around in there (those are his words) so things such as IUD procedures and pap-smears are quick and painless. There was a OBGYN I had before him who wasn't as quick and painless and I bet that if she had put in my Mirena it would of hurt alot.

Birth Control	Kim K., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/9/2010 2:35:17 AM	am on day 21 of using Mirena.  I am 27 years old and married.  Let me start by saying that getting it put in was the most painful thing I have experienced.  There were two MAJOR cramps.  The first was when she measured me, the second when she put it in.  I went in expecting a cramp, but nothing like how it actually felt.  I couldn't help gripping the table, squirming, and probably moaning or making some noise.  I can't quite remember.  I also had a very bad few minutes after it was put in.  I think it was a combination of the pain and the surprise about the pain.  I felt very dizzy and nauseous.  They let me lay down, gave me some water, and I was better about 20 minutes later.  I had a few cramps the following days and some bleeding.  I had a black gritty discharge that my doctor said was old blood from previous periods coming out.Now that I've been using it I've had a few cramps every few days and spotting.  I freaked out at first because I couldn't feel the strings.  I trimmed my nails and then had no problem.  I thought I had my period about a week ago, but now am having more heavy bleeding and cramping, so this might be it.  I had my follow up appointment with my doctor and she said everything looked good. The cramping and bleeding is normal at first and should taper off.  So, I'm fairly satisfied.Hopefully, the spotting will go away and I'll have some pretty short, light periods.  If so, this is the way to go, even with the major pain of getting it put in.

I had long,heavy periods and very bad cramps. Yoday I have a very light 4 day period with maybe 1/2 day of cramping. It did not make my period disapear but helped dramatically. I really only need the regular sized tampons anymore. I recommend this very highly. I wanted no period but am very happy with the outcome.
Birth Control	Keryne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/31/2010 12:40:40 PM	I am a mother of two and I had the mirena device inserted 2 months after I delivered my son.  The insertion was easy because I was on my period.  I was given a Motrin about an hour before the procedure but had no discomfort or pain.  Initially I had some light bleeding and cramping.  Then nothing.  I like this product because I do not have to think about it.  After reading some of the reviewer's comments, I think a lot of their problems are due to the fact that they have not had children.  Pregnancy and childbirth do not allow our uterus and cervix to return to their original state.  I believe this is why the product is recommended for mothers.  For my needs it is highly effective, painless, and I have not experienced the other side effects that are common with birth control- weight gain, mood swings, loss of sex drive, or hair loss.  I highly recomend it for the mom who might want other children some day.

I called Dr and he said it would go away...but it didn't!!!  I spotted for 9 months!! Argh! So I had it removed after the 9 months. 2 days later I had my regular period, bled for about 6 days, and now no more spotting!  But I did like the progestrone it released because it increased my sex drive. So now the Dr put me on Camila.  Hope it works!

I was not given any medication before the implant I wish I would have that is for sure. I had severe cramping for almost a week followed my random cramping for the next month.  Light bleeding also occurred during that time.  My period is much lighter however I seem to cramp more now.  Overall after I forget how painful insertion was I love my mirena!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/20/2010 9:41:41 PM	Ive had the IUD in place since February of 2009. For 4 months i had severe cramping and bleeding. After that had no problems, had the occasional cramping every now and then. Now every time I have sex i bleed lighty for a few days. Not so sure about that, but I will be talking to my doctor about it soon. The insertion wasn't any more painful then a regular pap smear check, and I've had 2 kids. I would recommend it if you really don't plan on having kids for awhile. Id rather have light cramping, and light spotting, then taking a pill everyday and possibly forgetting, and still continue to have a period.
Birth Control	rj71, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/19/2010 1:17:01 PM	I first had Mirena inserted while on my period 2/4/10. Because I've never had children, the insertion was quite painful and I was given 800mg Motrin &amp; Lortabs for the pain. After a couple of weeks I started to experienced mild depression, increased appetite, acne, loss of sex drive, and fatigue. I felt like I had lost my &quot;mojo&quot; and spotted the entire time I was on it. The doctor said to keep it in for 6-8 wks before giving up on it so I did. I had it removed last week and 2 days after that began to bleed very heavily passing clots the size of saucers! The nurse told me to expect bleeding for the next 2 months. I do however feel better since having it removed. I have a friend that has the Mirena and she loves it. Unfortunately I haven't had much luck with this particular method of birth control. I think I'll stick with the pill.

I have had no bad side effects - I am not gaining weight, no mood swings, no greasy hair.  I am just &quot;me&quot;.

Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	3/13/2010 8:02:04 PM	I love the Mirena IUD because it has totally eliminated my migraines, cramps, bleeding, mood swings.  My only problems have been greasy hair and skin, but it seems like a reasonable trade-off.  no weight loss or gain for me.  I read some of the other reviews which discussed facial hair growth and I might have to agree with that, but not sure if it is related or not.  Overall, I highly recommend this method if you are done having kids and do not want to think about birth control every day, or even every month.

I always thought the side effects were in my head. Had it removed and within 24 hours, was feeling back to normal.Had excessive bloating towards the end, moody, uncomfortable sex (even with strings cut short). I never could feel the strings, which made me parinoid that it wasn't there. Had an ultrasound 5 months ago and it was still there....$250 later and many pregnancy tests, I decided to have it removed. Now, I am looking for another option but am afraid to have the essure put in. I would really not recommend this to anyone.

I also strongly believe that is has caused an onset of joint pains and I have been in and out of hospitals with strong abdominal pains only for the doctors to find nothing wrong! And i haven't stopped lactating since i've been on it. I am having this removed IMMEDIATELYY!!! it more trouble than its worth!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Engel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/3/2010 9:09:38 AM	I have been on Mirena for 4 years now. In fact I have to get it changed out in about 8 months. After being on Depo for 8 years and not having any periods I felt this was the best option for me.  I do not have children and actually found the insertion procedure quite pain-free.  I did find they could cut the springs short enough not to bother my husband (you need to have this conversation with your OB-GYN up front to make sure you are on the same page).  I haven't had any bleeding except some spotting this last year.  It can be a little annoying but it only lasts 1-2 days.  I haven't had any weight gain or cramping (but I do take Topamax so that can effect the weight gain or lack there of).   I have noticed tenderness in my breasts and also mood swings especially as it gets closer to the 5 year mark.  Actually my husband noticed them.  It seemed as it got closer to the 5 year mark my mood swings almost resembled those close to severe PMS (irritability, moodiness, etc).  Those mood swings were not present in the first 3 years.  I will be asking my Ob-GYN on my next visit if this is a normal side effect as it gets closer to the 5 year mark for some of these things to return because it took my and my husband by surprise (it was a pretty marked change in behavior).  I would recommend this form of birth control to anyone not looking to start a family that is in a stable relationship, but I caution you to get all the information first and def. talk to your partner and doctor.  The mood swings were very surprising to both myself and my husband and were not present until much later. 
Birth Control	Mommy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	25-34	3/2/2010 6:06:15 PM	I thought Mirena sounded great.  It was new on the market when I decided to get it.  Right away, there were things I did not like about it.  My husband could feel the strings during intercourse.  I also could feel it moving during intercourse.  I have had greasy hair and some extra hair growth on my chin since I got it.  I am not positive that this caused it, but I had it removed today in case it is contributing.  I also have had tons of spotting or skipped periods the entire time.  Always a mixture, never predictable.  I Mirena in for 20 months thinking things would get better.  Today I went to have it removed and they could not find the strings.  The DR. had to fish for them.  The hook got caught on the IUD and the doctor could not get it off.  It felt a little like labor pains.  Hey, at least this knocked it loose as it had started to adhere to my uterus.  The doctor finally got the hook out and informed me that I would probably need it have surgery to remove it.  I mentioned that I really was not happy about that so he asked if I wanted him to try one more time.  Because it had gotten knocked loose from the stuck hook he was able to finally get it out.  I feel so much better!  The doctor said some women love it, but most have it taken out before the 5 years is up.

I'm 30 now, but I was 29 when this all happened. This was presented as one of the &quot;highly&quot; recommended options. Here were the side effects I experienced:1. Severe moodiness ( My fiance thought I had some kind of mental health issue)2. Spotting (it felt like constant for 10 mos.)3. Smell (The blood from the spotting was horrible. I was mortified.)4.  Acne5.  Hand numbness (severe) I was told multiple times by my m.d. that there was NO WAY the two were connected.  I teach and don't use my hands for tedious tasks all day. Something in me told me my constant and severe hand issue was due to Mirena.I felt like I had to beg and plead to get this thing out of me.  The day I got removed was literally one of the best days of my life.Three days later, no hand pain.I now use condoms- no more acne, normal periods, no stink, happiness, and best of all hands that work.  I never knew how great I had it.I have a new m.d. now too, one that listens.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/1/2010 1:18:23 PM	It has been exactly one week since i've had Mirena inserted. The overall experience of having Mirena inserted was not pleasent, I would definitely NOT say it was painful. Some of these reviews just prove to me they have an inexperienced doctor or a very very low pain threshold! I am 23 years old and have never had children and chose Mirena for that reason, i'm no where near ready for children! So far I have experienced minor cramping and spotting, the cramping is the only uncomfortable part because before Mirena I rarely experienced cramping! Some IBProfen and a heat pad decreases the cramping. I look forward to using Mirena and staying clear from &quot;the pill&quot; or &quot;the patch&quot;, i'm a crazy emotional woman on both forms of birth control which is another reason i have chosen Mirena. I'm also hoping it increases my sex drive unlike other forms of birth control. :) Good Luck to you all!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/26/2010 2:51:29 PM	I absolutely love it. I have had it since August and my period now lasts one day at the most. I can't feel it at all and neither can my boyfriend. It is the easiest form of birth control I have ever used. I don't have to remember to take a pill or change a patch or get a shot. The only bad thing was when they placed it in I had really bad cramps for about an hour but since then I can't think of anything bad.
Birth Control	Wendi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/24/2010 2:01:33 AM	I started using this form of BC about 7 months ago. So far so good. I had come previously off the DEPOshot, so I enjoy still not having my periods, and I don't feel hungry 24/7 anymore. My husband and I are waiting to have our 3rd child for about another year but he's already begging me to take it out cause he hates hitting the string when we are having sex. I guess if your partner isn't that long, he probably won't notice the string at all but it's been 7 months here and my husband hates this!!!!! He says it sucks and can't even enjoy sex the way he'd like to sometimes because it's annoying to have the string there. Overall, I am happy with the results so far with this product. And it's a short term solution till permanent sterilization.

I decided on Mirena after the birth of my child.  My husband and I do not want another child, however we don't want to do anything permanant yet.  I love not having to worry about taking a pill everyday. I have had mine in for 3 years now.  I did suffer cramps after the insertion, but it was just like having a bad period.  After 4 months I stopped having a period at all.  I actually have less mood swings than when I was on the pill. Some months I still have minor PMS symtoms.  I have also never had any problems during intercourse with Mirena.  I would recommend Mirena to anyone.

However, having it put in was easily the worst pain I've ever been through and the doctor didn't even give me a heads up on how painful it would be. It was probably about 3 or 4 days later when the cramps finally eased up. Now my periods are fairly light and my awful period pains have calmed down too. I've been having odd side effects though. At least I think they're side effects. My breasts randomly swell and get very tender, I've been incredibly moody, exhausted, and recently about 4 months after having it in have noticed my sex drive decrease. I've only been married for 2 months now, it's too early for my sex drive to die. Now I have gained 10 pounds that I can't seem to shake, but I don't know if I can blame myself or the IUD. I'm only 5'1'' I've never been big, so 10 pounds means a lot to me.

However, the side effects are annoying.  I continue to have spotting between periods, mild acne, tender breasts, mood swings, less sex drive and less intense orgasms.My husband says he can feel the string but it does not hurt or distract him.
Birth Control	Lilly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	2/17/2010 1:55:26 PM	I got Mirena insterted over 4 yrs ago, the insertion was painful and I wasn't even warned about how painful it would be. I bled profusely for 2 months and have had 14-21 day periods for the last 4 years. I was never told to check the strings, now they aren't even there. I had cramps stronger than contractions that would paralyze my legs from the pain. All of a sudden, I missed my period and have gained weight, I'm fatigued, I have a constant headache, and sore breasts and found lumps 3 days ago. I got Mirena to stop having irregular periods but it didn't work now they're just long, I've never had a pregnancy scare-until now. My doctor has already warned me that removal without strings will be painful since they will have to &quot;blind-probe&quot; because sometimes the ultrasound can't help guide them. If you are considering Mirena please think about it thoroughly especially if you are breastfeeding because the hormones do go into your breastmilk and can affect your child. Something my previous doctor also failed to mention. Mirena is definitely not for everybody so really consider your own body/situation before being caught up by what could be a great option for some. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Lilly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	2/17/2010 12:55:01 PM	I got Mirena insterted over 4 yrs ago, the insertion was painful and I wasn't even warned about how painful it would be. I bled profusely for 2 months and have had 14-21 day periods for the last 4 years. I was never told to check the strings, now they aren't even there. I had cramps stronger than contractions that would paralyze my legs from the pain. All of a sudden, I missed my period and have gained weight, I'm fatigued, I have a constant headache, and sore breasts and found lumps 3 days ago. I got Mirena to stop having irregular periods but it didn't work now they're just long, I've never had a pregnancy scare-until now. My doctor has already warned me that removal without strings will be painful since they will have to &quot;blind-probe&quot; because sometimes the ultrasound can't help guide them. If you are considering Mirena please think about it thoroughly especially if you are breastfeeding because the hormones do go into your breastmilk and can affect your child. Something my previous doctor also failed to mention. Mirena is definitely not for everybody so really consider your own body/situation before being amazed by end results.

The doctor stated that I would have some spotting for up to a year until my body gets used to it. I kept spotting, and finally decided to take a pregnancy test. I am 6 months pregnant. This is my third child, and I did not want any kids. I am very upset, and I'm demanding a refund. 
Birth Control	muffins, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	2/15/2010 11:58:22 PM	I started using Mirena about a year ago. When I got it put in I weighed 130. One year later I'm at 170 and despite a full workout plan and strict diet, I can't lose a single pound. My skin has also become really acne prone, not just on my face, but my back, chest and arms, which I've NEVER had a problem with. All, in all, I had higher expectations from this product, and needless to say, I'm making an appointment to have it taken out.
Birth Control	Angel2, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	2/11/2010 2:34:31 PM	I just had my Mirena removed, (to start a family) after having it in for 3 years. It was VERY painful to have the Mirena put in! Just about unbearable. And I was nervous to have it taken out, but that turned out to be painless. Other than a loss of sex drive, I had no other side effects. The only other complaint was that my partner would hit it sometimes during sex, and that was painful. All in all, I was pleased with it. And will probably use it again after we are through having kids.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/11/2010 6:05:18 AM	Its been almost five years since I started using Mirena and I so far have not had any problems.I do suffer from anxiety sometimes but chalk it up to family stress not the Mirena but who knows? I have gained weight but do not blame it on Mirena,its my eating habits.I have Mirena because my periods were getting heavier and really messy. It has worked wonders for that. At first I had bleeding,sometimes spotting for two weeks but after about six months that tapered off. I have had no periods or bleeding in almost 4 years or more.Only time I bleed is after my exam with OBGYN. I am having this removed in about four months and will have to wait and see what happens they can,t tell if I,m in menopause yet because of the Mirena. I had no cramping with the insertion and am hoping I do not have a problem with the removal of it.I am a little concerened because I have cysts and I hope there is no problem removing it.

Birth Control	knowledge, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	2/10/2010 9:32:06 PM	I wanted to have the choice, to have another child in the future and not think about birth control every day, I already have two children. I had a mirena put in about 2 years ago, it was a very painful procedure, and I wish my doctor had told me to take something for pain before going to his office. I am pretty healthy, I only had suffered with migraines but that was about it. I decided to have a physical, because I was losing a lot of hair and it really freak me out.I'm now having a number of test to find out what is causing this problem. In addition, I have suffered with fatigue, appetite increase, constipation, weight gain, pelvic pain, these feel like side effects, I'm thinking about having it removed.
Birth Control	lilone387, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	2/10/2010 4:44:40 PM	I got it taken out TODAY (2/10/10) and I'm already feeling better!!!!I had my baby in Oct 09 and got Mirena put in on Dec 09. I had the worst side effects.. migranes, weight gain, breast pain, cramping, no intrest in sex, bleeding ALL the time, it sucked and I literally HATED it. It wasn't until about a month after I had it that I went online and checked the reviews. I realized I wasn't the only one and it wasn't just in my head. I'm so happy I got it out now. It's crazy but it seems like as soon as my doc pulled it out.. I felt better instantly! My cousin had it and said she loved it though... I guess it's not for everyone, definately not for me. I also heard if you're breastfeeding traces of steriods will be found in your baby..that made me want to get it out so fast, you don't know what kind of long term effects that could have on your child. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	2/9/2010 6:22:46 PM	I had the mirena inserted Sep 1st 2009 and had it taken out Oct 14th 2009. I am writing this because I feel that I was not fully informed, my concerns were pushed to the side, and that I suffered numerous side effects (nausea, insomnia, sore breasts, anxiety etc). The mirena has been one of the MOST taumatic experiences I have ever had and I am STILL recovering from it. I was in a lot of pain and bleed constantly from day one! 1 week after insertion I suddenly wanted to bawl my eyes out for no reason, and the mood swings (eg anger/dispair) steadily got worse! I didn't want to be around my own self, in my own body - like who the HECK is this person!!!  This experience nearly destroyed my family, I had to quit work, and ended up under community psych care (which I am no longer under). The hormones in the mirena caused MY hormones to go totally out of balance. Ever heard of PMDD? I hadn't but in a nutshell it's 10 TIMES WORSE THAN A REAL BAD PERIOD!!! Everyone is different so if you are considering the mirena ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS AND KEEP ASKING! The pamplet said the mirena may not be suitable for treating abnormally long and/or heavy periods. If that is you then think TWICE! If you do not handle hormonal treatments well once again think TWICE! Quite frankly DON&quot;T DO IT! As for the rest of you I really do wish all goes well as the mirena CERTAINLY is a blessing for some women. In regards to weight gain GET OVER IT. There are things A WHOLE LOT WORSE!!! I certainly KNOW AND UNDERSTAND why some women CHOOSE NOT TO have the mirena. Best of luck

Birth Control	hlstylist, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	2/6/2010 8:33:54 PM	I had my mirena inserted about a month ago. Insertion was very uncomfortable, but tolerable. Bled for about 4 days after and then it stopped. Now am having some light spotting. I was on depo for about 5 years with no period, so Im hoping that the bleeding stops. Will review Mirena on here again later and see if anything has changed. Sex drive has increased since getting off depo and I just generally feel better. Will be perfect birth control so long as the bleeding stops!!

Birth Control	k_mama, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/4/2010 4:47:16 PM	Although this birth control is very effective I will not be using it again due to the complications with removal.  I went in last week to have it removed and the strings had fallen off and they could not get it out.  I returned yesterday to have another procedure done with an ultra sound.  They probed pretty much blindly in my uterus until they were afraid they my perforate my uterus.  It was extremely painful and I have been bleeding and cramping since.  Because they still cannot get it out I now have to have surgery and be put under anesthetic.  I'm really scared to get put under all to get out this birth control devise.  On top of the fact that my doctor said this is happening all the time.  I'm trying to find out it this is a malfunction of the device or what.  If any one knows please post info.  Thanks and good luck with removal.

The inserting of the IUD wasn't bad at all for me, just uncomfortable.  Until Dec 09 I had absolutly No probs, no periods, no break thru bleeding NOTHING.  In Dec 09 I started having painful intercourse, lower abdominal pain as well as lower back pain.  I tried diff thgs for 2 mths &amp; nothing helped so I got it removed yesterday &amp; had the IMPLANON inserted in my arm, so we will see what happens next.  I know it's not for everyone but I thought I would share my experience.

Terrible, wrenching PAIN is more like it. I had light-headedness afterwards, along with nausea. That subsided in a fairly short amount of time but the pain on the left side of my body did not. It continued the day afterwards, shooting down my left leg. Day 2 was pain-free &amp; the bleeding stopped. Day 5 now...no pain...no blood! I'm VERY happy with Mirena!
Birth Control	jepea, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	35-44	1/31/2010 11:33:51 PM	I had high expectations for Mirena, but have been very disappointed....First of all, it was extremely painful.  I felt severe cramping, nausea, and a weird cold-sweat as it was put in place, then felt pretty miserable for the rest of the day.   Two of my friends also use Mirena:  one had it inserted 7 weeks after giving birth, and she said it felt like mild menstrual cramps.  For my other friend, it was so horrible she actually was crying in the doctor's office during the procedure.  I've now had the IUD for 5 months, and am seriously considering having it removed for the following reasons:1. my sex drive is now basically non-existant (it was great until shortly after the Mirena).2.  sex is now painful. 3. I feel moody, bloated, headachy, and vaguely &quot;PMSy&quot; almost all the time 4.  I'm a little worried that the hormones may be bad for my baby (whom I  breastfeed), since they do pass through to the milk, and adequate long-term studies have yet to be performed in the US. These are all brand new symptoms in my life, that didn't start until after I got the IUD.   I read all the official literature before choosing Mirena, but had no idea how very common my symptoms are until a coworker mentioned that her libido had dropped after going on Mirena.  Then we began comparing symptoms, and I started looking into it and started to realize that all of these symptoms (which came out of the blue, and I'd attributed to new motherhood), might just be side effects of Mirena.  I'm cautiously optimistic that, once the IUD is removed, I'll go back to normal!!  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/31/2010 4:16:02 PM	I had a Mirena inserted 6 weeks ago and have been happy with my experience thus far. I am 25 y.o. and have not had any kids. Was previously on Yaz &amp; wanted to get off b/c of wild mood swings. Insertion was pretty painful but it was quick and afterwards the Dr. gave me 600 mg of Motrin for the cramping. I had pretty bad cramps for the first week &amp; I had almost constant spotting/bleeding for the first 4 wks, which Dr. said is normal. As far as side effects - I actually lost weight on Mirena which I attribute to getting off the pill. I have also had some mild skin breakouts which I also think is a result of getting off the pill not b/c of the Mirena.  I do have cramps with my period but nothing that can't be fixed with aspirin. For the first month my sex drive decreased but after my body adjusted to the new hormones, I am back to normal.  Mood swings are non-existent.  I can't feel the Mirena &amp; my husband has never noticed the strings during sex. It is so great to not have to take the pill! If inserted properly by an experienced Dr., I think it is a really great option for birth control. It's basically idiot-proof - I just check for the strings once a month, otherwise I never think about it. 
Birth Control	Kila300, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	1/31/2010 2:21:31 PM	I had the mirena for one year.(never got a period with mirena)  I started immediately with the headaches, cramps, and after a few months, began to have noticable water retention.  I went to my family doctor to find out that I had high blood pressure. She put me immediately on medication.   The dr. did all the tests, which all came back normal...so I decided to have the mirena removed (after debating with the ob/gyn).  I have a lot of the symptoms others have reported.  I have been on a strict diet..haven't lost any weight.  Luckily I haven't gained any weight either, but I do have to keep my calories down to 1800/day.  and I'm 5'10&quot;!  I'm looking forward to getting my health back!  Doctor says it will take three months to get my cycle back.

Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	1	Female	35-44	1/29/2010 4:08:11 PM	6-8 weeks after getting the Mirena, I experienced pelvic pain and pressure. Eventually that subsided.  I had the Mirena for about 9 months.  About 3 months into it I started feeling more tired than usual.  Eventually I was dealing with full blown fatigue.  I am a physically fit person and had diffulty getting through the day.  I was having severe mood swings.  I started feeling very depressed.  Then, I noticed my hair falling out. I had very thick hair, so it took awhile for me to become alarmed.  However, handfuls of hair were coming out and my scalp was starting to show.  I now have a difficult time styling my hair so that the thin spots don't show.   I had the mirena removed 3 weeks ago.  Had blood tests completed. Went to a dermatologist who ran tests and determined the hair loss was from something internal and he thought it was from the Mirena! He gave me a cortisone shot to stop the hair loss and start new growth. He said my hair will grow back, but my body has to work all this stuff out of my system.  I have to go back in 5 weeks for another cortisone shot.    I would NOT reccommend the Mirena for anyone.  Too many side effects.  It is easy to use, but not worth it.

I am working out at least 5 days a week and eating healthier. My doctor says the Mirena has nothing to do with weight gain, but I think she's wrong. Anyone else have the same issue? I am very moody and have no sex drive whatsoever.....frustrated..it does great on the birth control side of it, but the side effects are frustrating me.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	1/25/2010 1:26:00 AM	I have had mirena in for about 1 month now. I have never had kids, and thought this to be the right choice because i dont want kids for a long time. The insertion was painful, you should take some pain killers before hand, but it was very short, took only a few seconds for it to go in. I had bad cramping the first and second day, and was VERY VERY bloated the day after insertion, but it subsided after that and now i dont have that problem. I spotted for 3 weeks and it just recently stopped. once in a while i'll get a small cramp, but nothing terribly uncomfortable. so far i am liking it very much. I havent had it in for very long, so i'm not sure if this applies, but i have not had any weight gain or those other weird side effects. i got a little acne on my forehead, but it's a small price to pay not to worry about it. i havent had a period yet, so we will see how that goes. everyones body is different, so good luck!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/24/2010 10:42:28 PM	I have had the Mirena IUD for a little over a year.  I had been on birth control pills for many years and was considering having my tubes tied.  My wonderful doctor suggested that due to my age (32 at the time) that maybe I should consider Mirena.  After careful consideration and reading a lot of reviews, I decided to give it a try.  My doctor told me to take some ibuprofen prior to coming into her office for the insertion.  She carefully explained the insertion process as she was showing me the IUD and as she was inserting it.  The insertion was some what painful, but no worse than a contraction.  I went home, laid down on my couch, and continued to take ibuprofen throughout the afternoon/night.  I did have some spotting and some cramping that day.  The next day I continued to have milder cramping, but by the 2nd day after insertion I was fine.  At my doctor's direction, I continued taking my birth control pill for a month after wards to ensure full effectiveness had been reached.  Since then I have not had any side affects and have experienced very mild to no period.  I would highly recommend Mirena to anyone.  It is so nice not having to worry about forgetting to take the pill or pack it when going out of town.

Birth Control	JMMC, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	1/24/2010 7:42:55 PM	I just had Mirena put in 5 days ago and so far I'm up in the air about it. It hurt like heck to have put in, and I've survived a kidney stone and a c-section! It was kind of like severe menstral cramps.  The heavy cramping and mild bleeding lasted about 2 hours and then afterwards moderate cramping. By the second day the bleeding had stopped but I was still cramping, just not as bad.  Here on day 5 I'm still cramping but it comes and goes. The cramping ranges from &quot;eh, thats uncomfortable&quot; to a moderate painful menstral cramp.  I'm hoping the cramping will go away with time, but until it does I'm still skeptical about the birth control.
Birth Control	mrslidia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	1/22/2010 4:48:31 PM	I used Mirena for about 3 months then had it removed after I kept getting yeast infections. Then i had it put back in a few months later because I was going to get married so I didn't want to get pregnant during my honeymoon. While putting it back in the doctor had a lot of trouble putting it in and had to call for backup, then, after putting it back in I wouldn't stop bleeding, so instead of enjoying my honeymoon I bled the whole time. I had it removed right away because I couldn't take the constant bleeding and the frequent yeast infections. Now five years later I can't have any babies at all no thanks to Mirena it messed up my body!!!

Birth Control	LIZ, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/22/2010 4:22:15 AM	Girls: Go for it!I am 34, two children. I was on pills but affected my liver and weight. Then I moved to a non-hormonal IUD which was good, but the insertion was painfull (be sure you are on your heavier day of period for the insertion because this womb padding helps decrease the pain), I had heavy bleeding the first 6 months and cramps.  After a few years I discussed with my GP (partners count, but you take the decision!) and decided to go for Mirena.  Since I was afraid of the insertion my GP arranged an appointment at hospital for the insertion under anaesthesia: Brilliant! I have been with Mirena for a year and it is fantastic. I have no pain whatsoever, light bleeding, no weight changes; it has also improved my skin.  The only side effect I have noticed is a mild hiper-sensibility.  For example, around my ovulation days I become VERY sexual; some days I am incredibly happy, but others I can be slightly depressed.  Nothing to be worried about, though (just mind the ovulating days!).   I highly recommend Mirena as a conraception method. I don't even remember it is there.

Everything was fine at first, now it seems like I am having side effects. I have anxiety, which I have never had in my life. I get really flush in the face, and I have high blood pressure on and off. I have started to have a lot of abdominal pain, back pain, and pain shooting down my legs. I also have been having really bad acne, which I have never had before. I am 28, I should not be having acne like this. I am also having a low sex drive. I am thinking about having it removed.

If you haven't had any kids this will be very painful for you.  After you get over the first few months its good.  Very easy, don't have to worry about pills or anything.  Slowly I started having frequent mood swings and anxiety.  It has been getting worse and worse.  I though I was crazy until I have been doing some research abou it.  I am always tierd, I have alot of mood swings,irregular bleeing and I have become very depressed.  I have no reason to be depressed.  I thought there was somthing wrong with me, after seeing my doctor we stongly felt is was the Mirena causing everything.  I have never had a problem with any of this.  Thank goodness I am getting it taken out.  Please do your reserch before considering this product.

Last night there was a different kind of irritation and I thought maybe my IUD had slipped or something.  I had cramps all day today, exhaustion and mood swings.  REALLY hoping this is normal and goes away after a few weeks...
Birth Control	Terrified, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	1/18/2010 9:06:31 PM	I posted a review on how terrified I was to get this done on 1-16-10.  UPDATE:  I got Mirena this morning and so far so good.  I took a pill the night before to soften my cervix and diazapam (Valium) about an hour before - have someone else drive!!  Anyway, my doctor told me every step and then talked about what he was doing the whole time.  I had local sedation and the two shots were definitely felt but not as bad as the first time we tried to do the insertion without local (OWWWWW!!).  Once the two pokes were done (a bit of burning as the local was injected) I felt next to nothing.  Insertion took less than 30 seconds and afterwards I stayed on the table for a few minutes and then headed out.  My husband drove me home and I took a nap.  Three hours later I'm fine!  I'm a little sore now that the local has worn off and I have had a bit of spotting that is to be expected but really just a lot of terror for nothing.  My doctor took a lot of care that I was comfortable and that helped a great deal.  I'll update again in a few days!
Birth Control	jmo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/18/2010 4:58:46 PM	I am 28 and have never given birth or used birth control other than the Mirena IUD.  I used to get really heavy periods for 8 days with a lot of cramping on the first day. I had Mirena inserted 4 months ago and it was the best thing ever.  The insertion was very quick- took a minute or so to actually insert.   I had one very small cramp during insertion.  During the remainder of the day I had on and off cramping- but nothing major.  Took motrin and I was fine.  The following 2-3 weeks I had spotting (on and off bleeding).  The bleeding got lighter and lighter each day.  Since then I've totally stopped bleeding.  On occasion I get a very minor (isolated) cramp- this happens around the time I would normally get my period.  I've also had spotting on two separate days- but very minor.  I am completely satisfied, I had no mood swings, no weight gain, no side.  
Other	Terrified, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	1/16/2010 3:33:00 PM	I've never had children and I'm getting Mirena put in in two days and I'm terrified.  The first time we tried I couldn't take the pain and left.  This time I'm going to try local anesthetic.  The doctor has warned that with the local I will feel two very sharp pains as he deadens the two main nerve bundles but then I shouldn't feel anything.  After reading these reviews, though, I'm really close to cancelling my appointment.  Even those who rave about it go on to complain about side effects! I'll post if I actually have it done...

I am just wondering if anyone has or knows anyone who has gotten pregnant, while having their mirena. I know nothing is prefect.  I have been having a lot of the same symptoms i did when I was pregnant with my kids.  Can anyone help me??I have not taken a test yet because it is too early for accurate result. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/13/2010 11:59:18 AM	I agree with most comments- painful insertion, but besides that works like a charm! You don't even notice it. I've had it since April 09. I do not have kids but liked the effective %, and I've heard its very easy to get pregnant once its out. I had bad cramping one afternoon about 6 weeks after insertion, and the doc told me it was just my uterus contracting. highly recommended for those who want kids in the future but don't know exactly when.
Other	brandywine, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	1/12/2010 2:28:38 PM	I am 28 and have a family history of female issues.  All the women in my family have had to get their &quot;stuff&quot; taken out by the time they were my age.  I had a non stop period for 4 months so my doc. suggested this birth control.  I have experianced nothing but back pain, cramping, and discomfert since it has been put in.  I am still bleeding heavly and I have no answers as to why.  I have only had this IUD for about a month but I thought I would see some results by now.  I only have on child and my husband and I want to have another one.  I am scared that I will not be able to have another child.  I have read the reviews and data on the Mirena but so far it is doing more harm than good.  Some days my cramps are so bad I cant even stand up and my bleeding is so heavy it drips on the floor of my bathroom.  I am just at my wits end and not sure if this IUD is helping or causing more problems.  I know the cramping and back pain is normal but I never thought it would be this bad.

Birth Control	Punkydriver, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/11/2010 12:52:07 PM	I got my Mirena inserted just over 2 weeks ago. I had been on Yasmin/Ocella for 7 years and suffered a blood clot on my lung and ended up in the hospital for 6 days (I am 24, no children). After this, I didn't have many options for birth control. I was nervous after reading many of these reviews and going to a new male gyno. The procedure took maybe 15 minutes from pregnancy test to the doctor walking out after insertion. There was a lot of discomfort during the insertion, but nothing worse than a bad period cramp. I was dizzy and hot when it was over, but it only lasted about 5 minutes. I drove home, had some light bleeding and cramping, and hung out in my recliner. I was fine after a few hours. I am finishing my 1st period since getting Mirena. I have had a lot of bad cramping, but the bleeding was really light. The cramping seems to be only on one side though. Nothing Pamprin and I couldn't handle! So far I am very satisfied! I like the ease of not having to take a pill everyday and not having the &quot;uh oh&quot; feeling when I miss a dose or take it later in the day. Sex feels no different to me and it is more of a mental thing for my partner knowing something is there, though he says he doesn't feel anything. So far I am very satisfied and just waiting for the cramping to subside. I would recommend this to other women. I think that reading a lot of these reviews scare many women, but you are more likely to speak up when unsatisfied. Not all birth controls work for everyone. After my experience, I would never recommend the pill, but not everyone ends up in the hospital! If you decide on Mirena, just be prepared on what to expect and relax. I think my broken toe was much worse on the pain scale! lol. I also like that my insurance paid for this and I simply paid the $20 copay. Yasmin was $15 a month, so there is significant savings. Good luck!
Birth Control	Cyrena, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	19-24	1/11/2010 3:21:32 AM	i'm a 22 yr old mother if 2. i've had mirena for about a year an a half now, and i just recently started feeling really bad aches and pains kin my lower back, and am noticing a bit of a pouch in my stomach.ust this morning, i ran to the restroom, not knowing whether to poop or throw up (while soaking wet and sweating). up until this point, mirena has worked just fine for me, but i'm just hoping that i'm not that .1% that mirena is not successful with! wish me luck, goin to see my ob tomorrow (luck as in NO BABY #3!).
Birth Control	Addie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/10/2010 7:30:07 PM	I got the insertion on May 2007, at 22 years, after having my third baby via C-section, I went to the doctor's office without having my period, because I was breastfeeding, I got some pain,not as much as the papsmear, that's the worst for me, just took a deep breath, and everything was fine, 20 minutes after a left the doc's office and went home driving about 20 miles, after an hour got some pain similar to cramps, nothing that advil couldn't handle, I started bleeding for like a month, doctor told me that was cleaning the uterus, since June of 2007 I had never a spot of blood, that's great for me, no more pads, lol, side effects to mention: some hair loss, similar to pregnancy, some acne, similar to the ones that appears in periods, ovary cyst, which dissapear by them self, no pain, gain some weight, which is good because I was really skinny and with out hips, now I am curvy and my husband loves it, I don't get any period at all, just like a girl, no discharge, my desire increased a lot, sex got 10 times better, no pain after having intercourse, some depression, but I am sure that without it, I still have it.  For me is perfect, I go to the gynecologist twice a year and always looks fine, maybe not everyone is the same, but just try it, give it a chance. Good luck.
Birth Control	djtobin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	1/8/2010 3:23:31 PM	I've had the Mirena in for 2 years now.  My doctor told me I could bleed or spot for up to about 6 months...mine lasted 8 months!  Eight months, never a break.  This is the method I chose after my 4th child. Should have gotten fixed!  Well, my hair began falling out about 3 months into it, never lost my weight after chldbirth - still 20 pounds overweight, have suffered with severe depression, fatigue, insomnia,NO sex drive at all, mood swings, and more! Needless to say, I have not been my normal self for the past two years of my life.  I contributed it in the beginning to post-partum but realizing two years have gone by and nothing has changed, my marriage has suffered because of my state of mind (although I must say my husband has been patient &amp; forgiving)Got off my anti-depressants because I do not like medication...it had side effects too.  had blood work done to see if it could be something else...thyroid, anemia,etc.  Nothing...in good health says doc.  To make a long story short, afer reading up on this and seeing others have gone thru same things, I've made an appt for next week to have it removed.  Praying this is the cause of it all and I can get back to normal. I would not recommend this to anyone.  As far as periods go,  nothing regular, usually hardly anything at all, but on occasion I'll spot and cramp for 6 weeks, like right now. That's why I started researching and decided it has got to go!
Birth Control	fatcatmari, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/6/2010 6:42:39 PM	I had Mirena inserted on May/2009 and it has been excellent compared to the Depoprovera injection I was on before this.  My doctor extremely cautioned me on the dangers of the continued use of the Depo; 9 years total! I decided to have the IUD inserted and will never go back to shots or pills. I was relieved that I decided to take the full day off for this procedure because it is very painful. My doctor is very good, he told me step by step what he was doing and cautioned on the pain I would feel as he went through the procedure. For those of you thinking of getting it; this is what to expect. You are on stirrups, they take your IUD and after inserting a speculum in you, they insert this IUD with a long, thin instrument. The passing of the vaginal canal is simple, but once this instrument reaches your cervix it is a sharp and hot pain that starts about a level 5-6 and gradually goes up to a level 8-9. Afterwards, you cramp and spot and even your legs feel weak and debilitated. Definitely take someone with you, because you walk out trembling and kind of out of it. It is also a good idea to have someone there at your home for the next 4 hours. You need to eat and drink but you will definitely not feel like getting out of bed for a while after this procedure. It is worth it ladies. I have not had a period in over 6 months now and I don't have to worry about remembering to take my pills. I have had some nipple pain but other than that I feel this freedom and calmness, knowing that I have one child and I have 5 full years (or less, because this birth control gives you that option)to think if I want another one. Don't allow the pain to discourage you. Once that IUD is in there, 5 hours later you will be back to your normal self knowing that you have taken control of your life in that aspect.
Other	Jen, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/6/2010 6:26:53 AM	I am a mother of a 12 year old. I suffer endometriosis and have tried nearly everything there is before having a hystorectomy as a resort.I have had the Mirena inserted for approx 12 months. At one stage alongside the Implanon implant which was removed last October.I would have to say that for the reasons that I use the Mirena, it has been highly effective. Whilst i still have bleeding, it is nowhere near bad enough to use anything more than a panty liner or two for the day. Much better than a full period!I would have to say that insertion was almost as painful as giving birth, and if I was given the option, I would rather have had it inserted under anesthetic! But this could be due to the amount of scar tissue i have. So i cant completely blame the Mirena for that bit.As for a contaceptive - time will tell as i have only just tested it for this purpose. Fingers crossed it works well for this also, as I dont wish to be restarting after 12 years!I would highly recomment the Mirena for sufferers of endometriosis, but make sure it is done with AT LEAST a local anesthetic!
Birth Control		5	5	5			1/4/2010 2:20:52 PM	I have been using Mirena since Febuary 2009 and I have not had any problems whatsoever. It is safe, reliable, and you don't have to worry about taking a pill every day or inserting a ring every week. I highly recommend it to other women.
Birth Control	A student, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	1/3/2010 5:33:45 AM	DO NOT use Mirena is you are prone to anxiety or panic attacks! I am a 20 year old female with no children and have had the device for about 6 months. I'm not unsatisfied due to the pain during insertion. The doctor warns you ahead of time that the process will leave you crumpled over for awhile (and he is not lying.) What I AM unsatisfied about is my anxiety level! My mood stability is lost to this device! I not only have terrible cramps and unstoppable spotting, but I now have VERY frequent panic attacks due to it! Now, yes, I understand that me being 20 and in the prime in college for developing panic attacks due to being a student could be argued... but, I'm a junior, a very level headed junior. I've been at this school business for awhile now and didn't start having such frequent, severe, sometime unmanageable attacks until I had Mirena inserted. It is 5:15AM where I am right now. Is it because I want to be awake at 5:15 on a Sunday? NO! I have had three different panic attacks just tonight due to my anxiety Mirena! I'm not sure if anxiety constitutes to &quot;mood swings&quot; like I've read about in previous reviews of this drug, but it is definitely an undeniable mood to consider! Without Mirena I would describe myself as an extremely  stable individual, but with Mirena? From someone who has experience what seems like the worst anxiety over the past six months, DO NOT GET THIS DEVICE! Stay on the pill! Believe me, taking a little pill once a day is nothing compared to the endless nights, like tonight, that you will go without sleeping due to attacks! 
Birth Control	abringl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	1/1/2010 2:57:43 PM	Hi. I am a 23 year old mother of 2. I have had my mirena for almost 2 years. Overall, it has been a great birth control option-no periods, bleeding, or extra kids! While I have gained about 15-20 pounds, which does not make me happy, I do like the mirena. When I first got mine, I had the usual cramping and bleeding but it wasn't anything worse than having a usual month to month period. I did bleed for about 3 months afterwards but once that stopped, I have not had a period since. Besides the weight gain, overall the product is good. Does anyone know if the weight goes away once the mirena is removed? 
Birth Control	35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1		35-44	12/31/2009 10:18:22 PM	I had the Mirena inserted today.  It was the worse 2 hours of my life.  The procedure was extremely painful and within 5 minutes I was in unbearable pain.  I became extremely hot and my skin was clammy.  I was even nauseous and felt as though I would faint on the table.  The pain increased with every minute.  My pressure and pulse dropped to alarming levels and the doctor had to be summoned back to the examination room.  He was briefed on my complaints and vitals and had to immediately remove the device which had been placed only 25 minutes earlier.  The pain continued along with feelings of nausea off and on for over an hour.  I should have read more of the comments before I tried it.  I will never recommend this product.
Birth Control	Dana, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	12/31/2009 4:44:19 PM	My Mirena hell started 3 years ago, and today, December 31, 2009 I decided that I would not go into another year living in Mirena pergatory!!! I told my doctor to take this thing out of me because I was sick and tired of the horrible mood swings, the weight gain, the pathetic sex drive, the back pain, extreme fatigue, blurred vision, numbness and tingling in my hands and feet, and feeling like I was going to vomit all of the time.  At first I thought it was all in my head, then after 6 months I had a physical, my internist told me that I was very healthy and she couldn't tell me that anything was physically wrong.  She wanted to prescribe psychiatric medication to control my mood swings and that's where I drew the line.  I called my OB and demanded an appointment and got that thing out of me Today! I feel better already! I can't wait until my children gets their old mother back and my husband gets his wife back!  Good luck to those of you who still have this device from the devil and for those of you contemplating getting it, my advice to you is DON'T!

The first insertion came out after she released the device into the uteris. the second insertion was sucessful but more painful than the first. i emdiately had cramps, back pain and bloating. i dont know if it was a rush of the hormones released from the IUD or if its placed incorrectly. i came home took 800mg i b profen and napped for about 3 hours and felt better. now cramps are back &amp; the bleeding is heavier. i hope this doesnt mean bad news. i'll keep you posted on my progress
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/29/2009 10:46:58 AM	I've had the Mirena for about a year and a half now and I love it. I completely stopped getting my period right away, which is awesome. I've even lost some weight, but that may not be from the Mirena itself; prior to getting the Mirena, I was on the pill for about 8 years, so stopping the pill may be what caused me to lose weight. Either way, the Mirena is great and I highly recommend it!BTW, I've never given birth; I think the only draw back with that is an increase in pain during insertion of the device, which is not a walk in the park but is quick, bearable, and totally worth it.

I have gained 25 lbs since i got it and I have also lost my sex drive. I also get a very light brown discharge every month, sometimes lasting about 2 weeks. I keep hoping that my side effects will go away, but after 7 months, I have still gained 25 lbs. Im afraid if I dont get it taken out soon, I will continue to gain.

Well ive had it almost 2yrs now . it hurts a lil when put in and i bleed lightly for 6 weeks but other than that i love it no periods at all no cramping nothing as for the weight gain i think some peole are looking for something to blame it on because i lost 40 pounds now i was dieting but the mirena didnt make it any harder. I am very very satisfied and when i get this one out im having another put in.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	12/21/2009 11:41:27 AM	I decided to have mirena inserted due to extremely heavy cycles.  My alternative was edometrial ablation since I did not want to use birth control pills due to negative effects.  I educated myself well and read both good and bad.   I also asked around and spoke to a few that had it done with great success.  However this is not for me.  I've had it for about three months and I have the following side effects: depression, weight gain, dropped sex drive and horrible migraines really the main reason I have to have it removed.  Yes it did help the heaviness of my cycle, but there are just too many side effects for me.  Please note that I get bad side effects from birth control pills too.  I was hoping to be able to keep this, but it's not worth it to me.  I would say if you are considering- just try it.  One great thing is it is totally temporary.  Best wishes.  Oh btw I am 42 and have three children.

I work in a endocrinology office and i was dx with pcos. I do not agree that this form of bc is good for that dx, because of the weight gain. Acne , mood swings were worse. Having light periods was great, but overall not worth the weight gain!

Have 2 children, had my tubes tied when I was 30, but peri-menopause was making my periods unbearable, would be bleeding 15 days out of the month.  I love it, slight cramping after it was put in, but periods are basically non-existent, a little spotting here and there.  Best decision I ever made.  
Other	sabrina, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	12/8/2009 10:24:11 AM	I got my mirena on 12-7-09 at 3pm. after reading so many horror stories about the pain it kinda freaked me out. it was VERY easy. im 18 and i suffer from endometriosis along with never being sexually active or having kids. insertion takes 2-3 minutes and i didnt need ANY kind of painkillers or numbing medicines.they first check the position of your utuerus, then they put in a spectulum,then they clamp your cervix(feels like a tight pinch) next they rub iodine over the cervix, measure your uterus(start having some cramping/feels like a period cramp) then put in mirena. that easy! had some slight bleeding and cramping after but the cramping and bleeding only lasted a couple of hours. very happy i got mirena. today i have finals and feeling amazing! my advise to other women considering mirena is to not read horror stories and to try it for yourself. everyones body reacts differently including pain tolerence and reactions.what might not work for them might work for you and vice versa.

Now, im experiencing a little bleeding and some cramps here and there . I guess its normal because ive never had kids. Over all so far its not too bad. Since i never had kids the dr. gave me a pill to help it go in easier. It wasnt too bad like i said i'd suggest to for girls who never had kids and want a long term birth control. Im 18 by the way . 
Other	sabrina, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	13-18	12/7/2009 9:53:26 PM	I just got my mirena inserted today for endometriosis on 12-7-09 at 3pm and it was VERY easy. i also freaked myself out looking at reviews about insertion pain but it was nothing like the women said. Im 18 and never had a child or been sexually active and didnt need any type of numbing meds or pain pills. had some slight bleeding and cramping afterwards but nothing too bad. it took about 2-3 minutes. they first check the position of the uterus, put in a spectulum then rub iodine over the cervix, then they clamp the cervix(feels like a tight pinch), next they measure the uterus which you will then have slight cramping, after that mirena is inserted and your done. nothing bad at all. DONT FREAK YOURSELVES OUT READING HORROR STORIES. everyones body is different including pain tolerence and reactions. try it for yourself. its very worth it!
Birth Control	y20scouple, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/7/2009 9:01:11 PM	I just got my mirena in today 12/7/09 but I thought I would just let people know that I had a great experience with my procedure.  I read most of these reviews and was scared out of my mind.  The procedure took 3 min and didnt feel a thing.  I have 1 child and dont want anymore but they say that i am to young to get my tubes tied at this time so this was the best choice for me.  i am 12 hours into and havent had any problems or pain.  I had a little spotting for a couple hours after the procedure but that has been it.  So far I am really glad that I went ahead and got the mirena.  I will update in a few months if there any changes.  
Birth Control	Elucas5369, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/4/2009 1:38:00 PM	I am only writing to explain my fears and frustration with reviews. Of course the majority of the reviews are negative. That is because if you are satisfied that you are less likely to write and say that. I am 32 and have two children and I am at a point where i just don't want any more children right now. I have tried almost all bc optiond. Depo, pills, the copper IUD.  My main fear is weight gain. i talked to my OB-GYN and she said if you gain weight, it is purely due to your intake. I had mine put in yesterday 12-3-09. I have had two children and I admit that it was painful. Be sure to take Motrin at least one hour before. Since it was placed in, only light spotting. I am already pleased with that. I will write back in a few months as a update.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/4/2009 10:19:13 AM	Okay, I rated on my previous experience. I had mirena put in right after I had my son in 2006. I had it in for 2 years. I loved it, no side effects other than no period. (who would complain about that) the insertion didn't hurt at all. I had it removed to try for another baby. I had 3 miscarriages then decided I really didn't want to go through that again. I blame Mirena for those issues. I just got my second Mirena placed last week. The doctors refuse to do a tubal or essure, and I was sick of the pill. The insertion of this last one was horrible. It hurt and I went home and took another motrin. The pain was fine after 2 days. So far there really isn't any spotting. When I took out my first one I gained weight. I'm hoping that I lose weight while this one is in I gained so much weight while on the NuvaRing. My husband did complain once before that it poked him. I loved it before and I'm hoping I have a similar experience this time around. I have recommended it to everyone I know. But man oh man the insertion was painful. 
Birth Control	Hopeful, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	12/1/2009 6:50:07 PM	Well I just got Mirena today but I did want to give other women who are considering it what I have found. First off, it was very painful when they put it in. I am 24 years and have never had kids but I would guess the pain is about the same as giving birth expect it only lasted 5-10 mins. I have been reading ALOT of reviews today (I guess this is something I should have done before) but from what I have gathered the women that have not had kids had more pain when it was inserted but no side effects. So I am hoping the same goes for me. If you do decide to get I would recommend taking some pain meds before you go in.

Im 17 years old and the proccess was quick and not painful. But since ive been on it i cant stop spotting hopefully that will stop soon.I have been happy with it and so easy to use i forget i even had it, but i do see my self gettin attitudes all the time for no reason. other than that everything is great. I WOULD AND HAVE RECCOMENDED THE MIRENA TO PEOPLE.

While it is 100% on effectiveness, and I do love the convineince, i HATE the side effects I have expereinced. Acne (whole body!),migraines and WEIGHT GAIN.I am the heaviest I have ever been in my life. I have three children, 16yrs, 5yrs, and 2and a half, and I am done! I cant wait to get the mirena out and get the permanent 'fix'! I hate being this heavy. Also, i constantly feel like I am PMSing. ALWAYS bloated, crampy, hungry, and irritable...yet I never actually get a period. It has served its purpose but truthfully I cant wait to get it out. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/29/2009 2:34:12 AM	I am 20 years old and I have not had children yet. I had the Mirena inserted about a year ago, Oct. '08. The insertion process was quite painful. I had some bleeding afterwards, and some serious cramping, but that ended within 2 days. For the first few months, my periods were regular, short, and light. After about 4 months, my periods stopped all together, with the exception of a few light spotting periods. Getting the Mirena has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. It is extremely easy to use, my fiance has never felt it during sex, and after the first few days I have not had any bad side effects from the IUD. I would stronly recommend the Mirena.

I did not feel much pain during insurtion just a sharp cramp, I spotted for about 3 weeks. I recently had it removed b/c of lower abdominal pain and bleeding(I hadn't had a period since the birth of my last child a little over a year ago) The worst part of having it in was constantly worrying if the threads were still there and any stomache pain i had the doc. jumped straight to either it's inbeded or perferated or an eptopic pregnancy all of which are scarey thoughts when you have a house full to take care of. It has only been out for a few days but my stomache pain is nearly gone and having it removed felt like getting a cat scratch along the insides of my guts and gave me some nasty cramps. Good Luck.

I had Mirena inserted on Dec. 6, 2007. Since then, My periods have lasted anywhere from 2weeks to a month. Also, I do not have &quot;cramps&quot; I have what I like to call LABOR PAINS! I am constantly hurting in my lower abdomin. I have made several attempts to have the bc removed, But since the doctor who inserted it lost her practice, nobody will see me. I am friends with a girl who has a sister who developed uteran cancer due to mirena. She is 26 years old and has to have a complete histerectimy. This bc is clearly not for me! I hope you all have better expericence that i have.

It hurt having it inserted and there are minor cramps for a few days.  I spot maybe 4 times a year.  I still have acne issues during that time, but all and all it has not been all that bad.  the only issue is that when my husband and I have intercourse the wire hits the tip of his penis.  that can be an issue for my husband.  If I could do it all over again I would still do the same thing.  It has helped out so much and I may get it done again, here in the near future.
Birth Control	leah26, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	11/23/2009 3:38:42 PM	I actually just got the mirena inserted this morning so I know my ratings may not be fair. I have never had a child so the insertion was VERY painful for me. I got very light headed and nauseus during the insertion and my cramps are awful! As long as the cramping stops I am sure I will be very happy with it. My only reason for writing the review so soon is so women can know to expect some pain (my doctor didn't warn me of it) and take some ibuprofen or tylenol before going in to the office.They told me I would feel like going back to work as soon as it was over and that was not the case for me, I am very thankful I didnt have to go back.

I didn't have it for BC, I have menorrhagia so this was like having my prayers answered. No period months at a time, when i do have one it is light spotting. Side effects was the hair loss, headaches, stomach aches, weight gain, and acne. For two weeks i have been spotting and had a headache upon reviewing this i will have it removed to see if this will make it better.

I got it on October 16, 2009. I thought it would be the best form of bc for me. For insertion, the pain was unbearable almost. My doc said the pain would go away in a few days, but...it didn't. i started out on motrin and tylenol...that stopped working after a week. Started taking aleve...it stopped working a few days later...all the while i'm still bleeding or &quot;spotting&quot;, very very lite. Had sex the one day i wasn't bleeding, and it was AMAZING and it was great not having to worry about using a condom. still was cramping pretty bad though. I went back and saw a dif doc since mine wasn't in and he made shyt even worse...i left in even worse pain than i was before and bleeding more than i was before...i had heavy bleeding for the next week and a half with heavy cramping still and i was taking the advil liquid gels which seemed to dull the pain just a bit. The day before my check up with my doc, the pain was still somewhat severe but the bleeding decreased some. My doc fixed things and i went back to spotting and my cramps almost dissapeared instantly. She gave me a script for a higher dosage of motrin for my occasional cramps. Its been a week since and i still have spotting, and my cramps are barely noticable (w/o of motrin)and hopefully i'll stop spotting soon so i can have sex with my man again. I've lost 10 lbs, had minor acne, severe mood swings, and minor headaches. I def recomend this bc for anyone not trying to get preg, you just may have to deal with a bit of pain for a while. BUT NOT EVERYONE DOES!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	11/19/2009 12:21:53 PM	I'm 28 years old and have a 1 year old. I have been on Mirena for about a year. When I had it insereted there was really no pain,and I didn't bleed very much. I have had one period in the last year and it lasted about 2 days. That has to be the only good thing about Mirena.  I have NO sex drive. Before Mirena I had a pretty high sex drive, now it dosen't exsist.It has really put a damper on my relationship with my Husband. Before and when I was pregnant I didn't weigh very much. I only gained about 30 pounds when I was pregnant, and after my baby was born lost most of it. Now I weigh more then I have even in my life. We are going on Monday to have it removed!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/17/2009 10:06:28 AM	I am 22 years old and never been pregnant. Mirena has been perfect for me. I had it inserted this past January (09). The procedure took about a minute and the only side effects were mild cramping and bleeding for about 3 days after it was inserted. I have had absolutely no side effects from this IUD other than the amazing feeling that comes from not having to worry about getting pregnant. This form of birth control is a safe, no hassle way to prevent pregnancy for women of all ages that are in a serious relationship and not at risk for contracting std's. The only reason that they say it isn't for women who have never had children is because the insertion procedure can be more difficult, however my doctor prescribed me a single dose of something that softened the cervix for the insertion and everything went well. If the IUD isn't expelled within the first 1 to 2 months then it is very unlikely for it to ever be expelled. Also since Mirena delivers a very low dose hormone to the uterine area only, there are absolutely no side effects at all unlike all other forms of birth control. I can't even explain in words how Mirena has changed my life for the better. The secure feeling that comes with not having to worry about getting pregnant or taking a pill everyday is beyond amazing. I highly recommend it.

By April I was losing the baby weight and fast!  Then I got the IUD in May, it is now November and I just made an appointment to have it removed.  I weigh more now than I did when I was 9 months pregnant.  Also, I have been using a prescription for acne that I have always used and has always worked, now I am breaking out like crazy.  I am even developing acne on my chest, back and arms!  My husband and I don't want to have more kids but he is with me on this and he is willing to have a vasectomy just so I don't have to be on birth control, that's love!  I will miss being period-free but it's just not worth it anymore.

The NEGATIVES:Insertion was painful, but bearable. Aleve worked to get rid of the bad pain.I've had abdominal pain and cramping since insertion.Periods are lighter, but I bled for 2 months non stop spotting, then a month off, and had 2 normal cycles, now I get possibly 1 week with no bleeding.I've gained 20 pounds and cannot lose it.I'm tired and have NO sex drive. I previously had a higher sex drive than my husband. It is now nonresistant. It just so happens that most of the time I just don't care anymore.When I do have sex and an orgasm, it is painful. I can feel the IUD and it hurts during orgasm. The POSITIVES:My PMDD/PMS has been cut in half. My heavy periods are gone. Now I just bleed almost all the time instead. As awful as it is, I'm going to keep going and give it a little more time to see if the bleeding levels out. I can deal with the abdominal pain much better than the horrid bleeding I had during periods. For the record, my PMDD/PMS and heavy periods INTERFERED with my life and work, and I had to do something. Therefore, this was a plausible choice for me, and has been affective in reducing missed days at work and my ability to deal with everyday life.

Birth Control	kv, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/11/2009 1:00:29 PM	I had mirena inserted about 3 weeks ago and haven't had the terrible side effects that people have written about here. My doctor took me off the pill because I have high blood pressure so this is a good long-term option for me. I don't have any kids so insertion was painful but it was quick, maybe about 5-10 mins total. I did feel dizzy during the procedure but not afterward. The night of the procedure however I had some of the worst cramps I have ever experienced. Even advil, a muscle relaxer and a hot water bottle didn't help. The cramps continued for the next day and the day after but lessened each day. Same with the spotting and nausea. I had some bright red spotting that night and the next day and then it tapered off, getting darker in color, lasting for about 4 days. Oddly enough I felt bloated and gassy for a few days as well. I do get some random cramps here and there and have noticed my skin seems oilier but so far I feel fine. I think the side effects and mood swings from the pill are worse. The reviews on here definitely scared me and those that complained of weight gain and feeling moody should also factor in their lifestyle and stress level. You can't blame a medication for massive weight gain without looking at your eating habits and the amount you exercise. It also takes a little while for your body to adjust to a medication and I think some women were very quick to say they didn't like it. I am definitely giving mirena a chance, so far I am happy with it and if I do experience any side effects I'll update this review.

Some cramping when inserted but no big deal. About five months later my Acne was out of control. I usually get a bump here and there during my cycle, but now i get 3 or 4 at a time.  I dont consider myself to be vain, but I am 30 yrs old now and should not have to experience pumpils.   Also my mood swings are out of control and the headaches are brothersome as well. I have a 5 and @ yr old and I need patience. Since the Mirena I am easily irritate and very very moody.   On the flip side very little bleeding.  I did have it removed today and I will be going back to the BC pill.

It did hurt but I have had cramps that hurt a lot worse. I had in inserted at the end of my period since then I have had hardly any bleeding I don't even need a pad. I would suggest you have someone drive you home because I felt way sick afterwords. So far I love it and my husband says he can't feel the strings.

Insertion was a short but painful process.  I was told that I could experience abnormal bleeding and cramps for about 3 months (which I did).  Five months have passed and yes, my periods have become almost non-existent, however I now also have acne problems, weight gain, depression, a decreased sex drive, and mood swings.  Does it work? Yes--but the toll it has taken on my daily life is too great a price to pay. I am having it removed next week.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	11/4/2009 8:57:25 AM	I just had mirena inserted yesterday but felt compelled to submit a review on my first day experience because of the very negative experiences from a lot of patients.I was in my doctor's office for a total of twenty minutes, five minutes total for the insertion.  There were three series of cramps that my doctor warned me about right before each one.  I must say that I was a wreck going in there and while I was there, but the experience was a lot less painful than what I expected.  The cramps were very bearable, as I have two children already.The rest of my day I had minimal cramping and very little bleeding, even so far today.So, so far so good.  I will update in the future for how this is working for me, but as for now I just wanted to ease the feeling for those of you that are apprehensive about the procedure.  It was short and very bearable.

At first I noticed no symptoms until a couples of months after having it I gained weight at least 40lbs my mood shifted, my skin tone darkened in certain spots and acne was horrible.I also experienced the worst cramps in like as if I was having contractions all over again. I know that ever women body is differnt but for me this was a horiffic experience. I recently got my mirena removed and I would not recomend this birth control to my worst enemie.

It was very painful for the first day and i was physically sick right after. The next day I was back to normal, just some light spotting off and on. So far there have been no problems, but we'll see. I like it because i'm not stressed out about remembering to take my pill at the same time everyday, and since I don't have to worry about getting pregnant I feel sexier.

On top of the fact my doctor had me convinced it was a better form of bith control. I had mirena in almost a year,but there was a problem with this worry free version of bc the side effects. I know everything has them but WOW. I didn't realize all this time my bc could be the cause. I gained a tun of weight, my very normal complexion turned into a acne nighmare, of course the deprression came as well. Not to leave out the pain it caused I had a dull side pain that became &quot;normal&quot; to have and also times of extreme pain with sex that lasted about a month. My period never went away but it was irregular,so I always felt bloated, and irritable like PMS 24/7. Just got it removed today its not worth all that for sure!!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/26/2009 1:56:08 PM	I have had Mirena in for 2 months now and I just love it!  It was super easy to have inserted no pain a few cramps nothing big.  I have had 2 kids (one was a C-section).  I was taking the pill for many years and got sick having to remember it.  I also was slowly gaining weight over that last few years and no matter what I did (workout queen 7 days a week) didn't help.  After stoping the pill and using Mirena I have lost 8 lbs!  I highly recommend this!

Having just given my body a years rest from contraception. I am 36 and have never had children or been pregnant. Discomfort and faint is what i shall feel tomorrow, nothing compared to getting your 12 times a year! I can live with the quick pain of insertion and the couple of days of discomfort... i keep reminding myself of the 5 years of no drama and it's all worth it!
Birth Control	lily, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	10/24/2009 9:50:10 AM	I am 28 and have never had children and have no desire to, so I thought Mirena would be good for me.  It definitely works; I've not gotten pregnant.  But wow; holy side effects.  If I had it to do over, I would have just stuck with the pill.  The insertion process was momentarily surprisingly painful for me (the kind of pain that makes your spine sweat and your eyes cross) but I think this may be because I've never had children.  I had no side effects for about the first 4 months until my periods stopped.  Now it's exactly like physically my body is stuck in a permanent state of PMS.  My tummy stays bloated &amp; fingers and face swollen &amp; I experience some ridiculously painful cramps 3 or 4 times a week. I've developed some pretty severe acne (I suppose my penance for having clear skin growing up).  I always feel like a bottomless pit as far as my appetite goes.  I gained a good 25 pounds in 2 months after my periods stopped, and I just couldn't seem to get rid of it.  Quite frankly, I've resorted to severely restricting my food intake and though I've dropped about 15 pounds, I'm always - ALWAYS - hungry.  I miss my naturally fast metabolism; now I reeeally have to work hard to maintain my physique.  I also have mood swings, debilitating depression and irritability just like I used to the day before my period except that now it's pretty much all the time.  I've resorted to seeing a therapist to learn emotion regulation techniques, going on anti-depressants &amp; weekly acupuncture treatments.  If it hadn't been such a b*tch to get in I would have looong since had it removed.  I do plan to get it taken out before the end of the year.  If you're thinking of getting it then go for it.  Just know that if you experience any crazy side effects, you're not losing your mind.
Birth Control	Renea, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/22/2009 4:00:24 PM	I have had Mirena since April 2005. I would recommend this to any women. Inserting the IUD was a bit uncomfortable and I cramped for about 2 hours. I spotted for about 4 days. After that I haven't had any issues. I have not had a period since then. I spot every few months for about a day. No cramps, no pads, no tampons, no Midol, no unexpected pregnancy! Couldn't be better. I may get another Mirena when this one is expired. The only other thing I experienced was that the string retracted inside of me. This was not an issue. I just get a ultrasound every year.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	10/22/2009 3:04:37 PM	Hi. 29 yr old female. I had the mirena inserted 1 yr ago, 7 weeks after my first child was born. The procedure for me was painless, and I only had minor cramping and slight spotting. Everything was great for me for the first 4 months, then Wham!!! Horrible symptoms. Bleeding every other week, loss of sexual interest due to SEVERE pain during intercourse; VIOLENT MOOD SWINGS; horrible depression with suicidal thoughts; nightmares, fatigue... just plain miserable. I intend on having this IUD removed ASAP. I think this product works for some people, but definitely NOT for me. The side effects are way to unpredictable and difficult to manage. The mood swings have caused problems with my marraige, but thankfully I have a wonderful husband. To everyone who has the Mirena, watch out for the mood changes... If you don't feel like yourself, TALK TO YOUR DR!!! It's scary to feel like your going crazy from hormones. Hope this helps someone!
Birth Control	lmeyer36, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/22/2009 11:55:08 AM	I have had the Mirena for about 3 wks now. I have had no side effects except spotting. I love this device and not having to worry about when I have sex! Don't listen to all the negative reviews out there, they scared the crap out of me before I had this inserted, now I am glad I had it done!
Other	Tinkerbell, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	10/21/2009 5:45:07 PM	My ratings are low since I just had this inserted this week as I have heavy periods.  This was the most painful experience.  My doctor told me I would have some cramping when it was being inserted.  I almost hit the roof it was so painful (and I had my baby without epidural or any other pain medication, so It's not that I have no tolerance for pain).  I've had cramps off and on since.  If it comes out, I will definitely not have it reinserted - I cannot get that pain out of my head.
Birth Control	txchick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	10/21/2009 2:46:56 PM	I got on this after having my first child. I was told there were no serious side effects. The inserting wasn't painful and I had very light periods with no cramping. The side effects are another thing. I gained 25 lbs, started losing my hair, was moody all the time, had no sex drive, was depressed, got migraines, and the list goes on. I thought something was wrong with me but after taking a test to check my thyroid and  a blood test, I found out nothing was wrong with me. I eat right, exercise, and was still gaining weight. I then started looking at the side effects and realized it was Mirena. I am getting it taken out ASAP. I definitely DO NOT recommend it. 
Birth Control	dolphinschick, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/21/2009 3:26:47 AM	I had Mirena put in July 2009 and I have been very happy with it. I used to have horrible periods with bad cramping and I only had 1 period after having the IUD inserted. My periods went away and so far I have no trouble with it other than my partner says he can feel it every once in a while. I have had a child and I have read that it works better if you have had a child. I hope I don't run into any horrible side effects like I have been reading. The only thing I have experienced is mild acne and some weight gain.
Birth Control	Morgan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/20/2009 3:12:02 PM	I have had my mirena for a month now.  I had it inserted during my last period and haven't bled since at all.  No cramps after leaving the doctor's office that day.  My mood has been so much better.  I have been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds for 9 years.  I have had a little bloating, but no more than usual with pms.  Maybe I am a poster child for Mirena.  I was terrified after reading some of the comments out there on the web, but I talked to my doctor, and my experience so far has been wonderful.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/18/2009 9:25:40 PM	 I had my iud inserted five months ago.  Im 23, never been pregnant, I bled almost everyday for the first three months which is what my gyn told me to expect my periods are still a little irregular, but it has helped a lot with pms and mood swings, periods are also a lot lighter. insertion was very uncomfortable WARNING TO WOMEN WHO DONT HAVE KIDS ask ur gyn for a local! overall Im happpy with this product and I havent experienced any adverse effects except for some bad cramping which is commmon for women who've never been pregnant 
Birth Control	Denise, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	10/16/2009 3:57:28 PM	I have had my IUD in now for nearly 3 years.  I hate it and am having it removed on Monday.  Sure, you don't have to think about birth control, but it has not been worth feeling depressed and moody, my loss of interest in sex, and acne like I've never experienced that has left scars all over my face.  I had no idea that it had these side effects until I recently read about them.  Now it all makes sense as these symptoms have only shown themselves since having the IUD put in.  NOT WORTH IT PEOPLE!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	10/15/2009 6:04:44 PM	I have had this iud for 4 1/2 years now. I HATE IT. I have had so many problems ranging from cramps to infections to reacuring uti. Now I have PID and may have to have a hysterectomy. It was not worth getting. 
Birth Control	MsMonica08, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	10/15/2009 1:20:23 PM	I had Mirena inserted about 3 weeks ago (9/28/2009), I also never had a child, or been pregnant. Not even 30min after, I started cramping really bad. My doctor told me that might happen so I should get motrin to ease the cramps. I took the mortin, and after a week I found myself taking the motrin everyday just to make it through the day. Once the motrin wasn't enough, I started taking aleve, extra strength excedrin, and now extended relief midol. Yesterday (10/14/2009), I stared cramping beyond measure for about 3 hours straight and could not move at all. I also felt poking in my &quot;pocket book&quot; so I checked it and felt the strings coming outside of my &quot;pocket book&quot;. Today I'm going to get it checked because I belive the IUD is coming out or just not adjusting to my body at all.
Birth Control	Jennyfer, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	10/13/2009 9:17:08 PM	i had mirena inserted today, and i'm not sure if it's the mirena or what, but i've been Very tired, and when i awoke from a nap i didn't know i was even taking, i was very confused, and didn't know where the baby was that i had laid in his crib right before laying down... is this normal? or should i be worried?
Birth Control	LauraLove, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	10/12/2009 1:55:21 PM	I have had the Mirena for 1 yr and 5 months. It has been great until about 5 months ago...At first I had some spotting, bleeding, but I do with any bc. About 5 months ago, I started having deep cystic acne, which I didnt know existed until this. At 33, my complexion rivals a teens and they are deep and leave scars. I have little lumps or cysts in my neck and even around my ears. I had a pain in my side that came and went alot over the past 5 months but no one knew what it was. I have been tired more lately, and for the 5 months I have had increasingly more headaches or migraines than usual. ( I am prone to migraines, but maybe 3 a month) but I started getting them more and more like 3 times a week. and for 3 weeks now I have had a headache every day but 4 days headache free. I feel like something is wrong with me....and couldnt shake it being the IUD after hearing so many similar stories. So this morning after arising with another headache.. or the same one...I washed and scrubbed my hands for 2 mins..and took out my IUD. I belive it will be the answer I have been avoiding, because of how much I wanted effective BC. But nothing is worth a month long headache with 4 kids to care for. It was easy. I grasped the strings and pulled gently, it took 5 mins and wasnt painful or even uncomfortable for me. (I have had 4 kids though like I said) I feel a little teeny bit crampy....but I am sp happy its gone and will never use hormonal bc again. Im going to go with the Essure Route I think...
Birth Control	Stacie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	10/10/2009 7:50:36 AM	I am 23 years old married woman with one child I knew I didn't want anymore kids so I got the mirena out in 2 weeks ago. The in office experience was fine it's just like a papsmear, some women say you get a shot in oyur cervix, not me. My OBGYN used a antiseptic gel to rub on my cervix with a cotton swab I didn't feel a thing. Yes its alittle uncomfortable but who thinks paps are? Anyways you do get a lot of cramping afterwards, I felt a little dizzy aftwerwards but the dizzyness went away. I am however still cramping, especially after I have sex with my husband. I go on this tuesday to make sure it has been placed in the right place by my doctor, so far I am pleased no negative feedback so far, in due time we will see 
Birth Control	Liza0315, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	10/9/2009 12:04:55 AM	I just had the Mirena IUD placed today 10/08/2009.  I decided to get the mirena because I have one child already and I'm definately not ready to have another one.  I'm not very good at remembering little things like taking a pill everyday, so this option was very ideal for me.  The Dr. told me to take some kind of over the counter pain meds at least an hour before the procedure, but I didn't. I suggest that you listen to that advise. The procedure didn't last very long maybe 5-10 mins but it was uncomfortable.  I did experience pressure and quick, sharp pains a couple of times. There was pain, but definately bearable. After it was over, I felt cramping (as if it were about to get my period) radiating from my back to my left knee and a litttle unbalanced. I had some spotting but it stopped. I suggest you have someone drive you home afterwards.  It's been about 8 hours since and I still have some discomfort like menstral cramping and lower back pain. I've taken advil and motrin, it's helped somewhat. Again this is my first day, I'm not 100% on how my body will react to it but I'm hopeful. I was reading in other posts that some women had the mirena placed but they don't have children.  I was told you can't have it placed unless you have at least one? I did not read any of these reviews before I had the procedure. I think it's worth a try.  Everyone's body reacts different and it might not be for everyone.  Heck, it might not even be for me! Really talk to your Dr. about side effects if your uneasy about it or have a low tolerance for pain. If you've already had a child, this is a walk in the park.
Birth Control	glowwings, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	10/7/2009 2:41:59 PM	I have now had Mirena in place for 2 weeks. The only side effect that I have had is a small amount of cramping...usually the day after sex. Other than that...it is going very well!!!
Birth Control	Turtle86, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/6/2009 2:57:45 AM	I am 23 years old and had the Mirena inserted in February 2009. The reason I chose it was because I couldn't take birth control pills for other medical reasons. It seemed like the best choice since I am in a monogamous long-term relationship, plus the convenience and effectiveness. I'm not ready to have a child and will not be for a while.When I had it inserted, I was very nervous. It was an unusual strange but severe pressure initially as they inserted it. But once it was in, the pressure was gone. I had cramping for about a day and I bled very little, it wasn't even from the IUD but from the clamp they used to prop my cervix open. I since have had my period only twice where it was a full regular period and that was in the first 3 months but it was always extremely light. Periodically, I will spot very lightly for a few hours and very rarely do I get cramps any more. I love that I do not have to worry about my birth control and that I do not even have to think about it. My boyfriend and I can be spontaneous whenever we want. Only occasionally has sex been uncomfortable but it has never actually hurt. Certain positions just add a little pressure, but nothing severe. I think the IUD tends to have a bad reputation but I am proof that it can work out! It may not work for everyone but that doesn't mean it won't work for some people.

My biggest problem is recurring nightmares.  Two weeks of the month I have nightmares so bad that I don't want to sleep.  To me it's still worth it not to have to worry about becoming pregnant at 40.

My friends and family all said good things about it and i thought it was the best choice. It was placed in march2009. I didn't have much cramping at first. It is now over 6 months later and i haven't stopped bleeding. I've seen my Dr. 3 times because of the constant bleeding and she's just keeps telling me to be patient. I want it out. I have terrible cramps and i just want to stop bleeding. 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	10/4/2009 4:14:27 PM	I had a Mirena IUD place after our second child.  The result was horrifying.  I got pregnant IN MY OVARY.  Sure the Mirena worked cause the pregnancy didn't go into my uterus but I sure wish it would have.  I had to have emergency surgery and lost my ovary and falopian tube.  I will NEVER recommend this IUD to other woman---friends or strangers.  After my experience my DR. told me that she's seen this a little more often than the warnings indicate.  Usually in the falopian tube but nonetheless a pregnancy that shouldn't have happened and certainly in a place it was never intended to occur.  PLEASE TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT THIS COMPLICATION BEFORE HAVING THE MIRENA INSERTED.  A healty UNPLANNED pregnancy beats living with the fact that your choice of birth control caused you to lose a baby and part of your reproductive system.

Over a year sonce I got it. It was a little painful when they put it in, and a little cramping and pressure, but I never had any bleeding. I had my regular period there for a little while, but since May of 09 I havnt had my period at all. What I WANT TO KNOW is what about when I decide to have children again? How long after I take it out will I be fertile again? Will there be birth defects? Please let me know. . .jessica_bartz_1987@yahoo.com
Birth Control	apinkcharm, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	10/2/2009 12:26:34 PM	I had the Mirena inserted 09/30/09. I have never been pregnant. I had the worst cramping of my life. I couldnt move the first day and am still having very intense cramping that has now moved to my lower back as well. No over the counter pain medication has made a dent in the pain. I started this BC due to the side effects I was experiencing with the NuvaRing. I have heard good things about Mirena and hopefully the side effects will subside.
Birth Control	tmh, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	35-44	10/1/2009 2:54:33 PM	Had mirena put in Sept.11,2009. It was not really painful. Just felt alot of pressure, but I did pass out when I started to get up. Had minor cramping for a couple of days.Started bleeding on 9/16/09 and am still bleeding. Very heavy bleeding and large blood clots. Todays date 10/01/09. Went into the doctors yesterday, and was given premarin to take for ten days to stop the bleeding. So far, still bleeding. Will update how long it takes for it to stop. Doctor told me that 10% of women will never adjust to mirena. If bleeding continues, I will have mirena removed. Going to wait 3 to 6 mons. to allow my body to adjust.
Birth Control	misha8000, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	35-44	10/1/2009 2:24:06 PM	I had mine put in on 9/29/09. The insertion process was very painful for me. I was given a local in my cervix, and that was the most painful part, I could feel the insertion, but with the local that wasn't painful. I had severe cramping and pain the first day, and the cramping has continued but not as severe. I spoke with my doctor. She said the cramping was normal, and to switch from taking Aleve to Advil, which is really working out well. I feel confident about this, escpecially knowing my doctor has a Mirena IUD herself. From reading other reviews and talking with my doctor, it sounds as if I just need to be patient and in a couple of months I'll be very happy about it. I get my period every 20-21 days without fail, lasting for 6 to 8 days. I am tired of my period getting in the way of everything else I like to do. I also do not want children, and get anxiety if my period is one day late. I definetly think the benefits will outweigh the negatives! As for hair loss, I have suffered this before with a thyroid problem I was treated for. I took a hair vitamin for years that helped a LOT. In fact, I stopped taking it because my hair was growing too fast. I started taking it again after reading the reviews and I know it will help. I would highly suggest to anyone to get a good hair vitamin which contains MSM. MSM tightens your hair follicles which prevents hair loss. (I take Optim 3 Hair and Nail Formula from Hi-Health.) Back to the IUD, I need to be very honest. I felt very uneasy and had a lot of fears. I thought &quot;What if the IUD string gets stuck on a tampon and tears out&quot;, &quot;What if I get toxic shock&quot;, &quot;Oh my, what have done to myself?!&quot;but my doctor put my mind at ease. The insertion process felt very invasive to me, so I realized I was a bit emotional for that reason. Not to sound judgemental, but many women in the reviews that have had it removed so quickly may be reacting to that emotion, which is natural. If you feel that, just be aware and it will pass! 
Birth Control	Portland, Oregon, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/30/2009 5:22:54 PM	I had the IUD Mirena placed in my uterus on 11/13/2008, eight weeks after I gave birth to my daughter. I thought things were going fine until two months ago when I started having a heavy menstrual cycle every two weeks and increasing right sided pelvic cramping. I went to my doctor for a check of my symptoms and my annual pap exam. During my exam the doctor could not feel the string, she then performed a vaginal ultrasound and found my uterus to be empty. I then went on to have a abdominal x-ray to confirm my IUD had fallen out. But as of yesterday I have learned that I have to have Laproscopic Surgery to have my IUD removed from my body because it had purferated through my uterus and is now stuck in my right pelvis bone by my spine. The doctor will not know if any damage has been done to my bowels or any other organs until I have my surgery on 10/13/2009. I thought this was going to be a easy no nonsense birth control option for me but it has turned out to be a very scary nightmare.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	9/29/2009 3:14:25 PM	I have noticed some behavioral changes in my mood; slight depression, anxiety, nervousness, and just down right edgy and moody. This usually occurs a few weeks before my mentrual period. Mentrual cycles are weak, lasts for about a weeks time with slight bleeding, which will occur off and on. Acne break outs are common for me now. Cramping, along with sharp pains are a normal occurance for me.
Birth Control	jenniferph24, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	9/29/2009 3:39:20 AM	I had the Mirena IUD put in about 18 months ago. The insertion was not that bad. I had one very bad cramp and a small amount of the &quot;brownish red goop&quot; almost like a dark red period for a day or two. I got a light period for about three months then I no longer got it. I tried Depo-Prevera before that and you aren't supposed to get your period on that but I got mine EVERYDAY (no exaggerating) that I was on the shot. My doctor and I did not talk a lot about the side effect of the IUD. After about a three month I started to get a very sharp pain in my pelvic area and I had the IUD checked a second time for proper placement. It was in place. I had an ultrasound done to check for any cysts or perforations that could have been caused during insertion. Nothing. A few months later I realized my hair was  shedding a little bit more then I used to. And I didn't even realize how moody I became until I looked back at the last few months. I also have not had a child. I did have the Mirena IUD taken out last week because of cronic pelvic pain, I got Bacterial Vaginitis four times (never had it before IUD was put in), and I had lower back pain. (I have to lift a minimum of 50lb required at work.) I no longer have the BV and my lower back pain has subsided. the hair loss has lowered, my sex drive has come back, and my mood swings are gone. Although not having my period in 18 month was nice. I got the IUD taken out and I got my period as normal. ALL BIRTH CONTROL WORKS DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE. IT IS A TRIAL AND ERROR ON SIDE EFFECTS. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF THEY GET TO BE UNBEARADLE. IT COULD MEAN SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG.   
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/28/2009 5:54:16 PM	Immediately after the doctor inserted the IUD I started experiencing severe abdominal pain. Fainted in the office as a reaction to the pain. At home the first day I was taking Vicodin every 4 hours without any effect on the pain (and I never take more than one Vicodin for anything!). Doctor sent me to the ER to make sure the IUD was placed correctly and it was. They gave me Dilaudid injection (morphine) and the pain stopped for 24 hours. Returned the following day with same intensity - I could not walk, had to scoot on my butt to get myself to the bathroom. After two more days of this, I had the Mirena removed at the ER and it's been two days now and the pain is much better, only minor irritation persists. The doctor said that this was a fairly unusual reaction, but I guess it can happen. Horrible experience and I really needed this thing to work because my endocrinologist needed me off the Depo-Provera which I had been using for the past 11 years without a problem.
Birth Control	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/28/2009 1:58:38 PM	I have had the Mirena in for 1 week now. Had some mild cramping for a couple of days...no bleeding. So far only side effect has been mild nausea..lasted 2 days. And occaisional headaches. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/28/2009 12:49:17 PM	The Update on this Post:(I have never had any children or been pregnant. I have complications with all birth controls. Either they make me EVIL, Nuvo ring gave me the worst yeast infection in my life, Etc. I decided to get the Merina put in. After reading everyones comments, and replaying them through my head I almost walked out of the doctors office. I had taken 3 Ibuprofen and a very small dose of flexeral an hour before my appointment. I had also just got off my period the day before. It took about 5 minutes to put it in. There was about 3 bad cramps during insertion. I wouldnt say it didnt hurt at all, but YES it was somewhat painful. Although I dont think it was untolerable pain. I have had some steady cramping, and little spotting since yesterday. It has now been 36 hours since I had the Merina inserted! I am still having some bleeding, but no cramps or side effects at this time. I have not tried to have sex yet, but I will keep you all updated! It has been 3 days now, and I have no side effects other than some bleeding. I had sex last night and he did not even notice, and I had no pain from it. It took me a while to find the string but I finally found it. It's kind of like a wire almost, so if it did poke your man I could see it bothering him. Other than that all is great!)UPDATE: It has now been a week. I am still having a period, slight cramping(like period cramps), and a little lower back pain. This is all completely normal. I was informed of these regualar side effects before I got it! I was told these symptoms will end between 3-6 months. I am still more than happy with my choice!
Birth Control	Teena, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/24/2009 6:44:04 PM	I didn't read these reviews before I got Mirena placed (May 09) and thankfully I didn't! Mirena was suggested to me as an alternative aid for my PCOS. Since having Mirena, my cysts have decreased dramatically, and my periods are non-existant. I will admit, the insertion was quite painful (had to go back a 2nd time b/c my cervix wouldn't accept it) but I have had no children. The first month I spotted a ton, and honestly had second thoughts about the product. I am now in my 6th month with Mirena, and really loving the experience. My boyfriend and I have spontaneity, and security that we are protected. I do check every 3 weeks or so for the strings, which is recommended. The price was hefty (insurance didn't cover it) but well worth it because I will be saving roughly $3600 for the five years ($75/month for BC). I have learned from reading these forums that not every medicine works for everyone, but if you suffered from heavy periods, cramping, or even PCOS, or just aren't good at taking pills on time, I'd recommend Mirena for at least a try. 6 months later I have NO periods, occasional spotting, and NO loss of sex drive. I haven't noticed hair loss, or severe pain. The two things I have noticed were increased acne (still not bad) which could be attributed to the fact the medicine is released right into your uterus and isn't getting absorbed throughout the body like BC. Also, I have experienced a weight gain, but I do not lead an excessively healthy lifestyle, so that may be due to my own accord. In summary, I say give it a shot. Talk to your DR first and keep an open mind. These forums are scary, and I wanted to go up for bat for the good that Mirena has done. I'm planning on getting another! 
Birth Control	momof3, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/24/2009 1:13:12 PM	Had Mirena inserted after my 3rd child at age 40.  LOVE IT!  No periods or just spotting occasionally.  No weight gain. During my 4th year on it, however, started to get light periods every two weeks and progressing to spotting or streaking almost every day.  Dr. &amp; I chaled it up to peri-menopause.  Also experiencing all the other peri-menopausal sympotoms.  God's cruel joke!...Here we go!  Just had Mirena switched out for another one three days ago.  Today cramping and heavy bleeding which is normal, I think.  Hope to get my hormones in check again without having to go on estrogen.

Birth Control	glowwings, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/24/2009 10:32:51 AM	I just had the Mirena inserted yesterday. I do not know how it will go from here. But I thought I would write about the insertion. Yes, it was painful...it felt like someone sticking a hot poker into my cervix. But it went away fairly quickly. I have had some cramping overnight and this morning. No bleeding so far. They insert Mirena while you are on your period..because the cervix is open at that time and it reduces the pain. I will give it a few weeks and write about any side effects that I have.

I've had this one in for 3 yrs and am getting it out. I'm moody, gaining weight, migraines, chest pains, dizzy, etc. I had my doctor check everything else before it dawned on me to check the side effects of the IUD...they are ALL effects of Mirena! It will be out tomorrow and we will use condoms!
Other	Jackie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	9/21/2009 2:03:57 PM	I had my tubes tied and started heavy periods. This was recommended because I would either have a lite period or none at all. I thought I would die when the first one was placed. The Dr. had no idea what she was doing and had to keep reading the directions. It fell out 4 weeks later. 2nd one put in a year ago. Not too bad at first but my periods went from heavy for 4 days to lite for 10. It got worse and worse. A lot of pain and periods would last between 20 &amp; 25 days. I became very weak and could barely go to work. I had it removed 13 days ago and still bleeding. My Dr. said it is my body trying to regulate itself. The first 2 days I could not leave the house it was so bad! This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. I would never recommend this to anyone.

It is very low maintenance, however I am having a lot of trouble sleeping at night. This is starting to take it toll on me. Also, I have bad cramping two weeks before my cycle and bad headaches 2 days before my cycle. Other than that it is a Great birth control method!

Periods are lighter and shorter but still exist. I don't mind having periods however because it is a normal and necessary process. At 2 yrs later, I don't have all the same side effects, and I'm just now feeling somewhat normal.

Other than that I have cramps all the time no period at all now the first month I had it I had a period for a month straight. I also went from 110lbs to 150lbs sense I have been on this which has been a year.  I do plan on taking it out this week and finding something else that works for me.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/17/2009 5:58:23 PM	Well I wont lie, it really hurt getting it put in. BUT. I had a c-section with my daughter. Also, I had displasia last year and i had a leep done, so my cervix had alot of scar tissue. Otherwise, I don't think i would have been in so much pain. I had cramping for the first 2 days, nothing worse then period cramps though. I had some bleeding the first week, but it was really just spotting here and there. there was maybe 1 day it went like a light period, but the rest was spotting. Otherwise, I don't notice it and it hasn't made me feel weird or anything. 
Birth Control	BBinez, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	9/17/2009 4:42:03 PM	I'm in my early fifties and probably going through menopause, or right before menopause. So, my hormones are already out of wack, and the Mirena releases a synthetic progesterone. I became emotionally unstable, had migraines frequently, and had two periods a month for two years. My doctor kept telling me it wasn't the Mirena, so I went to another gynecologist. He suggested I take it out, and he found a cyst on my ovary when using the ultrasound to see where the Mirena was so he could remove it safely. I did not have a pleasant experience with it, and I don't think everybody has the same experience. My thoughts are that it shouldn't be used on women over age 45 and either pre-menpausal, or in menopause. I felt like a different person on it, and am beginning to feel like me again.

When I had the Mirena put in, I was totally shocked at how painless it really was. I have had very light spotting, no real periods. I haven't gained any weight. I am not sure though if a side effect can happen a year later, but I have very thick hair, and lose quite a bit of it every day, but in the last couple weeks the amount of hair I am losing is starting to scare me. I've read about 10 or so reviews and I haven't seen anyone having hair loss yet. But it is a side effect, and Mirena is the only drug that I am on so....I am kind of worried!

Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	9/14/2009 5:41:55 PM	I'm sure that this may have been a decent birth control, but 2 weeks after use, I noticed an itchy rash develop on my breast, along with significant breast tenderness.  Pregnancy test was negative. These symptoms lasted 2 weeks whereby it then spread to other areas of my torso, inner knees and elbows.  At the 5 week point of Mirena being inserted, I couldn't stand the rash/itching any longer.  Nothing else in my life had changed, and although providers were leaning towards an allergan, I thought it had to be this Mirena.  So I had it removed.  It has now been a week and I am still itching and waiting for a derm appt.  I would appreciate hearing more testimonials of those who have had the itching. If it is just dermatitis, then this is a real coincidence I feel.  I also recall having leg itching with the birth control pill, so am wondering if I am having a reaction to hormones, even low grade. I hope that my problems subside with in the next few days.  I would love to hear more from those with these problems instead, rather than the insertion cramps...mine of which only lasted 1 minute.I just may have wasted a lot of money getting it removed. Hope I did the right thing.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	9/13/2009 2:18:40 AM	Insertion was painless for me. Periods weren't any worse than normal, and lessened to spotting every three to four months. However, It has been five months and I haven't had a period (got tested by the doctor, not pregnant), and a year ago my sex drive completely died. I did not know this was a side effect. However I had the IUC in for 3 years before this came to be. I am not sure removing it is the best option and will discussing my options and pros and cons with my doctor.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	9/12/2009 9:47:22 PM	I had Mirena put in 6 weeks after I gave birth to my first baby. I was actually surprised when I had it put in because I thought it would hurt a lot more than it did, but really it was like a mild cramp for me. I had a little cramping for the rest of the day, but not after that. The only thing that upsets me about Mirena is the fact that I have had my period for the past month now and that my husband can feel the string. Otherwise I'm pretty satisfied with this product.
Birth Control	gagirl125, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	9/12/2009 9:12:32 AM	I tried every birth control before i tried Mirena. I would be sick for 2 to 3 weeks out off the month so my MD thought i should try Mirena. Putting it in was very painful and they ended up giving me a low dose of pain medicine after they inserted the IUD.About 2 weeks after I had it in place I became very ill. I had a VERY hard time breathing and it was extermely painful. I had a rash on my back and legs and ended up missing 2 weeks of school. I went to the doctor and told them i thought i was having an allergic reaction and they sent me home saying i had a severe chest cold.I later went to the ER and they told me the same thing. When i went to my MD the following day she told me that I WAS having a reaction to it and promptly removed it. Taking it out hurt but wasn't as bad.I'm not trying to scare anyone with my post but I just want people to be aware of what can happen. 5 years sounds great, just make sure you do your research before you try this method. I wish I would have!
Other	mom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	9/11/2009 7:42:55 PM	My Dr. gave me a mirena because I had thyroid cancer and needed to stop my heavy bleeding from my periods.  It did hurt at insertion and I have so many side effects.  At first I bled for 6 months straight.  One day I got out of my car and had blood running down my leg and clots like a miscarrage.  She was not concerned and told me my body was &quot;adapting&quot;. Over the years I have had terrible acne, my hair falls out in the shower every day, and I am moodier, have sweats, and have gained weight.  I never knew the extent of the problem until I read these reviews.  Now, it is time to remove it am I am finding nothing to replace it.  Ablation is an option but then you still need birth control.  When will these manufactures get this right?  Why are the women the guinea pigs.  I don't think I would choose this option especially since I didn't choose it the first time around.

I'm only 30 and still not sure if I want to have more children. The insertion was very painful for me, which suprised me because I was not expecting this at all. After it was inserted and I stood up to get dressed, I almost passed out. After about 10 minutes and apple juice, the feeling subsided. I really think it's a good idea to bring someone with you in case this may happen. Since the insertion, I have very light spotting. I have to wear a pantyliner all the time. I also noticed a slight crampy feeling that seems to never go away. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with the IUD or if it's just the fact that I'm highly sensitive to any discomfort in my gyn. area. Overall, I am happy with the Mirena - other than the constant bleeding factor. I haven't noticed any weight gain (but I breastfeed), no acne, no moodiness, and my sex drive is fine. Yay for the mirena!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/10/2009 1:36:01 PM	I read all kinds of reviews right before I got my Mirena, and I was terrified! I just wanted to let people know that, for me, the insertion was easy! A little crampy, but I've had worse period cramps. I went right back to work and was a little crampy the rest of the day, but I took a couple Tylenol and was fine. So far I've had a couple of days very light spotting, but again, no big deal. I'm head over heels for this product!! I have had no issues and would recommend it to anyone looking for easy BC.

I thought something was seriously wrong with me because I was sick all the time, I had cold sweats, shivers, acne, headaches, dizziness, vomiting, anxiety,diarrhea, moodiness and junk food cravings all the time. I thought I was just crazy until I read other reviews on many sites. I thought I was pregnant all the time because of the nausea and breast tenderness and breakouts and no periods. It's just too dangerous and not worth it.

Birth Control	sexymilf, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/5/2009 10:00:23 AM	First of all, Anyone considering Mirena should take in the consideration that the majority of reviews up here are going to be negative and that is not how all Mirena users feel; I am 5'11, 130 pounds and  I was scared to get Mirena but it did not hurt during insertion BUT everybody is different, i had a baby 8 months ago with no pain medicine so.... I knew i could handle it. But back to the Review, i had no cramping after insertion, i did not even feel it in there, I am still having a brownish discharge but so far so good.To the women complaining of Weight Gain: How long did it take you to realize that you were gaining weight? I check my weight once a week and if i notice a 5 pound weight gain the IUD is coming out!!! I asked my doc about that and she told me some people just cant keep food out of her mouth :) but so far so good for me

My doctor and I decided to go with Mirena because I dislike having to remember to take a pill everyday. I got Mirena inserted in the end of June. My doctor gave me a pill to take 5-6 hours before going into my appointment that thinned out my cervix and made insertion unpainful. I was talking to my doctor and the nurse and my doctor stood up and said it was inserted. I didn't even feel it go in due to that pill she had me take. It was on a Friday that I had my appointment and that evening I went camping for the weekend. Went boat riding, fishing and swimming. Did not have any problems. It has been almost 3 months now and the only thing I'm not liking is my body getting used to it so the period goes away. I bleed for 2 weeks then stop for a week then bleed for 2 weeks. Everything I have read tells me that once I get past the 6th month it should go almost away. I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to take the pill everyday but make sure to ask for the pill to thin your cervix.

I had it inserted 12/08. And I do love it. My periods have gotten lighter, and I don't have cramps anymore. I have noticed that my weight has gone up, up, up. I've gained close to 30-35lbs. I called my doc that inserted it, and said that weight gain is not a side effect. Well...IT IS!! 90% of the reviews that I have read people complain of weight gain. I hope I can keep this in, because I love barely getting a period. But we are totally done with having children, so I'm weighing out my options.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	9/3/2009 11:01:10 AM	I had Mirena placed after the birth of my 2nd baby.  About a year and a half later I was going to get the Essure.  When the OB/GYN went to remove the Mirena he said it wasn't there and it may have fallen out but they were goin to do an x-ray to see if it was in my abdomen.  It was.  It had gone through my uterus and into my abdomen.  i had to have surgery to remove it and it was very costly and Mirena would not cover any of my expenses.  Would NOT recommend!!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	9/3/2009 8:59:14 AM	I've been on the Mirena Device for 4 years now. Although I love the effectiveness and the stop of my period on this IUD, the pluses are now being out weighed by the minuses of this product.In the 4 years I've been on it I immediately started getting side effects that I did not think at the time were Mirena related. I had bleeding / heavy discharge for 4 to 6 months after installation, rash &amp; flush on my face that I thought were symptoms of menopause (even though I was only early 40's), I've had joint pain for the past 3 years and now I'm just about at 50% hairloss. My hair falls out in clumps and is so thin I almost look bald in the bright sunlight. Now I've finally decided to have it removed while I still have some hair left.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/2/2009 4:12:08 PM	I've had the Mirena for 3 years now.  It was a little ache bring inserted but nothing compared to childbirth.  No side effects, just my usual once monthly outbreak of acne.  I would recommend it to eveybody.  I now have 4 girlfriends that have the Mirena as well.  Sometimes I go 5 months without a period and when I do have a period, it is so light that I wear a pantyliner (or tampon, just for comfort of not wearing a pantyliner.)
Birth Control	KelCut, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	9/2/2009 11:33:54 AM	I'm 37 yr old mom of a 19 yr old. Got Mirena Feb 09 due to bp and dr. thought it was because of pill, had extreme cramping to the point of Good Lord what did I do? Was that because of c-section and not vaginal birth? I've gained approx 20lbs, have itching sometimes, oily skin, tired alot but may be because of bp meds. Really hate the weight gain and bloating. Seems to all be in the stomach area and look awful. I am researching other methods of bc because I hate this. Weight seems to be going no where except up, despite decrease of calories and increase of exercise. No period is nice but who wants to go to the pool/beach when you're bloated/pudgy like this?   
Birth Control	Wendy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/31/2009 10:11:58 PM	I have had Mirena in now for a month.  I read the reviews and they all scared me.  Let me say up front:  It hurts getting it put in.  If you go in knowing that it will still hurt - but it won't seem so bad.  Think, labor pains.  The first day really sucked... cramping and just a general discomfort.  But by day 2 things started getting better.  I had no bleeding the entire first week, then BAM! Bled for 2 weeks straight then it stopped.  I am a migrane sufferer and have not noticed any increase in headaches.  No changes in my mood or appatite.  I went back for my 4 week follow up and everything looks good.  I am very excited about not having to deal with Birth Control for the next 5 years.  Although I still some nights wake with a start that I didn't take my pill then think, &quot;oh yeah!&quot;  My best advice to anyone thinking about this is just to go into it knowing its going to hurt.  Don't believe anyone who tells you &quot;its just unpleasent&quot;.  Um, no - it is painful!  But the procedure only last maybe 3 minutes.  If you have had a child, you will remember the pain, it really does feel like labor, but its over quick.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/29/2009 10:48:40 PM	I love not having a period.  But, I'm now experiencing side effects over a year after having it put in!  I'm getting really bad acne and my hair is falling out by the fistful (but I have a ton of hair to spare).  I'm seriously debating getting it taken out, but this is seriously how much I hate my period.  I'm just confused how side effects will just show up a year later...Just make sure you do your research and ask your doc a lot of questions, they'll tell you everything you need to know.  A lot of these reviews sound like they didn't do any research.

I seemingly had none until about 6 months ago.  I have roseaca &amp; the past 6 months my skin has become uncontrollable.  No medication or light treatment is working &amp; my flare ups are ever present.  I am trying to find out if my birth control has anything to do with it.  I also am getting bruises on my legs out of nowhere!  My life style hasn't changed, nor my eating habits.  Otherwise it's been a great birth control, and if it's not the cause of my flare ups...it's the perfect birth control.
Birth Control	tt, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/26/2009 9:01:37 PM	When I first got Mirena just over a year ago I bled like crazy, I mean GUSHING for a month straight. I almost had it removed, then it stopped. My periods progressively got lighter and shorter and now I haven't had a period for the last 2 months. I had really heavy periods prior to Mirena so it's been nice. It hurt pretty bad getting it inserted, almost like labor pains but much much shorter. I have worried that I might be pregnant just because I haven't had my period, but I'm not. It's nice not to have to take a pill everyday and I can't feel it at all. I still have other monthly symptoms like water weight gain and sore breasts, I guess that was my period. I personally am really glad I got it. I'm happy I stuck it out that first month, as miserable as that was...it was worth it!

For some reason though I feel like it makes me really dizzy, and sometimes I see bugs that are not there... I know you all prob think that I am crazy but I am serious!Has this happened to anyone else? Also it is hard to describe but all in all my body just feels weird?
Birth Control	Concerned/Relieved Dad,  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	1			8/24/2009 3:04:30 PM	My daughter suddenly became an emotional wreck and feeling stressed. Oddly, she couldn't really articulate what she was causing her to feel stressed out. Then, she began experiencing involuntary muscle movements, first in one arm, then one leg and then all 4 extremeities. Her hands would clench and she reported feeling pain when it ocurred. The involuntary movements intensified over a 3 or 4 month period. Doctors and specialist tested her for Hutchison's disease, lupus and other conditions. She was placed on medication to prevent siezures. They even thought she had onset of epilepsy.  The siezures became more frequent and lasted longer over time. She went on disability from her job and was unable to drive for fear of an episode with her children in the car. She finally decided to have the device removed and miracle of all miracles...every single one of her problems stopped! Her neurologist to this day cannot offer an explanation as to what happened to her.  A reasonable person can only conclude the chemicals or hormones emitted by that device severely impacted her well being and ability to carry on everyday activities. It's been several months since removing the device and she STILL has not had a single episode of involuntary muscle movements and emotionally she is back to being herself.  I am posting this because I think others should know. I have urged her to report her experience to FDA.  Good luck to those of you that are using this device. I hope your experience is better than my daughters.

I already had one unplanned pregnancy and we are definitely not ready for another little one. My list of pros vs. cons-No pill to take every day-No weight gain-No hormonal changes -No changes to my libido-No worries! Cons-was spotting/bleeding for 3 weeks straight after getting it put in.-My boyfriend could feel the strings sometimes. He says it hurts his sensitive area. lol-I'm tired more often (well i do have a six month old now...so that might contribute)-I have more minor headaches than normal.-Minor backaches (But i also was in an minor accident 9 days after I gave birth to my son.  My back has been aching since then so having the iud probably haven't changed that at all.Well all in all, probably the best decision we've made for birth control.

Almost immediately my stomach started cramping. I could barely stand straight up to walk. I've been bleeding every day since. Somedays my stomach hurts and other days my legs hurt. My feet tingle and yesterday I noticed 2 acne bumps on my face. I was in good health before I got this IUD. I went to the dr on 7/31/09 to let him know that I was in pain. He told me to take Aleve &amp; that pain was normal for the 1st couple of weeks. I'm having the IUD taken out on 8/31/09. I know everybody's body is different but nothing is worth torture. Just think about it. What woman wants to be on her cycle for months at a time?THE ANSWER IS NOBODY!!!

Just a little fearful, when I get my next one because of the cramping I had during the first one (only a few days) but well worth it; no periods, copays for pill, pads, tampoons, etc....see you again mirena in two years.

I haven't had a period since! Over 2 years without taking a hormone pill or using a tampon (or pad) is AWESOME!! I used to get terrible headaches, breast tenderness, and acne on the pill - NO MORE!!!  My only regret is not getting the Mirena sooner!
Birth Control	SarahJones, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	8/20/2009 2:46:55 PM	I'm guessing side effects are different for everyone.  I've been on Mirena for 7 months.  I swear I've had every side effect possible!  I've gotten acne...and can't get it under control.  I've gained weight...went from 125 to 135...maybe not a lot to most people, but I can't stand it.  It did hurt when they put it in, but I got over it.  I had spotting for about the first 4 months.  I keep getting vaginosis...that nasty fish smell.  Going through a urinary tract infection as I'm writing this.  My body feels out of my control right now.  If Mirena wasn't so expensive, I'd have it taken out and get my husband snipped!  Trust me...I'm almost at that point!  Hope others have better luck than me.  
Birth Control	Confused, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	8/19/2009 1:03:47 PM	I've had Mirena for a year and a half and did so at the advice of a friend. Like most of you, I wasn't aware of all of the side affects. The benefits are that I have slight bleeding each month, but so far, haven't gotten pregnant. However, I have gained 10 pounds, have slight acne, mood swings, and occasional cramping. I didn't know this had anything to do with Mirena until I read the reviews. I might also consider removing it, but I love not having to buy condoms. My husband could feel it at first, but hasn't mentioned anything so far. My sex drive is the same as normal (high). But I would LOVE to try to lose the weight. Unfortunately, I haven't even after dieting and exercising.
Birth Control	nola, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	8/18/2009 4:20:35 PM	The first 2-3 months with Mirena were fine.I got it a month after having my daughter who is now 10 months. I had no problems at first. Then, I completely stopped my period, got acne that I cannot get to go away, and gained 20 pounds. I work on my feet all day, took a boot camp, and still cannot get the weight off. I called my doctor today to get it removed. It is very convenient, but its just not worth it.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/18/2009 12:44:39 AM	I've had my IUD for about 3 months now.  I am 23 and have never had a baby to the dr wasn't sure it would work for me.  Since i've never had a baby, the pain of insertion was terrible.  It felt like the worst cramps of my life and felt like i would faint.  If you can bring a driver to take you home after that may be smart.  I was in terrible pain the first day and couldn't really sit, stand, or lay down with out pain. I took pain medication and was fianlly able to fall asleep.  After that first day everything was fine.  I had mild cramps and spotting for a week.  Everything is fine now and it was worth the pain in the end.

My girlfriend had hers inserted about 2 years ago and she absolutely loved it and had no periods. I on the other hand had got mine insereted october of last year. yes at first there was a little cramping but nothing tylenol could not help out with. and for the first few months i had a period of about 2 to 4 days now i am lucky if it lasts 1 day. this was the best decision i have ever made. i dont have to stress anymore trying to figure out if i took my pill in the morning before work anymore because now i can just forget about it. some people may say its not worth it but i have never had mood swings while on it and i have actually lost weight. there was no change in acne and my boyfriend actually loved it because we had sex more days out of the month. it was a win win situation for both of us and the pros and cons actually benefited in our favor.

I was so worried!!  Cancelled my appt. for 10mths straight.. finally did it and it didn't hurt at all, I've had just light bleeding and spotting.  Normally I have a heavy period.. this is fantastic!  I also have fibroids which my doc. said would help keep them small as well as prevent pregnancy.  I'm so happy I went with this form of bc and I was in and out of the doc's ofc. in just a few minutes!  I wished it worked for every woman like it does me..  good luck to everyone that trys it!

My dr had me come in during my period to have the Mirena inserted because the cervix is more open so it is not as uncomfortable. I did feel some cramping. I bled for a couple weeks after, but it was a lighter flow.  I went back after a couple of weeks and had the strings trimmed - my other half was being poked by them. Since then my periods went to just using a liner for a day or two and now nonexistient. That makes me nervous, paranoid i might still get pregnant. I have had weight gain, but close to 10 lbs.  I have no issues with my sex drive, it is high. Also no acne issues. I guess my biggest issue is the total lack of period making me think i might be pregnant. Other than that, I think its' great!  Total carefree birth control.
Birth Control	heather, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	8/13/2009 2:29:05 PM	i have had CONSTANT bleeding since the day i had it put in, back on May 7, 2009.  One of the greatest perks for getting it was no period, man did i get a lemon! My acne is horrible. EXTREME mood swings. Husband hates it. NO sex drive. I seem depressed and constantly stressed. I have no hide left on the insides of my legs because of pads. Tampons hurt horribly. If you are contemplating it, I suggested not doing it. I agree that just because we don't want anymore children, that we shouldn't kill ourselves in the process. If you don't want to get pregnant, get this and you won't even have sex.  I have 2 wonderful children and if God sees fit for me to have more, then it is truly meant to be. I will be having it removed next week and my husband has been fixed. (Which i do completely suggest;)

Birth Control	tavia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	8/13/2009 1:54:36 AM	Don't get me wrong, this birth control provides excellent protection against pregnancy. However, for me personally,the side effects suck royally. I have never had problems with vaginal infections until I got mirena.I've had it for four years and have had yeast and bv infections the entire four years. My sex drive went out the door, and since my periods were very irregular, I often felt extremely bloated, fatigued and depressed.I appear to look three months pregnant due to the lack of my menstral flow. As I said before, the birth control is excellent,but if your a woman who has adverse reactions to hormones,consider getting a paraguard iud, which is free of hormones and just as effective. Also, if something doesn't feel right to you but your doctor says otherwise, go with your own instinct.My doctor swore up and down for years that the iud was not the cause of my incessant infections until they realized all the medications were not helping.Trust your own instincts.Doctors make human error in judgement just like the rest of us.I neverimagined in my wildest dreams that I would go through so much trouble tonot get pregnant. Although the side effects are saidto be minimal,you never know how it will effect you personally.

I have had problems with other birth control pill/ring because of the hormone dosage. My doctor recommended this and it sounded great.  I have had irregular bleeding, COMPLETE loss of sex drive, hair loss, constant cramping, weight gain. I have real bad acne on my jawline that won't go away and I have tried every cleansing product to get rid of it. This may work well for some and not for some. This has been the worst birth control that I have been on. Personally I liked the Nuvaring better. I can't wait to get this thing removed in a couple of weeks. 
Birth Control	Tara, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	8/12/2009 1:42:07 AM	I just recently had my IUD placed in June 2009. I am 38 years old and did not want to go through with a tubal ligation. So far besides the placement being uncomfortable, it has been great. I have noticed some side effects from reading the other reviews that I really did not know about. I hope that I will be able to keep it for the next four years. The worst of the side effects now is the bleeding. My last menustral cycle lasted almost three weeks. Bleeding on and off daily. Hopefully this will subside. But so far no major problems.

I have two small kids and I just turned 30.  After my second child was born my OB suggested Mirena (she also has it).  It was uncomfortable having it put in (I wont lie) but overall its a great birth control.  I haven't had any bad effects. My husband does say he can feel it.  My doctor told me that she can shorten the &quot;string&quot; and this should make it more comfortable during intercourse.  I however, feel great.  I do have some spotting throughout the month so somtimes i'll wear a tampon if i have white pants on (just in case) otherthan that i can't think of any reasons that are negative.  I was supprised to read everyone elses experiences with the birthcontrol.  I have several friends and family that use Mirena and they all LOVE it.  Hope This Review Helps!! (ps i'll be replacing my old with a new in the next 10 months) 
Birth Control	littlemamma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	8/10/2009 9:53:15 AM	I had the IUD put in in March of 08.  I just had it removed because of blot clots, headaches and increased acne. It has also caused several ovarian cysts.   The acne was the worst I have ever had.  When having it removed, it was extremely painful. Worse than a contraction when you are in labor. I would not recomend this unless you plan on using it for the five full years.  
Birth Control	delainegirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	8/9/2009 2:50:22 PM	i had a mirena for a year and a half and didnt realise all the symptoms i had related to it or i would have had it out sooner. I gained 10 kilos had severe acne, depression, severe mood swings, no sex drive, constant nausea, bloating in the abdomen that led people to ask if i was three months pregnant, painful breats and cramping the symptoms got worse as my periods became lighter and lighter when i had it removed i bled as if id just had a baby but suddenly all these symptoms just stopped this was two weeks ago and im already losing weight before i would go to the gym four times a week and not shift a gram! beware girls mirena is not for everyone and although i didnt get pregnant on it it made my life a living hell and reduced my self esteem to zilch.

I was nervous about the removal so I decided to google and found out about all the side effects (That I had NO idea about). This explains A LOT about what is going on with me. I LOVE that I don't get a period! After insertion I had mild cramping and spotting and have not had a period since. (Inserted 6 wks post partum.)  In the two years that I have had it in I have taken 6 pregnancy tests-I constantly experience pregnancy symptoms.I also had my thyroid tested and tons of bloodwork done. Prior to getting it I was breastfeeding and shedding the baby weight. Right after I stopped the weight loss completely and gained about 30 pounds. I am constantly on a diet and exercise plan and get little results. I am constantly tired, get severe migraines, my skin itches, I have horrible acne, NO sex drive at ALL, mood swings and depression,tender breasts, my uterus always feels like I am three months preggo. I could go on. I lived with all these things simply because I hate taking the pill, refuse to get the shot and I like not getting a period. Hopefully it comes out ok and I wont be going back to it.  
Birth Control	Jenny, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	8/8/2009 9:01:24 PM	Love that it is easy, effortless, love that my periods are no longer present, not worried about getting pregnant anymore because my sex drive in gonzo!!  My husband got poked and he hates it because I don't want to have sex ever!!  I didn't know that this was happening to other women.  I really thought something was wrong with me.  I know it doesn't affect all women this way, but for some it does.  If you are contemplating it, go for it.  It is very expensive even with insurance.  That reason alone makes me not want to get it removed.  It's like throwing $500.00 down the toilet.  But, my relationship is suffering and nothing is worth that!

Birth Control	kl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	1	1	Female	25-34	8/6/2009 1:33:55 PM	I did not believe the horror stories. Each of us is different but the side effects CAN happen. Try it out, it works great for some people. Just know that you can get it out any time.For 4 months I have had significant hair loss, weight gain and now have PMS after 19yrs of having a period. I get headaches and cramping all within the last 4 months. I am normally a healthy 33 yr old, have had 2 healthy pregnancies and run 2 miles a day. I'd rather take the time to use a condom and retain my sanity and normal way of life. Could it be a coincidence? Maybe......but I am not going to wait it out any longer. Don't want to mess with my body chemistry any more, who knows how it will affect me 15 yrs from now.

Some irregular bleeding at first but fine now.  Slightly more cramping for the first 6 months then normal but almost no period now.  I am getting worse acne then normal though lately.

My husband tells me he can feel it and it makes him irritated everytime we have relations. What should I do?
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/3/2009 11:04:52 PM	DO NOT BELIEVE THE BAD REVIEWS.. They will just freek you out. I read all the reviews before I ever got my mirena. I was still going through with it, regardless, I was just trying to figure out what to expect. IT IS THE MOST AMAZING BIRTH CONTROL. I have had my mirena for over a month now. Yes the day of I had some cramping for a few hours afterwords. Its going to happen, they have just inserted a foreign object. I had very light cramping the next day, no worse than a period. I have not had ANY bleeding, any cramping, or any unusual problems. I feel amazing. Sex is not any different. My partner has not been able to feel it, either. It is amazing. I love it. Love it Love it. I wish I never read any of those bad reviews all it did was stress me out for no reason. They set you down in the room measure your cervix, show you the mirena itself, puts it in a tube like structure to measure how long it should be when inserted, and its a quick pinch and its done. Literally five seconds. My ob handed me the end of the strings to feel to know what they feel like (fishing line).Gave me an antibiotic and i was done. Its not bad at all. And its amazing. Everyone should have Mirena as a birth control. 
Birth Control	beccabloom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	8/3/2009 7:05:46 PM	Inserted 3 months post partum. No pain during insertion. Love the fact this works for five years. However, I cannot loose any weight while on Mirena no matter my efforts. I will most likely get it removed solely for this reason. I have also lost my sex drive completly. So if you want to be huge with no sex this this is the perfect thing for you. Mine is coming out in a couple of weeks and I can't wait. I understand It's not that way for everyone. Everybody is different. This is just me. I will update once it has come out.
Birth Control	AnnieCat, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	8/2/2009 12:59:23 AM	I had the Mirena inserted 6 weeks postpartum, (it was relatively painless).  It's been in about a year and a half.  I have yet to have my period - which is a concern.  I had the spotting for over a year.  My husband got poked by the strings in the beginning, but it's better now.  But the strings are so short I fear they may have trouble removing it.  I am concerned about not having my period, I think it's a good thing; to have the body cleanse itself of toxins once a month.  As a yogi and a person who considers herself very body aware; i feel like my uterus is getting tougher - thick - bulky.And I am starting to have lower abdominal pain which could be any number of things according to the precautions and side effects of this drug.  And after reading the reviews I too have been having my hair come out in mass amounts.  And I had a horrible unexplained rash/hives like occurance for two days that I found listed in the side effects.  AND I was told this drug only affects the uterus and the hormone is not stored in the cells, but now I find that the hormone could've been passed to my baby when I was breastfeeding - so obviously it travels around the body.This thing in my body concerns me.
Birth Control	Jula, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/2/2009 12:00:43 AM	I've had the mirena for five months now and so far so good.  I haven't gotten pregnant, which is a huge plus since that's the point right.  As for the side effects...well since the mirena was put in my acne has gotten worse.  I only get acne when I'm pregnant and I have very little of it while I'm nursing since hormones are still crazy then.  Anyway, my last daughter 9months when I got it and I was in the process of weaning her.  Everything went fine with her milk since I was already starting to dry up.  I only had a period for the first two months after I got it and they were light.  I've only had very light spotting one or two days once a month since then.  Around the time that I spot I feel a little cramping but nothing major requiring any medicine.  My main concern is the acne.  IDK whether it will eventually go away once I've had the mirena in for a while or if this side effect will stay as long as I have the mirena in.  Oh and I have had a problem with losing weight and I'm always hungry.  That's not a good thing.  Anyway, I've decided to give it another few months, hopefully at least a year to see how things pan out.  If I still have this acne and cant lose weight then I may get it removed.

I LOVE Mirena! I've had it for over a year now, and it is perfect for me and my husband! I cannot recommend it highly enough!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	7/30/2009 4:52:03 AM	In the beginning Mirena was awesome. I stopped having my period after a month. The side effects I experienced were cramping on my right side, weight loss, and decreased sexual drive. I once read &quot;It works great as birth control because you have absolutely NO sex drive&quot;, I now completely agree with this statement. After using it for a year, I had it removed.
Birth Control	hlane, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	7/29/2009 2:01:56 PM	I experienced a complete stop to my post-birth weight loss &amp; even gained despite rigorous exercise, headaches that got worse each month, high bloodpressure (I have always had low before Mirena) and it was as if I was always on edge, stressed, anxiety, lost my sex drive and all in all almost lost my relationship... 2 days after the Mirena was removed, all symptoms are gone and I feel better than I have since 9 months ago when I had it inserted...

I don;t have to remeber to take a pill everyday which is nice so i guess i just have learned to deal with the side effects of it.. I spot bleed alot and it seems my stomach always hurts.. so i guess its all on what u want for yourself.. I know i don't want no more kids but fearful to get fixed.
Birth Control	Lovely, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	7/25/2009 11:58:15 AM	Had mirena in for over a year and still bleeding,sometimes for over 2wks at a time. I have had acne in the past, but since mirena, the acne has come back and gotten worse. Also, I feel like like I have lost weight,but not a lot  since being on mirena. Oh, did i forget to mention the cramping before my period. I don't know about you, but for me, the weight lost, the acne, and lond periods is enough for me. Making an appt on Monday to have it taken out. 
Birth Control	forevermama, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	7/23/2009 5:06:39 PM	My Mirena was inserted 6 weeks ago when I was about 2 months post partum.  The insertion was extremely painful for me.  I had a normal vaginal delivery, so it was supposed to be a piece of cake, but no.  Of course I spotted and clotted for a month continuously, had a week of relief and then started a twisted version of a period.  I know all of these things were possible, but was not supposed to be was weight gain.  Today, I stepped on the scale to reveal I had gained 9 lbs!  I lost it!  On the day of insertion, I only had 4 lbs to go until my pre-pregnancy weight.  I am active and watch what I eat, so I was shocked.  The doctor was very upfront, letting me know that if my body had reacted this way so soon, I would likely continue to gain weight.  My Mirena is now sitting in the bottom of a bio-hazard box.  Yes, I could have tried to wait a little longer to see if things would level out, but I was not going to take the chance of gaining another 20 lbs.  I worked too hard to keep from gaining too much weight while I pregnant and to lose it when my son was born.  Everyone reacts differently, most women do not gain weight, just keep an eye on it if you chose Mirena.
Birth Control	Karine, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	7/22/2009 5:11:38 PM	I had Mirena put in about a month ago or more. I have previously been on the shot and that made me bleed for a year straight. After reading comments on here I was worried it would happen again. I bled for a week immediatly after getting it put in, then stopped for a week and now I've been bleeding for 2 weeks. I want to try to stick it out the 3-6 months but I don't want to keep waitng to stop bleeding and go through another year of this. I don't know what to do. Also to the people that just got it put in today please quit writing comments because you are not helping because you really don't know anything about the side effects of the product. Please and thank you!
Birth Control	ABC, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	7/22/2009 9:33:51 AM	I had it inserted a year ago.  I bled lightly for about a month, then I just spotted lightly 2 days a  month, then 8 months after insertion I stopped having any spotting at all.  I've LOST over 15 pounds and feel better than I have in years.  The Mirena did not make me lose weight, diet and exercise did. &quot;Marital relations&quot; are great with no worries. Went for yearly check up last week and doctor says I have a mild bacterial infection - I have no symptoms and feel fine - for which she prescribed Vandazole gel.  Will go for a follow up in 2 weeks.  My only nagging fear is that this bacterial infection is somehow going to adversely affect the Mirena.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/21/2009 4:06:58 PM	I have had the mirena in for almost 5 years and I love it. I stopped having periods completely after the first year. I have had none of the bad side effects other reviewers listed. I have tried most forms of B/C and they all made me nauseous, weight gain, mood swings and headaches. The mirena pinched a little bit going in and I recall being crampy for a few days but since then I don't even know it is there. I will definitely be getting a new one this year. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	7/21/2009 10:44:33 AM	I was surprised by how painful insertion was.  The side effects I experienced included fatigue, severe cramping (to the extent it would wake me up in the middle of the night), and constant spotting.  I developed ovarian cysts for the first time in my life approximately one month after having the IUD inserted.  While I have been unable to find the medical correlation, it is my belief the IUD caused this condition.  I made the decision to have the device removed after three and a half months.  Fortunately, removal was not as painful as insertion.  All symptoms have now ceased.

Birth Control	nt, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	7/19/2009 7:08:53 PM	My IUD(mirena)was inserted before my 30th birthday.  I've had it three years...I love the fact I don't have to worry about it but I have gained thirty pounds, really bad back cramps, I can't sleep.  The doctors tried to tell me this isn't a side effect.  Ladies we know our bodies.  I'm having mind removed.  Oh did I mention swelling and itchy skin.  I wouldn't recommed it.
Birth Control	Happy2beMe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/16/2009 8:27:07 PM	It was not fun having it inserted and did have the cramping and spotting for about a week, but since then, I have been very happy with it. My periods are pretty infrequent and very light compared to what they were before, incapacitating and couldn't leave the fetal position the first 3 days. After the 5 years is over, or after baby #2, what ever comes first, I will definetly do it again, the pain was worth it.
Other	I hate Mirena, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	7/15/2009 4:47:10 PM	I am 38 and was advised to go on Mirena almost 2 years ago due to my extremely heavy and painful periods and uterine fibroids.  At first my body went through several months of adjustment (spotting, gross discharge), then finally leveled off with no more periods.  I thought all was going to go well from then on until about a year into it.. I slowly started to get side effects that have just increased as time has gone on (edema/water retention, fat gain on the hips and waist, headaches, low back pain, dizziness, foggy-headed, sleepiness, no energy, greasy acne/huge festering pimples that won't go away, rage/severe mood swings, depression, chills, sweats, worse allergies than normal, extra clumsiness/poor motor skills, insomnia, confusion, poor memory, lack of concentration, muscle mass loss - even though I still exercise, dry brittle hair and hair loss, and anxiety/panic attacks).  As I said, these continue to get worse and worse, and I've had the Mirena for 1 year and 8 months now.  I have an appointment to have it removed in two weeks.  I know I will go back to having extremely bad periods and painful uterine fibroids, but I'd rather have them than this.
Birth Control	transcriber87, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	7/14/2009 9:37:16 AM	Well, I had mine inserted about 2 months ago and at first, I just spotted here and there.  After about a week, I started bleeding and I HAVE NOT STOPPED BLEEDING SINCE! It is a real pain to bleed all these months!  AND I am getting acne, not just on my face but on my back too!  The plus for me is that I have had no cramping with this just the non-stop bleeding and acne.  I decided on this method of BC because I was using the ring before and I wanted to use it again...doc put one in and told me that it could diminish my milk supply (I am BF'ing) well within 12 hours, my milk supply was cut in half almost so I opted for this...I am having second thoughts now, I really don't know what I will do now!
Other	Olivia, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	7/13/2009 3:27:32 AM	I had this inserted in April, and have had hell with it. I have had continuous back pain, stomach cramps which I have been taking paracetamol, codiene and diclofinac for. I have had a one month long period, where it was extremely heavy bleeding, resulting in me having an extremely low iron levels. Today I had to have an urgent ultra sound as my doctor was going to remove it, and couldn't find the strings. The Mirena is still in me, yet the sonographer wouldn't say where. I am now going to have a surgical procedure done to have this removed. I am 15 years old, and had this put in to help with heavy menstruation under a general anaesthetic.
Birth Control	nomoremirena, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	7/11/2009 7:12:30 PM	I have had four children--this is the WORST pain ever to have it inserted. The doctor took 2 shots at putting it in--that's after I had the paragard removed at a previous appoint. I had natural childbirth with a high pain tolerance--the insertion of this was horrible. They had to keep me also due to my blood pressure bottoming out (I kept breathing just like instructed). Why in the world does the manufacturer not include a quick dose of numbing med with the package? Many medical procedures do that now, we don't even treat animals without meds. Now that it's been in a month, lots of nausea at weird times, constant feeling &quot;hot&quot; like I have a fever, some bloating (I'm pretty skinny so it's more noticeable). Don't know that I would recommend this for others. My best friend also had one--she'd also had the paragard and she said she would never recommend it, and if when it's time to replace in a few years, she'll have to think long and hard before having another one put in. ditto for me. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/9/2009 3:07:05 PM	I've had Mirena for 6 months and I've had cramping and bloating the majority of the time. Also I've gained over 10 pounds since it was put in. It's great not to have to worry about birth control, but the side effects are terrible.
Birth Control	JessicaJJ, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/9/2009 3:51:08 AM	Getting it put in sucks and don't let the doctor tell yah any different..... a little pinch....yeah right!! I am satisfied with it though not pills to remember to take, no menstration to deal with. Occassionally there is some discomfort in my abdomen that usually subsides shortly after. 
Birth Control	Niecey, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	7/6/2009 10:37:38 PM	So i did a post 5/19/2009 and now im back for a update.  Went to my 1st check up 6/5/09 (5/8/09 i had it put in). The dr couldnt find the strings so i had to do the ultrasound and thankfully it was located and &quot;perfectly&quot; in place.  I was told she could redo it or leave it, it will just be harder to take it out later.  Im not going to go though the pain again if its in a good place.  The everyday cramping, back, and leg pain has subsided and the spotting/light flow is pretty much gone unless i have sex.  then i bleed for about a week.  And i have notice some cramping during sex but it does subside.  I still have periods w/ cramps, not as heavy but for a longer time.  and for the 1st month my boobs were so sore i could barely wear a bra.  Never had that happen before.  I went from 3 heavy days before the iud to 5 light flow days after it.  I have started to notice some acne but not a lot and some moodiness.  Cant say anything about the weight gain or the spotty skin being african american, but i will keep an eye out for those.  I really am getting less to complain about im just ready to have sex more often w/out the bleeding, hell  im ready for the bleeding to stop altogether!  I will check back in few months with a update.
Birth Control	Stefanie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/2/2009 8:54:00 PM	This is the second Mirena IU I have had, the first one {had for 2 years} fell out after a bladder procedure so I just got a new one yesterday, for me it is extremely painful to have inserted and both times I almost passed out because of the drop in your heart rate whenever your cervix is messed with like that. The insertion is the worst part for me! I have had extremely good results with this product and would highly recommend it, but we are all different and not everyone will have the same results, it took about 3 months after the first one was inserted for my periods to become regular and the spotting to go away but after that my periods were so light, regular and very mild cramps, no problems with weight gain or anxiety but about the same PMS as without the IUD. Overall very satisfied as my periods without an IUD are pretty unbearable, (heavy bleeding, horrible cramps).      
Birth Control	gee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	7/2/2009 12:41:39 PM	Well, i could write all day on the side effects that came along with my mirena. It was inserted 1 month ago and since then I have been bleeding and clotting non stop, i am dizzy and moody everyday! My bp has increased, I have palpitations , my sex drive is gone , I have high anxiety...and the list goes on and ! I am having it removed today! I would'nt recommend this to my worst enemy! I am even considering changing my gyn for not informing me of the side effects and making the mirena sound so grand.

Birth Control	kyla, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/30/2009 12:30:59 PM	Mirena was inserted in me last wednesday.  As soon as the doctor inserted it I started having very strong cramps and they got stronger and stronger.  I went into the doctor 5 days later and the could not find the tails, they sent me for a ultra sound and found it in my uterous.  Now I am going in surgery to have it removed, and may cause me far worse problems than that.  Ialways read review and think what are the odds, but it happened to me, I reccomend not risking it.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	6/27/2009 10:42:14 PM	I have had Mirena for two years now.  I'm kind of dissatisfied with the results.  I have bad period cramps coupled with lower back pain.  Acne has not been a problem but lately I noticed that I have facial skin discoloration.  Frequently, I experience abdominal pain during sex.  In addition to the painful sex, I have almost NO sex drive.  I'm only 25 years old, I should want to have sex more than I do.  I never experienced weight gain but I do feel like I am moodier than before having the IUD.  The IUD is very easy to use and effective but I am beginning to think the side effects are out weighing the good.
Other	Kat, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/27/2009 8:42:31 PM	I am planning on getting IUD. I hate the pill and side effects, mostly I didn't have any sex dive. Did that happen to anyone on IUD?
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	6/26/2009 11:24:49 AM	I have had mirena since 2/09....up until last night(6/09) i have had nothing but good to say...i love that i do not have to be bothered with bc pills and i don't even feel it in my body...its so care free! but last night i was removing my tampon and after removal i noticed that the strings from my mirena were hangin out....i was scared and nervous and didn't know what to do! i called my doctor and the nurse told me that my strings were probalbly just needing to be cut a little shorter and that my doctor would not be able to see me until Monday (today is Fri)...i asked if it was a problem or emergency that i had to go to the emergency room and have it removed...she said it was a common thing and i could even leave them like so if it didn't bother me...which really shocked me! the weird thing is i have not experienced any pain from this! i plan on going to the doctor Monday to find out if my strings need to be cut shorter or if there is another problem! Has anyone experienced this problem? if so please let me know what your result was!!!
Birth Control	Michelle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/25/2009 8:50:43 PM	I had the mirena placed around January 08, so it has been over a year now and it is working great.  No pregnancies nor complications.  There was very minor cramping upon placement and throughout that day.  I am very happy with the Mirena and would recommend it for anyone.
Birth Control	hugshelpalways, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/25/2009 2:29:47 PM	I have had Mirena in for 2 months. The first week I got really bad cramps I mean I thought I was in labor. I went into the doctor and had an ultra sound, everything was in place correctly. My doctor encouraged me to keep with it and stick it out. He prescribed 800mg motrin which I took right away. and made me feel much better. For the next week I was taking the surgical stegth motrin regularly. then I just didnt need them any more. although I have been spotting daily the pain is not so bad. My doctor says after about 3-4 months the spotting and cramping normaly go away. I love and trust my doctor. and thank him for suggesting mirena. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	6/24/2009 6:17:44 PM	I got the Mirena in April 2007 after I had my son and I just had it removed today. I felt instant relief when it was removed! I got off to a bad start with the IUD, I bled for 2 months after I had it put in! Then I have had severe--I couldn't move they were so bad-- pains in my abdomen. I went to the ER several times and they found nothing wrong with me and my Mirena was in place. I have basically been in pain for the past 2 years with this IUD.It did prevent pregnancy,it was easy to use (you don't have to do anything) and had no weight gain side effects but the pain (for me) was not worth it anymore! Mirena gets mixed reviews, I'm sure it works awesome for some women, just not this woman =)
Birth Control	Dragonslave7, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	25-34	6/24/2009 3:47:14 PM	I had my IUD put in last Monday (6/15/09). My doctor did tell me most of the side effects. But I am still cramping and having severe pelvic pain which makes me take 800mg of Motrin every 6hrs to help with it. I am still bleeding heavliy. I have tried the pill before and got pregnant with it, and the shot (Depo) makes me have my period for months at a time, which I can't have because I am already severly anemic. I think my system is just screwed up. 
Birth Control	jan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	6/24/2009 10:41:29 AM	The IUD came out of place after 6 months in. I was having bad lower abdominal pain and did not know what it was. I started suspecting the IUD. I went for a checkup, and they couldn't find it. So, now I have to go for an ultrasound to see where it is. If it is easy to reach, they might take out with forceps, or it could require surgery! I am extremely worried about surgery and fearful that it may have damaged any of my internal organs (hence the horrible pain I  am having). This is absolutely not worth the risk. There are many other good birth control methods out there without this huge risk. I then found out that exactly the same thing happened to my co-worker and heard about more people that I know having complications. So, I think the statistics for this device are not accurate. It seems that it comes out more than is claimed. By the way, I have been an extremly healthy young woman and I have never had any health problems.

Birth Control	angelface, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	6/18/2009 5:12:45 PM	It is coming up on my five year anniversary with the Mirena and my experience has been very smooth the whole time.  I had some pain at insertion, some cramping initially (first day or two), then couldn't even tell that it was there.  My periods stopped almost immediately, which was nice. To make myself feel more at ease, I'd take a preg. test every other month or so- always came back neg. One thing that I have noticed lately though (remember, its been almost the full 5 years now) is that my blood pressure has been higher than usual.  I already have high blood pressure, and control it with meds, but lately, its still high and I'm wondering if it has anything to do with the Mirena.  I have an appointment with ob/gyn next week and will have to make the choice whether to insert a new one or not.  I'd like to do this again, but am holding my breath to see if dr. recommends it w/high blood pressure issues.  Everyone's body is diff and reactions to meds are diff too, but for me, Mirena was truly a God send.

I had mine put in yesterday, 6/15/09. Yes, it was uncomfortable, but bearable. I have a tilted uterus so the doc had use a clamp on my cervix. This is why it is so painful to some. The clamp allows the doc to tug on the cervix to straighten the uterus while she measures, then inserts the Mirena. The clamp has very pointed ends and pinches when clamped on. Think of how it initially hurts to get an IV.  The tugging feels like a cramp/mild contraction. I relaxed the best I could and went to my &quot;happy place&quot;. Don't be afraid of the pain. I took an Aleve when I got home and barely felt uncomfortable the rest of the day. The other bonus is that I only spotted for 6-8 hours. No cramping today and I was even able to do a spin class this morning. Everyone is different, but just felt I should balance out all the negative reviews. So far so good for me. Hoping it will lighten/remove my period next!

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/12/2009 6:00:03 PM	I had my 1st child 10/07 and i had the mirena inserted 1/08. Since i had recently given birth I didn't feel a thing when it was inserted, was surprised when the dr said &quot;its in&quot;! Had moderate cramping the first day, nothing major. In the past I have had horrible cramps each month and heavy periods, now just the occasional cramp, but very irregular spotting, if I have to wear a pad its only for one day, then panti-liners for the spotting. I do have frequent headaches, but can't be positive its due to the mirena..I didn't gain any weight either, same as before I got pregnant. It is very convenient, I was horrible about taking the pill! I do have frequent discharge, and did bleed for several weeks after insertion, and for about the first 6 months, frequent periods...i thought it would never stop! But it did, you have to be patient, no bc is perfect, but once you get past all the initial side effects its great. I am ready for another baby though, so removing it this month, maybe back after baby #2!Everyone has different tolerances for pain and shouldn't be too worried b/c some ppl say its terrible...its over quickly and you need to relax your muscles, just like with a pap! Tensing b/c you are nervous will make it worse I would think.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	6/11/2009 11:41:35 AM	Doctor recommended it for endometriosis, since I have difficulty with other bc. Was EXTREMELY painful to put in (no kids), bled for 5 weeks straight after. Have not had one period since, and am a little worried about that since I want to have kids in the next 1-2 years. I have pain in my right side near my hip, and while I have cut my caloric intake dramatically I can't lose weight. I get migraines from the hormones, and am now on two other medications to prevent those. I am very scared of losing the mirena inside, or having an ectopic pregnancy, but don't want to get pregnant just yet. I would strongly encourage people to NOT take this.
Birth Control	pc, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	6/10/2009 5:36:40 PM	Inserted 3 months post partum.  No pain during insertion.  Love the fact this works for five years.  However, I cannot loose any weight while on Mirena no matter my efforts.  I will most likely get it removed solely for this reason.
Birth Control	Kay, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	6/10/2009 2:46:39 PM	I go Mirena in May 08 at first I bleed for about 3 weeks then I would have these pain but after the 3rd month I had no bledding and no pain. My only concern is since I have had the Mirena I have gained about 25 lbs I was wondering why i have been gaing but reading what others have said I think i know why. My doctor never informed me of this side effect and had I known i may have taken another route since I have has weight problems in the past. Other that the weight gain I would recommend it to others. 
Other	mobo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/8/2009 5:02:09 PM	Changed my life!  My heavy menstrual bleeding controlled every thing I did 3 days every month. I was using a super plus tampon every hour or less. I had to take iron pills. After getting the IUD my periods are so much better I can't even believe it.  I should have had this done years ago.  Don't wait for your doctor to suggest this - if you have heavy periods - make an appointment to talk about it with your doctor.

It was extremely painful for about 1 minute.  I was very crampy for about 1-2 hours after. I wish I would have had someone drive me to my appt.  I was very uncomfortable driving home.  I have mild cramps here and there but nothing unbearable.  I do find myself having a hard tire sleeping at night.  Unsure if it is related to the mirena.  So far so good.
Birth Control	Kimbertimbers, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	6/8/2009 1:32:56 PM	I has 3 months of terrible cramping, it was constant pain. But after that t is month 7 now and I don;t even know I have the IUD. I think if I knew how horrible the pain was I would have reconsidered. I have gotten acne but no weight gain. my period is lighter and happens less often, but I still get the bad cramps (flash-back) when I am going to get my period. Still it seems a better choice than taking hormonal pills everyday, and I have had a better time with the IUD than the pill as far as side effects go. I think a lot of people get &quot;side-effects&quot; because they are getting off the pill and going back to normal hormonal levels which makes for a long and uncomfortable adjustment. For example, I did not have acne before, but the pill helps subside acne. So no pill now and more acne now, it's makes sense to me anyway.
Birth Control	ihateit, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	6/8/2009 5:50:09 AM	My list of complaints with this form of bc would take up all 2000 characters on this form! I am having it removed tomorrow and would not recommend this product to anyone unless I really did not like them. Just to name a few of my favorite problems I have experienced horrible cramping, nausea, acne, weight gain, discharge, dizziness, anxiety, back pain and 3 week long periods. I have been to my regular doctor as well as a neurologist to determine the cause of some of my more alarming symptoms and they found no underlying cause. It never dawned on me until I recently web searched the Mirena that it was the most likely cause of all my discomforts. Furthermore, I agree with some of the other posts relating to the lack of a sex drive it causes, so in a way it is a great form of bc because you have to have sex to get pregnant and the Mirena makes it very undesirable to do so. 
Birth Control	mommyof3, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/6/2009 11:20:59 AM	GET THE MIRENA IT WORKS!!!I had Mirena put in 07/2008 and its been FABULOUS! I had some moderate cramping after insertion, a little light spotting and its been PIE IN THE SKY ever since. I'm not depressed. My acne is non existant. My sex drive couldn't be better. My usual case of pain in the butt PMS is no more. My period has been no more than a day or two of very light spotting. Initially I had some hair shedding but I had that following the birth of all my children and can't  place the blame on the Mirena. When I had my Mirena placed I still needed to lose over 40 pounds of baby weight. I lost it all plus an extra 10 pounds that had been holding on since college that I hadn't been able to shake. I won't say it was easy because I had to really work at it but it is possible.  Don't let all the bad reviews scare you away from what could be a really great form of birth control. Had I read these reviews I would have never given the Mirena a second thought. But after expierencing it for myself I kick myself for not trying it earlier. My last birth control fiasco resulted in me having 2 sons in less than 18 months. I say try it if it works out well great if not just know not all birth conrol works the same for every case.

Finally when I went to go have the Mirena out - it is stuck inside - they can not remove it without surgery. THis is extrememly danagerous device and should not even be on the market
Birth Control	sarasd@aol.com, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	6/5/2009 5:46:06 PM	I had mirena put in for less then 24 hours.  When my Dr. put it in and I had instant pain he informed me that some pain is normal. Within the 24 hours I had it in I was in unbearable pain and had to go the a hospital for tests before my Dr. could take it out.  I am a healthy 29 year old with 2 children and no want for anymore soon.  I was the perfect candidate.  I didn't realize what horrible things could happen with an iud until I had one.  I hope that this will help more women make a educated decision and I don't mean what the drug companies want up to hear.  I would tell anyone and everyone don't get a iud it's not worth the side effects! !

After the initial bleeding stopped...several weeks, as they said, I remain on a regular cycle. My only complaint is that my cycle is sometimes a little longer 7-9 days, but it is very light to spotting. Sometimes it is only a couple of days, so that is nice. I experience the normal PMS, but it is nothing that is unusual to the natural hormonal effects that I've ever had. Light cramping, moodiness, cravings etc...nothing that I haven't experienced since I was 12. I have struggled with the weight a bit, but only a few lbs. I figure the exercise that I do is worth the convenience. Maybe it's my age, I turned 43 this year. So, I plan to continue eating well, exercising well and staying on it. If I begin gaining rapidly or having longer periods...I'll talk to my doctor and go from there. Everyone is different... Good luck!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/3/2009 3:35:44 PM	In the first 6 months I had nothing but cramping and pinchy feelings and heavy spotting, I almost had it taken out but it resolved luckily. I love not taking an oral B.C and am enjoying the much lighter periods-hardly there at all! One thing I still don't like though is that it does not stop ovulation so the possibility of an egg being fertilized is still there but then it has no lining to implant in so essentially you miscarry. That still bothers me.

I got it 5/2008 and have had very few complications. I have no kids so the insertion was definitely uncomfortable, but after that I was fine. I had a light period off and on for about 4 weeks after it was inserted, but it was extremely light. I was the type who had severe bleeding to the point of having to go to the ER each time I had a cyle prior to Mirena. Now I never have a cycle. I have very mild cramps, some acne and bloating during the week I would usually have a cycle. I gained some weight, but nothing that was just unbearable.  My sex drive is FAR from lacking, if anything it's tripled. (smile) And I've had no hair loss whatsoever. Everyone is different, but to me the Positives FAR outweigh the Negatives in my experience!

The pain was about like having a pap smear done while being inserted. I beld off and on a lot for the first 3-4 months. I have noticed me being bloated and have not lost any baby weight. i get asked all of the time when my baby is due. I also have really bad mood swings and it breaks my heart to know that my children are suffering from this too. I did not know that any of this was related to the mirena until reading the comments. I am going to the doctor today to make sure that it is the mirena causing the problems but I feel confident that it is now. I love not having to take birth control and it is a hard decision to make but I can not deal with the mood swings and bloating. These are the only problems I have with it now. Any suggestions? I don't want any more kids right now but my youngest is only 7 months so I don't want to rule it out completely. HELP!!!!

So far I am happy I got this. I have had two ablations and this was last option to control heavy periods and severe cramps.I had read previous postings about pain and was really uneasy but was not as bad as I thought.Took a couple advil before and went back to work after.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/20/2009 1:59:10 PM	I had my baby in Sept 2008 and got the Mirena in Nov. 2008.  I lost all of the weight from the baby immediately and was down to 130.  Since being on the Mirena I have exercised, started eating better and even trained and walked in a 10k BUT I have gained over 15lbs!  I have read some other comments that other people have gained on it too.  I also feel bloated and my belly is so big.  I have never had trouble losing weight but the weight has not budged and I blame the Mirena.  I am going to get it taken out as soon as possible!
Birth Control	misfitgrl78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/20/2009 12:25:48 PM	I have never posted a review before in my life, but after reading all the negative reviews and knowing how nervous I was, I decided to add my two cents. I have had my Mirena for almost 5 years. I have to say it has been the most amazing birth control EVER! The insertion was more painful than I expected, (it is a little more than 'slight discomfort' ALMOST as bad as a contraction) but it is over quickly. I had slight cramping for a couple of days, and during my first couple of periods following insertion my cramps were worse than normal. However before insertion, I always had HORRENDOUS cramps and excessive bleeding (sometimes 2-3 WEEKS at a time) and  after getting Mirena they immediately became shorter. In fact, after about 6 months I would only have slight spotting for 1-2 days per month, and NO MORE CRAMPS!! My sex drive increased remarkably, and has remained high. Now that I am nearing the 5 year mark, I am starting to have longer periods and slight cramps again which I assume is because the hormones are running out. I have had no negative side effects, and will definitely have it replaced!
Birth Control	MommyMB, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	5/20/2009 12:32:02 AM	After having my 1st child in Nov of 09 Mirena was the so called best birth control choice of all of the doctors at my OB/GYN office and they made it seem so safe and pretty much 100% effective, but they don't warn you about the threads that can make &quot;bedroom time&quot; painful! Lets just say the husband was being poked where he didn't want to be and it hurt for me as well. Also I had gotten it put in 6 weeks after delievering my child and I was still losing my baby weight till the week I got it put in and i've been gaining ever since. I'm a pretty athletic person i'd say and I've gained 15 pounds in 4 months. I went for a check up 4 months after having it put in and they couldn't find it and scheduled me for a sonogram to see if they could find it. A few days after that I felt sick after I ate as if I was pregnant again. I went and read all the side effect of mirena and wow i wish I woulda have been warned about them all before I just agreed with it. So I take a pregnancy test tomorrow and if the Mirena is still inside of me lost somewhere, I will not be able to keep that baby which is such a horrible thing and something i'm very against. I just wish they woulda warned me about the side effects and not made it seem 100% safe and effective. I will stick with pills from now on for sure. 
Birth Control	krissn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	35-44	5/19/2009 11:44:24 PM	I had a traditional IUD for 10 years and was very happy. I decided to try the Mirena on the advice of my GYN to control excessively heavy periods and cramping. At first it worked, my period was light the first month and gone the second. However, pain incresed to almost constantly. I ended up with cysts as a side effect. My new GYN said they were &quot;impressive&quot;. While removing the cysys, she also removed my uterus, as I didn't need it anymore and it was the original problem. So, no more mirena and no more cysts since it was removed. I think it could be a great method of birth control, if you don't get the side effects!
Birth Control	niecey, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	5/19/2009 9:45:57 AM	Ok.. in a way i wished i had read these comments before i had it done because i would have known that it is &quot;normal&quot; for the cramping and bleeding the for the first few months.  But then again im glad i didnt read them because i would have never gotten it done(05/08/09).  sorry to hear about the issuses!  im 36 with 1 child and i dont want anymore, so this is purely for birth control.  Yes this hurt when it was inserted and yes i have had cramping, pain in my left thigh, and a spotty to light period since day one.  today is the heaviest, but im willing to give it a few months to see if it subsides.  so far my sex drive isnt gone and no headaches but i have noticed the greasy skin.  
Birth Control	cardozafamily, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	5/18/2009 3:41:08 PM	I have had this since Feb 14 2008. I've had 2 kids and didnt need anymore at the time and im terrible on taking pills reg.it took about 10 minutes and was very uncomfortable when it was beign incerted. I had light spotting soon after, but not i have a period ever 3-6 months for about 1-2 week of light bleeding. The only real pain i get is every month i get a searing pain in my adomal pain near my right hip socket for a few days. I tolerate it cause i just cant afford to get pregnant anytime soon with my husband being military and about to deploy again.
Birth Control	sicklysugar25, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	5/15/2009 11:24:46 PM	I got it put in a couple of days ago and it hurt TERRIBLY, this is because I haven't had kids, I got it for medical reasons, but I'm worried about the weight gain; I'm already overweight and am having trouble losing the baggage I have.  Can anyone who has been on it for a while help me with this? I know everyone is different, but I'd like an opinion on the matter.  Otherwise, I am happy about the choice because I am young and am still in college.  I've been have slight cramps but I doing well.
Birth Control	V irgeb1234, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/15/2009 4:44:16 PM	Mine was put in on Nov 08 because I am 33 and aready have 3 girls. I also have a history of painful menstration. I tried uviring before but that was unconfortable so I had it removed and replaced with Mirena. I took Tylanol before the procedure and in five minutes my doctor was done before I knew it. There was very little pain. I spoted for about a month or two then had no period at all but I am having my first period now and I didn't have to take any pain killer for it. I wouldn't have lasted a day without. So far I have to say I am satisfy.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	5/13/2009 11:55:02 AM	I had the mirena placed 3/09. I had very little cramping during placement, but 2 days later I had the most horrific pain. I had cramps everyday and pain pills and ibuprofin did not even phase the pain. I also bled everyday. it was horrible. I had it removed 5/09 and it was instant relief. my dr said i was just one of the women it was not ment for and that i should not have been in that much pain. so if you are having the constant pain i reccomend getting it removed. there is no use being in pain for that length of time.

This is my 2nd period and I'm still spotting after a week and a half.  And as for the weight gain, about 5-7 lbs. But I don't have the horrible cramps or bleeding.

Birth Control	HUGSHELPALWAYS, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	5/11/2009 5:08:01 PM	I HAD MIRENA PUT IN ON MAY 5TH. MY DOCTOR SUGGESTED IT BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE 2 LITTLE ONES AND DECIDED I WOULDNT BE HAVING ANYMORE, ATLEAST FOR A WHILE. MY MENSTRAL CYCLES ARE NOT REGULAR AND ARE EXTREAMLY PAINFUL. MY DOCTOR EXPLAINED THAT THIS WOULD HELP WITH MY PERIODS AND SINCE I AM FORGETFULL, ALOT EASIER FOR ME TO USE IT SINCE IT ONLY HAD TO BE PUT IN ONCE AND WAS GOOD FOR 5 YEARS. PUTTING IT IN WASNT TO BAD, JUST SOME PRESSURE AND A CRAMP CAME ON AS HE WAS INSERTING IT. BUT HERE IT IS A WEEK LATER AND THE CRAMPING IS VERY TOUGH TO DEAL WITH. IM FINE IN THE MORNING BUT AS THE DAY PROGRESSES IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE. I HAVE MY FINGERS CROSSED THAT THIS WILL GO AWAY SOON, OTHER WISE I WILL HAVE TO GET IT TAKEN OUT. GREAT CONCEPT, JUST WOULD RATHER KNOW THAT MY CRAMPS WILL ONLY LAST A FEW DAYS WHEN IM ON MY CYCLE RATHER THAN EVERYDAY. 
Birth Control	cristina , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/10/2009 10:40:35 PM	Very easy. I don't have to think about getting pregnant every time I have relations with my spouse. Now reaching my fifth year we are thinking of removing to try to get pregnant again. It is nice to know that I can reverse this treatment when I am ready, and not when the medicine says I should. I like that I am in control. 
Birth Control	IrulanMunkie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/8/2009 10:12:08 AM	I'm 26yrs old &amp; had one son by C-section about 6 yrs ago. I have not had much luck with other BC but was days away from getting my tubes tied. I don't want anymore kids but when I went in for the consult my doctor convinced me to try this. I got it put in on 5May09, it was very painful to get it put in. Was light headed &amp; dizzy after but that went away.Crampy is still around but no bleeding. Was gonna have them take it out to get the pain to go away but I will try to give it a chance. They are right though, don't read all the reviews cuz they will scare you &amp; you should trust what your doctor tells you &amp; if you arn't sure then get some other opinions.

THIS DRUG DOES SERVE ITS PURPOSE I AM NOT PREGNANT BUT IT DOES MAKE YOU HAVE A CRAZY CYCLE. I DID WORRY A LITTTLE WHEN I MISSED MY PERIOD FOR A MONTH. THEN THE NEXT MONTH I WAS ON MY CYCLE FOR 2 WEEKS. 
Birth Control	Tparrish, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/7/2009 1:24:12 AM	I had Mirena inserted April '08 and have not had any problems other than an occasional mild cramp that is very brief. I am very happy to say I have not had a period since getting this.  I can handle a little cramp every once in a while for the exchange of no period! A big plus is not having to worry about your birth control on a day to day basis like when I was taking the pill. I think this is the best form of birth control I have ever tried and probably will continue using it in the future.
Birth Control	dpeeezy0047, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	5/6/2009 1:56:49 PM	I had mirena inserted in July '07. The bleeding has been minimal ever since, but the cramps are still there. It had gotten so bad, a few months ago I went in to have it removed. After talking with my doctor I changed my mind. I'll hang in there for a little longer but when my annual comes up in a few months, I'll make a definite decision. Sometimes I think bleeding every month isn't so bad because my cramps were never this bad.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/5/2009 12:52:17 AM	I got the mirena inserted in May '08. So far I have been pretty satisfied w/ it. I do have severe headaches quite often, however, I had a problem w/ headaches previously. I think that everyones body will react differently, but in my opinion the benefits far outweigh any risks. If you are considering get it, I would recommend just trying it for a few months and see how you feel. When it is inserted it is kind of painful...w/ cramping for about a day. I had heavy bleeding for the 1st few days afterwards then nothing for 6 weeks. Then a short heavy period. My 2nd one lasted for 2 1/2 weeks. They have now regulated a little more...just some light spotting in between. I was on the pill previously and was always nervous about getting pregnant, w/ this my mind is much more at ease. 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/3/2009 6:00:09 PM	I have had Mirena for about 4 years, after my second child was born. The procedure was a breeze for me with no complications, and no complications since.  I have no more monthly friends, and even no indication (bloating, pain, etc.) that I should.  Supereasy birth control.  I'm coming up on year 5, and would definitely do it again although my insurance changed, so we will see.  (The one downside is that I believe this is quite expensive if your insurance doesn't cover it).
Other	angelr, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/1/2009 10:35:34 AM	I got the IUD in june of 08, and have been trying to have it removed since. I have a 5 year old girl and do not want anymore but because im 29 my dr will not tie my tubes. I am still having horrible periods and the headaches are getting worse by the month. After reading all the other review i now understand where all the acne is coming from along with the 15 pound weight gain. I want it out!! Also i have had bacterial infections since i got it, Even though the Dr claims they are not related i never had one before the IUD.

Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	4/30/2009 1:19:27 PM	I had the mirena iud placed 4 1/2 months ago.  I took it to reduce bleeding and as a form of birth control.  I have two friends who have not bled a single day since it was placed.  The insertion was not too painful but I had severe cramping for about 2 hours after the procedure (take Advil before you go in).  I bled off and on for the first month, almost every day for the second months.  The third month I bled like I was having a period for a good two weeks (not too heavy but not light either).  The fourth month I would feel a bit of cramping for 20 minutes and would bleed for a while and then nothing for a day or two.  I actually went four days without bleeding last week.  I am encouraged that I will have little to no bleeding by 6 months.  It is cost effective if you use it for the entire 5 years and is a good form of birth control.  I just think you need to be prepared for a long duration of bleeding at the beginning.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	4/30/2009 9:53:47 AM	I had Mirena inserted 9/06. I have 3 kids and am 35. The procedure itself hurt a little, but driving home I felt so dizzy and light-headed, I crawled into the house and crashed on the floor. After about an hour I was fine.  2 years and 9 mos. into it: I have no sex drive, problem with acne, no period (I feel like an idiot when asked when my last period was- I don't know!) this is fine with me, and twice now, even this minute I wonder if I'm pregnant. I have never before had bloating or other side effects. If I'm not pregnant, I would get it again when it's time.

I read the reviews and they scared me to death however,it was nothing like I read. I felt NO pain just some mild cramping when she measured my uterus. After that all cramping went away.Today is day 2 and I am feeling great! I encourage all women to ignore negative reviews(everyone will get different effects) and go get this done!!! Love Mirena!!!
Birth Control	Tae, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/23/2009 8:14:54 PM	I was previously on Depo Provera and I decided to find another form of BC because of the side effects. I had previously been on Depo Provera for 4 years with no side effects (that was when I was 17 - 21 yrs old). I then had my son at 22 yrs of age and decided to get back on Depo Provera because it had worked so good. But this time around I had numerours side effects, bloating, mood swings, no sex drive (hurt my marriage) and I bled (medium to heavy) for a month straight. I just got the IUD today (strong pain upon insertion and still having on-again/off-again cramps right now) and after reading these reviews I am very freightened. Im afraid that this will be a repeat of the Depo Provera. Eventhough, I'm paying closer attention to the reviews givien by ladies in my age range, I still have my doubts. We shall see. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	25-34	4/23/2009 1:44:11 PM	I have had this IUD for close to 7 months now. For about 3 months after I had the Mirena inserted, I had constant bleeding and cramping, which is pretty common. After those symptoms disappeared I was pretty happy with it. Until I noticed hair loss and my hair dresser confirmed I am having hair loss! Also about a month ago, I was put on an anti-depressant... I would have never connected depression to the Mirena if I didn't read these reviews

I have gained a total of 40 lbs since then, and I cannot lose the weight no matter how much I diet or exercise.  I have had NO sex drive since the insertion, and my hair and skin have been so disgustingly greasy that I have to wash my face 3-4 times a day.  Awful.  I had a non-stop period for the first 2 months which I expected, and the only positive thing I can find about this IUD is that now I have no period at all.  
Birth Control	Kigak5, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/22/2009 3:20:14 PM	I am late 20's and have 5 children.  I got this put in in late Jan 2009.  It did hurt when it was put in and for the rest of that day, some cramping.  Went away, spotted for the rest of the week.  My period came in feb, no march, yes in april. Oh and I spotted for almost all of feb on and off, taken care of with thin panty liners (highly recommended). No more spotting, only slight clear-yellow discharge once in a while. Sex drive is good, I got some severe headaches the 1st month, but gone now. Don't be afraid to try it, everyones body reacts differently.  My husband and I said we would try it for 6 months and then decide to keep it or not. I really like it up till now. Will keep it in unless something better comes up...doubt it. The Mirena has been good to me.

Then bled regularly for 2 weeks and now still bleeding lightly for 3 week after that.  So, bleeding for a total of 5 weeks now.  This is getting very, very OLD!

I had the Mirena taken out 8 months ago and I have not had one since.I made no other changes to my diet or medication. I never had a kidney stone prior to it's insertion. The longest time I went with out a kidney stone when I had the IUD in was two weeks.
Birth Control	kateplus2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	4/17/2009 9:02:44 PM	i had mirena for two months and had it removed 3 days ago. About a week after I had it inserted, i started having panic attacks, nausia, fatigue, weight gain, and SEVERE mood swings. I thought I was going insane. My doctor then tried to push more meds on me, but I know it was from the Mirena. I never had any symptoms like these before. I didn't get pregnant, but it is not worth my life being disrupted so severely. I don't feel like this is for everyone and your body will let you know!
Birth Control	mmoss, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/17/2009 2:23:42 PM	This is a love-hate relationship for me....I love that it's there, I don't have to worry about it, I can check to make sure it's there (for my peace of mind), and that it's a no maintenance type of birth control. However, I have had SEVERE bloating about once a month for around 5 days at a time. Also, this is preceeded by two days of bad migraines. With the migraines I get naseau and sometimes light-headed. I rarely bleed but when I do, I can't leave my home because it's so bad. Also, I began lactating (which is a very rare side effect of this drug) last month. That was quite the shocking moment for me! I'm not sure the benefits out weigh the side effects I'm having at this point. It's been almost a year since I had it implanted and I'm thinking of removing it. I really have a hard time with the headaches but the hardest time comes with the week long bloating where I can't wear my normal clothes and weight 5-7 pounds more than normal....this takes a toll on my emotional health as well!
Birth Control	Steph1017, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	4/16/2009 7:43:07 PM	I had Mirena inserted on March 18 2009.  I went in on April 14 for my one month check up to be sure all was well.  Mirena strings were missing so they did an ultrasound to find the mirena in my pelvis.  Instead they found a fetus.  I'm 6 weeks and 6 days pregnant.  It's either faulty IUD or faulty physician office.  The dates don't add up, that means they inserted the device and I was already pregnant.  Ridiculous.  I'm very DISSATISFIED!! Now I'm stuck trying to decide what to do about the unexpected pregnancy.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/16/2009 2:26:04 PM	I thought this would be a great solution to the bc pills. Well I was wrong I would never use this again even if someone paid me. I had it done in December 2008 that was 4moths ago and i am still in pain. Heave bleeding and cramps the whole entire time not one day of relief, nausea every day and not the mention the horrible headaches it has caused. I finally had it removed last week and I have never been happier in my entire life!
Birth Control		5	5	5			4/16/2009 12:43:10 PM	I got the mirena inserted about six weeks after i had my son in august of 07. I realy thought it was going to hurt but i didnt feel a thing. I still have my period but i only get it like every three months and it last for about three days. Its also very light. My sex life is higher than ever.I dont use condoms any more and still havnt gotten pregnant. This is the first birth control i have ever tried but its great.

I went in expecting a lot of pain, but it was not bad at all.  She said &quot;you'll feel a pinch&quot;... and I felt something that was a little uncomfortable and I kept waiting for a pinch... and then she was done.  I had a couple of periods, but haven't had one in quite some time.  No complaints about that!!  And for my sex drive, it's possibly lower but HELLO, I have two little ones who have me grabbing every bit of sleep I can get... so no biggie for me... I'm sure if you asked my hubby, he wouldn't agree.  But it's all good.

I love the person who invented this. Not only do i not get a period i don't have the worry of if i missed a pill.  I have a 6 year old son. As for my sex drive its still rockin.  The only side affect i have is the acne which comes and goes.  I can handle that for now.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/13/2009 3:43:57 PM	I have had two miscarriages 5-8 weeks in, but no kids. I didn't have any pain, cramping or spotting after insertion. I actually stopped having a menstrual cycle all together. And I don't have a problem with this considering the fact the I bled like a river and pain killers couldn't help my cramps before getting the IUD. I had it inserted 8/08 and I love still love it now 4/09.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	19-24	4/13/2009 2:31:33 PM	I wanted to tell about my experience with Mirena because I have read the reviews and really, everyone is going to be different. When I had the IUD placed, I will tell you, the pain was terrible. It hurt me so bad I literally fainted in the Dr's office. BUT, there are 2 reasons why: 1. I have never had children &amp; 2. I have a tilted uterus and my Dr had to lift it to insert the device. After regaining consciousness, I went home and was in pain (bad period cramps) the rest of the day and for about 2 weeks. The cramping did get lighter and lighter but I thought I had made a terrible mistake in getting the IUD. It's now been about six months and I absolutely love it. I have tried other birth control methods and nothing has been so confortable. I haven't gain weight, I'm not moody, I have no period and I don't worry about getting pregnant. I have not lost my sex drive, infact...I am more driven then ever. I do get cramps maybe a coupld of times a month but only for a day or less. My only worry now is whether I will go through the same pain again when it is removed. And from what my Dr says, because of my uterus, I most likely will. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	4/13/2009 8:16:31 AM	I had it put in 6 weeks after having my son On Sep 14 2007. At first nothing changed as far as periods which would last atleast 8 days. Then it started to work and I didn't have anymore periods and if I had it was every 2 to 4 months. Now my complains have been fatigue, sleepless nights, not as high of a sex drive, when cramps come on it feels just as bad as labor pains. I also have to say I cannot seem to lose much weight after a certain point no matter how much diet and exercise. I would recommend this to women who have unsually long periods who have had children and really don't plan on having anymore for a long while. I am not getting divorced and have lost 20 pounds out of shear determination however, I get cramps atleast 3 times a month without bleeding and if i decided to have it removed it should be a couple times more painful to take out than it was putting it in. At the time my cervix was still soft but it's been almost 2 years so it wont be as great.

I got it in dec. of 08.. Im having it removed and just taking pills or smoething cause this lack of sex is puting a strain on my marriage. and I mean seriously i just dont wanna be kissed, touched nothing and ive never been like this before
Birth Control	misjan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	25-34	4/12/2009 2:59:23 PM	So as far as Effectiveness goes I have to give it 5 stars, not because it's good at preventing pregnancy but because I don't want to have sex. It's not that I don't have a sex drive but I'm constantly having cramping and pains in that area. My periods which I do say are lighter last 12-14 days at a time and come back after about 2 weeks. The cramps I have during that time are much worse then when I was just on the pill. It was a horrible experience being put in and assuming this doesn't subside I'm not looking forward to the removal. I've talked with my doctor and she's put me on an oral birth control for a month to see if that will help my symptoms. I'm not going to get my hopes up. My friend has ad it for over 2 years and has not had any symptoms. So I can't say I wouldn't recommend it but it really sucks if your body doesn't like it.

I almost passed out after it was over with too. After the feeling of passing out was over with I was fine! I just took some pain killers and took a nap...I havent had much cramping but I do have an upset stomach. This was my last option for birth control so I hope it works like the doctors said it would.
Birth Control	Lana's Mom, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/11/2009 7:01:03 PM	I love this thing. For those of you thinking about having an IUD, don't let negative reviews scare you away.  Like any medication, everyone reacts differently to it. It was easily inserted, I had minor cramps but nothing excruciating.  I just had a baby 5 months ago and my husband and I are not ready for another one, so I did some research and was almost scared away from the idea of an IUD by the negative reviews. I'm had a little spotting but nothing else.  Some women complain of pain during insertion but it may be the dr's fault.  Some are just more gentle than others. But you should really check it out. I love mine!!! Because I'm still nursing, I had to take Jovilette which you have to take within 3 hours of the same time everyday. With a busy infant, who has time for that. Mirena is so convenient!!! And I don't feel it at all!!!
Birth Control	Kelli, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	4/8/2009 3:56:42 PM	I Had the IUD inserted 2/06/09. I am 19 with no children. The insertion was very painful, and I had bad cramping the first 3 days. My period has been irregular, but since it is a new horomone in body that is expected. So far, I love it! I have had no major issues and love that I dont have to remember the pill everyday. I highly reccomend this form of BC!One reccomendation is to have someone drive you to your insertion appt. I was dizzy after insertion and was very glad to have my boyfriend drive me home.
Birth Control	Lana, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	4/8/2009 11:08:47 AM	I got the Mirena in 9/08. It is April 09 and I have very light periods but they last 2-3 weeks, then i have one week with no bleeding or spotting, then i'm back on again!! It is very annoying! No heavy bleeding. I can usually get by with a panty liner, but it is not stopping 7 months later!! Not much pain at insertion...moderate to severe cramping for two days or so, but after that better. I do have more severe cramping and VERY tender breasts a day or two before each period. But the worst has been the constant spotting. No decrease in sex drive like some others have had.
Other	hamy456, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	4/8/2009 2:43:38 AM	I am 45 years old. so the reason i got this was to slow my bleeding down. It hurts quite a bit to put it in. After a month or so i cant feel its there anymore but i havent stopped bleeding yet!!!! I dont want sex anymore not interested at all! When i did have sex he could feel it and it scratched him. I do also have weird discharge sometimes. Also im not myself anymore, depressed i guess.I have not taken it out yet as it was expensive and the doctor told me to give it 3 months. All i wana do is cry. why did he do this to me? Also my friend said it is very painful to remove. one more thing i have been very dizzy and unable to work lately, i see that could be a side effect. now i have to go to my regular doctor he will know what to do. please dont do this to yourself before you are very sure of what you are doing.Oh yeah i have had it for 4 months.

I have a 8 year old daughter and was currently on Neuva Ring.  Don't read the horror stories like I did, I went to the doctor a nervous reck. It is not that bad just a little cramping that last 30 seconds to a minute. I stoped bleeding 2 days later and now i am spoting in the mornings and that is it. Hopefully, that will stop soon. I went to work after the procedure and I cramped the rest of the day, but come Saturday all the cramping was gone and have not experience any since so far I am loving MIRENA!!!!!!!!

Birth Control	jethoon, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	4/7/2009 12:54:10 PM	Even though they say to get Mirena only if you've already had a child, I didn't know that and it had been recommended by two different friends.  Neither of them had given birth either and we're all around the same age, early 20's.  They were really excited about their IUDs and warned me of the pain.  Planned Parenthood was giving them out for free and 5 year protection sounded great.  It did hurt a lot, but was over very quickly.  I didn't have any bleeding afterward, but I did feel a little funny and was nauseous for about a day or two.  Overall, I highly recommend Mirena and have told friends to get it.Every once in while I get a little light spotting, but thats it!  It is great.My boyfriend really loves it too, but it gave him some problems at first.  The strings sometimes poked him during sex.  More than hurting, it caused some psycological problems.  I went in and had the strings shortened.  After that, we were fine and he wasn't scared anymore.  The IUD was put in a year ago and I'm so grateful to have 4 more worry-free years!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/7/2009 5:20:28 AM	I had the IUD inserted in Oct of 08. I had it placed at my 6 week check up after a c-section. I will be very honest. It was intensly painful. Like nothing i have ever felt before. I bled for two days after that, and then stopped for a few days. I then had three solid weeks of bleeding followed by two week periods for three months. Now, after six months i have only two day periods that are so light i really have to wear nothing as protection from my period. I would say to anyone that has just gotten it or is going to get it, to really give it a good four to six months before you have it removed. It is a super pain in the butt at first but well worth it now. I have no cramping, basically no period and my husband loves it now. It was definitly worth the hassle. Just be patient. It is so worth it now. 
Birth Control	Tigger, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/5/2009 1:06:04 AM	I had my son on 3/11/08 by c-section. He is my second child, my daughter is now 3 years old. At about 10 weeks out from my surgery I was told I could get the IUD. The procedure was more painful that I expected, it was like a mini labor but bearable. Afterwards there was the bleeding and discharge from the medication she put on my cervix (it bled from the spreading). I bled off and on for several months afterwards but it wasn't much of an annoyance. The part I don't like about this product is I am having a reaction to the medication (I believe). Each month before I have my menstral cycle I start getting yeast infection like discharge, inflamation, irritation, and iching. It is like my warning that I will be bleeding soon. Then I bleed for about 2-3 days (med to light) and after that is complete the yeast-infection-like symptoms go away and I am good to go till next month. It is really weird (and a bit annoying especially when I want to have sex because it is painful). However, the benefits of knowing I won't get pregnant and not having to take a pill (I am terrible at taking pills) outweigh the cost of irritation. :) I haven't heard anyone talk about discharge and irritation on a monthly basis so I thought I would share just in case someone can relate.

I've had very few side effects, and nothing that I wasn't informed about beforehand.  I recommend going to this website for a great source of information and both positive and negative experiences, instead of only negative experiences.

It is HORRIBLE!!! It has been 3 months...I have been bleeding for every week within those months, but one.  I am experiencing an alarming hair loss( and I have a lot of hair).  Also, I breakout with the most unusual rash all over my body:face,bikini area,legs.  I must explain this rash b/c it's that horrid.  First, you break out with red bumps( the size of an eraser). Then, they rapidly fill with puss;thus, becoming the size of a quarter. Next, the puss bubbles until leaking out...Finally, the quarter size markings turn a dark brown and harden.  Oh, and if you try and pop them, they only get bigger!!!  So, I have been on this birth control for 3 months;yet, cannot have sex becqause I have been bleeding for most of that time.  My OBGYN tell me, so women experience this for up to 6 months.  Also, I believe it's important and relevant to mention,I have had these horrible side-effects and I am only 29 years old.  Worst of all, I had to pay $500 out of pocket for it, as most do.

Although I did have a miscarrige a couple weeks ago. The only pain I had was when my Dr. was inserting it. I've had no bleeding, or discharge, so far. I have  read a couple stories of women that have had the IUD and hated it, I have also read stories about women who hated it. I was on YAZ when I got pregnant, do you think my DR. gave it to me because I got pregnant on the pill?

I have 3 kids so mirena is very convenient for me. I had it put in 6 weeks after my last daughter was born and it felt like i was having a 30 second contraction when it was being put in, but other than that it was definitely worth it!
Birth Control	JD2004, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/19/2009 7:42:04 PM	I had my Mirena inserted in early January 09. I'm 22 and mother of a 2 yr old which I delivered through C-Section. I wanted to switch from the patch only because I wanted something more reliable and long-term. Like most, I was worried about the bleeding and the pain that might follow. However, the insertion was very easy. Especially after reading all these posts, I was really expecting the worst. But it felt like nothing more than strong menstrual cramps.  However the bleeding has been a nuisance, but my doctor fully explained that it would be beforehand. I bled for two weeks after insertion, stopped for two weeks, bled for another week and a half, and stopped until early March 09. Today is the 19th and I have been either spotting or having sporadic heavy bleeding since the first week of March. But my fiancee is understanding. I know that if I just stick it out everything will work out. I would recommend this to any woman looking for a reliable, fool-proof form of birth control.

It's really annoying. I don't understand why a doctor would allow somebody who has never had children to get the IUD inserted. I had mine put in 6 weeks after I gave birth to my daughter and I didnt feel anything when he put it in.

It has been such a convenient method for me.  I have been on it for over 3 years and have such a light period...I've heard others complain about heavy bleeding and cramping but I have had none of that.  It is such a great alternative for me being that I was mostly sure that I didn't want anymore children but wanted to reserve from getting a surgical procedure.

I didn't consdier the leg pain could be due to this until I started reading these reviews. I can't say it's effective beacuse I only have sex now about once a month. I'm happy about not having to worry about pregnancy, but I'm not sure this is the method for me.
Birth Control	Nicole J, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/13/2009 6:38:42 PM	I am 20 years old. No children. I just got the Mirena yesterday, and like some people I didn't read reviews on it, which scared me a little. My boyfriend didn't like the idea of me getting it because of some of the contraindications and he heard (and me also) that you can become infertile from Mirena. I read the most 100 recent reviews, but there were only about 2 other women that i can compare myself to (age, no children, not married, etc.) so I thought i should give my input. when getting it inserted it did hurt, but it was bearable. i didnt faint, didnt feel dizzy, or feverish, just shaky (i was nervous). after reading some of these reviews i feel better about it. the dr suggested i come in when i was on my cycle to make it easier, so i did. i was given 800mg of ibuprofen, my Dr measured my uterus to see if i was the &quot;right size&quot; and put it in. it took less than 3 mins and i was able to get up, get dressed and that was it. i did have cramping after and took steady doses of 800mg ibuprofen, and that helped me. i was toward the end of my cycle, but i have more bleeding (which i expected). its more of a brown gouk, not heavy so i just wear a panty liner. I am scared about the weight gain and getting acne that i have heard about, but i believe this one is the best for me. i have tried close to 10 different kinds of bc and have yet to find the right one for me. i hope Mirena works. remember ladies that everyone is different!! so its not going to be the same for everyone! but if it seems right for you i suggest trying it. :)

I do have to say, not having a child was quite difficult to have the mirena incerted. a couple days of cramps and some slight spotting and I was goldon from then on.

I wanted a tubal but was told I'm too heavy for surgfery.  yikes  I just had 2 BABIES 10 MO APART  so I know I need to lose about 30 lbs.  My dr suggeated Mirena instead nd I thought I wouldtry it even though I had a copper iud back in the day and was nit happy,  With this I have constant bleeding, bloating and cramps like I just delivered my 4th baby.   I will be asking for a removal on tues at my appt and will schedule a tubal ligation.   I don't recommend this birth control at all and wish I had read comments from this website before I had it inserted   I don;t want to gain weight and I definetly don;t want to get prego which I've read has happened to a few who also posted comments  
Birth Control	MissMinWisconsin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/5/2009 11:44:52 PM	I had Mirena inserted 12/31/08, and it is now March 5th.  It was just following my cycle, as my doctor recommended. The pinch as she held the cervix in place to insert it was no picnic, but was over quickly.  I've had 3 children by C-section, and dealt with all sorts of pain following those so it was definitely manageable though uncomfortable for sure.  They asked me how I felt afterward - I had no idea some people faint till they brought it up (I didn't).  I got up, got dressed and went back to work (office job) -- I recommend to bring a moderate flow pad to wear afterward or use the one they provide -- I changed mine to an ultrathin as soon as I could. No big deal!  I bled for 3 days and had first-day-of-period type cramps, and then had  a break for a few days and the bleeding started again.  I have now bled lightly to moderately off and on (mostly on) since then, but suddenly this past week it stopped (so far). The pieces of tissue &amp; small clots I passed sometimes were gross &amp; unexpected, but again tolerable.  I know it is keeping me from getting pregnant which is the desired effect, but I hope that it is not what is causing me this fatigue.  I was not happy to see fatigue on the list of symptoms.  I've been blaming it on all sorts of things, and really hope this isn't the actual cause.  I came on WebMD to research symptoms of being tired and a rash (circular shaped rashes in places where you sweat that flake over), and found that a rash (doesn't meet the same description as mine though) and tiredness came up for Toxic Shock Syndrome which is a potential result of using mirena so I ended up in this area checking other people's symptoms.  Again, hoping this isn't caused by the Mirena!  I am assuming my symptoms are from something else, and would still recommend Mirena so far!
Birth Control	turtle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/5/2009 4:27:56 PM	Okay let me say I had my mine for 4yrs &amp; 9mo. I ? it and even 6mo ago planed on getting another June 09.  However it wasn't till 2 week ago I started haveing laber pain type cramps &amp; I looked up side affects &amp; then it hit me what I had been dealing with this whole time. No period right away which I am not complaneing about that but stomach stayed bloated all the time.  5mo after it was fitted panic attacks, anxity, mood swings no histery.  11mo into it 45lbs weight gain I was always a size 4 &amp; all of a sudden I was a Size 13. then about 4yrs into it cronic back pain, stomach cramps,chills, drpression a feeling of being overwalmed of duties,breast milk discharge even though my son will be 5 in 2mo.  The ER said by CT Scan I had endometis due to this. GYN will not get me ultrasound for 1 1/2 week because I am not pregant &amp; they don't consider it an emergancy.  I finally had mine removed yesterday I had to convince the GYN.  Because he still says nothing is wrong. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	3/5/2009 2:24:16 PM	I have now had them mirena in for a year an half. I'm 25 &amp; have one child. I had it put in 6 weeks after having a c-section. When the doctor inserted it, it hurt very badly but only for a few mins of excruciating pain. (c'mon he's pinching &amp; shoving something up your uterus) I had cramps the first couple of days, for about 3 months I had major hair loss, HORRIBLE headaches &amp; was about to have it taken out. But after 3 months it got better. VERY light periods which is always nice. My advice wait about 3-4 months before you decide to take it out because most likely the side effects will decrease. Also, make sure the &quot;string&quot; (which to my husband says feels like a wire) is cut short enough so it doesn't poke your significant other during sex.
Birth Control	txpeach, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/4/2009 1:16:08 PM	OMG...I've had this thing for a week and I'm about to rip it out myself.  I've cried from the pain, vomited at least 6-7 times in a week!  I hate this thing and wish I would've never done it.  I've taken motrin, even feldene to help with the pain. I haven't had sexual relations with my husband from the fear of more pain.   This sucks---BTW I'm 38 and 0 pregnancies
Birth Control	sass, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	3/2/2009 12:03:26 PM	WELL.. a girlfriend of mine had the mirena put in and i asked her how it felt? She explianed it to be like during intercourse when it feels the guy is in too far, but lasts for about 30 seconds to a minute and half... i was like i can deal with that. NO i cried and screamed i felt like the biggest baby! i even made the nurse hold my hand. IM NEVER HAVING CHILDREN! She spent about 30 minutes trying... It wouldn't go in! i gave up a few times ~ finally when it was in i felt i was going to pass out from exhausting my body from tensing up. I didn't realize they would dialate your cervix!!! Wow! i mean if you can get it in easily great but i have a friend that works at a gyno and she said no matter if you have a kid or not... IT HURTS! i cramped for over 3 days and now 3 weeks later my boobs feel like tender rocks and occasional random cramps. hopefully 1 month of mess will make the next 5 years easy.
Birth Control	blondambition813, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	2/27/2009 8:36:56 PM	Today I went in to have the mirena iud put in. I am 28, no children. I was given this birth control option because I now have high blood pressure at a young age. The doctor prepped me for the iud. I had to take 2 tablets to put in my cheek i believe to dilate me a little better an hour before the procedure. In the room, the doctor injected me with a &quot;novocaine&quot; type injection to numb the pain since i had never had kids before. The pain I felt following that while she attempted to put the mirena in was unbelievable. She wasnt able to get the mirena iud in after a few attempts and told me I had to find another birth control. My cervix opening was too small and she was unable to insert it properly. So pretty much I went thru all the pain of the procedure with no results. I am back to a new pill now. Not all women will experience the pain I went thru, however I would suggest if you have NOT given birth before and you are getting an iud inserted, save yourself the pain and try to see if you can have your doctor check that the iud will fit properly into your body. Best of luck to those of you who are able to successfully get it inserted!
Birth Control	Laurie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/27/2009 12:21:04 AM	I am a 24 year old woman with a 2 year old.  I had mirena put in after my little girl was born and it was fine.  My doctor explained to me that my cervix had already been expanded for the birth of my child, so inserting the mirena wasn't a big deal.  I cannot believe that some doctors would even consider allowing women without having given birth get the mirena put in.  I can't imagine how painful it would have been if I hadn't given birth a few months beforehand.  My only complaint is the irregular, strange periods that make me paranoid about being pregnant.  I am terrified of getting pregnant. Although my boyfriend and I would gladly welcome another baby, the complications of getting pregnant with mirena scare me.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/26/2009 3:43:56 PM	I am 44, I have 2 kids ages 18 &amp; 21 years. I got my Mirena about 1 month ago. The first week was irritating because the inflamation from the insertion was causing a little cramping. I spotted a tiny bit and then it stopped. I feel great! I wish I had done this years ago! I have had some intermittant spotting but nothing I can't handle. I have always had a pretty healthy sex drive and I have to say that now it is better than ever! My husband loves it too! It put spontanaity back in our lives.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/26/2009 1:59:12 PM	I had the mirena placed 6 weeks after my c section in may of 2008. I have not stopped bleeding since it was put in. I have no idea if i have gotten my period. I have tried everything, taking birth control pills to get my cycle on track, pain meds, and just waiting it out. I have had problems with mood swings, feeling depressed, tired all the time,wieght gain 15lbs, itchy skin, bloated, consitpation, cramps all the time. the worst head aches of my life. I wanted to wait it out but nothing gets better. More and more side effects come with every day.

I have gained 50 lbs. I have HORRIBLE ance (which I have never ever had even more than 1 pimple at a time) and I'm 29. But those are nothing in comparission to the contant pain and then severe stabbing pains throught the day. I have had maybe 3 days at a time without bleeding, and bleeding old looking, clumpy blood. but for the most part my period is 24/7. not to netion that the most effective way this is keepingme from getting pregnant is that I have absolutly no libido. Also wanted to add the depression and mood swings. And to top it all of my cousin just found out shes gotten herself PREGNANT even thought she had mirena put in about a year and a half ago.

I would recommend bringing someone with you because I passed out shortly after I had the IUD inserted. I was very dizzy. I had really bad cramping it almost felt like contractions for about 3 days. I bled for 2-3 weeks; heavy at first then to spotting.

Birth Control	Casey, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	2/19/2009 12:32:17 AM	I just got the Mirena two day ago, but I already love it. I am nineteen with no children and no plans on children any time soon. I just want to warn people : The littel &quot;Pinch&quot; your doctor will warn you about wasn't a &quot;Pinch&quot; for me. I believe my exact remark was, &quot;Wow, that really does hurt!&quot; Hah. I had cramping for the twenty-four hours following the insertion, but that has gone away now. I am looking forward to five years of not worrying about unwanted babies. Knocking on wood that no complications arise.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/18/2009 12:18:26 PM	I'm 24yrs old and got Mirena July of 08. There was no pain and my dr. was done in 1min. I had VERY irregular bleeding for the first 5months, but now I have VERY light peroids that last 2days. I have some cramping every now and again, but that is the only side effect that I have now. I have not lost my sex drive and am very pleased with this form of birth control. The reason I probably didn't have any pain with it being inserted is because my dr said its easier when its put in on your cycle. Im a mother of 2. Hope this helps!
Birth Control	1isenough, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/18/2009 11:44:08 AM	I had a Mirena IUD for 5 years and never had any complications. There have been no problems and I would recommend it to anyone that meets the requirements.  It is painful to have inserted but it is a quick procedure,(only a couple of minutes) and the cramping lasts a few hours after. The protection is wonderful and I have no worries about it failing. I also just had it removed and replaced with a new one the same day. It also helps control my problem with ovarian cysts and endometriosis.  Ask your doctor about that.
Birth Control	Gigi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	2/17/2009 1:54:32 PM	I am a 35yr old mother of 1 child which is 6yrs old. I got mirena in June of 08. The 1st day it was put in I started cramping and spotting. I took advils and motrins. I bled off and on for about 3mths then i started getting a regular cycle. I have no problems with sex. A few minor cramps a week before my cycle but nothing serious to complain about. I like mirena so far and Im just waiting for the no period stage. I have not gain or lost any weight. I have a very active life and it has not slowed me down. I had back pains before mirena so I dont incorporate that as coming from this birth control. Im very sexually active with my mate and he still doesnt know that I have mirena. Rigth now Im satisfied!!

I have also not stopped bleeding. My doctor says it takes 6 months for your body to adjust. But how do i know it will? How do i know when it is time to try something new? please has anyone had this happen to them. Did your bleeding stop? I have tried everything hormons, other bith control with mirena, pain relivers 800mg everything! 
Birth Control	runningirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	2/16/2009 12:10:10 PM	I am a 36 year-old woman who does not plan to have children. I have tried many reliable hormone-based birth control options under the sun and always had a hard time with them - mood swings, depression, significant weight gain shortly after starting using these methods. 14 months after getting Mirena I went up 2 pants sizes and it seemed to have all caught up with me in the past 2-3 months. I always don't think it's natural for a woman not to have a period at all (it happened to me after 2 months). I feel constantly exhausted and my breasts are always tender. I can't even run anymore. 2 size bras up as well. I originally wanted the copper IUD but my dr told me my periods would be even heavier and the risks were not worth it. I am hoping to have mine removed this week.

I love the fact that I have not had a period for 3 1/2 yrs, at first bled for about a month then went to occasional spotting. It did hurt putting in it nothing like childbirth though. Sometimes I have some discomfort when having sex. I get cramps, but overall I think it's worth it.

My first couple of periods lasted about two weeks and now have cut down to about a week, but I get constant spotting and headaches and get major cramps like two weeks before my period.  and come to find out that 10 months down the road of having mirena IM PREGNANT!

Birth Control	Worried, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/11/2009 1:11:02 PM	I just got the Mirena IUD inserted on Monday, February 9, 2009.  So far I have experienced back pain on the first day after the insertion and mild cramping is still is present.  I'm wearing a pantyliner just in case I start bleeding or spotting, but I have not noticed any bleeding.  I plan on at least trying it for a month and if I am not satisfied I will be having it removed.  I wish I would have came to this site and read all the reviews prior to getting this inserted because I might not have gone through with the procedure, which was very painful.  I have one child and it still hurt.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	2/7/2009 9:08:51 PM	I am a 24 year old African American, Im married and have a 21 month old son.  I have had problems with Mirena from time I got it put in aug 07.  My first &quot;cycle&quot; was about two months after and was very light and &quot;dead&quot; looking and it lasted about two weeks.  So I figured I would give it some time for my body to adjust...needless to say now feb 09 I currently have a cyst on my right ovary, lower back pain, joint pain, mood swings, fatige, headaches, bloating, no sex drive and I cramp for about two weeks before my &quot;cycle&quot; comes on (its still very light and last about a week now). But I must also say that I have had bad reactions to all alternative birth control currently out. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/5/2009 11:49:12 AM	I got my Mirena right about a month ago. I hadn't actually read any reviews on it until I got home that afternoon. I just want to give some people some hope! There are certainly more negative's on this than positive's! I will say this...it only took a minute or so for the doctor to do the procedure. The worst part of it was the fact that he dilated me a bit before doing it. I was uncomfortable but it cerainly wasn't unbearable. I cramped up mainly. But, I also had my 1 year old daughter sitting on my stomach while he was doing it! =0) So maybe that had something to do with it! I got home and for about 4 1/2 days I did have cramping. I took Advil liqui-gels (800mg) in the morning and then I would take a couple more in the afternoon. I used a heating pad when I was sitting or laying down. It went away. I haven't had any problems since then! Intercourse hasn't been uncomfortable and there haven't been any after effects...my husband said he could feel it for a second but it didn't bother him! Remember ladies...every woman is different different different! Give it a try, if you don't like it...you can always go back! Best of luck to all of you! (Jen...25 yrs. old)
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/4/2009 10:29:45 PM	I'm writing this review to set the record straight. First of all, I'm a 20 year old college student who has never had a child before. My doctor and I made the decision to go with Mirena because of complications with the birth control pill OrthoTriCyclen Lo.   After reading many negative reviews about Mirena- I was very hesitant to go through with getting it. I was so nervous I delayed getting it for two months. It's important to take into account that many of the people who leave reviews are people who have had a NEGATIVE experience with a drug/product. With this in my mind- I decided to give Mirena a shot. I went to the doctors office with all of these horrible ideas in my head (many women said that it hurt so bad they passed out/cried out in pain) THIS WAS NOT THE CASE.Remember it's important to have a good relationship with your gynecologist, let them know what you're expecting and they'll do their best to prepare you for anything that will happen. The procedure took no longer than ONE minute (despite some women saying it took 10 to 20 minutes), it was very quick and someone uncomfortable during insertion. I was able to drive home, and the pain was tolerable after with a few ibuprofen and bed rest. Basically I'm writing this to help women my age with the negative comments about Mirena. Everyone is different and you should really give it a try! I had Mirena inserted yesterday and there is no more cramping/pain. And as for the women who say that there is &quot;brown gook&quot; discharge- it's the antiseptic that the doctor puts in prior to insertion...which should go away with showering.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	2/3/2009 6:22:36 PM	I've had this almost a year. I have absolutely no sex drive.  Constant headaches, lower back pain, leg pain and joint pain.  I had it inserted seven years after my son's birth.  I had tried the depo and almost every pill available.  It was not very painful having it inserted and have extremely light bleeding, when I get bleeding.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/3/2009 3:24:48 AM	I had the mirena inserted after my first child.  Very painful.  After having it for several month started having horrible leg pain and joint stiffness of the lower extremities.  Gained 15#.  I was irritable, and just didn't feel like myself.  I started reading the reviews. My doctor tried to tell me that my symptoms were not related to the mirena.  I had it removed and the next day my mood was better.  I have no leg pain now and i am still trying to get my weight off.  this BC method was not for me.

Bled lightly for about 3 months, and now nothing.  No period for 3 months.  Fine with me!  Feel great, diet is working and I've lost 22 pounds, I can check for it myself about every 2 weeks and I can find the strings.  No complaints.
Birth Control	MandyLynn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/1/2009 6:28:24 PM	I had to have Mirena due to hypothyrodism. I can not use a hormonal birth control and this was my only other option besides  condoms, and I have been married 5 years  I don't think that I need or want to use those any more. Mirena was not any more painful than a period cramp being inserted, and was done very quickly. The one thing that I did not like was that I bled very lightly for about 2 months, but was told that was normal. Other than that I say that it is so worth it and the best birth control ever. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/31/2009 9:31:24 PM	Mirena has been in for 3 weeks. There was intense pain upon insertion - I nearly passed out, turned completely white and started shaking. The doc recommended that I make the appointment for 8 days following my period, as my cervix would be wide open and thus insertion would be less painful - couldn't imagine what it would have felt like at any other time of the month.After eating/drinking in the doc's office for about 20 minutes, all pain had subsided. Now - I have no bleeding/spotting, very minor cramping, no mood swings (yet).I'd recommend it - but also recommend asking the doc for some pain meds beforehand to help with the insertion.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	1/30/2009 2:22:41 PM	I haven't ever been pregnant so my cervix was just not into it! I'm not gonna lie it hurt. I don't know if i would suggest it or not I have had it for a week and still have pain! Nothing major now but let me tell ya it was not fun the first couple of days, but I don't think my Dr. had any mercy for me either!!  Of course that helps if they care what your feeling.

In the begining I bled and cramped for 3 months. I honestly thought that there was something wrong, but eventually it withered out to about 2 real periods a year and light spotting ocasionally. Emotionally I havn't noticed a whole lot; not more than I would expect being 18-22 years of age. All in all I can't wait to get my secound one in.

I have never had any kids. I got the IUD becuse other birth controls didnt work really well for me. I didn't know that I was going to to be in pain almost a year later. I have had it checked twice it feels better for awhile when I get it chcked but then its back to cramps. I also get cramps after I have sex. I am mean other then the fact that it really works well I would get mine removed. To me its not worth the pain that I go thru almost everyday. So ladies really think about it before you get an do you research. The IUD is not for everyone.

Still to this day I may receive my period a week early...some right on time... even a couple days LATE... but nevertheless is comes!

They would not tie my tubes when my youngest was born in 05 becuase of my age. I had my IUD placed in April of 06 I had strong bleeding for three months after placement.  I now expierence sever cramping, painful intercourse, moody, I have just recently begain having breast tenderness it is painful and I regret having it placed.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	1/26/2009 1:22:44 AM	I had the mirena inserted 12 days ago during laproscopy surgery for endometriosis.  I am 24 years old with no children and have had debilitating periods for years and so my gyno suggested insertion of the IUD while I was having my operation for endo. Once pain from the operation had subsided I now have shooting pains in my abdomen and ovaries which can be attributed to the IUD.  Additionally my moods have been all over the place and I have been wanting to eat constantly- I just hope this subsides!  I will try and stick it out for a few months as the mirena is meant to be excellent for controlling symptoms associated with endometriosis.

I have 3 children and don't plan to have others, but still wanted something reversible.  I have had no problems with bleeding, cramping, etc. after initial insertion.  In fact, a rarely have a period even after 3 years!  Love it!

Although this birth control is effective I hate it. My doctor thinks its what's best for me right now because I am so young, but i never get my period, I have mood swings, acne, weight gain, and always cramping. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BIRTH CONTROL TO ANYONE.

I am having the IUD removed tomorrow, as a matter of fact. It is definately not for everyone. 
Birth Control	Michelle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	1/21/2009 1:16:29 PM	I had mine inserted 11/14/08. Extremely painful insertion. I have gained 15 lbs in less than 2 months.  I have never had so many pimples in my entire life and I'm 39!  I have sudden onset of extreme cramping at any given time, makes me wonder if I have cysts that might have burst when it happens.  I have been extremely moody, I can't stand myself half of the time.  GAS!! OMG!! Sorry Ladies.  I don't want sex because I just don't feel like it anymore and the weight gain hasn't helped with my self esteem either.  I have been wearing a panty liner ever since day one.  Not a lot of bleeding, but more of a brown discharge.  YUCK!  The only good thing I can say about it is that I don't have to worry about taking the pill everyday.  Don't know whether or not I'm ready to have it removed yet though.  I'm going to give it a little more time, hopefully my body will adjust.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/20/2009 4:28:02 PM	I'm 25 without any children.  I decided to get mirena, since my insurance would cover the entire cost and I was tired of taking a pill everyday.  (I took Yasmin and Yaz for 6 years).  The insertion was like really bad cramps for a few days.  I was still able to go to work and carry on with my life.  I had spotting for the first two months.  The worst side effects have been acne, mood swings, and insomnia.  Fortunately, the acne and mood swings are starting to go away, now that I've had mirena for 4 months.

Other	melissa.cherry, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	1/18/2009 7:46:58 PM	I have had Mirena in for a month. I did my research and felt it would benefit me. My tubes are tied but I have issues with my period.I'd been on Yaz for 2 years &amp; I was fine. My doctor recommended the Mirena as I am approaching my mid 30's. I've had bloating cramping feeling since day 1. Also gained 5lbs in 4 weeks.I bled for 3 weeks. I'm having alot of discomfort after intercourse and problems with constipation and gas. I've also noticed more acne.  I'll see my doctor in 2 days and I'm gonna ask for it to be removed as some women with the side effects I'm having have had perforation.I'm glad it has worked for some women just not for me. It would have been more helpful it the makers of Mirena had been more informative of side effects. I have been taking 800mg of advil twice a day for a month and it doesn't help. Intercourse has been very uncomfortable for me, like I can feel it in there. Not to mention the severe bloating after intercourse. I hope that my doctor doesn't give me any argument about having it removed.I understand that everyone is different and Mirena works well for some, but after reading other women's testimonials I feel better knowing that I'm not the only one feeling miserable on this medication.     
Birth Control	myopinionmatters, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	1/17/2009 12:09:27 AM	I had no idea mirena would be so painful. If I would have known I never would have went threw with it! When it was put in it hurt and when I got home I couldn't even get up. I've had to take ibuprofen every day just to live a normal life. I would not recommend this to anyone! It's birth control because I'm in too much pain to even think about sex!
Birth Control	anh3s, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/15/2009 11:11:08 PM	I am a 23 year old mother of two and just had my 6 week postpartum check up today. I was told that I would have to still be bleeding for them to insert mirena, and although I still have not started they went ahead and put it in.  I have to say after reading reviews on here yesterday I was scared that it was going to hurt.  But honestly the only thing that was uncomfortable was the clamp that they used to open the cervix. I couldn't even feel them placing it in and they had to tell me it was over. I was a little light headed for a few minutes, which he said was normal. I also experience mild cramping and bleeding for several hours although both have completely quit and I feel fine now. Overall so far I am quite pleased and hope that things continue to go well with Mirena!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	1/15/2009 10:17:33 PM	Great birth control method, but within 3 months of having my Mirena put in after the bith of my daughter, I ended up having a cyst on my ovary the size of a golf ball. Not to mention the cyst reptured while having sexual intercourse, worse pain of my life. Now I am having it removed this week. i rather go through child birth before dealing with that pain ever again.
Birth Control	maria, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	4	Female	35-44	1/15/2009 3:04:35 PM	I had Mirena inserted on December 18, 2008. The insertion was horrible. I felt I was going to die, and was not prepared for the pain at all. The cramps were more than cramps. The rest of the day I felt lots of discomfort, and although I had just gotten over my period, it started all over again. The following week was better, some spotting every day, but not so bad. Last week I had my period again, it lasted 7 days. It finally went back to spotting on Monday.(today is Thursday). Today I went to the doctor since he wanted to see me a month after insertion. I told my doctor that my boyfriend complained about poking and some pain. (That was the first time we were intimate. After that he has said he feels something but its not so bad). I wanted to ask my doctor to cut the strings shorter and how long it would take for them to get soft enough. He said that cutting them short will make it more difficult for my boyfriend and will really &quot;poke&quot; him, plus at the time of removal, it would be very difficult. With my body temperature, it has already adjusted to the way it should feel, the doctor also said that the strings are doing what they are supposed to do, which is to &quot;bend back, wrap around, etc&quot;. He also said that the spotting is due to the fact that as the IUD releases its medicine, it makes the lining of the uterus thin out, therefore it comes out in the form of spotting. He said to give it a few more months to see any changes in the spotting. So far my boyfriend and I rather have this than being on the pill, or using condoms. I had not been on the pill for over two years and my boyfriend and I could never be spontaneous, we had to make sure we had condoms and we had to plan things every time. Now things are very different, at least for now, we dont worry about pregnancy, if we want to be intimate we can do it worry free! I could not be on the pill because it makes me gain weight, and condoms are very uncomfortable, so our alternative here is so much better. I also 
Birth Control	SD, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	1/14/2009 5:55:04 PM	I had the IUD put in approx. 6 wks after having my second child in 2007.  I am considering having it removed because i have found that I am having frequent yeast infections (which follow my period) and never had this issue before using Mirena.  While it's worry free birth control, I'm not sure it's for me.  I still have a period; though light I hate the fact that the discharge is dark in color.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/13/2009 2:11:50 PM	I got the Mirena put in about 8 wks after my daughter was born in Dec 2007. I love this thing. I felt a small cramp when they inserted it and I got my period right after and it only lasted for a few days, but very light. My cycles quit coming since Nov 2008 and the only problem I've had with Mirena, is I've gained close to 25 lbs with it. I excercise on a daily basis and I eat really really healthy. But if you're looking for an effective birth control and you don't want pills or any other kind...Mirena is right for you. 
Birth Control	youlittlesqueek, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	1/13/2009 12:27:37 PM	I am a 25 year old mother of one who got the iud in may of 2007 it is now jan 2009 and I am having it removed in 2 weeks. It is nice to not have to take a pill daily but about three months after insertion I started getting urinary tract infections which have continued every month after my period since.  I do have very light periods, a panty liner a day, however it took some time for them to regulate.  There were times in the first few months that I WOULD BLEED for weeks at a time.  The insertion is painful however I don't think it was worse than child birth.  The pain afterwards lasted about two weeks and advil worked the best. Better than vicondin.  My dr tells me that this is due to advil suppressing uteren contrations. I have to say if you have problems remembering the pill and issues with depo than I think giving mirena a try is worth it. It was very conviniate and if it works for you it would be great.  I did also have large cysts on my ovaries also but they went away on their own.  Women need to remember too that we are all different, just because this didn't necessarily work for me doesn't mean it won't work for you.
Birth Control	navybratsmama5, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/12/2009 4:44:27 AM	I am 32 with 5 children. I chose this over getting my tubes tied because I'm afraid that I might regret doing that. I absolutely love having this type of birth control. I don't have to worry that I forgot a day and I can go about my business like I'm not even on birth control. Okay, I do get a little bit of pimples on my face now and then... I don't really like that part but I can live with it. My periods have been extremely light... light like meaning I don't even need to wear a panty liner light. I don't mind that at all. I haven't had any cramps, aches, or pains. And, best of all, I haven't gotten pregnant on it!I have gotten pregnant (in the infinite wisdom of my teenage years) using the &quot;pull out&quot; method (all you little girls learn something from me... &quot;pulling out&quot; does not work), I got a little smarter by using condoms and got pregnant again, decided the pill was the way to go and, guess what, got pregnant again, I got the norplant after my 3rd child and that worked only because I bled for 18 months straight before having it removed. My 4th child was planned and that was really nice. And then I went on the patch, well, needless to say I have baby #5 sitting on my hip. Don't get me wrong I love all my babies but, you know, I would have loved to have planned them all. Yes, I have been called fertile myrtle many times and I think this time we finally chose the right way to go. I would and have recommended this to friends, especially those who are like me and not want to do any permanent damage. Having the choice to decide together if and when to have or not to have another child is awesome.So, overall I say this is definitely the best out there.
Birth Control	AlyK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	1/11/2009 12:37:52 AM	I had this put in shortly after my son was born. I had absolutly no pain, and only minor cramps after. I have only expirenced one peroid in the past 3 months, although i was breast feeding when i began using the merina IUD. My problem with this type of birth control is the weight gain. I have gained 15LBS in three months (and I run 2 miles 5xs a week. otherwise it is great there is nothing to think about, it is there is works, but if i contine at this rate i will explode.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/10/2009 6:22:53 AM	I had Mirena put in a little over a month ago.  I've never had a child, but the dr reccomended it because of my endometriosis.  The insertion was very painful, not gonna lie.  I yelped a little and had a few tears.  BUT she told me exactly what i would feel.. a pinch, poke, cramp etc...  It was in in under 3 minutes.  I was a little dizzy so i layed there for a few minutes.  She gave me a script for some pain meds.  by the time I left the Pharmacy 20 min. later all I felt was a little discomfort.  The rest of the day i relaxed and used a heat pad.  The next day I felt OK just a little tired.  After that all was fine.  Spotted for about 2 weeks, very light though.  And no period so far.  The only pain I've had since insertion is from a current cyst I had before insertion.  Great for me, I love it!

Birth Control	messyjessy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/9/2009 8:41:57 PM	I am 25 with a 6 year old, got pregnant on the pill was using ortho-patch for the past 5 years. Didn't have insurance paid like $500 for this to get put in which was very pratical considerin the patch was $50 a month. I enjoy not having to think about birth control. After insertion, I had severe pain and cramping, the Dr. told me it shouldn't hurt that bad, Yes he was a man! Duh! Anyway, I think the sorfter the cervex like on your period the easier for insertion and maybe less pain. about 2 -3 days later I was bac to normal.My boyfriend did say he could feel the strings, but no big deal. I used to have a 7-8 day cycle every 28-30 days, now I have a 3 day flow once a month. LOVE THAT!I have had an acne problem since I got pregnant 7 years ago, but have noticed a lil more than usual like on my back and shoulders, which I didn't have before.I don't think I had an excessive weight gain, I mean I got it in March 2007 and just noticed some weightgain due to the colder weather and the Holidays, so I can't say I think it's the device.Overall I like it, I am however, concerned about getting it taken out and what will happen then, 5 years is a long time.
Birth Control	Rayn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	1/9/2009 1:22:48 PM	I'm 23 with one child. When they put it in at my six week postpartum visit, if felt as though they were breaking my water all over again! After about an hour, though, the pain went away and I was pretty happy with it because I didn't have a period at all. If you are considering Mirena, be sure to not only read their website's warnings, but also read other peoples comments before deciding Mirena is for you. I'm having mine taken out because I recently sat down to think about my health over the past 11 months while I was on Mirena, and I have discovered that symptoms I have had over the last year that had unknown causes may be due to Mirena. I won't find out for sure until I get it removed and see how my body reacts, but these are a few symptoms I have experienced (though, not all at once): weight gain / bloating (looking six months pregnant), uncomfortable vaginal dryness, lack of sex drive, painful sex, headaches, mood changes / swings, memory loss / forgetfulness, and even an unexplainable thyroid cyst that had to be surgically removed. I am considering using ParaGard instead since it does not rely on hormones to prevent pregnancy. I'm hoping it will be a better choice than Mirena. While Mirena is effective and easy to use, personally, I am dissatisfied with it. The negative side effects outweigh the benifits, and I am opting to go without the hormones... I've always thought adding things to your body that aren't naturally there probably isn't a good idea, anyway. Good luck on your decision!

Insertion was so painful, i had terrible cramps for the next month, and lots of bleeding. Months later i have spotting all the time, no sex drive, acne, head aches, I don't feel like myself! I had it removed today and i am so excited to have me back! I told my doctor about the loss of libido and she said it shouldnt come from mirena, but sounds like on here it does. do your research!
Birth Control	Betty1234, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	1/8/2009 8:35:14 AM	I have mixed reviews about the mirena. It was terribly painful to have inserted and I was nauseous for two days after. I had cramping and pain for those two days as well. I had light spotting/bleeding for about a month. Now (going on two months since insertion) I have random spotting and random cramping. It works- because Im not pregnant but I feel a little bit dissapointed in the side effects. I also have bleeding during intercourse which is a huge nuisance. I am going to keep it in for a couple more months to see if it gets better but if not, I may have to weigh options!

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/3/2009 7:44:38 PM	I had the Mirena IU inserted nearly 2 years ago after the birth of our second child.  The discomfort when it was inserted was minimal and I've not had any issues.  For the first couple of weeks, I had spotting.  Ever since, I have gotten very light periods and they are very regular.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has had issues with birth control pills - I've always had to take lower dose pills because I've gotten sick on regular dosage pills.  It's also great not having to worry about birth control methods with my husband because Mirena is so reliable.
Birth Control	katesashopaholic, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	1/3/2009 3:14:11 AM	I'm 23 years old. I had my first child in April and got the Mirena in July. The initial process was worse than child birth. In October, for about 2 weeks, I felt like I was pregnant, but the test came back negative. And now for the last 3 weeks I've been feeling like I am pregnant. The test was negative. So its overall effective, but I'm so miserable. I have constant terrible cramps, nausea, headaches, trouble sleeping, bloated stomach, weight gain, mood swings and major depression like I had when I was a sucicidal teenager. SO I'm having it removed on Monday. It works for some people with out any problems, I however am not 1 one of them.

Anyway, I've had it for about 4 months now and I get really bad cramping randomly. When I first got it put in I got a fever of 102.7 that night and it lasted for 2 days. Anyone know what's wrong with me? :[  the doctor is booked up til after the hollidays so I'll have to wait to get profesional help I guess.
Birth Control	Hope, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/31/2008 12:18:32 AM	I am completely satisfied with Mirena! I had it inserted 18 months ago after the birth of my second child, because I want to wait a few years before even thinking about another child.  I had always used the pill, but Mirena is so much more convienent and worry-free(and, in the long run, much cheaper than the pill). The insertion was pretty uncomfortable, but it was in place within a few minutes.  I experienced some mild cramping for about a day or two(like period cramps), then after that I didn't feel anything at all.  And, best of all, I rarely get a period.  When I do, it's just spotting that lasts about a day.  I have never experienced any unpleasant side effects from this drug and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	12/28/2008 11:14:46 PM	Wow...I've had so many out of wack things go on with me, and I NEVER thought it was due to this little evil device. I gave birth to my first child and got pregnant with twins 6weeks later. I made the decision to get off the pill and onto this since I refused to chance another pregnancy anytime in the near future and could be forgetful with the pill. GREAT idea right? I have fybromylgia and have had very low points with it...but it has been nothing compared to this. I am probably twice as fatigued than normal which was already all the time practically. I am losing so much hair. My normally &quot;always ready to go&quot; sex drive was gone and I didn't even realize it, because I was so irritated all the time. I've been called one of the most patient and &quot;kind&quot; people anyone has ever met until this thing took over my life. I've been absolutely irrational for the past several months and didn't know what changed all of a sudden to cause this. Then the other day I flashed back to reading my &quot;warning&quot; pamphlet when I got this evil thing and remembered the hormone being different from anything I've ever taken...and then the light bulb when off in my head. I'm used to getting bad migraines which I regularly have, but are aggrevated by most pills...so I asked the doc about it, never did I think to be concerned about all of this. I've had the IUD for about 7 months now, and I believe that I have spotted everyday. I have breast pains, as if I were needing to breastfeed. Nausea- sometimes to the point where I took a preg test. I'm 27, have never had a pimple and have had 2 zits in my life...now I break out with all of these little aliens (?). My back pain-horrible. Fibromylgia is NO fun, but I even learned to cope with it-with NO meds outside of a motrin here and there. This thing though???? I'm so glad I decided to check these reviews. I had NO idea...Calling the doc tomorrow as soon as I wake up!
Birth Control	jjr, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	12/23/2008 1:29:12 PM	I have had Mirena for one year now.  I've had 4 ultrasounds this year, two confirmed ovarian cysts over 2 cm, which have since gone away.  I have constant aching in my low back, in front of my pelvic bone, sometimes it extends down my right leg and migrane headaches, which I take tylenol about 1-2x per week.  (I only take it if I have to.)  I have no sex drive at all and rarely orgasm any more.  I constantly have one big pimple or &quot;boil&quot; like I used to get when I was a preteen, I'm now 32.  As soon as my husband gets his vasectomy, I am getting it removed.  I've tried to get it removed, but my FNP resists, stating, &quot;you are just going through a phase.&quot;  The good news is that I don't have a period, at all.  Yes, it is a reliable form of birth control, but I don't like it, I miss my old self!

Like others, I had it inserted before I read actual patient reviews, which had me quite scared.  I am pleased to say that I have not had any reactions.  I had major depression/ mood swings, weight gain, and acne while on DepoProvera and was scared to have the same reaction as the hormone released by Mirena is the same. I may have some weight gain, but I was overweight to begin with.  Insertion was a bit painful with cramping for a few days, but no cramping and no periods since.

I had the irregular bleeding which my doctor said was normal. After that my periods were gone. I love it. I like not having to worry about taking a pill. The down side for me is the weight gain. Another was acne. I never used to have a problem with my skin, but after i got mirena inserted i started having problems. Other than that i'm happy with it

I had no pain when it was being placed. the only thing that happened is my dr had to cut the strings shorter because my husband could fill them but he said it felt cool lol anyways I have already recomended it to my sister and all of my friends its great! I have my periods but they are so light

I kept it in for the full 5 years without ANY negative side effects. I have a history of depression and Mirena had no effect either way.  I stopped having periods for the last 2.5 years which I see as a positive side effect :)  I would recommend this birth control.

I LOVE it so much.  No side effects at all.  The only thing I'm worried about is leaving it in to long, it is just as expensive to take it out as it was to put in, tthe only difference is I had insurance five years ago and now I no longer do. I would reccommend this to everyone.

It was inserted last week. Constant severe abdominal pain. Went yesterday to have it removed and my uterus is perforated (6 days later). I have to have laparoscopic surgery tomorrow to have it removed. I did not research until after placement... shame on me!

I have had one child and I do not want anymore. I hate having to remember to take a pill everyday so i spoke with my doctor about the mirena and we both agreed it would be the best for me. So for I love it. it was painful for me the day i got it but the next day it was better. still have slight cramping but nothing i cant handle..all in all i love it so far but like i said have only had for not even a month yet so we will see

I have had severe pain in my lower back, pelvis and even going down my right leg. Went to the doctor for it and she told me it was not related even though it all started the day after. Then i started with a discharge that was constant, have to wear a panty liner everyday. I also have became depressed and have anxiety issues an had to be put on medication. On top of that i have gained 25 pounds that i worked hard on losing after my second child. I am extremely upset with this iud and plan to have it removed very soon and try another method
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/7/2008 10:23:45 PM	Insertion was NOT FUN.  However I got through it and then read all the reviews on this site and was scared to death.  After a month I have not lost any hair, gained any weight or any of the other horrific side effects I read about.  The insertion was like a regular pap smear with severe menstrual cramps.  That lasted about five minutes.  If you have a high threshold for pain it won't even phase you.  My &quot;period&quot; this month is almost non-existent.  If you've ever taken any kind of birth control pill then you are already used to the possible side effects.  I would highly recommend it - and also recommend you stop reading the user reviews as they will scare you, possibly for no reason.
Other	suecee1020, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	12/6/2008 7:17:21 PM	I am the mother of 4 and my husband had a vasectomy so I wouldn't have to take the pill. I have a strong family history of breast cancer and heart disease. I went to the doc for heavy bleeding. I was bleeding through tampons and pads in 1/2 hour. I went for an ultra sound and biopsy. I was suppose to have a D&amp;C and the doc said she couldn't get OR time. She had the mirena in her hand. She had already decided she was using it.  so without the test results she inserted the mirena. I was talked into it by the doc and nurse. She has one and it's great.  I never saw any info or side affects until it was in. My fault!! I asked and was told it was safe. There was not other word the nurse did most of the talking. It didn't bother me going in  but, I have leg pain back pain, headache, cramps, my breast and armpits  feel swollen, no sex drive and I have a wonderful husband. Why are these docs pushing this?? I called and wanted it removed. She wants me to go for another ultra sound to check location. I said I just want it out! Why would anyone put this into a woman 50yrs old who has a strong history of breast cancer and heart disease?? I can't wait next week it is coming out.  Ps Test were normal.  Do your research

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/29/2008 11:10:01 PM	 27yrs old, 1 child, insertion 1yr ago. After much research on mirena I decided it was worth the possible side effects. Insertion was right after my period, and was quite painful but not unexpected nor was it debilitating for me.  It seems so long ago that Im not sure I remember original side effects except spotting and cramping.  After about the 1st/2nd month I no longer had a period but I still experience monthly PMS symptoms including cramps, breast tenderness and body ache. I have several medical concerns but did not relate them to Mirena until reading reviews. Side effects POSSIBLY related: weight gain (25lbs), depression, hip pain (joint), fatigue, loss of energy, acne, mood swings, random spotting with sex. I say possible because I have had several very big life changes during the past year, including a new climate. I did have to have the string trimmed as it was poking my partner making sex very painful &amp; impossible for him.  Pros: no daily pill, no monthly RX cost, no pregnancy, no period, ability to have it removed if we want more children.  I am not considering early removal unless side effects worsen or when Im ready to try for more children. I have recommended this product to friends. I think the review complaints are very valid and anyone should consider all options before making this decision. Good luck and I hope this review is usefull.

My new doctor suggested the Mirena. She has one and &quot;loves it.&quot; Well, I do believe many women have the product and love it. However, I know from experience that doctors are not educated enough on the true percentages of side effects vs. what the company advertises, nor are they educated enough on who the &quot;right candidate&quot; is for this product. I had never given birth to a child, I am not married, so just with those two descriptions I do not fit the company's &quot;ideal candidate&quot;. Regardless, I made a HUGE mistake of trusting my doctor without doing my own research and let her insert it at the same visit in which she suggested it. The insertion was horrible (I can handle pain, I've had many surgeries) and I nearly passed out. I had to stay at the doc office for 30 minutes before driving and was sick to my stomach for 2 days. I gained 20 lbs within the first 6 months (while working out and watching my nutrition!). I have experienced a whole different kind of acne - cysts - on my face. I also had depression/anxiety. I was constantly tired, no motivation, and loss of desire. Unfortunately for me, my work life was so stressful and since my doc didn't tell me about any of these potential side effects, I didn't know that the Mirena was likely the #1 cause of these new issues in my life! After seeing my family doc a few times, seeing my girl doc once, and doing my own research, I had it removed after just over 1 year of insertion. I immediately lost 7 lbs within the first month. Felt energized. No more random pains. Face is clearing up... In summary --- do your research on Mirena in more places than your doc office and than on their inaccurate website. Ask around. Read everything. Good luck.

It has been 9 months of constant bleeding, foul odor, heavy bleeding after sex, no sex drive, headaches, insomnia along with fatigue, lots of pelvic and back pain, heaviness in the vaginal area, and now to top it off, tried to have it removed and the string was missing.  The IUD had embedded itself in to my uterus and I have to have surgery to remove it.  DON'T GET IT!

I have had 1 period that lasted about 10 days, only had very light bleeding, hardly enough to wear a pad. Light enough to have sex whenever I wanted. My husband cant feel the string. The only side effect Iam having is feeling tired. When I read about other women complaining about this, I thought there is no way this could be a side effect of the birth control. I have worked in a pharmacy for 14 years and have never seen this as a birth control side effect. Would not have guessed I would have that side effect. I forget I have only had Mirena in for just over 1 month. It seems like it has been all I have every used. It has been great. I would recommend this type of birth control.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/24/2008 11:25:40 PM	I got this about 8 weeks after I had my first baby (Jan. '07).  I have a low pain tolerence and all I felt when they inserted it was cramping and a little pain.  I spotted for about a day.  In October of '07 i was having a little pain in my side and i checked the string and they were not there so i called the dr and he ordered an ultrasound and come to find out it had slipped back some so i went to the dr and had that one taken out and another one inserted in the same visit and have had zero problems with it since.  Every month about two weeks before i start i get some cramping but nothing that i can't handle, other then that i have had zero side effects.  I would recommend this product to everyone but remember you can't go off of what other people's experiences are everyone has different pain tolerences and think different things hurt.  I would say try it and if you don't like it you can always have it removed.

IT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO ME WHEN IT WAS BEING PLACE INTO ME. BUT ONCE IT WAS OVER I DIDNT FEEL ANY PAIN. THERE WERE SOME LIGHT BLEEDING AFTER IT WAS PLACE BUT SOON STOP THE NEXT DAY. ON OCT. 20 I STARTED MY PERIOD AND BEEN ON IT TIL NOW WHICH IS NOV. 20. I BEEN BLEEDING FOR AN MONTH NON STOP. I'M DIZZY, SLEEPY, SOME HEADACHES, NO ENERGY TO DO ANYTHING. I HAVE AN 9 MOS OLD TO CARE FOR AND SOMETIMES I CAN'T DEAL WITH HER CAUSE OF HOW I'M FEELING. I CALLED MY DOCTOR AND THEY TOLD ME ITS ALL NORMAL. WHAT I SHOULD'VE DONE WAS DID SOME RESEARCH ON THIS BC BEFORE I WENT AND GOT IT DONE. AS FOR INTERCOURSE I CAN FORGET ABOUT THAT FOR NOW. I HAVE TO WAIT TIL 3 MOS TO PAST BEFORE I CAN BECOME SEXUAL ACTIVE AGAIN. THE ONLY GOOD THING I LIKE ABOUT THIS BC THAT I DON'T HAVE TO WAKE UP AND TAKE A PILL AND HOW MANY YEARS IT LASTS. BUT GUESS I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BC TO FRIENDS. IF ANY FEMALES WANT TO TRY THE MIRENA, ITS UP TO YOU. I HAVN'T HAD ANY CRAMPS YET BUT I HAD ALL THE OTHER SIGNS.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	11/19/2008 2:52:01 PM	I decided to get Mirena because I am in my 30s now and smoke and have very heavy painful menstral cycles.  If I had known how painful this was going to be I would have never done it.  I have a strong threshold too.  I have felt completely dysfunctional ever since insertion a month ago.  Some issues I thought unrelated but after reading reviews on here I am not so sure.  I have been dizzy and exhausted, the cramps I have EVERY DAY are worse than my normal cramps, I have severe lower back pain and even pain and cramping in my legs.  I just don't feel like myself at all and taking 800 mg Ibuprofen twice a day every day for pain is not my idea of fun.  Plus that only remedies one of the many problems I am experiencing.  I am having removed next week and cannot wait.  Like all things this is not what everyone will experience but just sharing mine.  
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	11/14/2008 5:24:52 PM	I've had the Mirena in for, as of next week, 5 years. I have loved it until recently. This month I have constant strong spotting, just non-stop. I thought maybe it was &quot;wearing out&quot;, but none of the information suggests that is really possible. Then I started reading the web. I'm not a reactionary person - I wish someone had some basic research on whether these side effects are more common with Mirena. But I've had more than usual trouble with depression (a life-long issue, so I thought nothing of it), developed an anxiety disorder, have terrible acne (well, for me), back pain (which I feel sure is unrelated), and weight gain (which I figured was getting older). I have to get it out anyway, but after all I've read I don't think I'll get it again. My insertion, for what it is worth, was fine.

I talked to my doctor about having it inserted and he consigned the idea.  I have irregular, heavy periods lasting about 7 days with bad cramping.  I was given a many pamphlets and testimonials from women who all said it was the most wonderful thing.  I even read that it was painful getting it put in, but the results were worth it.  The doctor who did the procedure told me there would be mild discomfort and any symptoms would go away within three months.Therefore, I decided to have the Mirena inserted.  The insertion was very painful, but nothing I could not handle.  Fifteen minutes after it was over, I was doubled over in pain.  I had to call my finance to come and pick me up from the doctors office.Since I have had the Mirena, I have been having about 2 -3 periods a month lasting about 5 days.  They are certainly lighter than before, but they are extremely painful now.  I feel tired all the time, I feel like I want to throw up a lot.  I am very moody and worst of all my stomach cramps so bad, sometimes I just cry because the pain is so bad it sends shooting pain down my leg.  I also have bad acne beginning on my forehead and my jawline. I would not recommend this to anyone.

I had a ultrasound and a x-ray only to discover my iud did in fact perforate my uterus and entered my stomach! Tomorrow I will be in surgery to have it removed!  I actully consider myself lucky not to be pregnant, and this is why I rated the effectivenss the way I did!! If I had to do it again, I probably would, considering the facts, this only happens to a small precentage!!!

After trying a million different types of birth control, I finally found Mirena and have been using it for 2 years. I have, however, been experiencing severe abdominal pain on and off for the past year. Doctors have not been able to say whether or not this pain is because of Mirena, but I did have it in for almost a year before my first pelvic pains began.

Due to family history my most extreme side effects have been unbearable I have developed Alopecia Areta (my hair falling out in bald patches) which is genetic in my family and is set into motion by the hormones in the Mirena. Along with gaining 25 lbs that I lost after child birth. And acne that I have never had before, I have tried many things most of which had worked for me for years now and cannot even help a little that along with the hair falling out I will be talking to my doctor about removal ASAP I am undergoing treatment for the Alopecia and it hasen't helped yet I hope by removing the Mirena it will start to work. My family also has many other health problems that limit my birth control options to three: and IUD, depo and the mini pill I thought the IUD was the easiest option for me So just if you have ANY family history of Alopecia or any other Auto Immune Diseases I advise against the Mirena.Thanks so much I hope it turns out well for you!!

It was recommended by a relative. The insertion was so painful. I could possibly compare to the first stage of labor. I had light bleeding for 24 hrs. The bleeding has stopped and I haven't had a period for 3 mos.. Which is Awesome. The bad thing is i was losing weight prior to Mirena and now i have put on 5lbs in 6 mos. (NOT GOOD). I also have headaches and never had headaches before Mirena so that's another side effect I don't like. My sex drive is low and I suffer from lower back pain. Overall i am somewhat satisfied.I will give it another 6 mos and see how it goes..more weight gain ..it coming OFFF!....

I hate the thing, the side effects are horrible. Headaches which I have never had before, I have gained 30 pounds which I have always been thin my whole life, I have always had a really good sex drive but have no interest in sex since getting this inserted, mood swings, tired all the time even after sleeping 9 hours, i have a period two weeks out of the month every month, a strange odor down there especially after sex. Have to wear a pantyliner everyday because of spontanueos bleeding through out the month. I can not wait to get this thing removed.
Birth Control	katskin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	35-44	10/27/2008 10:36:12 AM	After an extremely painful insertion, I spent a month cramping and bleeding (lightly, but still bleeding) and had it removed.  I have never had breast tenderness or cramping with my periods and now, two months later, I am still having severe breast pain and cramping, plus I have broken out in severe acne and gained weight, and for the month I had the device, I had chapped lips which began to go away the very day I had it removed. I have never had so much pain and would have cramps that would cause me to double over. It may be for some, but not for me!  I wish I had read the reviews for this thing first, before I spent over $900 for the insertion and the removal and wasted a month of my time.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	10/27/2008 12:31:57 AM	I am neither for or against this product. I'm going on my 10th month after insertion. I am 29 &amp; have 3 kids. Pros: Painless insertion, no more heavy periods, and of course very effective as birth control. Cons: constant spotting, light bleeding everytime after sex, tiredness, weight gain, unusual vaginal odor, and frequent cramping. I will probably be removing this device after much consideration and will be seeking a more permanent birth control procedure. Since every person is different my side effects may not necessarily afflict anybody else. Good luck to all. 
Birth Control	mom of 2 boys, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/26/2008 9:03:23 PM	After the birth of my second son, I needed a birth control that was semi-permenent, but was reversible. I choose Mirena, after researching other types of birthcontrol. It has been the perfect birthcontrol for me so far. I had it inserted on Thursday Oct. 23, 2008. I had a small amount of cramping during the procedure, but nothing too bad. I had just started my period the day before, so I was bleeding heavily. After the procedure my bleeding all but stopped. I did not have any cramping after the procedure. So far every thing as been wonderful. I am prone to get migrane headaches and so far no headaches, just some loss of appitate, but that is ok since I have not lost all the baby weight yet. I hope this review helps somebody. Everyone is different and reacts to medications differently.
Birth Control	metacognition, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	10/25/2008 4:16:18 AM	This IUD is great! It was put in two days ago. I am 22 and have never had kids. The insertion was very uncomfortable with serious cramping but not painful. The cramps remained for about a day, then a day of &quot;tenderness&quot; and now I almost feel nothing, plus my period has stopped. I can run, jump, lean over and bend without feeling it. And I've got 99.9% birth control protection! Take that, nature!I will have to wait six months to see if there are any side effects but the Mirena has been excellent so far! Ignore all of those negative rants on the internet - people blame anything on this little IUD and some birth control is not for everyone. If you experience major symptoms in the first six months you can always have it taken out. Also those horror stories about insertion seem to be rare or exaggerated - I was kind of nervous based on what I've read but everything worked out fine for me and I did not take ANYTHING beforehand or receive anything to numb the cervix. Give it a try and see what you think (especially if you get insurance coverage like me - I paid $40 for birth control a year LOL! I am ecstatic to have this IUD. I will update it in a few months if I get any side effects. Since I already have serious PMS that results in acne, depression, bloating, and half of the symptoms that 5% of Mirena users experience, I figure that this IUD could not actually make things much worse and might even improve them if it stops my period like in 20% of users. We'll have to wait and see!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	10/24/2008 12:29:36 AM	I am 20 years old. Have no children and currently no desire to have any. My primary care dr and I discussed the risks of Mirena and I had been thinking about getting it for 6 months. I have a heart condition that is genetic and am scared to death of giving birth so I would really like to adopt when I am older. i have been on depo for 3 years and i'm currently not sexually active. Also my insurance is up at the end of Nov of this year so mirena seemed to be an excellent solution. So my gyno said he thought I had made a good choice and we scheduled it. I had it put in monday 10/20/08 it took 30 minutes. I nearly passed out during the procedure. had severe cramping, i wanted to die. the pain is now worse. i was taking 800mg ibuprofen every 6 hrs, i am now on lortab every 4. I am so swollen i cannot even check for the string. Pay attention when they say Mirena is NOT for everyone and make sure you are well informed before making the decision to get it. I am going in tomorrow to have it checked and most likely removed. I cannot even stand for five minutes without hunching over in pain. May be good for some, but not for me!

I got my first one removed in october (after 4 yrs and 11 months). I love the fact that my period are very light,i Don't like the headaches. The first time i had it inserted i was 16 or 17, my doc resisted told me to w/depo. She told me i was too young didn't have kids. I insisted on having it placed, the procedure took about 15 mins, i had light cramping and spotting. having it removed took about 5 mins no pain. In april i had it reinserted very different experience. I switched providers and the process took about 45 min she couldn't get it in, she stated that it was cuz i hadn't given birth. I explained that i had it before with out any problems. After it was inserted everything is okay.. Very pleased with results  
Birth Control	AC in Illinois, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	10/20/2008 2:33:06 PM	29yr old Mother of two (5yr&amp;4mth old)I got the Mirena put in October 16,2008... I was on my cycle ....OH my the insertion of the Mirena  VERY PAINFUL..it takes about 10 to 15 min to get it in but it hurts I had cramping and discomforting pain only during the procedure but after I was fine, I felt gross due to being on my cycle as requested by my doctor. I took a 600mg ibprofen after but thats it.. I did have a little itching after and still now (nothing major)  my cycle lasted two days longer but everything is fine no cramping,back pain etc.. I actually feel better then before I have a burst of energy as if my hormones has changed(maybe its just me)but even my fiancee thinks my attitude has changed since Mirena and I really feel different like two days after I got it, so far I read all the reviews and the majority on here where negative but I made the decision to try it for myself each women is indeed different and I didnt have alot of the problems that some of these women had after insertion only time will tell but so far so good. I will keep you posted if anything changes I LIKE MY DECISION I feel like it was worth the pain 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	10/20/2008 2:19:50 PM	I got the Mirena 6 wks after having my last baby. The insertion was uncomfortable and I cramped for the rest of the day but by the next morning the cramping was gone and I started light bleeding which lasted for 3 months. The bleeding was more of a nusance than a problem in any way. My husband could also feel the strings so my doctor cut the strings shorter. She said that she has  only had to do this for one other person.  I had it in for 3 years and I love the fact that the whole time I didn't have to worry about any birth control. I am not the best at remembering pills so this was great. And did I mention 3 years of no worries!!! When we decided to get pregnant again I went in to take it out and they weren't able to do it in the office and because of the strings being short. I ended up having to go to &quot;surgery&quot; just so they could put me out and look a little harder without me feeling any pain. (Don't worry. there wasn't any actual cutting or anything.) I would actually prefer we had gone straight to this method because it was completely painless and I got to take a little nap with it.  Although the insertion and removal were uncomfortable I will definitely do it again. The benefits way out number the negatives.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	10/16/2008 11:04:30 AM	I had the Mirena removed yesterday.  I had it for a little over a year and am SO glad to have it out of me!  The insertion was a breeze but the side effects were a killer.  My husband could FEEL the string for the first 2 or 3 months, talk about a buzz kill.  He said it felt like barbed-wire.  My normal very high sex drive took a nose dive...had hardly no interest.  Then started the odor from &quot;down below&quot;....but only after sex.  Never in my life had I EVER had an &quot;odor&quot; issue.  It was horrible...after tests for infections and so on my Dr chalked it up to &quot;hormonal&quot; chages deep with in.  The only thing I could relate it to was the IUD.  Needless to say I cant wait for my body to retun to normal.  I've gained about 10 pounds on it and feel lucky to have any hair left!  It falls out constantly!  The great side of the IUD was no periods...I did have frequent spotting but no cramps or anything like that.  My husband and I will be TTC in the next few months and after that he's getting snipped so I will just go back to BC pills to help with my cycle.    
Birth Control	amhoult, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	10/15/2008 6:54:47 PM	I've been using Mirena for 3 years, 5 months now and it has more positives for me than negatives.  I have two children and don't plan on having any more.  Periods have always been UNBEARABLE for me and often left me doubled over in pain.  No need to worry about forgetting to take a pill with Mirena, little to no periods and it's good for five years.  Can't get much better than that!  The biggest complaint I've had after being on it for three years is increased discharge or vaginal fluid/moisture, especially upon getting up in the morning.  Feels like I'm wetting my pants!  The only other (minor) complaint is that what little periods I have (actually for me periods=spotting) is unpredictable.  For the most part, periods have almost stopped completely since the second year of use.  All in all Mirena is my #1 choice and I HIGHLY recommend it for all women!!!
Birth Control	mama08, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	10/14/2008 7:46:15 PM	I had my IUD put in 6wks after the birth of my 3rd child. It did not hurt. I had spotting for 3 months after. But since the bleeding stoped I had some cramps.After intcrose They became so bad I had to go the ER. The IUD had become upside down and side ways. It was painful to move.Once it was put back in place. All pain stoped. I love the bc methode. But I do not want to go throught that again!!
Birth Control	me, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	10/12/2008 3:27:41 PM	I am 35 and the mother of a 5 yr. old.  After having my daughter, I started using the patch, since I was breastfeeding, I could not take the pill.  After finding out about all the problems associated with the patch, I went back on the pill within a year.  My doctor advised me at my last visit that since I am a smoker and have reached the age of 35, they will no longer give me the pill because it will increase my chances of having a stroke.  Mirena is what they suggested and after asking a million questions, the doctor convinced me this was the way to go.  When asked if there was any pain associated with the insertion, I was told I would feel some cramping.  Exactly 2 weeks ago, I had the Mirena inserted and 'some cramping' was putting it mildly!  I would have at least appreciated being told that the level of pain varies by person, I think I would've been more prepared.  The insertion went fine, only took about 10 minutes, but afterward, I felt faint and nauseous and had to wait a while before leaving the office.  It subsided after a couple of hours and was just normal cramping after that, for a few days.  I have been bleeding lightly since and it has been 2 weeks.  Just yesterday, I had a dizzy spell and felt very nauseous last night before bed.  I didn't think anything of it until I read most of these reviews, now I'm wondering if it's related to the Mirena.  I will see how things go in upcoming weeks, I am certainly not willing to deal with a 4 month long cycle or bleeding heavily after sex with my husband.  I never had a problem remembering to take my pill, so unfortunately for me, this was the only way to go unless I quit smoking.  I am not totally against it, to each his own, definitely give it a chance if you have a hard time remembering to take your pill, but be prepared and do your research.  I'm surprised I even tried this, the thought of anything foreign in my body creeps me out, I wouldn't be surprised if my body rejects it.
Birth Control	mommy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	10/9/2008 9:15:28 AM	AWFUL PRODUCT.  IM AM BLEEDING SO HEAVILY AFTER HAVING IT PUT IN.  I AM BREASTFEEDING BY BABY EXCLUSIVLY THAT IS ONLY 9 WEEKS OLD AND HAVING BEEN BLEEDING FOR 3 WEEKS STRAIGHT AFTER THEY PUT IT IN.  I SHOULD NOT BE HAVING PERIODS LIKE THIS DUE TO BREASTFEEDING.  CAUSES HEADACHES AND CRAMPING.  I HATE THIS PRODUCT.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT.
Birth Control	j-bean, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	25-34	10/8/2008 1:12:01 AM	I was not prepared for the pain of having it inserted, yikes!  I was on the depo for 7 yrs, and needed to get off in case of bone density issues, none of which my doctor ever mentioned could even be a concern to me!!  Thanks for that, Doc!!  Side Effect-I have been getting very strange acne on my forhead, not zits but more like a semi-permenant acne rash, plus my head has been getting severe acne, which infects my hair follicles and scalp condition.  I havne't had my period for many years except for one miserable week switching bc methods.  My main concern and I read the entire blog to find out about this.  I have a problem worring about the IUD coming out.  My cervix moves around(in depth) and sometimes the &quot;string&quot; (really a sharp plastic pokey, that no one actually descibes)sticks out farther than at other times.  This constant checking and worrying makes me extremely paranoid.  I already have depression and am overwieght (my whole life) and had a decreased sex drive since the Depo 7 yrs earlier.  I hope the side effects will clear up in time, you DO have to get used to new meds,(I should know, I take Tons!)  It may be worth trying, I would recommed try, but be warned.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	10/4/2008 4:48:06 PM	My experience with this was horrible. I had it only for a week and I bled all over the place. My doc was upset because it was a waste of money to him. I developed huge blood clots and no matter how many times i changed my pad or tampon 5 minutes later it was full. I passed out at work because i would so weak. I am very disappointed in this treatment. I would not recommend it to anybody.

I don't have a period anymore and I don't have to worry about taking a pill everyday or having anymore babies right now. My husband loves it, he says he doesn't feel anything. 
Birth Control	jsmith0621, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/4/2008 2:37:24 AM	I became pregnant before my third child was even 1 yr. Then I miscarried. I didn't want to have to go through with that again since I was nearing my 40th birthday. After talking with my doctor about my options I had the Mirena inserted. It has been one of the best decisions that I have ever made. Yes, there was a little pinch when inserting but nothing more. And, no more periods. I will be having my doctor remove and reinsert a new one this month.   
Birth Control		5	5	4			10/3/2008 12:11:48 AM	I'm 25, mother of one. I had the mirena inserted at my 6 wk check-up in May. My doc told me I'd feel 3 cramps.. felt 2 but nothing worse than a regular period style cramp. Spotting for a couple months on and off.. rarely needed a liner for it even. Have had 2 three day periods so far. My husband doesn't feel it or the strings and I don't feel it. I love not having to take any birth control. Sex drive is very high. Works wonders. I breastfed my little girl for the first 5 months. No cramping in many months.However.. I've had lightheadedness the past couple months. I've also gained a good 20 lbs. I moved after her birth and just seen a new doc about both of these factors. She knows I'm on mirena and never mentioned these could be related to that so it's interesting others mentioned these. I will ask her at my next appt in a couple weeks. She did different tests to check out what could cause those and all came back normal.. so very interesting to me now!
Birth Control	littlemama, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/1/2008 7:29:44 PM	When i first got Mirena put in it was a little uncomfortable but that goes away as soon as they are done and then you don't even feel it. i got it put in on my period so the cramping was normal nothing you cant handle after having a baby. But i did have a long period for about 2 months of light bleeding but after that was done not even as much as spotting. its been a little over a year now and still no periods and no side affects, and most important, no unplanned pregnancies. i love it and would recommend Mirena to every one out there that is wanting to wait for a while for more kids.   
Birth Control	runningrn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/28/2008 4:34:01 AM	This is the second Mirena IUD I have had and I am 25. The first one I had taken out after two years due to unrelated problems.  This time I had it put in in April due to a period that went for 25 days.  The first insertion at 19 and no births, was awful and I cramped for 24 hours.  This time it was nothing.  My period is now gone, not even spotting.  The only problem this time is I am shedding a lot of hair.  I have thich hair, so I don't have bald spots.  This didn't happen the first time.  I would rather have thinner easier to fix hair.

I actually have had no mensus since insertion and forget I even have it. My husband doesn't feel a thing and I can testify it is effective.  I have 2 more years and plan on another insertion of mirena which upon initial insertion really did not hurt. Thank you makers of Mirena.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	9/24/2008 4:09:10 PM	I agree with others that have suggested to not take so much of the negative feedback on this site into consideration before you get Mirena.  I looked at some of the comments, got a little concerned but kept my appointment and I am certainly glad I did.  I am 43 and have no kids, didn't want estrogen and this was a great option for me.  It was a little uncomfortable to get but I kept thinking of how convenient it was and how much I was looking forward to less/lighter periods.  I did experience a little discomfort for a couple days - then a couple days of spotting but now 10 days after I am feeling great.  I highly recommend this if it is an option for you with your doctor - it is worth it for me so far!
Birth Control	ttfn7381, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	9/23/2008 9:23:57 PM	I got the Mirena put in 9/10, doc told me I had to put it in during my period to ensure I wasn't pregnant. The procedure was ok to handle I had two kids w/o and drugs. I was still having boold clots at day 10, finally it subsided. But having intercourse with my husband or having a bowel movement aggravates it. I hope this will subside as my doc assures me. She highly reccommended it. I cramp occasionally, but it doesn't bother me. I've had two kids with no drugs! I got the Mirena cause of the risks other other forms of b/c and I can't remember the pill. I don't want my husband to get fixed, I'm still trying to convince him to have more kids. I'm anxious to find out the long term and hope this side effect dissappears and no others occur.

Starting out it was great.  Bled some, not terribly bad.  Insertion was a breeze and I really believed this was heaven sent. Now a year later I'm questioning the length of time this product has been tested and feel that Bayer has not tested the product for a sufficient length of time to report the effects to providers and patients for long term use (past the 3 to 6 months they stress abnormal bleeding).  Not only was there not enough information out there when I researched this form of birth control but now there seems to be more negative than positive and you really have to question that. I have to agree with alot of the women that the side effects are pretty tormenting. The side effects should really be looked into before making the decision to use Mirena.  If you do choose this form of birth control I wish you the best.

I am one of those people! I am 28 and have two children. I have had my IUD for 9 months. For the first 3 months I bled everyday...from then on my periods have been eratic but light. I thought I wan losing my mind when I woke to a face and upper back full of acne- something I have never had before. I have totally lost my sex drive like many other women. FOr me insertion was not bad but I am looking forward to having this thing removed. I tis just not worth the side effects....
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	9/20/2008 5:47:24 PM	I had it put in Monday afternoon, it is now Saturday. It was extremely painful, I was told because I've never given birth. I had cramps for the first 3 days that were like a period, very little bleeding though. I have since experienced some abdominal pain the last 2 days. Going to give it some time but if it continues I will have it out and get my tubes tied instead. I did this so I could have more sex with my boyfriend, not less because I'm uncomfortable!

Birth Control	PcLvNHapines, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/20/2008 12:01:36 PM	I am a 22 year-old mother of one. I had Mirena put in about a week ago. There was hardly any pain in the procedure, but I did have some slight cramping and light spotting for 2 days afterward. I did not even need to take Tylenol. I feel great now, and my hubby and I have already had sex and he can't feel it in there at all, so that's a plus. I had tried Nuvaring before and had some bad side effects. I don't plan on having another child for a couple of years at least, and I can't remember to take a pill so this method is VERY easy to use!
Birth Control	AllGood, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	9/15/2008 3:04:11 PM	Severe depression, mood-swings for this patient with a previous dx of bipolar II. I'm getting it removed on Wed b/c even the small amount of hormone triggers mood-swings and suicidal depression (I attempted suicide and Mirena is but one contributing factor) 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	9/14/2008 6:58:01 PM	I am 26 and had this put in a month ago.  I exercise regurlary, count my calorie and carb intake.  Dont use sugar and salt to an excess.  My weight has not fluctuated since the birth of my second child, almost 4 years ago.  However, I have already gained 10 pounds, reducing my carbs and calorie intake would not be healthy (going under 1200 a day) and to work out daily for two hours is enough.   In addition, I have severe pain and swelling in my legs as if I was going to burst with pressure.  I have commented this to my doctor and he said first, Mirena doesnt have those side effects.  I was appalled, not only did he lie straight to my face, but his nurses advised the same.  I cannot believe this. MIRENA discloses this type of side effects on the pamphlets and internet site.  How disgusted I am to know medical practitioners mask pharmaceutical companies.  I never used any type of contraception since I dont like any type of medication or hormones.....Nevertheless, I hate this experience, the pain upon insertion, severe cramping, mood swings, headaches, weight gain that is not just water retention (is what doc and nurses concluded I was suffering from)  I WOULDNT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL.  MEN YOU NEED TO GET a vasectomy done!!!!! we deal with enough JUNK!  THis is coming out next friday...i am NOT submitting my body to this junk.

My husband could feel the string at first but that resolved itself.  I stopped gettting my period in April.  Before that it lasted for about 10 days.  No increaded acne, I have lost 10 lbs, and i enjoy sex more because no risk of pregnancy.  The only thing I have noticed is i am tired but the 3 kids might have something to do with that.  If you have a child already it tends to be easier because your cervix has been stretched out already.  Also if you are predisposed to the side effects it causes it would be a good idea to stay away.  I am very happy with the Mirena and so is my husband.  I would recommend to try it but if it is not for you , you can always change your mind.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	9/11/2008 12:47:38 PM	I had Mirena inserted about a week ago. I've been on various forms of birth control since I was 15 to control ovarian cysts and heavy menstruation and cramping. I started having migraines with vision changes with the combination pill and was told that I couldn't be on that anymore due to risk of stroke. After talking with my doctor we decided that the Mirena IUC would be the best option for me. If I had read these reviews beforehand I never would have gone. The pain was close to being the worst thing I have ever experienced. Like many here I was told it would be &quot;uncomfortable&quot; and that I should take some ibuprofen before having it done. As far as I can tell the ibprofen did absolutely nothing to help with the pain. I am 24 and have never had children but my doctor had assured me that it would be fine. I cried and moaned and did my best to keep from outright screaming during the procedure. Several times I almost had them stop and give up on the whole thing. It took nearly 20 minutes and she had to call a nurse in to help because she couldn't get my cervix open and then she couldn't get the IUC to go in. I ended up laying in the exam room for almost an hour afterward until the pain went away enough for me to move. I bled a lot (soaked through 2 maxi pads that afternoon) and had very severe cramping for 2 days. It has been a week now and I am still having mild cramping and steady spotting. I'm willing to give it more time because this is basically my last option, but so far I'm not terribly impressed, and I will probably not have another one put in again ever.

I had cramping for the first 2 days but now none at all. I had some light bleed for about 2 weeks but that has now subsided too. I am very happy with it. I also had my first period and it was very light normally it is very heavy so I was thrilled about that!

Having the IU has also caused me to have an ovarian cyst which is not serious at this time.  Otherwise, my husband and I have not had to worry about having another child until we are ready.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/10/2008 2:10:46 PM	So far so good!  I had been on the pill forever, and after having two children, and at 44, I wanted something that I didn't have to think about all of the time.  I would forget to take my pill sometimes for 3 days in a row!  It is quite painful to get inserted, like a giant cramp or contraction and lots of pressure-but it was over relatively quickly.  My period was fine, but lasted about 3 days longer than usual.   My body seems to be happier with it-my sex drive has increased-things feel more sensitive now.  Go back in October for a check up.  My husband has not been bothered with the string, and actually thinks it's great because it has taken a worry off of our shoulders.  Hope it continues to be a positive experience!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	9/10/2008 1:01:12 PM	No one, not even my doctor, prepared me for how painful the insertion would be.  I literally cried out loud in pain.  It was a quick procedure but the strings got caught and my doctor accidentally removed it...so I had to do the whole entire procedure again.  But that wasn't anyone's fault I guess.  The pain so severe, however that I felt lightheaded for the next few hours and had to go home early from work.  Pain relievers did not work at all.It has been two weeks without any pain and now all of a sudden, I am having severe cramps and feeling light headed again.  I have a follow up appt with my doctor next week so we shall see.Besides the initial pain, it seems to be working well.  I am rather moody but I kind of expected that.
Birth Control	k9dawg, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/9/2008 10:56:40 PM	I have had mine in for 3 1//2 years. I've enjoyed not having to take a pill everyday or worry about getting pregnant.  However, for the first 6 months, I bled everyday. After that, I've had very few periods at all.  I've become prone to get bacterial vaginosis (bacteria in vagina that causes that fishy smell) more often, especially after I have a period.  I'm also moodier than I was ever before.  So..this treatment has its ups and its downs.  For me, I've decided not to have anymore children, so when my 5 years is up, I will be looking for a more permanant fix.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/9/2008 1:06:29 AM	This is the second time that I've had the Mirena IU. The first time was after the birth of my first child (7 yrs ago), and the second after the birth of my second child (2 1/2 yrs ago). I had no problems getting pregnant again after the removal of the first one. Both times I experienced few problems, although I wish I had known that decreased libido was a possible side-effect. Not sure that that cannot be attributed to other causes (screaming baby at inopportune times for example). I would certainly recommend this product to friends, although if they experienced any of the nastier side effects I would definitely recommend that they try something different ASAP because it does seem like there is a significant portion of the population for whom this  product does more harm than good.

Birth Control	easybreezy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/2/2008 10:05:48 AM	I looked to this website of ratings to get an idea of how people felt about Mirena.  I agree that the majority of the reviews are the negative. This teriffied me and I almost didn't go.  I started praying about the situtation and reminded myself that everyone is different.  So far, I have had not problems.  I had the procedure on 8/29.  I had mild cramping for a few days and that was it.  No other side effects. I will revisit my doctor in six weeks.  I will provide an update at that point. It is worth it to give it a try.  You can have it removed if you don't like it.  See you in six weeks :)
Birth Control	aj, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/31/2008 2:40:22 PM	EVERY WOMAN IS DIFFERENT! It seems like the majority of postings on here are negative. If you are looking on here to try to help you decide whether or not to use Mirena, you may get scared away- I almost did! I decided to get the Mirena and am thrilled that I did! I was in and out of the doctors office in 10 minutes! It was quick and easy. I only had light bleeding/spotting for 2 days after insertion. Other than that, I've had no other side effects! The best part for me is that I don't have to remember to take the &quot;pill&quot; anymore!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/28/2008 11:27:22 PM	I can't believe the side effects many reviewers are trying to pin on this IUD. Many, many Rx drugs cause hair loss, anti-depressants are one of the main ones. Adult acne in women of child-bearing age is extremely common, and is usually worse after childbirth. Weight gain can be attributed to so many other things, especially when caring for small children. I highly doubt all the side effects listed here are due to an IUD. I used the Mirena for all 5 years, never had a period, and it worked great. Many of these symptoms have come and gone over the years, but can easily be attributed to other conditions or medications. I had it removed just this week, and after hopefully having one more child I will have another put in. Removal was difficult due to the strings being cut way too short, but that was not the fault of the Mirena. Insertion was a breeze, but I have a high pain tolerance. I would recommend this to anyone who wants easy, reliable birth control.

Birth Control	susan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	8/27/2008 5:54:29 PM	I have had this in since July 2006.  I had extremely heavy period that would last literally months at a time.  The only time my period ever gets like that is when I am on birth control.  Anyway, I have had bad headaches and never really put it together until i started doing some research on this thing.  Turns out that my sinus problems and chronic tiredness could be linked to the IUD.  While I was on the pill, at one point I felt like I was having a stroke.  I have been feeling the same kind of symptoms for the last year or so.  I still have a period every month.  I'm only 26 and in pretty good health.  I have had three children.  I have been fighting the urge to get this thing taken out for over a year, and everything on the web seems to solidify my theories.  I am going to get it taken out as soon as I can.
Birth Control	worried in michigan!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	8/27/2008 12:10:34 PM	I am 30 years old and I had the Mirena putin Aug. 25, 2008.  It was extremely painful!!  I have been suffering from excrutiating back pain ever since my doctor put this in.  I am also scared to death to have sex, I am afraid something bad will happen, after reading the pamphlet that the doctor gave me.  I am also scared that my husband will feel the string and not be aroused by sex with me anymore.
Birth Control	Lydia, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/25/2008 4:44:37 PM	I may be on the brink of menopause anyway, but after I got my Mirena, my periods stopped completely which has been nice after many years of heavy bleeding.  I have had no other side-effects.  I previously had a Paragard for 13 years and was also very happy with it, except for the heavy periods.

I got my periods regularly until April 2008 and then they went away completely. I still experience a mild cramping when I would normally get my period, and also the mood swings. My doctor prepared me for up to 8 months of discharge and random bleeding, however there was a point that it concerned me so I got checked out. Other than that, I have loved this product. I am NOT a pill taker, and even the Nuva ring was difficult for me. I love having this, the minor cramping and discomfort felt for the first months do not surpass the freedom you get from this product. I have better sex with my man, and better yet, its not permanent birth control so we can have another baby when we are ready.

Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	8/24/2008 4:13:01 PM	I just had Mirena inserted 2 days ago.  I am 35 years old and have never been pregnant.  I had been on the pill since since I was 17 years old with no problems but wanted something with no upkeep (no pill to take daily, no refills).  I was on my period for the procedure and it was EXTREMELY painful.   Was not just slightly more uncomfortable than a pap as my doctor told me it it would be.  Measuring my uterus was the most painful part and had to be done twice.  Also, the instrument used to open my cervix nicked a blood vessel and it took almost 10 minutes of swabbing with a clotting agent to get the bleeding to stop.  This definately contributed to my pain for the rest of the day.  The day of the procedure I experienced intermitten strong cramping as well as the pain from my cervix.  The next day I had a constant cramping which also caused pretty severe back pain, but very little bleeding.   This is my third day and the cramping and back pain has decreased significantly but there is more bleeding.   I think reading the comments here helped me prepare mentally for the procedure because I was not surprised by any of it.  Time will tell if I end up having worse side effects, but so far it hasn't been too bad.  I suggest having it done on a Friday so that you have the weekend to rest and recover.  I have just been taking 800 mg of ibuprofen every 4 hours for the pain but definately would have liked something stronger the first 2 days.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	8/23/2008 6:53:43 AM	After reading other reviews I am starting to wonder if my acne, fatigue, and increased depression are a result of this too?  I have had this in for about 6 months now.  It has been effective, and although painful the insertion was very quick for me.  Oh, and my sex drive has also declined though I should say that I am not sure if these side affects are from having just had a second child 9 months ago or what.  I don't want any more children so I may ask my husband to have a vasectomy and then have it removed to see.  Though I have always suffered with depression somewhat, for the first time in my life I am seriously considering antidepressants.  Oh, and I too am experiencing difficulty loosing weight

It was very light but very crampy. I do have mood swings but my sex drive is higher then ever!
Birth Control	Whitney06, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	8/20/2008 5:37:28 PM	I am 20 years old and i had the mirena put in 8 weeks after i had my son. my doctor talked very highly about it and i'm terrible at remembering to take the pill, so i thought i'd give the mirena a try. insertion was quick but uncomfortable.. i was pretty crampy afterwards but by the next day i couldn't even tell it was there. i got my period about a week afterwards and unfortunately it lasted 40 long days. its been 4 months since that and i haven't had  a period since. i haven't noticed any side effects inparticularly.. but after reading other reviews i'm beginning to wonder if my loss of sex drive is because of the mirena? i guess i won't know until i get it taken out.. and since i haven't had any major health problems i will most likely keep it in until i decide to have another child. i'd say overall my experience has been pretty good =)
Birth Control	jodi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	8/20/2008 4:33:41 PM	I've had Mirena for about a month now and have been bleeding pretty heavy ever since.(definately not just spotting) After intercourse I bleed even heavier for at least 5 days after and it makes me not want to have sex anymore. Usually the bleeding would increase shortly after, but last time it started gushing during and my husband got scared and stopped. It seems to be getting worse and worse. I haven't noticed any other side effects, but the bleeding is getting so old. I wanted to wait it out, but am not sure I can much longer unless it stops. I am so frustrated because I loved the idea of being off the pill. I've always had pretty heavy periods but this is far worse. I am so disappointed.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	19-24	8/19/2008 3:23:57 PM	I had Mirena inserted 6 weeks ago and it came out today, I like many other women started having side effects which included: chest pain, numbeness in my arms and legs, tired all the time, can't sleep at night, nausea. I really hope I start to feel better soon now that is gone.

Did not like the procedure, doctor had a difficult time inserting it (I have children) it was very painful and should not have been (I had to be numbed). I have been bleeding since (not spotting), headaches, nauseated, moody and extremely tired since a couple days after it was inserted. I am trying to be patient, but...if the side effects continue- out it will come! Good luck to anyone considering it.
Birth Control	FelixandSarah, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	8/16/2008 2:23:27 PM	I had it inserted June 30.  No problem.  No bleeding until July 25, and I thought it was a regular period.  But I'm still bleeding 3 weeks later.  HOWEVER I am not upset because reading their patient literature prepared me for bleeding for 3 - 6 months.  I'm giving it time.  That is the one and only side effect so far.  Skin is fine, I am LOSING weight because I am dieting and it's working, sex drive is in overdrive because we're just so releived that we're not going to get pregnant, can't feel it in me but I can locate the strings easily, no mood swings, regular headaches like I had before (nothing weird).  Everyone is different.  I am watching my body closely but I'm going to see if I can wait out this bleeding.  It's light to moderate and bright red. I am hoping for good results.  Everyone is different.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	8/13/2008 12:29:51 PM	I tried this a few years ago when I was 36 and since I haven't had children it hurt very badly having it put in.  It seemed to make me cramp and bleed and hurt a little during sex.  I didn't have it long before I asked to have it removed.  Having it removed is painless.  I'm at a loss for what method to use now because I was on the pill for many years with no problems and then I hit 35 and the migraines and water retention and anger issues started.  That's why I went to this, but I didn't like it either.  Too much cramping.
Birth Control	darkogirl610, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	8/12/2008 9:35:56 PM	I had mirena inserted 2 months ago and I really like it.  The initial insertion was painful because I have not had any children.   I also almost fainted in the doctor's office within 5 minutes of it being inserted (a little known potential side effect).  Other than that first day everything has been great! I have not had a period since I had it put in and my husband doesn't feel it at all.  I was previously on the ring which has estrogen and since being off of that my blood pressure has gone from 140/80 (borderline high) to 119/69.  When I asked my midwife about it, she said that some women react poorly to estrogen and that removing it is the reason for the blood pressure drop.  I would recommend this birth conrol!

I had it removed less than 3 weeks ago and feel like I did before I had used the Mirena. I felt better within 2 days but it did take 4 visits to the OBGYN to get it removed. I had to call in very emotionally distraught and at wits end to get it done. The OB also doesn't feel that my complaints were from the Mirena even though I had done nothing differently to add the issues to my body. It did not hurt to have it inserted or removed, but I have also given birth 2 times. Good Luck to all!
Birth Control	ready for a change, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	8/7/2008 3:09:52 PM	I have had mirena for about a year now, and i have had almost all the side affects that most people are complaining about (acne, unsteady weight gain and loss, mood swings, tiredness, hair thinning in certian spots, long periods, and cramping, depression, loss of sexual drive dry skin, and every time i have sex, i spot) and plus when i got it put in, i cramped really badly and blead for 2 months straight. Yes i agree that the side affects sucks, but the pill that i was using at the time (ortho-tri-cyclen) was doing the same thing to me, the pros of the pill was that i had less bleeding on my period, and the cons was i had to take a pill every day and i was a little more depressed. After thinking hard on what choice to make (get it taken out or keep it in) i felt as if it(Mirena) was doing its job.  Every one situation is not like mines, I did not want to have any more children bc i wanted to achieve my personal goals in life by graduating college first and get married before i had any more, plus Mirena was easier. I know the pros are limited to NO PREGNACY, compared to the cons of many different side affects. I felt as if i can handle that for a short period of time if the rewards are greater in the end. And plus i had to understand that ALL medication have some sort of sideaffects that could cause death. But when i do decide to take it out in december of 2009, i am gonna get me some proactive and clear my skin (even though my skin was not that bad) and hopefully i wll go back to normal for the other side affects. I would recommend Mirena to any one.... who is over 21, who is a high achiever, wants to have sex and dont want any more unexpected pregnacies.

I have no complaints about this form of b/c.  I always had trouble remembering to take the pill and as a mother of an 18 month old, neither my husband or I were ready for another.  This seemed like a logical choice, and not permanent.  There was some pain during insertion, just like a bad cramp.  It was over before i knew it.  I did have bleeding for about 3 weeks after insertion, but for the next 5 months my periods got lighter and lighter.  This month, only spotting.  I have no problems with cramps, irritability, weight gain, or loss of sex drive.  My husband does not even know it's there.  Mirena is very convienent and I would definetly recommend it to others! 
Birth Control	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/6/2008 1:44:16 PM	It has been an absolute nightmare!  I had it put in June 3, 2008 and it came out yesterday, August 5, 2008.  Severe pain, ovarian cist, back pain, nausea, dizziness, anxiety and two trips to the ER in one week because of pain and nasuea.  Every test came out fine. (X-ray, CT scan, blood work &amp; urine).  Not ONE doctor suggested I remove the IUD knowing it was there.  It was finally my insittence to have it removed and the doctor finally agreed.  Wouldn't wish it on anyone!

I just had it removed today! I loved it for the most part. It was easy and something you dont have to remember and rarely had my period. The only down fall I had with it was bad depression, mood swings, and I lost my sex drive almost completly. Getting it inserted there was little cramping but nothing compared to child birth and getting it removed and quick and simple. I'd recommend it to friends. It just affects different people different ways.
Birth Control	mom4life, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	8/4/2008 9:32:55 PM	The Mirena seems to be good but I only had it implanted 1 1/2 months ago.  I do have some cramping and bloating for sure, and it may just be my eating habits but I have gaineda little weight.  Also, my face, neck, and chest are a mess!  Acne has NEVER been a problem for me but it is now and it seems like it is ever since I had the Mirena implanted.  Has anyone else experienced any of these issues?

I love this little thing no bleeding, no cramps, no clots, just great! I have never had any of the side effects and my sex drive is just as high as before. I've recommended it to all my friend, some have even gotten it and had no problem either. Don't believe all you read everyone is differnet and it is worth a try. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/4/2008 4:23:00 PM	Just had this placed last Thursday.  So far, it has been excellent.  I haven't had any of the side effects that others have talked about.  I feel so much better knowing I am protected without having to use another form of birth control.  Having had twins 3 years ago, we are not wanting anymore for a while.  I am not ready for permanent birth control, so this is the option we chose.  I did have some cramping when it was being placed, but nothing I couldn't handle.  I drove myself home afterwards and had no issues except for a few minor cramps.  I did take Ibuprofen before the procedure and took some more after I got back home.  I hope I am still loving this a few years down the road.  So far so good!! I would recommend it to my friends!

Eczema, anxiety, frequent migraines, no libido, weight gain, acne, sinusitis, vertigo.  Was never warned of these effects despite all being listed in the physician's literature on Mirena.  Ask to see it- it's in black and white.  Post removal side effects or withdrawal are as bad or worse and there is no research on that so good luck getting treated.  I wouldn't wish Mirena on my worst enemy.

Birth Control	mimiliz, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/31/2008 11:35:29 AM	Glad it worked for previous reviewers, but I had horrible side effects- skin changes, weight gain (despite working out 2 hours a day) mood swings, depression, insomnia, joint pain and many others.  If it works for you, great, but for those of us it doesn't, it's truly a nightmare, and not just problems I blamed on the IUD.  The side-effects (including the weight, thank heavens) went away after removal. To those who think it's great, a warning however, I know women whose side effects didn't show up until many months or years later, until then they thought it was great.  Once the problems start, your body's a mess.  Hope this doesn't happen to you, I wouldn't wish this on anyone, even the know-it-all who thinks thinks the side effects aren't real.  
Birth Control	twinmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/31/2008 2:51:27 AM	OK - I read all this stuff before I had Mirena put in and an almost did not show for my appointment - I am 34 and have had 1 twin pregnancy (but never went into labor and my cervic never dialated)- for all of you who are seeking comfort read this --- I had the merina put in while I was on my period. Was it comfortable - no - was it the worst pain ever - not even by a long shot! I had a Kidney stone that mounted this easily - 2nd only to giving birth to twins by c-section. Any way- that was in April - GREAT news!! I have not had my period since! The first month I felt very PMS had some on and off cramping and I could have sworn i could feel it and I spotted on and off - but nothing a panty liner could not handle. But after that - have not had any issues - no mood changes, I cant feel it, no weight gain (in fact I lost 3 lbs) and my sex drive is the same... I would highly recommend this - if you are someone who is very sensative or gets wound up about stuff ( you know who you are) you could easily blame all the problems of the world on this tiny little device - if you're not stop reading these crazy sites and driving your self nuts!!!   
Birth Control	Cheri, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	7/30/2008 2:35:01 AM	I am 22 years old and have no children, but am married.  I have had the Mirena a month and a half.  Insertion was very painful, but that is probably because I have never had any children, but my Dr. didn't have to dialate my cervix.  I was dizzy afterwards, but I am dizzy after any kind of procedure I have ever had done.  I cramped a little and spotted a little for the first week and had a very light period this month.  I have only had to use a pad, which before my bleeding was so heavy, I had to use a super-plus tampon plus a pad at all times throughout my entire period, which usually lasted about 7-10 days.  My period now has lasted 9 days and I am still bleeding lightly.  Hopefully I will be done tomorrow.  The only complaint I have with the Mirena is I have been constipated and the cramps that are associated with that are unbearable.  I have been doing what I can to help that problem and what I am doing is working.  I was told of this side effect.  I have had stomach problems in the past, so I don't think it is because of the IUD.  I just went in and had it checked and my Dr. said everything is fine.  My husband cannot feel the strings.  I have not noticed any difference in my moods or my sex drive, but I have only had it in for a month and a half.  My Dr. told me to expect side effects for the first 3 months.  I am going to wait it out and see how this works.  I really want this to work because my husband and I do not plan on having children for about 5 years anyway.  I have not experienced hair loss, weight gain, or acne.  I am happy with this birth control, but I will repost in another month and a half and let you know how I am feeling.  I love not having to take a pill or change a patch or ring.  I love the freedom.  I am going to be patient and hopeful that the side effects do not worsen.  I would recommend this birth control method, but do research first and do NOT read the reviews of other women before you have it put in because EVERY WOMAN IS DIFFERENT!
Birth Control	CMLS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	4	Female	35-44	7/24/2008 5:09:26 PM	I am 39 and mother of a 6 and 3 year old girls. I had the Mirena inseted a week ago. Am experiencing light bleeding.  The insertion was NOT BAD at all. It only lasted a total of 10 minutes, start to finish.  Just took Advil prior.  Had mild cramping and still have very little back pain that Advil takes away.  I am just waiting to see when this bleeding will stop.  So far so good but some of these comments do scare me. I hope this works for me. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	7/19/2008 12:40:43 PM	I'M A 29 YEAR OLD MARRIED WOMEN.

I'V HAD THE MIRENA FOR 1 YR NOW. THE CRAMPING SUCKS NO BLEEDING YET MY HUSBAND CAN FEEL IT DURING SEX. I WANT A HYSTERECTOMY DONE BUT MY DOC SAYS TO YOUNG SHE TYE MY TUBS BUT I HAVE NO INSURANCE. ALL AROUND SO FAR ITS NOT TO BAD OTHER THAN THE CRAMPS. I'TS GREAT NOT HAVING TO WORRY FOR 5 YRS ABOUT GETTING A SHOT EVERY 90 DAYS. I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE MAKE THEIR DECISION IT'S A BIG ONE BUT IF YOUR SERIOUS ABOUT NOT HAVING CHILDREN RIGHT NOW IT'S A GOOD CHOICE.BUT ALSO REMEBER EVERYBODY HAS DIFFERENT REACTIONS TO METHODS.

I HAVE GRAVES DISEASE AND TAKE 3 PILLS A DAY AND HAVE'NT HAD ANY COMPLICATIONS WITH THE MIRENA. ANYWAYS GOOD LUCK ON YOUR DECISION.  
Birth Control		4	5	1			7/17/2008 2:06:29 PM	I gave the mirena a try on April 14th.  I was told since I've had a child the process would be the equivalent to a pap smear.  Needless to say, that was not the case.  A trip back, two valium, and two doctors later it was sucessfully inserted.  Apparently my cervix went back to prepregnancy form .. basically it's like I've never had a child.  Anyway, I immediately began to notice side effects.  I became extremely irritable, had abdominal pain, hair shedding (in handfuls), bloating, and zero sex drive.  The only good thing about the mirena is no menstrual cycle and spontaneous sex (no worries about condoms or pills).  On June 27th I had it removed and began to notice a difference right away.  Please do your research on this before deciding to use this as your method of birth control.  The side effects are just not worth it!
Birth Control	Mom of 3, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	7/16/2008 11:41:18 PM	I am a mother of 3,and chose to get Mirena due to a surprise pregnancy with my third(while on the pill).I've been on it for 4 months.The insertion of it was fine,cramping(but labor was worse).I got it inserted 2 months after my son was born and bleed for 2 months after that.I have severe headaches now,acne;which I've never had in my life!My sex life with my husband has gone way,way down hill and I gained 10 lbs easy!Yeah its great because you don't have to take a pill everyday,but it takes a toll on your body!
Birth Control	ursula, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Male	35-44	7/14/2008 11:29:30 AM	I was very hopeful about this method of b/c DESPITE some poor reviews.  Well, my hopes were dashed within first couple of weeks of insertion.  I managed to stick with this method just shy of 2 months. I spotted occassionaly for the first month; then no bleeding!  Which would be fantastic!  BUT, not worth the extreme breast sensitivity and horrible abdominal pressure I felt DAILY. I was examined for that discomfort and had developed ov cysts.  Treatment seem to fail, abdominal pressure persisted and weight gain ensued. The discomfort was something I could no longer live with...it was like having all symptoms (in a more extreme form) of mensturuation, without the bleeding.  
Birth Control	Debora, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	7/13/2008 11:16:07 PM	I had the Mirena put it 14 months ago 6 weeks after my 1st daughter was born. I only felt a small pressure during the insertion. My period was normal during the first 3 months. After the 10th month, my period was coming less and less. I have not had my period for 3 months now. No weight gain or acne. The only side effect for me is some nausceousnes and it has brought my sex drive down alot. This is the only reason I plan on removing it. Other than that, it has been doing its job. I do not have to remember on taking a pill or have a hard time to get pregnant again when we want. 
Birth Control	cbledawg, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/11/2008 2:40:50 PM	I have had this little torture device for nearly two years.  Since inserted my hair has been falling out in handfuls, I've got bad acne, my migraines have flaired up (2 a week as opposed to 1 every few months before), I've had a 2 year long sinus infection (yes this is one of the relatively unheard of side effects), absolutely no libido, serious moodswings, vertigo, I bleed for 5 days every 2 weeks, horrible cramps and about 5 ovarian cysts (one of which ruptured on me).  This thing is coming out ASAFP!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/10/2008 4:40:41 PM	I'm a 29 year old single mother of one. I was hessitant to use anything with hormones but after i had this placed i haven't had any moodswings, depression, or panic attacks. I love it! It was a bit painful but worth getting it. I suggest getting this. 
Birth Control	LillyMom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	7/9/2008 3:03:36 PM	I've only had the IUD in place for just over a week.  The insert was a bit painful, although uncomfortable is a more accurate description.  I cramped considerably for 2 days.  I am still spotting lightly, which will make this a 2 weeks of bleeding, so far.  However, I am usually quite sensitive to hormones.  Yet, I don't feel cranky or nauseous as I have on the pill.  As of now, I am quite happy I chose Mirena.
Birth Control	Lexysinger, 25-34 Female 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/7/2008 4:23:11 PM	I am 29 years old and a mother of one.  After having my son I was concerned about which birth control to take seeing as I was breast feeding.  My doctor recommended Mirena to me said it was low hormonal and would not harm my son.  I couldn't wait to have it put in.  I even told my husband, &quot;Don't touch me, till I have this put in.&quot; LOL.  During the insertion, there was a little discomfort but nothing worse than a bad cramp that lasted about 20 seconds.  Then I did cramp for the next day or two like I did during a normal period.  My period was like a normal period during the first 3 to 4 months but would come about twice in a month only lasting about 3 days.  The cramping would come and go during those few months even without any bleeding.  After the first 6 months my period went from every month to every other month and only lasting 2 days then becoming lighter and lighter.  I would still get cramps off and on every month without any bleeding but the cramps were not severe just annoying lasting only a day.  Now after 2 1/2 years with Mirena in I do have a period every month but it is only spotting lasting only about a day or two, which is GREAT!!!!!!  Oh, for the first 6 to 8 months my husband did feel the string but only occassionally, so I went back to the doctor and they snipped it another 1/2 inch.  After that he no longer could feel it. However, I was told by a different doctor that they snipped to much off and was hard to see curing a routine check up. I have not had any health problems that I recall. In fact, my face cleared up and I have had no problem losing any weight. I love mirena and when my 5 years is up if my husband and I aren't ready to have another child I will have another replacement.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	7/5/2008 1:39:01 PM	Painful insertion, severe cramps for 24 hours.  Also, something not many people have written about, but several of my friends agree...your sexual partner does feel the wires/strings and get poked.  Can make intercourse uncomfortable.  However, it is cost effective. I'm not sure if I will go back to using this after I'm done having children or not.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	7/3/2008 12:35:46 PM	Spotted for the first month. But overall it is great! I would definitely sugguest it.

I am getting it taken out finally thank god. But otherwise the insertion was painless and it is effective. I would say beware useing this, my life changed because of it!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	35-44	6/30/2008 11:27:39 PM	experiencing constant bleeding, dizziness, nerveousness.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/26/2008 6:22:40 PM	I'm 27, no children, and I got Mirena inserted today.  I was planning on getting Paragard, but my doctor said that with the copper IUD most women get heavier and longer periods that don't go away over time. I was nervous about hormones in my body never having been on the pill/patch/ring before (didn't want hormones hijacking my life), but since Mirena is localized and doesn't contain estrogen, I changed my mind.  Insertion was not pleasant (yeah, it hurt), since I've never given birth. Some cramping today, but I feel great! It's such a huge relief to have reliable birth control!  I did not know about the possible hair loss, weight gain and acne side effects; they worry me a bit. Im also concerned about my partner feeling the strings during intercourse. My doctor told me that he cut the strings long so they would curl and not poke my partner (here's hoping it works). If all of those side effects are mild, then I am going to keep this IUD in for at least three years. Also, I recommend NOT reading all of the negative reviews prior to insertion - they will only increase your anxiety. I was very nervous before the procedure - its a big decision!  I do recommend, of course, reading as much factual information as possible, so you can be informed and have questions for your doctor. Will post if I experience any problems. Good luck!
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	6/24/2008 3:02:28 PM	I have one child. I had the device placed for abnormal bleeding and very heavy long periods. I've never been able to take birth control pills. I had fibroids removed about a year ago with a D&amp;C. My doctor thought my bleeding would slow down but it never did. My doctor suggested this device. Severely painful insertion for about 10 minutes and I had mild cramps for about 2 days.  So far so good with the rest. I have had spotting but minimal. I am hopeful that this will work for me. I believe eveyone needs to give things a fair shot and remember all drugs are individualized and take time to work. My doctor said to give it 6 months, before making a real judgment. She believes that this is actually one of the best products out there. I also believe how it works depends on your age and what other medications that you are taking and have currently taken in the past. It's scary trying anything new and not knowing what to expect.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/23/2008 10:16:29 AM	I got the mirena about 2 weeks ago, after using a diaphragm for 3 years and getting tired of the upkeep and mess.  i have thrombophelia so hormonal bc is normally not an option for me, but the doctor told me the mirena's hormones do not get into the bloodstream and progesterone doesnt effect blood clotting like estrogen.  the insertion was very painful (no kids) but was quick and the severe cramps went away after about an hour.  i have slight cramps every once in awhile and so far the biggest issue i've had is the fact that the strings cause my partner discomfort(dr. said not much you can do about that).  hoping none of these other side effects that are reported pop up in the months ahead.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	6/22/2008 2:11:37 PM	Got the mirena about 19 months ago and since have experienced acne- I'm 31 not liking it, also the worst part is Ive noticed my pores have gotten huge. Is it possible it could be aging my skin. My skin was not like this before I had it installed. Also my eyes have been bugging me and are often dry. These problems only started since I've had it put in.
Birth Control	19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5		19-24	6/20/2008 5:31:59 PM	i think that mirena is working great for me, i was spotting for about a week and a half afterwards. after just light spotting once a month for about 3 days. i love the fact that i don't have to worry about popping a pill everyday or having my husband use a condom. i absolutley recommend mirena for everyone but just know that everyone is different.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/17/2008 1:23:22 PM	I have had mirena for about 2 and a half months. insertion was very painful!!! i have not had kids so maybe that is why. my only complanint is that i have been spotting off and on the entire time, which my dr says is normal so maybe that will go away soon. as far as weight gain goes, you control how much wight yu gain or loose, yeah you may have to change your eating habbits in order not to gain, but i havent had a problem with it. i think ppl like to blame thier weight gain on something besides themselves. so far happ with merina.

I absolutely wish I would've never considered Mirena as an option. It's been a year since insertion &amp; I've gained about 40 lbs, developed acne (at 29 yrs old!), my menstrual cycle has completely stopped, and my desire to have sex is now non-existent. Definitely dizzy, decreased energy, and excessive sweating. Can't wait to have it removed!!! 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	25-34	6/14/2008 3:35:50 AM	I have had this thing in for about a month and a half.  I was very open minded about the ease of not having to take pills anymore however, I have not stopped bleeding, not just a little either.  It is mainly during and after intercource.  It has interrupted my fiance and I a number of times and he has noticed that I am not as interested in sex anymore (never a problem before).  I am having it removed asap.  It is very uncomfortable for him and I don't like being at work and suddenly feeling a wet spot on my clothes.  It is so unpredictable.  I do not recomend this to anyone.  I have also noticed a definate state of depresion.  WARNING!!!  The doctors are using us as test dummies.
Birth Control	topdogmill, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/13/2008 9:37:09 PM	This is the best birth control ever!  I was on the pill for 10+ yrs, but after my son was born experienced high blood pressure, so I then switched to the copper IUD - no hormones - so no moodiness or weight gain, but the heavy bleeding was not fun.  After my second son was born, on the recommendation of my best friend, an OB-GYN nurse, I tried Mirena.  Insertion was a non-event, just relax and take a deep breath.  I spotted for about 6 weeks afterwards, and now have no periods.  I may spot once every 3-4 months, but that's it.  I actually have decided that if I do have another child, I will not have a tubal ligation (seems like a standard when you deliver by C-section), because I love Mirena and the fact that I don't have periods anymore, and it is more effective than a tubal according to my doctor.  I highly recommend it - the best birth control i've ever used, and the last one I'll try.  The other bonus - my insurance covered Mirena so with my copay/deductible it was about $100.  Then after the initial six weeks, I have saved a ton of money by not buying any monthly supplies and not paying for prescriptions every month.  Highly recommend it - go with Mirena.
Birth Control	TammyGirl, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/11/2008 11:21:25 AM	I am sitting here wondering weather or not to use Mirena. I am a single mother, 37 years old and I have an appointment as soon as my next period comes. I am reading these expierences that everyone is having and I am getting a little nervous. I know it doesn't affect everyone the same, but I really want to try it but nervous at the same time. Well I guess I just have to wait and see. I will send an update. Wish me luck :)
Other	cbournheard, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	6/11/2008 10:22:24 AM	I have had Mirena for about a month now.  My Dr suggested it as a method to reduce periods which would eliminate the pain I have with Uterine Fibroids. Since insertion, I have experienced extreme weight gain and prolonged periods (very light though).
Birth Control	tired, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	35-44	6/9/2008 3:52:23 PM	I never had children and my doctor recommended this type of birth control.  I have had it for 1 year and 5 months.  I'm not fond of it either.  I have really bad cramps two weeks of the month and I have a period every month.  For the past 3 weeks I have been spotting every other day.  I didn't even have that bad of cramps when I wasn't using birth control.  I also have soreness in my breasts.  I would like to have it removed but I don't want to pay the cost.  I thought I was the only one with problems but I guess not.  What attracted me was the &quot;no periods&quot; after a few months but that is not the case.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/8/2008 11:15:10 PM	I've had my Mirena since 2002 and had it replaced in 2007. I've not had any complications other than cramps every once and a while and best of all for me, NO Menstral Cycle.. What we must remember is that all medicine works differntly for everyone. 
Birth Control	danis, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/4/2008 11:34:24 PM	I have been using Mirena for almost a year now and I really like it. I have no children but was still approved to use it as a form of birth control. The insertion was painful because I had to be slightly dilated (praise be to all of you women who have had children!) and I bled/spotted for about a month. However since then I have only experienced a few breakouts and a bit of weight gain. I love Mirena! No periods, no bloating, no  having to remember to take a pill!!! I highly recommend it!! 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/4/2008 5:37:41 PM	This is my second review for Mirena. I have been on it for about a month now. I say it is worth it. I just had twins about 4 months ago and I am breastfeeding. The procedure to have it put in was uncomfortable and caused cramping and nausesa the first day or two. I had mild to heavy bleeding the first three weeks. I have not been bleeding for about 6 days now. As for the hair loss complaint I do not notice any more so than what was before I was on Mirena. Weight gain not a facotr. Sex drive...about the same. It took about a week and a half before I was interested though because of soreness it being put in. Before Mirena I was on quite a few birth control pills that cause weight gain and depression so I am so glad I tried this one. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	6/1/2008 3:26:08 PM	ok, so i've had this product for about 2 months now and i did not know that there could be so many side affects i'm now reading about. sadly my ob/gyn is not very personable so we never actually had a lengthy conversation about the product.  i just knew that after 3 kids i did not want anymore but since i have such a wonderful husband i might reconsider some day. but since i've had this put in, i've gained about 10 lbs, i've experienced cramping all the time, headaches, i've had my period 3 times in 2 months and i don't mean just spotting, and i think i can feel it!  does anyone have any suggestions?!? 
Other	hardc08, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	5/31/2008 11:51:20 PM	I hate this Mirena. Calling my doctor Monday to get it out and if she tries talking me into keeping it in for a few more months, I am going somewhere else.  I have had Mirena for a little over 3 months. I have been &quot;spotting&quot;, more then spotting, the entire time and get cramps like I have never experienced before. It is the worse pain and shoots right down to my legs. I cant even stand up from the pain.  And I know I have a high pain tolerance, so this is not me being a baby. And it feels worse for some reason when I exercise, so I am scared to exercise now.  I have also experienced very painful breast on a few occasions, bad acne (I never had acne before this. Maybe one small pimple a few days before I would get my period), my complextion just doesnt look right to me at all, I have had a headache for the past 2 weeks (not bothersome but annoying), and I have definately noticed mood changes.  I am sure this is an effective birth control method.  I wouldnt know because who wants to have sex when your bleeding? Not me anyway.  Not everything works for everyone and this is definately not working for me.  When I went for my 6 week check up, my doctor told me to give the Mirena 6-8 months.  I dont think I can handle this for another 3-5 months. Glad it works for some of you though.
Birth Control	Kati, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/31/2008 12:57:22 AM	I thought this form of birth control was perfect.  I had the mirena in for almost 3 years.  I felt a little discomfort when it was put in however the pain was gone before the doctor told me it was over. I never noticed it again.  I did have some weight gain but it wasn't more than 10 pounds and I needed that anyways.  The only issue I had with it was that the string cut my husbands penis on the tip.  I had regular periods the entire time I had it in.  I just had it removed this week so my husband and I could have another child.  It did not hurt at all coming out. I will use this form of birth control every time from now on!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	5/30/2008 11:02:04 AM	I have spent sometime today reading over the previous reviews so I figured I would throw in my 2 cents as well.  I had mirena inserted about a month ago.  I was very nervous and even cancelled my original appointment because of the uncertainty.  My biggest mistake was reading all the negative reviews of this birth control.  Somewhere along the line I forgot that not all drugs or birth control work the same on everyone.  I can say that the whole procedure took about 15 minutes, that includes the doctors set up.  There was a lot of discomfort.  A LOT!  Similiar to bad period cramps, however lasting for a few minutes.  I left the office feeling fine and went home to relax.  The next few days I was in slight pain, not as bad as my period, just uncomfortable.  I did bleed for about a week after.  Light bleeding, I used a panty liner.  So far it has been fantastic!  My sex drive has increased.  You wouldnt believe how freeing it is to not have to worry about forgetting your pills or pesky condoms.  (I should mention I am married with 2 kids, youngest is a year and a half)  So far I have not had any of the negative side effects others speak of.  No weight gain, no hair loss, no reduction in sex drive etc.  My suggestion if you are considering it is to do lots of research on it and ask LOTS of questions of your trusted doctor.  Dont be disappointed by the negative reviews. This is not going to work for everyone.  Good Luck!
Birth Control	Mother Chaos, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	5/29/2008 11:08:55 PM	my doctor convinced me to get the iud. i was going to tie my tubes. I'm glad i din't. i am a mother of 3 beautiful boys and thought i was done but i decided after finding the love of my life i want more. but not just yet. the incertion was extreamly painful and i was in tears. i bleed for over a month and no period. the only good things that i didn't have my period and it was effective. i cramped serverly the whole years i had it and i cramped after intercourse. it wasn't worth the trouble. i'll just stick to condoms. now after a month and a half of not having my period i had it. it's the worst period ever. clotting and heavy bleeding sucks. i do not advise any woman to get this implant.

Yeah I didn't get pregnant on it, but that could very well be because I could never have sex.  I went to the ER and everything for the pain.  I had it removed before the first month was up.  It was put it to help prevent endometriosis pain and it only caused more.

I bleed almost every day. There is maybe a week out of the month that I dont. I have discharge all the time(no infection tho). Headaches, cramps, stomach problems, depression, SEVERE drop in libido(sex makes me want to vomit right now), fatigue, weight gain, everything. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/26/2008 9:37:26 PM	I only had my Mirena put in a few weeks ago, but so far, I have nothing bad to say.  My youngest is 1 1/2, and we decided we didn't want another child too soon.  I was a little uncomfortable during the insertion, and afterwards I had mild cramping.  The cramping persisted for the next 4 or 5 days, with very light bleeding.  That's been it.  My sex drive has increased, and I love the freedom!

I have not been at all satisfied . They have tried two times to remove the mirena they even tried this new tool from the siminar and still they were unsuccessful. They said they could not find it.  They have done an ultrasound and MRI, still no luck all they seem to be able to offer me is more percocet for the pain which most of the time it doesn't work.  It only makes me want to sleep or be drowsy all day . I can't even properly take care of my 8 yr old son without help.  I am so tired of being in pain and taking all theese pills that don't work someone need to do something and quick.  If you have any suggestions feel free to contact me email me at gladerica@yahoo.com.  
Birth Control	iuder, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	5/25/2008 4:08:38 AM	I was aware of no side effects but I have had major hair loss but I wasn't aware of why, but it was a long bloody procedure to put it in. If I hadn't trusted my doctor so much I would have stopped her in the middle. She had to try a few times and it took over half an hour as she said the opening to my cervix is tiny tiny. Also, I had it put in when I was in a long-term relationship and we later broke up so it is not supposed to be used with multiple sexual partners. So now I use condoms with it.
Birth Control	miss_dee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/19/2008 11:21:14 PM	31 year old mom of two, a 6 yr old girl and a 1 year old boy. Had my Mirena inserted in Feb/08. There was a little discomfort, but compared to my 16 hour natural labour with my my son it was bearable. However, the bleeding has been non-stop from the first day and it's almost June. No cramping, but feel a little nauseous and some hair thinning...Feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place because I can't use anything else except condoms...and that's how I got my fist child. No real complaints so far but the jury is still out...will post back when the bleeding stops...
Birth Control	Tamra, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	25-34	5/18/2008 12:47:20 PM	I have had mine in since August of 2005. I got it about 6 months after my daughter was born. I bled for a few months and then finally the bleeding stopped and I stopped having periods altogether. The IUD has been great for preventing pregnancy and it's nice not having a period, but I too have lost a lot of my hair and it seems to be looking worse all the time. Also, after I had my daughter, I lost all of my pregnancy weight plus 5 pounds. Since having Mirena, I have gained it all back! I now weigh more than I did when I was 9 months pregnant!! I cannot seem to lose it either. I also have depression, acne and bad uterine cramps.I think this IUD is great for preventing pregnancy, but that's about it. I am getting mine out and I cannot wait to start feeling normal again. I honestly wish I'd never gotten it and I don't recommend it. It's not worth having to deal with the side effects.
Birth Control	jjalvino78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	5/16/2008 10:25:49 PM	I had Mirena inserted over 2 months ago.  The insertion was easy, just minor discomfort; however, I have been bleeding almost non-stop since that day.  There have been 2 days that I have not bled.  And I have zero sex drive.  Unfortunately my insurance did not cover this so I am stuck paying it off for the next 8 months.  So I'm going to try and suck it up until then.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	5/14/2008 3:53:53 PM	I had the Mirena put in 9/07 and it was horrible I do Not recommend this to anyone. Within a month I had it taken out by my Dr's advice because of lower body paralysis, I bled for the whole month I had it in. Now im living in pain everyday because i have a joint diesase that the doctors cant figure out and it all started from this drug!!! The worst part is it was my last bc option im alleric to everything else!

However the mood swings, depression, cramping, acne and weight gain are too much. I have only had it for 6 months and I will be having it taken out next week.
Birth Control	Tanya, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	5/14/2008 2:40:56 PM	I have had the Mirena in for about 1 1/2 yrs. No problems with having it put in or with spotting, but about half of my hair has fallen out. I had went to my gyno last week inquiring about the possiblity that this is the problem. (I had also went to my primary care dr and had numerous blood tests to make sure that there was no other issues)He acted like I was crazy for suggesting this so I did not have it removed. I have never had any problems with birth control pills so I thought I might go back on them but he thought that this was ridiculous. My husband will be scheduling an appt to have a vesectomy, so I will have it removed as soon as I can.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	5/11/2008 8:08:27 PM	Had Mirena inserted 1 1/2 weeks ago.  It hurt so bad, that I almost passed out, I ewas sick &amp; they kept me at the clinic for 1 hour because my blood pressure was too low.  Got home &amp; had the worst cramps I ever had in my life for 3 days.  Now I feels tired ever since, when I workout it feels like something is stabbing me???  I will try to give it time, but this is not fun.  When I read all the post of having it remved I get scraed that I may of made the wrong decision.  I was on Depo for 8 months, gained 8 lbs, got acne and still have very bad cramps every month, the pill did not help my very bad cramping either.  If this does not work, I do not know what to do.  I am 38 and runing out of options.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/9/2008 10:31:44 PM	I've had the Mirena IUD in for over a year now.  No periods.....ever.  No cramping, bleeding, no pills to have to remember to take.  It's great!  The convenience and ease of use is amazing.  If I were to comment on any negatives, it would be that my complexion is not as clear.  Occasional breakouts occur; similar to &quot;that time of the month&quot;.  But, I've had no bloating or weight gain.  My husband and I are happy.  I would highly recommend an IUD.
Birth Control	momof2girls, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	5/9/2008 2:27:39 PM	Inserted on 9/11/06 and thought yeah no more pills.  Bleed for 6 weeks, just like after the recent pregnancy.  Gained 30 lbs and had some bladder problems.  Removed on 4/29/2008 and loving it.  No more bladder leakage and lost 5 lbs with in the first week.  Everyone that I work with all have had the same complaints about the weight gain.  I was also constantly moody with no period.  Well I would rather be moody on a monthly basis than be an emotional rollercoaster all the time.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	5/9/2008 10:38:08 AM	I just got it inserted yesterday. It was painful, but bareable since it only took a few minutes. I had sharp cramps go up my left side. My doctor gave me some motrin. I felt slightly nauseas and a little dizzy on and off the rest of the day. This morning my back aches and i have slight cramping. Generally, how I would feel on the first day of my period. I had twins three months ago. I was not on birth control before because of adverse reactions to the hormones in multiple types of the pill. I thought I would try this because it didn't have estrogen in it just the synthetic progestrone. I am breastfeeding, and was worried because the label says to discuss it with your doctor, but she said its ok. I am willing to try it out to see if it is worth it. I was shocked as I read the reviews to see how many women who had not had children were given this BC when it says you should not have it unless you have had children. When they insert it the doc is dilating your cervix think about it, it is going to hurt somewhat. I only rated somewhat satisfied because it is so early on, but I do feel very relieved about knowing I will not have to worry about getting pregnant again soon. I have only had sex with my husband once since giving birth because the act itself is still painful for me because I had an episiotomy. I still have a sex drive right now so I will know if the mirena is a cause for a decrease in my libido.
Birth Control	Butterfly Love, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	5/8/2008 1:47:46 PM	Today is my 1 month anniversay with Mirena.  I did not have any cramping or other side effects like others.  I had on and off spotting for the first 2 weeks.  I have been bleeding for the past 11 days.  I lost alot of hair.  I gain a bit of weight.  It is very frustrated to be bleeding all the time..very inconvenient.  Yes it is working because there's no sex.  I am still debating should I have it remove or be patience.  Will post after next week's doctor appointment.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/6/2008 2:44:41 PM	well so far so good! I just had the Mirena inserted yesterday, I haven't even had it in for a day and the cramping has already stopped. I haven't noticed anything else happening just yet but like I said it's only been a day. I think everyone reacts to things differently, I was on the shot for over 2 years and had the worst time with it as far as weight and mood changes, so maybe this BC will be different for me. So far I love it.

Birth Control	thornz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	35-44	5/5/2008 7:22:08 PM	Wow! I am so glad that I found this site.  I had mirena inserted 6 weeks postpartum in Nov. 07 and was not told of all of these side effects.  I have been blaming the hair loss on postpartum even though I didn't lose any hair after my first child 3 years ago. Every time I brush my hair long strands just fall out. My shower drain is constantly clogged with hair. I get really bad headaches and my weight has skyrocketed!  I only gained 25 pounds during both of my pregnancies and easily lost it after my first child.  At my 6 week postpartum check up after my second child was born in October 07 I had already lost about 20 pounds.  I now weigh more than I did when I gave birth!  I have been very moody which my husband and I have blamed on my low self esteem with my weight and just the strain of taking care of a 3 yr old and 7 month old.  After reading all of these reviews I finally feel hopeful that I can get back to my old self if I have this IUD removed.  I am calling my doctor in the morning and hope that she can schedule me soon! I will re-post in a couple of months after removal to update on side effects and hopefully they have all gone away.   
Other	Chris/SLP, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	5/2/2008 2:49:37 PM	I had it placed on 02/28/08 and within one month I gained 15#, felt extreme fatigue, mood swings, bloating, high irritability, decreased libido and increased nausea.  Insertion wasn't a problem but I have had two children.  My husband and colleagues have noticed changes in my attitude which has become more negative.  My gyne and her staff are surprised at all the trouble I am experiencing which made me feel like this was in my head but after researching users comments, I have found many who post are experiencing the same exact symptoms.  I am having it removed on May 28 and that isn't soon enough.

The fact of not getting pregnant is great I have a 4 and 2 yer old we want more but not right away so this is great. Now to the not so great since insection in june06. I have gained 40 lbs., sex hurts or I am just not interested, and my hair has gotten thinner. It did make my periods lighter but they will last 2 days stop for 2 days then come back for another day or so (not fun). It is hard to say if I would do it again. We are planning another baby in a year or so. Does anyone no if it hurts to have it removed after having it for a few years?
Birth Control	teesyweesy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/1/2008 8:53:25 AM	The mirena IUD was an excellent form of birth control as I lost any interest in sex.  I also was a hormonal weepy mess and had to have the IUD out after only 3 months.  I also experienced cystic acne and occasional uterine cramping.  If you can tolerate hormone birth control, then this probably is a wonderful method, unfortunately, I can't and had to go back to ortho tri cyclen low.  
Birth Control	MommaRachie, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/30/2008 3:56:15 PM	I haven't tried this form of BC yet. I am 22 with one child and I need some form of BC. I am going to the Dr. tomorrow to find out more about it. I was on the depo shot before and I hated it, I gained so much weight with the shot I had to stop. I was just curious if anyone else had switched from the shot to Mirena and how you would compare them.

I spotted for 9 months but now.. ONE DAY PERIODS.. wow... amazing.. I used to have 10 to 15 day periods so you can imagine my joy.. I haven't had any real noticeable side effects other than acne, but hey.. one day periods and an effective birth control vs. acne... guess what I would rather have.. oh and for those not having sex anymore.. yeah it was uncomfortable at 1st but over time it's not as bad.. BE PATIENT.. I am fully sexually active with my partner.

I was very scared to go get it done but I had to. I am 21 with two kids so I needed some form of birth control. The patches made me bleed for three weeks at a time, I forgot to take the pills, the ring was uncomfortable so I had no other choice.. well the insertion hurt real bad but afterwards it was fine. I have a little bit of cramping but nothing that Tylenol couldn't take care of. I have noticed I'm losing my hair in clumps. I'm gonna let it play out for at least three months to see if it gets better. I'll come back then and tell ya..

It was painful to have implanted (I've never had children) and I had cramping and irregular bleeding for the first few months.  After the initial discomfort and inconvenience, everyting is great! My periods are regular (and shorter), and I love not having to bother with a pill, patch, etc. For me, it was well worth it!

Just had Mirena removed less than an  hour ago and good riddance! Hopefully I will stop having the spotting and get to a normal period, and be done with it! It didn't hurt at all, felt like my regular GYN visit (didn't take her 5 minutes to get it out). I do feel just a little cramping but nothing the ibuprofen can't fix. Three months to the day and nothing but  mischief- only had sex three times in three months... unbelievable. For me Mirena only worked because you're not having sex! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	4/18/2008 12:59:27 PM	I had the mirena inseerted March 08 and am getting it out april 08.I was never explained that it can express through breast milk, that I would be bleeding it feels like forever.Thank goodness I looked it up, because I thought somethign was wrong with me.ANd now i am worried that it is decreasing my milk supply even though it says nothing about it in the warnings.I have also seen a significant amount of hair loss which is way more that post-partum like I thought. I wish this was a good b/c method but jsut not for me I guess back to condoms for the time being.
Birth Control		4	1	1			4/23/2008 9:57:38 PM	I  have had this since October 18, 2007 and i hate it, The hair loss, mood swing and of course the bleeding for the last 8 months. Of course it work cause your not having sex. I hate  it and i am getting it removed

I have had the mirena 14 months. I loss my hair horrible. I have gained 40 lbs in the past 14 months. The weight gain has killed my self esteem. DONT DO THIS TO YOURSELF!!!

Birth Control	ANGELA, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	35-44	4/16/2008 9:44:32 AM	For all the ladies who had problems with this product, I feel your pain. I had Mirena inserted in January 2008 and its now 3 mos later and I can't wait to get it removed! I can't stand the break through bleeding, leg cramping, mood swings, and constant migraines. I feel sluggish all the time, I feel bloated all the time, and Lord knows the sex is extinct due to all the bleeding [all the time]. Mirena is not for me! I have 2 teens and definitely do not want anymore children. I plan to get tubal ligation in the fall. I figure 3 mos is enough time to see how well it works with my body. Yes, it does its job as far birth control goes (probably because you don't have sex due to the bleeding) but the constant side effects are too unbearable. Ladies listen to your bodies, if you're having difficulties in the early stages Mirena will only cause more difficulties later. I will have Mirena removed 3 months to the day of insertion and can't wait. Good riddance Mirena! 04/16/08 angela
Birth Control	ReneeC, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/10/2008 9:37:23 PM	I had first heard about it when I was 7 months pregnant. I had researched it and luckily my insurance paid for the whole thing. I have had it for about 5 months now. I absolutely love it! I remember on the way to my ob/gyn I was so scared that it was going to hurt. I didnt feel a thing. A couple of days after I had it put in I was sick and crampy and I bleed for almost 2 months but I dont have my period at all now. And I don't feel it in there. I couldnt be more happier with the decision to use it!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	4/10/2008 7:56:55 PM	I have been using Mirena for 15 months now and just LOVE IT!  My periods have been drastically reduced to little flow and very mild cramps.  It did take about 6+ months for my body to &quot;regulate&quot; itself with Mirena (lots of interim bleeding) but now, no issues.  It was worth the wait!  I am 39 with 2 children.
Birth Control	Candace, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/8/2008 3:39:59 AM	I had it put in a month ago. I haven't stopped bleeding since. I still have major cramping and pain shooting down my legs. I already have arthritis in my lower back and the back pain is severe. People at work and in my family have been questioning why I look so pale and sick all the time and this is the only thing I can think of that would be causing me to look sick all the time. I feel sick all the time! I see many people talking about getting it removed. I already know how painful it was to get it put it. I threw up and almost passed out.  Had to drive myself home and nearly passed out walking into my apartment. Luckily the bf was home to hear me fall in the hall. I really hate to ask this but I need to know how bad is having it removed? It may be worth keeping in for that 5 years if it's anything like having it inserted.  I would rather have gone through my 30 hours of labor, 3 hours of pushing, and emergency c-section again. At least my body had 9 months to gear up for that!! Plus that child birth syndrome of forgetting how bad that pain was.  I'll never forget how painful having this has been. At least with the child birth I ended up having a happy little 3 year old face smiling back at me.

I've had the Mirena for 8 months now and I currently have no problems. In the beginning there was abnormal bleeding for a while, but after my body adjusted I was fine.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	4/6/2008 3:41:16 PM	I also have really bad back ache and cramping ive only had it for 3 weeks but my doctor knew that i have never had children before and she still allowed me to have mirena is it bad if ive never had kids before and have this contraceptive???? should i take it out because i do want to have kids someday
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/4/2008 10:01:41 PM	Two doctors tried unsuccessfully to insert this.  They could not get it in and the pain was very bad.  After about 45 minutes and alot of pain I stopped the procedure.  I would not recommend it for anyone. 
Birth Control	tll08, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/4/2008 8:53:22 PM	I had mine inserted about 4 months ago, I haven't been on bc in 7 years b/c I hated how it made me feel, so after 2 (planned) children I didn't want to take any chances so I opted for Mirena.  I like it okay I haven't exp. the same probs I had with the pill.  However, my predictable 6 day, heavy period, has gotten lighter but sometimes it is 3 days sometimes 8, the first 3 weeks I didn't think I would stop bleeding, but now I just don't know how long it will last.  Has any1 else had this exp. and when did it get somewhat predictable????
Birth Control	Rachel, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/4/2008 12:53:26 PM	To Pauline, you were asking for some help or advice. This is really something that you will have to try for yourself. Yes, it wasn't the most pleasant experience to have the IUD inserted (mine was a little jarring because I have never had kids), but just take a few asprin or advil to get relaxed and make sure to get a good night's sleep afterwards. Make sure that you monitor your mental and physical self. Look for hair loss (I did have some, but its gone away) or acne (which did happen to me too, but it went away), but if you start thinking in a different way and you notice that &quot;Wow, the thought I just had really isn't 'me' and I do mentally feel different, then take it out. I had the nuva ring for one month. I was moody, irritble and sucidial. Once I saw the connection, I took out the ring and never looked back. I felt better right away. Since you are the only one who gets to deal with you all the time, you will notice changes that no one else will. Monitor yourself and even though things may suck at the beginning, just give it atleast a month so your body and adjust. You will do just fine. 
Other	pinkshoelaces, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	4/3/2008 2:55:22 PM	I had my IUD put in 4 days ago and they have been the worst 4 days of my life.  Insertion was so painful I passed out.  After I was correctly anesthesized and the procedure was continued, the friend I brought with me to drive me home passed out too from seeing the amount of blood that dripped of the table and onto the floor.  What should have taken 5 minutes took 30.  My doctor recomended it for my endometriosis, praising it, and even suggested I go to work later that day.  I have had heavy bleeding and intense cramps since and am having this taken out asap the minute I start losing hair or gaining weight.  Hopefully the cramps and bleeding will slow down.
Birth Control	Elsa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	4/3/2008 12:08:27 AM	The insertion was extremly painfull, i almost fainted. Its being 7 months since i had it inserted and for the fist 4 months i was bleeding non-stop now is on and off but a little lighter. What really drive me insane is the horrible cramps and the lower back pains. I like the fact that i dont have to worry about getting pregnant but i don't know if is really worth it. 
Birth Control	Poozabug, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	4/2/2008 9:34:48 PM	I've had the mirena for approx 2 years.  I have experienced terrible lower back pain on and off for 2 years.  It has just occurred to me that it might be the IUD.  Has anyone else experienced this???  I have a gyne appt. in 2 weeks, I might have it removed, but I don't want my periods back.  I haven't had any hair loss or weight gain, but the back pain is awful.

I was wondering if anyone else has the same problem??? HELP
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/1/2008 11:41:10 PM	I have had this in place since November 2007 and at first I was pleased and then a week or two went by! It was very painfull getting it inserted. I had my period for almost three months (light and then Heavy), I have gained about 35 pounds regardless I work out three times a week, I have serious abdominal pains including cramping, and My sex drive is almost gone. I am 24 years old and NO children. I am going to get it remove ASAP. 
Birth Control	mom2donny, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	3/29/2008 12:39:00 PM	Do your research before getting this device! I had it removed after 3 mos. because of the side-effects(weight gain,depression,joint pain,insomnia,acne,irritability). If I had seen these reviews, i would've never gotten it. I told my doctor about mood problems with birth control pills and was told this would not have the same effects(not true). AND if you are still breast feeding and thinking about getting this IUD, it is NOT proven safe for your baby, the hormones are passed to the baby in the milk (i was told it was safe to use while breast feeding, also not true). I realize some people have no side effects and love it, but if you have ever had problems with any hormonal birth control in the past, this device is probably not for you. If you do decide to get it, be on the look out for adverse effects, most women don't realize until months later that the IUD is causing them. If you do have adverse effects,PLEASE, report them to the FDA. You can do it online and it only takes a few minutes. 
Birth Control	Edsa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	3/28/2008 4:32:15 PM	At first I loved it. Now that I has been in for about 3 months I am having nothing but problems, all the time. I get black an blue marks on my legs all the time. It looks like someone had beat me up. And I am VERY DEPRESSED! To the point I thinking about killing myself. I have to keep telling myself that is is the Mirena and that I will go away once it is removed. I have headaches every day and cramping all the time. When I bleed, I bleed so heavy It is like I am peeing blood. The other day I have to change my pad 4 times in a 6 hour time table. I can not wait to have it removed and get back to my old self.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	3/27/2008 11:33:17 AM	Ithis is the 2nd time I have used it.  After my first child I had really no complaints.  This time around I have a lot of spotting.  I bled for at least a month right after insertion.  I have broken out with acne like I did 20 years ago.  It is horrible.  I think it may have fallen out a little.  I can feel the strings without actually looking for them.  I can see them with a mirror.  I am going in to have it checked and hopefully removed.  I did have hair loss after about a month both times but I thouhgt it was just postpardum????  So I am kind of in the middle on this one.
Birth Control	abbie0924, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/26/2008 6:36:24 PM	I had mirena inserted 2mos. after the birth of my daughter. I didn't even feel a thing! I had a few light cramps afterward and some spoting for 3 days that has stopped now. I am happy that it didn't hurt like the majority of people said it would.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	3/25/2008 2:04:48 PM	I have had bad cramps since I had it done, and have bled for the last eight weeks
Birth Control	luvley76, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	3/25/2008 5:48:01 AM	I am not usually one to complain about a new drug. Being an RN, I try to really give things a go and let it have some time before judging it but I am making an exception with this! Immediatel after getting the mirena I started losing my hair, they blamed on me being post partum. However this did not happen for the 8 weeks I had nothing in post partum. I kept it in thinking I was over reacting. It just kept getting worse. Then I lost my sex drive. COMPLETELY! Forget the birth control, who needed it I stopped having sex at all. It also made me very moody, even my husband noticed a huge difference. This went on and on and finally at work, I work in various depts I started asking others that I knew had it in if they had the same symptoms. Sure enough, sex drive was number 1 and hair loss too. I couldnt believe it. I even asked a few patients on the sly about their symptoms and many reported similar things. Finally the last draw came when I got my first period after 13 weeks, it was horrible and it never ended. It lasted 4 weeks of straight bleeding. I was at my wits end and had it removed. Amazingly my hair has stopped falling out, and I may just want to have sex again now! I am feeling much better and want to caution anyone to read up on this drug. Just because it is the next new great thing, doesn't mean its without some major side effects. Good Luck

I do have a lot of pain when im about to start my period. so far i havent had any of the symptoms that were described in other reviews. just once and a while i have sharp pain. my sex drive is the same as it was before. but before mirena i was on the pill for a long time. the worst part was insertion it only took my doctor like 2 minutes so it wasnt that bad.

Birth Control	Maggie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	3/10/2008 1:42:55 PM	I had this inserted a year ago after my second child was born and had no problems until now. I have all the symptons of being pregnant but a hpt says I am not. I feel tired to my very core, nauseous, colostrum leaking, even though I finished nursing 1 year ago and now I am getting headaches more frequently. I am having it removed asap...I do not think this is a safe contraceptive...and the FDA needs to pull this off the market.
Birth Control	Roxanne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/7/2008 9:35:26 AM	*** Insertion***This was EXTREMELY PAINFUL to have inserted. I've never had children before, perhaps that was a factor. The entire procedure lasted about 4 or 5 minutes and it was the single most painful experience of my life to date. I question whether or not I EVER want to have children. I was screaming on the table, broke out in sweats, almost start hyper ventilating, wanted to puke, feint and defecate myself all at the same time. It sort of felt like a Papsmear multiplied by 1000.  They didn't offer me any kind of numbing agent or local anesthetic. GET IT. Don't let them convince you otherwise! Get someone else to drive you to this. Brochure says &quot;may have some discomfort or pain during insertion&quot;... what a joke, it was torture.I had just a little bleeding and cramps/ backache afterwards, that lasted about 4 days.*** Results ***I've now had this for about a month and I am very satisfied. I did not gain weight, or break out in acne. I actually lost weight and other than the occasional mild abdominal pain I have had no other cramps/back-aches. Appetite is decreased and I no longer crave junk food like I used to.  I also suffered no spotting or bleeding.  I feel like my sex drive has increased, no pain or irritation during sex. I think I have my period. I'm not sure because the bleeding is VERY light, almost not panty liner worthy. If this is a sign of things to come I'll be very pleased!I recommend this device but PLEASE GET A LOCAL ANESTHETIC BEFORE THEY PUT IT IN! ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE NEVER HAD CHILDREN!

I no longer have a sexdrive, even when I'm having intercourse with my husband. I haven't had a period in a little over a year(I've had mirena for about 3 years now). No one told me that overian cysts could occur, I believe I've had quite a few. Sex is very painful to me and my husband. He says it feels like a needle is poking him and I feel as if something is being jammed into my uterus only on one side though. I have all of the side effects to my period without actually having my period. And the bloating is rediculis. I've talked to 3 doctors about it and they all told me not to worry about it. Some doctors they are!!I'm getting this removed as soon as possible, I just can't take it anymore and I want my libido back, its ruining my marriage. I'm just afraid it's going to hurt worse than it did when it was put in. That was the worst day of my life.
Birth Control	happy to get off, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	2	Female	25-34	3/4/2008 9:43:53 PM	I wish I never used mirena.  I got it put in 6 weeks after I had my daughter, I was never advised on what all the side effects were.  It is over 3 yrs later &amp; I have noticed a alot of hair loss, weight gain and facial hair.  I am having mine removed to more and am hoping the side affects are reversable. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/3/2008 2:39:27 PM	I loved using Mirena.  I didn't have my period very often and when I did it was very light (I could use a mini pad).  I felt nothing and didn't have to worry about birth control.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	2/27/2008 9:51:50 AM	I've had mines for about nine months now, it hurt a little when it was inserted, and the cramping was a little severe. I love that i don't have to be worrying about getting pregnant or taking a pill, my periods have gotten lighter but more painfully, i cramp a lot usually 1 to 2 weeks before and during my period. My partner does feels something poking him but nothing major, and sex drive is really good. but reading this reviews i could relate a few things that have been going on with me, one the hair loss, more breakage than loosing it, also acne not major but didn't really got any before mirena, and the headaches.......i'm a little concerned with it now but i don't really wanted remove because it has been the only effective thing for me since the pill and the patch hasn't worked for me, and i have gained at least 14 lbs but i thought i was just eating more usually i could loose weight gain easly but i can't get rid of those extra pounds, i'm going to consult my obgy as well as my doctor to see if i'm better of without it, i have two children and just want to prevent getting pregnant again :( 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/20/2008 7:27:53 PM	it's great not worrying about pregnancy I don't like not knowing my cycle anymore but was aware of that previously as a side effect I don't think I will have it replaced in another few years (had it nearly 2 years now) Have experienced regular low pelvic pain less than previous period pain but more common and constipation as side effects but less mood swings than I got with any pill or my own regular cycle.

I'm taking it out next month asap. It was inserted May of last year. That same month I started seeing a shrink b/c I was depressed.  Months went passed and the depression became worse, it turned into mood swings. Sex drive was gone, appetite was gone.  I've now added anxiety to the list. I hate this thing b/c it has affected my life in the worse way. Oh and I bruises just appear on my legs for no reason.  Went ot the dr and they said it's b/c I'm not getting enough calories.  I wouldn't recommend this method.  There are too many side effects that really happening to people.

BUT after one year or so I noticed some hair loss, another year later the hair loss has become worse and becoming very noticable.  Too bad because this was the only draw back.  Having it removed as soon as possible.  Would prefer not to be bald.
Birth Control		5	5	5			2/18/2008 1:13:50 AM	I just got mirena put in abt a month ago. So many people have said how bad it hurt, I've never had kids, the dr used numbing shots (like the dentists uses) and it was no worse than a pap smear. I have been spotting, but nothing out of the ordinary. Feel good, no weight gain, no hair loss, or any other side effects, and also no decrease in sex drive... All is well so far.

Birth Control	jennifer71461, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1		19-24	2/13/2008 1:59:34 AM	I've had mine for almost a year. I'm a mother of 2 and all the side affects are there. I have serve headaches daily, pain during certain positions of intercourse, pain in pelvic area sometimes even shooting down me legs, not really weight gain,but I can't seem to lose weight, and serve nausia. I've read alot of reviews and it works for some,but I'm not one of those lucky ones. I would in some way say it is a great method of birth control, because I haven't became pregnant,but if you start having symptoms they only get worse. I'm having mine removed. All I can really say is if you try it good luck,but I would necessarily recommed it to anyone
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/11/2008 10:13:34 PM	I have had the Mirena for close to 3 1/2 years and I think its great. I got it put in 3 months after my son was born. The only problem I've had is that at my last &quot;annual&quot; they couldn't find the string so I had to have an ultrasound to make sure it was still placed correctly. For a long time I didn't have any periods and no cramping either. Now I still have no cramping but occasionally have a very light period if my husband and I have sex near the time I would be starting. Which can be hard to tell since I don't keep track anymore because of not having any. I didn't have any weight gain, thank God, since I already had an extra 20 pounds from being pregnant. ;) It seems like a lot of the people who have rated it before me have had a lot of problems, but I would definitely recommend it.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	2/11/2008 11:12:06 AM	I've had the mirena in for about 8 months now. I have never had kids so... of course it really hurt to have it put in, but after the initial bleeding and cramping stopped, which was like 2 wks after insertion, i love it for the most part. My sex drive &quot;sucks&quot; since I have gotten it.  I get cramps like 2 weeks before my period, but i barely bleed at all. For the most part I don't even know that it is there.  Every once in a while the string will poke me on the sides of my walls, and he can feel it stabbing him sometimes.. But I think it's kinda worth it, if it wasn't for the sex drive factor. I hate that.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	2/4/2008 7:42:33 PM	I had this put in on January 8 of this year; I thought that it would be fine and I wouldn't have to worry about getting pregnant again and taking a pill everyday. Sinc inserted, I have had shooting pain; cramps that make it unbearable to move and sleep at times. I have experienced dizziness and a period that won't go away.  I definitely think that it isn't for everyone and it's not for me. I will be getting it removed asap. 
Birth Control	Rachel, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	1/30/2008 11:51:49 AM	I got the Mirena inserted 2 days ago during my period. The insertion was a little intense for me because I haven't had any kids yet. I'm still bleeding a little from my period, but not horrible. Every so often I get a little cramp, but nothing too bad. I feel fine, but its weird to know that its there. If you are ok with someone poking around down there for a few minutes and you don't mind a little pain, the procedure was a breeze. I would recommend it. I suggest taking some aspirn before hand. Make sure you get a good night's sleep afterwards. 
Birth Control	Cristina, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	19-24	1/30/2008 12:18:30 AM	I thought mirena would be a safe form of birth control for me since I had really heavy and long periods before I had my son. I was hoping  it would lessen or stop my periods altogether. But it was not completely effective. I did not get pregnant, but it made my periods worse. They last for months now. Heavier than before. And I rarely cramped before, and now it rarely stops. It is a rare side effect, I suppose, and I never thought it would happen to me, but it did. It was easy to use in the sense that the doctor put it in and I don't have to really mess with it, but now it hurts me and my boyfriend to have sex. And I've had it trimmed as far as it can be trimmed. And the cramps make me double over in pain. I just wanna curl up in a ball. And I can't really do that with an active 17 month old in the house. I told myself that I would at least give it a year to see if it would get better. But it didn't. I'm getting it taken out in February of this year and will have used it for 16 months at that point. I hope someone will read this and realize that some side effects may be rare, but they do happen. At least to some people. I just want to maybe save someone else from going through the nightmare that I have gone through. I am personally not satisfied with this birth control because of the side effects, even though it has so far prevented me from getting pregnant.
Birth Control	Maryann, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/29/2008 8:35:04 PM	I was nauseous, gained weight, depressed, had mood swings, and even had a bit of &quot;dripping of urine&quot; on this med. I felt terrible for a year until I realized all these symptoms were from the Mirena. If you begin to feel ill after having this thing inserted, have it removed because you will not feel better later, but worst as time progresses. Having it removed was the best thing I did for myself.
Birth Control		5	5	3			1/29/2008 11:37:34 AM	i got the mirena almost 2 yrs ago now and it has worked, however ive had many side effects. i did not find getting the mirena painful at all, but this is probably due to the fact that i have two kids. during the first yr i had severe pms, especially moodiness and headaches. those side effects have disappeared now, however i have gained 35 pounds and have lost alot of hair in the past year. although it is nice not to worry about birth control i would not recommend it to anyone, especially anyone with weight problems or headaches. i am considering getting mine taken out.

Wasn't painful at all when it was put in. Just a tiny pinch after that i had only spotting and very mild cramping and now 3 years later i feel the weight gain, cramping (not so severe) but very uncomfortble abdomial pain not what i thought but it kept me from getting pregnant and it is good.. i do recommend it...
Birth Control	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	1/20/2008 11:09:35 AM	I loved the mirena, I never had my period the whole time I had it. However after only 1 year it came out. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/18/2008 7:35:05 PM	I love it! I had it inserted when my youngest was 7 wks old. I havent had a period on over a year aside from some minor spotting. my only problem  has been that the threads go MIA on occasion, i can feel them, but they just poke out of my cervix. my husband loves it as well.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	1/17/2008 7:36:54 PM	I had it placed in about 2 yrs ago and i love it. There is no monthly birth control bills or remembering to take you pill. It really works. But each person must see if the good outweights the bad. I cramp every month about a week before my cycle and during, sometimes its worst some months than others. I once felt like i was in labor. My sex drive has decreased to the point where it troubled my relationship of three yrs. The doctors said your partner can not feel it but that is not true. My partner hated it for the first eight months. He said it was like a sharp needle stabbing him. It also made sex uncomfortable for me. Sometimes I cramped so bad i would have to stop having sex. Weight gain was another problem. I was a size 10/12 when I got the mirena, since then I am now a 16/18 and almost in a 20. I gained 40lbs in less than 2yrs. I am actually thinking about having it removed as soon as I am able to. I am kind of still outweighting the good and the bad. I can deal with the low sex drive and even the cramping one week out of the month but the weight gain is making me think twice.
Birth Control	Braidi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	1/17/2008 2:24:30 PM	I had mine inserted March of 2006 and have been having headaches ever since.  I did not have periods only little spotting every once in a while.  I loved it except the headaches.  My OBGYN says that there is no way it could be the IUD.  However, I've been to every other doctor and they believe it is the IUD.  So I had it taken out yesterday.  I have a slight headache today, I am hoping that it is just after effects.  Oh also I gained 40 pounds, which I am now trying to lose.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/13/2008 10:42:34 PM	I had the Mirena IUD inserted six years ago to reduce heavy irregular bleeding despite being on the pill.  It was painful for a few minutes on insertion but then no problems at all. Periods dropped to 1 light day every 8 weeks then stopped when I started having chemo for breast cancer 12 months later. I kept it in because the Tamoxifen I was put on can cause thickening of uterine wall and Mirena reduces this so they cancelled out. Saw a different gyno after 5 years to have it removed but he wanted to do it under general anaesthetic! GP suggested to wait till own Gyno was available; he took it out in office last week with barely a twinge (one good cough!)I have read lots of reviews and it seems some people are unlucky or very sensitive but I loved it.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/12/2008 7:49:02 PM	My doctor suggested this b/c of endometriosis, and my inability to remember to take the pill. I was tired of forgetting and worrying about getting pregnant. Putting it in was nothing.  I had already had 2 children and I guess my cervix was ok with it.  No pain whatsoever, no dizziness, no cramping.  I did have moderate cramping for a few days afterward. My periods have been irregular, I have head headaches (which are sometimes really severe) which I never had before, acne which I had never had before and cramping which I was already used to from the endo. Even with the acne and headaches I still LOVE my mirena.  It is SO worth it not to have to worry about getting pregnant.  My husband has never felt the strings and I check each month after I have my &quot;period&quot; to make sure they are there.  Periods are so light I sometimes don't even have to wear a tampon or pad. I only notice anything when I go to the bathroom but no other time. I do cramp a lot but I can handle that with some ibuprofen. I would highly recommend this to any women who just hate the pill like I did.  I love not having to worry about anything.  It is so great!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/12/2008 1:43:50 AM	I've had the IUD for a little over 4 months and I love it! My sex drive has went way down but it keeps the babies away. When getting it inserted there was little cramping but I have not had a period in over 3 months! I'd recommend it to anyone who still wants kids but isnt ready.

I'll take the irregular periods to an unplanned pregnancy.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	1/9/2008 11:30:42 PM	I've had Mirena for over 1 yr.  The only bad thing I can say about it is the random cramping.  I spot once a month, but do not have a true period. Getting it put in, so far, has been the worst part 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	1/7/2008 5:28:28 PM	it was extremely painful to have put in, then i had shooting pains for quite sometime. when i got it checked the dr. could not feel strings so after 2 ultrasounds i had to have an xray where they found it completely outside my uterus. i now have to have surgery to have it removed!! i would NOT recommend this to anyone!!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	1/7/2008 10:28:08 AM	I had Mirena inserted on December 19, 2007... The insertion pain was beyond what I had expected. The pain was unbearable and took two insertion attempts to get it right. I had mild cramping afterwards but when I got home... I was ready to rip it out myself!!! The pain felt like full labor pains. Now 21 days into it I have cramping and spotting. In addition, I thought all was well when I checked and felt the string, then a week later no string. Also, I have a diminished sex drive and the sex that I have is uncomfortable. This morning I felt sharp (stabbing) cramps on the right side and now nagging cramps on the left side. I have always had a 3 day light period with literally one or two mild cramps.  Since this is all so new, I am going to hold out.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	1/6/2008 7:29:43 PM	I had this put in because of very heavy periods a little over a year ago. There were 2 attemps because it was so painful to put in. I had my period for 3 weeks then stopped for a week and the cycle continued. Under Dr's advice to give it time, I have. Now 1 year later I still have daily cramping, heavy bleeding,weight gain, and mood swings. I get my period every 2 to 3 weeks. This did not work for me at all. I am having it removed but I am affraid of the pain I will feel when they take it out. Even though my periods were heavy before at least they only came once a month.  
Birth Control	Erin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/6/2008 3:17:58 PM	I had the mirena put in on Dec. 6th, I went in two weeks later for a follow up to ensure it was in place.  To my surprise it was no where to be found.  I had an ultrasound, still not there.  Then I had a CAT Scan, and they found it.  The mirena has migrated completely outside of my uterus into my lower left pelvic area.  I am having full blown surgery on Jan 8th to have it removed.  This has been a complete nightmare, I would reccomend that everyone consider this risk before opting to use this device. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	25-34	1/6/2008 2:10:28 PM	I got it put in over 8 months ago, my ob/gyn had an awful time getting it in and it hurt terribly. After the awful insertion,I bled for an eternity but started losing weight like crazy. Sex drive is barely there but I do it anyway:)
Birth Control	Pickle 245, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	1/6/2008 1:55:04 PM	Insertion of the Mirena was extremely painful.  I think it was worse than having my baby.  It took to doctor three tries to get it were it needed to be.  Afterward I immediatley started to spot.  About a week later I started my period and it lasted for 3 1/2 weeks. Stopped for a week then started again. Now I start and go for a week,  stop for a day or two then go for another week.  I have awful cramping,  moodiness,  extreme tiredness,  no sex drive at all and heavy periods.  Its frustrating because before my period was always very regular and light.  I'm still thinking of having it removed but my doctor thinks I should wait a few more months. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	1/2/2008 11:20:23 AM	I thought this was the miracle birth control...but after 2 years, all of the sudden I've gained 25 pounds and am starting to feel the psychological effects. The same thing happened to me while I was receiving the DepoProvera shot. I'm having my Mirena removed. Too bad... It really was great while it lasted.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	1/2/2008 2:28:58 AM	I had Mirena for 1 month.  I was crabby and my pelvis hurt.  There were 3 straight weeks of heavy bleeding so I begged the doctor to take it out.  It's only been a couple of days now, but my bleeding has gotten worse after it's removal.  I really wanted it to work too.  I was excited for fewer/shorter periods and thought free birth control.

Birth Control	Dana, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	12/31/2007 10:03:09 AM	I decided on Mirena after my 2nd birth and all and all it is great except for the few side effects. After the insert I had dizzy/faint/nausea and extreme cramping(that felt like a peaking contraction) for about a constant hour. I do have headaches &amp; moodiness but had them before Mirena. Sex drive has gone down hill. Vision change comes &amp; goes but can't pin-point it on Mirena(may be blood sugar level which Mirena can be a culprit). Spotting periods. Not having to worry about getting pregnant or missing a pill-AWESOME! I will be giving Mirena a 1 yr. chance unless my doctor says different. I am going into my 5th month trying.

The process was very painful, even though it was inserted on the second day of my period.  I feel as if in  constant PMS (mild cramps, bloating, back pain, breast tenderness, mood changes, joint pain).  I have been spotting regularly.  My sex drive has not been affected at all, fortunately. I've considered having it removed, but I have been advised to wait for my body to adjust to the hormone (3-6 months).  I take Naproxen Sodium on a daily basis to ease the pain and discomfort.  Hopefully I'll feel better and fully enjoy the benefits and convenience of this birth control method.

Getting this device inserted felt as if I was in labor again. My period lasts for two weeks now instead of the three days before I had the procedure done. I have no sex drive whatsoever, acne all over my body, backaches, mood swings, weight gain and headaches. On the plus side I have no cramping, no stress over missing the pill and I am giving this device a year to work before I decide to take it out. It works great against conception and that is a great plus for me.

Everything else about it, for lack of a better word, SUCKS...since I got the mirena inserted over a year ago after the birth of my first child, I have frequent headaches, frequent breakthrough bleeding, and no sex drive whatsoever. If you enjoy engaging in sex on a regular basis, you want to steer clear of the mirena.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/12/2007 3:06:15 PM	I have to children, after my second child I decided to go for Mirena. Most of my family has it and they recommended it. I had a bit of cramping when it was first put in but it was worth it. I don't have to worry about it, you don't feel it and it doesn't bother your partner. Just make sure you are not having intercourse before you but in the IUD. I heard that my friend had it inserted and she had intercourse about five days earlier and she was pregnant at the time of the IUD put in. But other that that I hear many bad things from friends who don't even have it hummm.... Try it! Its  been great since I put it in. I believe the only side effect I have in the acne. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/10/2007 11:34:48 PM	I have had this device insertd after 2 pregnancies. It was a little painful when inserted but not too bad. spotting for a while but eventually went away. after the first time of using it removal didnt hurt at all i got pregnant within a month.  I chose mirena again because i dont have to worry about remembering to take the pill. my sex drive was low for a while but its coming back. with the first one the doctor cut the strings too short i couldnt find them so i went to the doctor they done a sonogram and it was still in so if you have that problem see the doctor its very easy to check.  if you have it put in make sure they cut the strings long they eventually soften and will not hurt your partner.

It was very pain upon insertion, spotted for a month or two off and on, but lately I have suffered with 3 to 4 vaginal itching in past 3 month and my blood sugar has been run kind of high. My sex drive is completely gone.I suffered with lot of mood swing (so my husband and son(17yrs old) tell me), have a rash on my chin and ear that I have been seen the dermatology for about 3 to for month (hard to get rid of. I have mild cramps sometimes.I am call my gyn tommorrow, think about having removed to many side effect going on, but overall very effect for prevention of pregancy and no period ( havent had a cycle in about 1 1/2 year.If you want to keep your sex drive no have it done.
Birth Control		5	5	4			12/4/2007 6:05:17 PM	I am very happy that I got the Mirena.  My cycle is light...if any.  I don't have the cramping and don't have to remember to take something everyday.  My one downer...my cycle seems to be higher when my stress level rises.

Ever since I've had it, I feel different. I'm having mood changes, nervousness and anxiety and 2 of my doctors don't think it's related.

Make sure everything is explained to you first!!!!!! It is effective but I am going thru alot of stress and unsurity about what is happening right now. 
Other	Heather, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1		35-44	11/28/2007 2:34:47 AM	I had this &quot;anchor&quot; put in 6 weeks ago, to help with the severity of my menstral cycle. Extremely painful to put in-to the point of shock (I was not warned of this previous to)...it wasn't pretty. Anyway, I have bled and had cramps everday since...and it's getting worse. I'm getting it removed next week. I figure going back to a few, predicted, days of heavy bleeding and cramps will be better than bleeding and cramps everyday. I would not recommend this, it was totally not worth it for me. 
Birth Control		5	5	4			11/27/2007 2:10:49 PM	I had no problems at all with insertion. A little cramping that evening but thats all. I spotted the first 3 months right around my time of the month, and then my periods stopped completely. Every now and then I may spot for a day or so. After about 6 months I started getting acne and now (almost a year into it)my acne is still around and my breasts get sore every few weeks. But its great. I don't have to think about it. My mid wife told me to wait a week till I had intercourse, but we did a few days later and my husbad had no complaints about the string &quot;poking&quot; him. I don't think I would want to use then after I am done having babies, but it's great for in between. I recommend this to anyone.

It was slightly painful to put in but I would do it again if i had to.  Its so nice, one less thing to worry about.  And lets be truthful, sometimes you go out and have a little to much to drink or whatever and you and your husband come home and forget the condom...well not a problem, not to mention when we get five minutes to be intimate with eachother we do not have time to mess around with condoms and such.

It was painful to put in, but worth it.  I have very light periods now and they have regulated.  I also like the fact I can try for another child right after having it removed.  I also don't have the moon swings pills and patches give me!  After your first child, try it!

I haven't had any kids, but they thought this was the best for me. since i've had it, i've been told it can cause infections such as UTI's and also PID. I've had constant spotting since it was inserted and also constant cramping. As of tomorrow i get it removed, but i'm afraid of it hurting like it did going in.

Birth Control	blewnee4924,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	3	Female		11/13/2007 3:08:39 PM	just got it put in a few days ago. It was very painful for me (i haven't had any kids and i have a small cervix). The pain subside a little by the end of the night. I have still had some cramping and back pains along with some spotting. So far, even with the pain, i am decently happy. Takes the stress of pregnancy out.
Birth Control		5	5	5			11/13/2007 12:32:48 PM	I have only had slight break through bleeding, which occurred mostly within the 1st year of insertion.  I have not had any periods or any pregnancy 'scares' like I did on the pill.

The insertion was painful but tolerable, and for two years now I have had much shorter and less painful periods - fantastic.  I don't have kids, which I know is when they usually like to do IUDs, but always hated the pill; Mirena has been great.
Birth Control	Mainegirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	11/11/2007 6:49:06 PM	I had mirena inserted because Dr was concerned about long-term effects of Depo-Provera injections(which has worked beautifully for nearly 10 years).  The insertion wasn't bad, but I developed lesions that made urination incredibly painful.  Eventually medication cleared that up, but I was dry, itchy and uncomfortable - intercourse was painful.  Dr. removed it after four months.  My allergist suspects a nickel allergy was the problem.  So, if you have many allergies, this may not be the answer for you.
Birth Control		5	5	4			11/11/2007 4:41:21 PM	I have had my mirena for almost 2 years now. I had very little pain upon insertion, about the same as a pap smear. My periods are lighter, shorter, and less frequent. I had heavy and unpredictable periods for the first few months, but after that it has been great!
Birth Control		5	3	2			11/10/2007 10:57:54 PM	It was very painful during insertion, and I have had alot of side effects from weight gain, depression, heavy vaginal discharge, cramps, and breast tenderness.  On the plus side, no period and no pregnancy.  Want it removed but worry it will hurt just as much.

I would highly recommend this product to my friends and family.
Birth Control	TiredMomma24, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	11/4/2007 3:28:05 PM	I initially started using mirena as a way to control my outrageously long and heavy periods. It took a while but after a year I almost never even have a period. And thankfully am no longer anemic. And I havnt gotten pregnant yet so its pretty effective  in that way.Im thinking of having it removed. Side effects are mild but I have been hearing way too many horror stories about it. I already know they cant find the string so If i did accidentally get pregnant I would have to try to carry to term with Mirena in me. If I didnt miscarry there are still other risks to a baby. I just don't want to take that chance. Plus i also think its been negatively effecting my sex drive.

I've had it for almost 3 years and I have some pain,I spot it seems with the season change, nothing heavy.A little scared about having it removed although putting it in was not that bad.
Birth Control	momoftwo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	10/25/2007 12:15:28 AM	I did a ton of research on birth control options, and was really excited abour Mirena. The insertion was slightly uncomfortable, and I had fairly heavy spotting for the first month -- both of which weren't that big a deal. My big complaint: it FELL OUT after 30 days! Pretty expensive birth control for one month (I paid $150 and the insurance company paid $500). My insurance won't cover another one (they only pay for one IUD every five years, somewhat understandable) and there is no guarantee from Mirena or my clinic. Basically I'm SOL. Threw $150 out the window. But I'm not bitter or anything...  :-)  PLEASE ask your OB about &quot;expulsion&quot; (the IUD falling out) if you're considering Mirena. I've read that anywhere from 2% to 30% (!) of users experience this (source: Internet medical websites).
Birth Control	momaf2, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	10/18/2007 4:28:08 PM	I have had the IUD in for almost two years. The first 9 months was okay, there was a lot of spotting, but other than that it was fine. But in the last year I've gained 40 pounds, had trouble sleeping, I've totally lost my sex drive, gotten acne and been having horrible mood swings. The side effects are different for everyone, but I would really encourage anyone thinking about getting Mirena to seriously look into all the possible side effects. On the plus side, I haven't gotten pregnant.

I had pretty intense cramps for a few days afterward. I still do have cramping every once in a while during and after sex, but it is still worth it.

Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/10/2007 11:36:43 AM	My husband and I have 3 beautiful children and needed a reliable method of birth control without giving up the option of having another later. I am over 35 and did not want the pill again. The procedure took only about 30 minutes and I don't have to think about it for another 5 years.

What should have been a three minute in and out procedure took over thiry minutes and even with topical numbing, it was incredibly painful.  However, after a few days, all was back to normal and I've no problems over the past few years.  Would recommend to other women, and highly recommend to other women who have already had a child.

Birth Control	trina1997, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/26/2007 3:41:45 PM	Putting the Mirena &quot;in&quot; wasn't very painful...I had lots of spotting for about 3 months afterwards.  I did seem to gain some weight and I started getting acne on my face.  However, now I am having an extremely light spotting for about 2 days once a month and I'm only 5 months into having the Mirena.  It's great for me since I have a blood clotting problem and can't use any estrogen birth control.  I am not having the extremly heavy periods every 2-3 weeks.  Hopefully my acne clears up and the removal is not too painful as well.  
Birth Control	otterpup, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	9/25/2007 7:32:11 PM	&quot;Installation&quot; was pretty uncomfortable.  I'd even venture to say it was painful, but only for a moment.  Then I wasn't sure I was going to make it through the first 3 months of having it in, because I bled constantly for that 3 months.  HOWEVER, once the bleeding stopped, it has been an absolute dream!  I've had it now for almost 2 years and my periods are so light, they're almost non-existent (a plus, in my book!)  My severe period cramping and bloating have also almost disappeared!  I can't see why anyone would not choose a Mirena!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	9/18/2007 12:32:39 AM	The initial spotting is bothersome.  Easy to use.  Painful to have removed.  Deffinitely recommended for anybody that is not ready to be steralized, but wants a long term birth control method that is easy to use.
