Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	indianaguy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	12/5/2010 11:42:50 AM	Chronic rhinitis since ~10 yrs old.  Constant nasal congestion requiring constant clearing of throat and frequent headaches.  Kinda like someone had punched me in the nose all the time, and somewhat darkened rings around the eyes.  Runners asthma during/ after 5+k runs.  Parents didn't get it, even though dad was a vet. Started taking allergy shots in early 20's with minimal benefit.  At age 41, noticed methylerythromycin cleared sinuses for about a week or two.  Consulted physician and he prescribed Flonase.  It worked wonderfully well...except for side effects which the physician said did not exist.  Two puffs daily year-round for about 8 years.Flonase side effects: * Weight gain, 7%, and this seemed to be muscle.* Occasional bloody nose, accompanied by scabbing that rarely healed.* White spots on tonsils accompanied by some infection?  Speculation:  Candida?* Joint soreness beginning about 2 or 3 years after start, and it got slowly worse.  Most of this can be associated with Lipitor that began about 6 years after starting Flonase.* Erectile dysfunction.  Lipitor was likely the main cause, but things returned to normal after ceasing Flonase 6 months.NasalCrom:2 puffs every 6 hours year around.  I can tell after about 5 hours the benefits are waning.  Benefits:* Minimal mucous in throat, reducing illness from colds to maybe one per year and despite working in a steel mill and on a farm around hay.* Lost the 7% weight gain experienced taking Flonase.  Unfortunately, this seemed to be mucsle mass.* Libido improved to normal.* No muscle soreness.* No white spots on tonsils.  These had been present for years while taking Flonase.* Runners asthma much less severe over no medication, and improved over Flonase.* No perceived negative side effects.
Other	Howard, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	3/4/2010 5:34:59 PM	Nasalcrom is a Mast Cell Inhibitor and prevents the release of histamine.  To be most effective, it needs to be used prophylactically.I have used Nasalcrom for about 20 years - started when it was a prescription drug for allergic rhinitis.  Once I got my sinuses healthy, I decreased dosage to once in the morning and once in the evening.  During seasons of high allergens or before mowing grass, which bothers me, I will dose up.  When I was under a allergy doctor's care years ago, he told me there were no known side effects and I could literally used every hour, if I felt that helped.  The recommended dosage in the OTC Nasalcrom now states something much less, like four times a day.  Some users may experience a stinging sensation in the noses for a few seconds and you may find you will get a white discharge (coagulated medication?) in the morning down the back of your throat.I believe Nasalcrom has helped me maintain healthy sinuses for years.  My allergist once told me he had treated a fellow he was convinced had a chronic sinus infection for more than 20 years.  Such acute infections take more than your standard 10 days of antibiotics to cure.  10 days just kills off the weak bugs and you end up with a superinfection from the superbugs.  Make no mistake.  If you have a sinus infection, it will take antibiotics to get rid of it.  If you have had cold symptoms for more than 2 weeks, it is most likely a sinus infection.  Go see your doctor!  I have not had a sinus infection since being on Nasalcrom (20+ years).FDA clears Nasalcrom for over-the-counter saleBusiness Wire, Jan 6, 1997 http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_ 1997_Jan_6/ai_18990834/
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	55-64 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	12/22/2009 3:31:31 PM	I've been using Nasalcrom for about 8 years.  It has mainly rendered my previous bad allergies to almost nothing with regular use.  Not even pseudofedrine with decongestant worked consistently for me.  Highly  recommended!
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	12/19/2009 2:31:20 PM	Still discovering what my newly-blooming problem has been for te past couple of years. Allergy tests say allergies, but of the antihistamines, Rx and OTC, tried so far, none have had any effect. Symptoms have been manageable except addition of nighttime stuffiness two months ago. Mouth-breathing by mid-sleep equaled bad sleep. Oxy sprays worked, but can only use for three days. Then I discover NasalCrom. By the second day of 4x, I was staying clear all day and night. A week later, I went to 3x, and am now 2x, early a.m. and late p.m. (if I even remember the a.m. since I've been so clear). I'm sold! and ready to buy it in bulk someplace! (Alas, apparently not much discounts on this.)
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	Wendy in AZ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/24/2009 5:23:01 PM	My husband, 11 year old daughter and myself have used this medication for about 8 months. It takes about 3 days of 4-5 times per day to become effective, and then we go to once or twice a day.  We have noticed no side effects, except it tasted nasty at first.In previous years, we have taken every OTC medication and then ended up in urgent care anyway because nothing worked well.  This last year was the first year we did not have to get the steroid shots.  What's even better is that we can decide when we need to take it and when we don't need to take it.  Just as long as we have that three day window, we can plan to take it around events we know will trigger our allergies (gymkhana, trail rides, stacking hay, cleaning barns), and then go off nasalcrom when we're done. Great stuff!!

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	Snugfitstudio, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	4/25/2008 9:01:55 PM	Nasalcrom works great for me, much better than antihistamine tablets that make me drowsy. If I wait until I get symptoms, releif starts in 2-3 days and full relief of symptoms in 1 week. Protection against pollin continues all season.

I do not use it all the time. Once in the a.m. and once at night if needed. I can't seem to get a description of side effects.Edmund Parent
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	9/26/2007 2:59:00 PM	I have been using this medication for about 8 years now and up until now it has worked very well for me. Now, it's not working as well as it used to, and it has given me breathing problems. I wouldn't recomend really long term use of this medication.
