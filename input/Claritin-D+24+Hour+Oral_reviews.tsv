Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	35-44	9/8/2012 4:36:24 PM	Worked great for my allergies, but due to my extreme sensitivity to pretty much every allergen, I was on this, and similar medications for almost 7 years every day.  Do not ignore the potential for mood changes, mental state of mind changes, outbursts or anxiety- these are very real and ruined my marriage.  I've been off this stuff for 2 weeks and feel different. Yes, my allergies are terrible, but I'm treating with natural methods.  This drug made my body change including facial swelling around the eyes.  Since I've been &quot;free&quot; I have not had any outbursts, or mood changes.  Too bad it's probably too late to save my marriage.

Other	bamaman, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2	Male	35-44	8/10/2012 9:25:53 AM	As with others, it cleared up my allergy symptoms within a few days of starting it, But I had a headache, jitters, and nausea. These side effects were worse when I stopped the meds for 1-2 days. 
Seasonal Runny Nose	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	5/15/2012 10:07:37 AM	Definitely has helped with my allergies and symptoms, but I have been making the mistake of taking it before bed and have not been able to stay asleep. I also feel hot at night. It seems like there has been many accounts of this happening, so don't take it at night!
Stuffy Nose	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	5/10/2012 9:55:42 PM	I took this drug this yesterday and this morning for congestion and I am having insomnia, I feel very weak and tired, I had trouble focusing at work, I feel dizzy, and my heart is pounding.

Other	lisa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	1/23/2012 8:34:57 AM	Take the 12 hour treatment instead of 24 hour and don't take it before bedtime... you won't sleep a wink!  My heart and mind were both racing all night long!
Cold Symptoms	Robin, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	1/17/2012 6:27:21 PM	I was struggling with cold symptoms for 3 days(watery, itchy eyes, running nose and congestion) hoping that the virus would run it's course and get over soon with lots of rest.  Unfortunately, the symptoms worsened by the end of the 3rd day. My husband bought Claritin-D 24 hour for me.  I took it at 6 in the evening and had relief of symptoms shortly after taking.  I felt great and wished I would have started it 3 days earlier.  The only problem is that I could not sleep a wink.  It is now 24 hours later and the symptoms are starting to return.  I am afraid to take it again. I may hold off tonight and consider taking 1/2 tablet as soon as I wake in the morning.
Other	12SBOJV, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/9/2012 3:12:31 PM	This medicine does its job: stops my sneezing,itching and eye-watering, and clears out my sinuses which relieves some of the pressure and helps with the headaches.  The only negative thing is that it makes me restless....i took it the first time at 10pm and didn't sleep at all that night (my own stupid mistake since it has a high dose of pseudoephedrine) I've started taking it in the morning, and only when i really, really need it.  It helps.

I also get sinus infections 2-3 times a year. This is the only medication I have found that works to clear up sinus dranage. Works great for itchy watery eyes and sneezing also. I only take it when I have severe symptoms. Otherwis my body seems to get immune to it.

I could not attend conference for 3 days due to severe allergy attack. Available over the counter, it is the only medicine I choose and know I will get fast relief.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	12/17/2010 10:34:45 AM	I took the medication at 1pm in the afternoon, and that night I only slept a total of 30 minutes. I layed in bed from 9pm until 5am (when I had to get up for work).

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	5/18/2010 5:26:29 PM	I was on regular Claritin for months for allergies and it did nothing, so my doctor suggested I try Claritin-D. It works great on most of my symptoms, but I have to take it first think in the morning, or else I can't sleep. Other side effects I experienced are slight restlessness (just feels like more energy), and slight loss of appetite (I'm on a diet at the moment, so both are actually beneficial, but I am keeping a close eye on both side effects in case they increase in intensity).
Other	anonymous, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	25-34	5/11/2010 10:47:51 PM	I have seasonal and non-seasonal allergies. Claritin D helps a great deal with my symptoms but does not completely alleviate all of my symptoms at all times.  I would recommend it to seasonal allergy sufferers. 
Sneezing	Jodi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	3/4/2010 3:11:27 PM	After taking this medicine...extreme tiredness, sleeplessness, dry mouth, just plain don't feel good.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/21/2010 12:26:35 PM	I've taken Claritin D 24 Hr daily by prescription for about 15 years &amp; have avoided getting sinus &amp; bronchial infections that typically follow congestion caused by my allergies. It did rais my pulse and blood pressure a little, but they're still slightly below &quot;normal&quot;. Otherwise, I've had no negative side effects.
Stuffy Nose	Bluecat2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	1/29/2010 4:31:43 PM	I don't feel sick, this is not a cold that I have.  Did not work at all.  No side effects, nothing.  If anything, made the congestion worse.  Large pill to swallow.
Cold Symptoms	clogged1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	12/27/2009 5:23:24 PM	I have to take the 24-hour version at about noon, or I can't sleep at night.   The decongestant wears off somewhat by evening, but my sinuses are still better than they would be without medication.

The swelled jowles, inflamed sinus, and generally cold like symptoms.  This stuff works.  I want to report that I can not take this medicine as much as I need to, however, because it causes extreme erectile dysfunction.  No way can I get a rise after taking the stuff.  The other side effects are not nearly as intrusive and obvious as the ED.

This drug is bad news, and I am having difficulty seeing a caregive in the fear that I will now have a preexisiting heart condition. BEWARE OF THIS DRUG!!!
Other	jr78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	9/9/2009 12:03:12 PM	Worked for my throat problems, but terrible side effects: general jitters, then a feeling of extreme sleepiness, followed by a feeling that it is harder to take deep breath.
Other	Tiger, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	8/13/2009 2:28:32 PM	For the past 8 months, I have had frequent stuffiness/sneezing/even chest congestion. My doctor suggested I might have developed an allergy to something.  A relative suggested Claritin D and it has been a miracle!  I'm finally able to breathe freely, stop using tissues by the box, and feel GOOD.  Side effects: Perhaps a slight decrease in appetite and restlessness, which could be also described as more energy.

I can honestly say this is the first time I can honestly say my syptoms are virtually gone. The slight dry mouth is a small price to pay for being able to breath for the first time in I can't remember when.Taking a med once a day could not be more convenient.

I have also experienced a headache, but this could just be from the sinus pressure and not a direct effect from the drug.

I would not recommend this to anyone who works the night shift.  It doesn't allow you to sleep for an extended period of time.
Allergic Conjunctivitis	way2be, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	35-44	6/5/2008 9:48:21 PM	Almost immediate improvement of scratchy/sore throat, sinus congestion.  Decongestion effects seemed to wear off after couple weeks but still helpful.  Decreased need to use exedrin for severe sinus headaches.  Increased alertness and felt somewhat keyed up (but not agitated).  Decreased overall need for rest/sleep, including much later bedtime and no weekend napping...huge change for me.  Restless sleep but easy waking.  Changes/fluctuations in mood noticed, including increased needless worry/obsessing.  Overall, drug seems helpful but with noticeable (some helpful, others not so helpful) side effects.   
Seasonal Runny Nose	angief18, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	45-54	5/27/2008 5:20:17 PM	I started yesterday and today I feel very emotional. Last night had nightmares and very bad sleep. I feel tense and not myself. Was not able to concentrate at work so I had to come home. I have never experienced such side efects with a medication. It worked great for my allegy symptoms but other than that it has been an unpleasant experience. Also the nurse at work took my blood preasure and it was 150/80 which mine is usually low between 90/60. I also have a bad headache.

Only side effect so far is occasional chills.  I have terrible allergies, so it's worth the chills and being in 90 degree Florida, it's a good thing!
