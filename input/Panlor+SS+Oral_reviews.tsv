Pain	gary4sunshine, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	2/8/2011 2:51:14 PM	I have Peripheral Neuropathy,HypoThyroidism &amp; Degenerative Disc/Joint Disease. 3 surgeries with no relief from pain. My Neurologist wants me off Percocet(which was working somewhat) because the DEA is cracking down? But after 3rd day on Panlor SS, the pain was unbearable, so I'm taking 1 1/2 tablets every 8 hrs now, which is helping, but I'm pretty fatigued. Probably going back to Percocet.

Pain	azzie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/23/2010 10:42:43 PM	i have been taking panlor for about 6 years. to prevent migraines, my dosage is 4 a day. it has been extremely effective, however, without it, i experience severe withdrawal symptoms. i am easily agitated and my migraines are far worse. this drug can be addictive. if you are being treated with this drug or plan to, all i can recommend is to make sure you have your re-fills in order.

Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/31/2009 5:36:24 PM	I have suffered with migraines for over 36 years.  I have been on all medications.  Finally, a doctor gave me this medication to take for breakthrough migraines.  This is the only medication that will stop the migraines in their tracks.  Now I no longer have to go get shots when I get bad bad migraines that my regular medication does not stop.  This is the best medication I would recommend for migraines.   I can still focus, and function.  Only negative impact is I get a little sluggish but it stops the migraine and that is so worth it.

This product actually did what my dr. said it would! Took care of my pain and i wasn't all mentally cloudy! I know not everyone is the same but I would recommend 1st if i was a dr. anyway that is my opinon for what it is worth
