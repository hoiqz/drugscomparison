Rheumatoid Arthritis	skylands, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	8/3/2012 2:54:39 AM	I have been receiving cimzia injections for RA for the past four months.  The first  month it was like a magic bullet. My symptoms were tremendously improved and I was able to do so much more again and had more energy. I was thrilled.  The second and third month I could feel the symptoms under the surface and did not have near the energy I had initially.  The last shot only seemed to last two weeks.  I have been bruising easily and darkly (black), all the bones in my feet hurt. My feet are swollen and ankles and knees and hips hurt.  I am anxious to heaer reviews from other RA sufferers.

I haven't felt a remarkable improvement in my Crohn's symptoms. All the drug has done for me is reduce the loud bowel sounds.  As far as side effects, I've had joint pain &amp; stiffness, hair loss, weight gain(3-5 lbs after every dose), anxiety &amp; anger issues, &amp; forgetfulness. I just stopped taking Cimzia about a month ago &amp; I feel so much better. Less joint stiffness, starting to lose the weight I gained, more energy, &amp; a vast improvement in my mood. My doctor needs to find a better treatment for me. I've had Crohn's for 24 yrs, been in remission for 22 yrs &amp; just started flaring up again about 2 yrs ago.

I had previously taken Enbrel and Humira and never felt as well as I do now.  Hope this lasts!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Tish, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	7/18/2012 1:46:19 PM	I just took my second set of shots so it is still kicking in. I have previously been on Enbrel and Humira, which lost their effectiveness for me.  I noticed a difference after giving myself the first 2 shots of Cimzia. My inflammation and pain started diminishing within the first 2-3 days. During the 2 weeks between the shots, I have seen further reduction in my inflammation, however I could tell when it was time for the second set of shots due to recurring pain. Hoping I see further reduction of the inflammation and even less pain from my RA. Also, these shots are nothing compared to the Humira pen.  Looking forward to getting my life back.

I completed the program and after 3 months the RA has started to return..It works but at $2,500 per shot (2a mo needed) I can't get it on Medicare...
Crohn's Disease	sickofit, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	2	Female	35-44	5/10/2012 8:20:52 PM	I started cymzia in 1/12, developed numbness in my back after the load up dose. Went off it for 2 months, had MRI, nothing is wrong at all according to the results. I have felt confused and lost at times, feel like I am on a spinner and someone keeps flicking me around in the circle, sick to my stomache all the time. The doc thinks I am fine. I'm afraid to tell him that I just feel worse, he acted like there was no other choice but cymzia or remicade. I really think that I felt so much better on the asacol hd alone. I want to be able to keep on working, and this cymzia had me so tired and confused it really makes it difficult to even get out of bed. Is anyone else having the back numbness and/or spinning feeling?

As well as life changing arthritis.Please, help your get out of the fetal position promising God you will never put anything in your mouth ever again.You deserve to have your disease better controlled.Please ask for Remicade. You will experience Life again.God Bless You AllDhoward

After the last surgery my gastro put me on Remicade.  After 4 Remicade doses I developed numbness in my hands when sleeping, which progressed to extreme muscle &amp; joint stiffness.  There were days I could hardly walk.  I refused to take any more Remicade.  The rhumalogist I was referred to suggested Cimzia, that it had fewer side effects.  I really hate having to self-inject it.  I also noticed the muscle &amp; joint stiffness starting, though not as severe as before.  I don't really notice any difference in my Crohn's symptoms, so I don't know if it's helping or not.  I am gaining weight, not happy about that.  Now after being on Cimzia about 8 months, I have a MRSA skin infection.  Not happy about that either.  Really wondering if I should keep taking these so called biologic drugs.  The last surgery was harder on me, took longer to recover.  I don't know what's worse, surgery or these drugs that mess with your immune system.
Crohn's Disease	angie21martin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	2	3	Female	25-34	3/6/2012 5:47:59 PM	Well my fiance has crohns(over 18 years now)  and has been put on this medication recently. He gets the acne all over his chest and shoulders, a rash all over his stomach, and night sweats. When he first got the shots he immediately got a U.T.I.(first one since he was 10, he's 28 now) which turned into double kidney infection with multiple kidney stones within days. While in the hospital being treated for the U.T.I. he caught MRSA(antibiotic resistant staph) with Cellulitis in his neck and face... was a horrible experience for the both of us. We were in the hospital for two weeks. The antibiotics weren't getting rid of the MRSA. We also stopped using Cimzia while in the hospital since he had an infection. After much prayer and research we found ELECAMPANE ROOT(tincture) and Copper Pills and in less then 12 hours his white blood cell count went from 35,000 and rising to 12,500. He went home two days later, infection gone. We, just a few days ago, gave him his other dose of Cimzia shots. My fiance is laying next to me crying and in agony from his Crohn's pain right now. Breaks my heart :( wish I knew what I could do or find to help him...
Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	2/24/2012 12:57:19 PM	I was diagnosed with RA 11 years ago and have been on biologics for the past 7 years.  My shoulder has been giving me fits for a couple of years with no relief from anything we have tried.  I switched to CIMZIA in January and within 3 days of my first injection my shoulder stopped hurting!  So far, so good.
Crohn's Disease	Annie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	25-34	1/30/2012 1:47:37 AM	I've been on cimzia for 2yrs and it has lasted longer than humira and remicad (both worked for about 6months and then they stopped working), just recently started having a big flare up again. Hoping this medicine will still work because it's been great except for the nights I give myself shots ( I get swelling and rashes where I do the injection and the next day I have a massive headache) but I'd take those symptoms over my crohn's symptoms any day! 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Emelia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/27/2012 1:54:50 AM	I have had RA for 4 years. I have been very pleased with the effectiveness; short time period it took to start getting relief; the careful consideration in the design of the product. Had tried several biologics with limited or no relief of symptoms. Cimzia has a loading dose unlike the other biologics I had used. I found relief within a month. Had problems with my other biologics &quot;wearing off&quot; a couple days prior to next injection. This has not happened with Cimzia. Have not suffered from many side effects. Have some irritation at the injection site which resolves within a couple days. The injection can cause a burning sensation during administration but bringing the drug to room temp and icing the injection site prior to admin does help decrease that. Have had thrush which was treated with one dose oral pill. Have had one flare while on Cimzia but I had a respiratory infection and had to hold my injection for several weeks. However, once I restarted I had immediate relief again. The syringe has the most thoughtful design I have ever used as it has large grip,and large plunger to push, and a soft silicone ring on the cap making it easy to remove. The plunger moves with ease so this has worked well for limited mobility. The texture of the materials reduces slippage, easy to grip and don't have to use forceful movements to administer. I worked as a Registered Nurse and have used many syringes this is by far the most consumer friendly that I have used.The packaging is also thoughtful as it uses velcro to secure it shut, no box fumbling.

Although I have one issue, every time I get my injections I start feeling light headed while I am receiving them. I have even passed out 2 times. Does this happen to anyone else? Not sure what is going on
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Lou, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	11/16/2011 10:30:27 AM	I was diagnosed with RA 3 years ago. I've been on Cimzia 4 months. My energy level is better. What it hasn't helped is the pain in my legs at night. I let the shots sit out for a half hour before using. Have had no side effects to speak of. Use Ibuprofen for pain when needed. It doesn't last very long. God Bless all of you that have to live with RA. It is a bummer.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Just Me, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	11/15/2011 9:41:17 AM	I have had my first two &quot;loading&quot; doses.  My RA was diagnosed about 20 years ago, and I have tried just about every medication there is for RA.  One of the nurses at the infusion office told me about Cimzia so my doctor said lets try it.  So far I do not see any difference - time will tell.  I am to take 2 shots every 4 weeks.  I am a bit upset by the posts here saying that it is difficult and painful.  I find it so much easier than an infusion.  You need to let the syringes sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before injecting (this is in the instructions), and give the injection either in the top of your leg (thigh) or stomach.  I do not find it painful.  At first there is the slight &quot;burning sensation&quot; but it goes away in minutes.  When injecting you need to take your time since the solution is thick-this is not something that you just stick, push, and go.  But you actually have to slowly push the plunger on the syringe.  I am hoping that this works for me.  The fatigue and joint damage is taking its tole.  Just need to stop the damage and find some energy.
Crohn's Disease	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	11/4/2011 1:19:16 AM	I've had Crohn's disease for 4 years.  I've tried Remicade, which worked well for a while until I developed anti-bodies and had to stop taking it.  Humira worked for about 6 months and then I became allergic to that too.  I've been on Cimzia for 14 months and it has kept me in a remission (the longest I've had since my initial diagnosis).  I had a fissure &amp; abscess which required surgery.  Cimzia has prevented it from returning.  I'm very happy with the results and lack of side effects thus far.  My doctor is optimistic that I'll continue to be able to tolerate it since I've been on it for twice as long as any previous medications. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/22/2011 11:13:49 AM	24 hours after starting this drug, I began to get hives. They lasted about 9 days, getting progressively worse each day. I had some in my mouth as well. I was advised I could try a second dose if I had an epipen ready in case I had a severe allergic reaction. I am not prepared to try that, so I stopped the drug. The hives were so itchy and uncomfortable. I did feel an increase in my energy level after one dose; hope I can find another biologic that will work for me. Good luck everyone.

I have had one bowel resection 1 foot of intestine gone. I too suffer from chronic fatigue muscle fatigue and sleep issues. As well as shortness of breathe. Cimzia was a mixed bag but for me i gave up on it because of the people i had to deal with in obtaining it. And worse I had gall bladder attacks that i thought was crohns but found out otherwise. I have had my gall bladder removed and the sharp pain in the center top of my stomache has stopped. I still suffered severe lose stools. But between a drug called colestipol and immodium ad which seems to be hard to get now I am improving. In the end i do not know if cimzia helped or not i guess i will find out soon enough. I hate this disease it is hell and would not wish it on anyone with the exception of our politicians lol. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	55-64	10/11/2011 10:37:22 PM	I am currently participating in a drug study of Cimzia with my rheumatologist.  It's a bit inconvenient to drive 60 miles each way every two weeks for the blood work and injections.  There is definite relief  when taking thiese injections.  
Rheumatoid Arthritis	sunny, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/28/2011 9:59:50 PM	I had rheumatoid arthritis for over 20 years.  I am in my 50's now and was using Remicade but developed serious allergies. Cimzia is my miracle drug. I had the shots now twice (2 months).  I m getting 2 shots of 200 mg each once a month.  i feel wonderful as if I never had this disease. I am able to exercise with weights now  Before my hands and feet were in so much pain.  I have lots of energy. I work full time.  The only thing I am feeling is my heart racing more but if that's the noly thing i have to go through then, i m fine with that.  also the shots don'hurt as much and it is so fast!  Hope all of you do well too.

Drove me to try Cimzia after trying everything else non-biological.  Started Cimzia in June 09 after having my second kid and it has been a blessing ever since.  I am an avid weight lifter since age 14 and it gave me all my strength back and I don't know I am even on a drug.  I do have increased sinus infections during winter but I also have little kids that are germ factories.  I just hope the drug keep working.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	billie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	55-64	7/15/2011 12:00:41 PM	My last post was around 6/15/11 after I finished my starter pack.My fatigue is still better but the pain and inflammation are not better.I took 2/200mg shots yesterday and I will once a month.My doctor said it may take 2 to 3 months to get the full effect.I hope it works because so far nothing else has.My hands seem to be getting worse and I have all over pain sometime especially in legs,hands back.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Katie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	2	Female	55-64	7/6/2011 7:58:33 PM	I was on Enbrel for 7 yrs and it stopped working. Just finished my starter pack with Cimzia and also taking 5 mg prednisone. WIthout the prednisone the Cimzia doesnt seem too effective.  I am in pain and feel the RA. It is very painful to inject and so far doesnt seem worth the intense pain.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	billie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	55-64	7/3/2011 8:57:26 AM	Hello, I just want to up date my Cimzia results.My last up date was on 6/17/2011 and I was just a few days pass my starter pack.My fatigue is alot better I have more energy than I have had in a long time.It is really nice since I am raising my 3 year old granddaughter.MY pain and inflammation are not really better yet.My doctor called to ask how I was feeling since I had so much trouble with pass medicines.I told him about the fatigue being better and I can deal with the pain as long as I feel better.He said I should have the full affect of the Cimzia by 3 months.I will be taking 2/200mg shots once a month now my next one will be 7/15.I will post again the last of July.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	billie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	55-64	6/19/2011 11:18:57 AM	HEllo, on the 17th I posted that I had just taked my third set of 2 200mg shots my  starter pack.Anyway I auctually think I feel alittle better.Yesterday I felt better than I have in a long time except for one spot in my lower back.I feel pretty good today so far,just alittle weak in my legs.But I don't feel as fatigued as I usually do.I hope I finally found something to work.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	billie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	3	Female	55-64	6/17/2011 10:09:52 PM	I just took my third set of shots on6/15/11 second 2 shots on 6/1/11 and first 2 shots on 5/17/11.I can't really tell any difference in the way I feel.I still have so much fatigue.My all over body pain might be a little better but not much.Maybe I'm expecting to much out of these R A drugs.I still have depression feel so tired.I take vicodin and motrin for pain.I pray that it will work.I have used Humaria,Rotuxin,and Orencia.Humeria worked for 8 mo.If a drug works should you feel like you don't have R A are is that to much to hope for.Hope it will work for someone else.Also I have had no side affects to Cimzia.

I am into my monthly shots and I have developed terribly itchy rashes on my arms.  They are extremely itchy and red.  Weight gain seems to be an issue too.  Pain has gotten better, less of it. Less dizziness also.

Only the occasional Motrin now, so Cimzia has been effective....and yes I am still taking Methotrexate. Be sure to inject very slowly which causes no pain and no bruising.

The cimzia does not have the energy high associated with remicade, but it doen not have the total energy drain when the drug wears off either. I have developed night sweats in the past month (5 months after starting cimzia). I also have frequent cramping in my knees, thighs and feet primarily, at night. All-in-all, I do not think cimzia has proven effective in treating my crohn's disease. I may have my doctor change me to another biologic (humira, etc.)
Crohn's Disease	shawna s, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	2	Female	25-34	5/12/2011 6:47:14 PM	Unlike many of the others I did not have extreme pain or problematic bowel movements.  I had (and still have) three fistulae.  I have not noticed any changes after 4 montths of using cimzia.  The side effects that I have are pain during the shot (it burns soo badly it makes me cry) and swelling after.  Sometimes it bleeds a lot and leaves a huge bruise.  I also feel narcoleptic the night after the shot and the next day or two.  I administer the shot myself, so it is really tough to do the seccond shot.  I also get muscle spasms in my legs and my knees hurt often now.  Those started soon after my second dose and still occur.  My acne is worse than it has ever been in my life.  I had bad skin as a teen, but this is ridiculous!  It's not just on my face, but my back, neck and chest.  If I don't see any crohn's improvement soon, I may have to stop in just for the acne and leg muscle spasms.  I hope that it actually helps everyone else!  Good luck!

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Wilma, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/13/2011 6:28:20 PM	The price for Cimzia is obscene!!!  When my health insurance ends, I'm screwed big time.  We must continue the fight for Universal, single-payer health care.  I am an RA patient and I work in Clinical Trials for RA patients.  My patients are suffering and can't afford this medicine.  These medicines for RA (Biologics) cost practically nothing to make and the pharmaceuticals recoup their research costs in just a few years, for example, Enbrel today is pure profit for the drug companies, raking in tens of thousands of dollars per year per patient.
Crohn's Disease	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	4/6/2011 11:55:13 PM	This drug has been a lifesaver!  I started feeling better right after the first shot. Besides a headache after the first dose, I haven't had any other symptoms. I hate having to give myself injections, but it's definitely worth it.

Developed allergen to Remicade. I have been on CIMZIA for two years; am now developing an all over &quot;itch,&quot; and battling a nasty cellulitis infection.  Crohns doctor and dermatologist appointments are both weeks away.  Not sure if this CIMZIA related I believe it is.  Anyone else experience this?

Its has caused hypersensitivity i cant go outside or in a light room with out glasses, it also caused me to get optic neuritis in my right eye, im now having nerve problems because of this so called &quot;medicine&quot; and just took a neuro-psych test because my doctors think Cimzia has made me Bi-Polar. This drug sucks and has caused nothing more than to make me get sicker &amp; develop more illnesses. PLEASE DISCUSS WITH YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT THE SIDE EFFECTS!!!! I did and he blew off my concerns with &quot;its really rare thatll never happen to you and TA DAH!! THANKS CIMZIA!!(SARCASM)

It has decreased my stomach pain greatly, I no longer take anything for pain other than OTC now.  However my bathroom visits are quite frequent still.  Every time I eat my stomach becomes extremely upset, so I eat less.  But other than that Cimzia does help.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	65-74 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	2	1		65-74	2/3/2011 7:17:43 PM	I had been on Humira for five years when it stopped working.   My doctor then put me on Cimzia.  That was ten months ago.  About three months ago, I began to suffer from extreme fatigue, difficulty breathing, weight loss, rashes and increased joint pain.  As my condition continued to deterioate, I called my doctor for help.  He advised me to discontinue use of the Cimzia and scheduled an appointment to review my situation.  He informed me that I was suffered from the side effects of Cimzia. It was very scary since I almost died.  This medication should be monitored very carefully. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	BLM, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	55-64	1/27/2011 8:59:47 PM	I am fairly new to the medication, had 2 mo of Cimzia thus far. It burns at 1st but seems to be working for RA. I hope they come out with an easier way to inject. I am able to do steps better, and walk longer since starting this med. Hope it keeps getting better so I can get off some of the other pain relief meds I am on.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	CaAfAm, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	1/14/2011 2:13:10 PM	RA is a nasty condition and I was diagnosed 2 years ago. I have tried various meds, just like you and here's what I found to help me.Injections are more painful than taking pills (hence the 'ease of use' rating), but the relief from pain is wonderful. I have a prescription for 400mg (2 shots) once a month, but feel that I need it more often. I am also taking Methotrexate and daily Motrin (600mg twice a day since I am an Rn and work  12 hours shifts 2/3 times/week). Humira did not have the instant relief and so I don't know if it is longer lasting. NOW, I can dance, walk and jog and at last loose the weight from the Prednisone gain.Yeah!! Here is to 2011 being a new year. I pray that God be with you and help you through His Word as it has encouraged me.

I am currently on Cimzia and just wanted to  comment about the biggest side effect that I noticed was extreme fatigue the day after the injection. Other than that the drug has been working pretty good.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	bobaloo, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	45-54	12/1/2010 1:49:52 PM	I've had RA for 25 years.  Enbrel worked great for about two years.  Switched to cimzia in July, four months ago.  My pain has improved but not to the effectiveness of Enbrel at its best.  I have not been able to taper prednisone yet, which has been a goal; still on 10mg.  I'm somewhat satisfied because I was so much worse last summer, basically disabled.  Now, I'm able to work but not exercise.

I am also taking Methotrexate and folic acid. After my first injection of cimzia my psoriasis is clearing up fast and I have a bit more energy but I have not noticed any effects on my swelling (yet). I am hopeful.

I was recently In a clinical trial for Cimzia for about 4 or 5 years. I had to go off the trial because I had a flare up and had to start taking Prednisone. It took me several months to get better. Tat was about 18 months ago.  I recently had another mild flare up. I believe the drug has lost it's efficacy, but my docter thinks this is the best drug out there. I felt better when on Azzufadine. It seems like a safer drug...less side affects. I don&quot;t know what to think. I haven't taken Cimzia for 2 months and don't feel any worse.

I have had allergic reactions to ALL the other RA meds on the market. I started taking Cimzia a year ago. Because I have so many problems with meds, my doctor and I decided that I would give my injections every two weeks. not the once a month. I have had no side affect doing this. The cimzia has no preservative, this is  what enables me to take it. I went over seven years not able to take anything. Good Luck

Other	Lee, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	65-74	9/8/2010 11:40:49 AM	I have had Ulcerative colitis since 2002. Went thru all the medications, including Remicade which caused me to lose 50 lbs.Had 15-20 BM's a day &amp; so weak I had to rest several times if I tried to mow the yard. I had to give up exercise &amp; golf and couldn't go out for dinner or to the store without several trips to the bathroom.  I began self injecting Cimzia in Sept 2009. Sure, it stings a little, but if I inject slowly there's no problem.  By Dec 2009 I was gaining weight &amp; back in the gym.  My Dr said OK to using Imodium as needed.  Now have 1 or 2 BM's a day. If I get gas, Beano or Gas-X takes care of the problem. Pizza is back on my diet if I go real light on the sauce. No popcorn. I now play golf (walk)regularly and recently played 45 holes w/out incident - (last 18 holes with a cart).  Just took an enjoyable 2 week driving vacation without incident.  I have gained back the weight I lost with Remicade.  With Cimzia my life is almost back to normal even though I have to remain aware that the U.C. is still with me.  If I'm playing golf, out on a boat or traveling, I know the Cimzia is working, so I just take my Imodium &amp; I'm good for the day.  Something that I could never do B/4 Cimzia.

I felt reduced inflammation and the flu-like feeling over my entire body is gone. I just have a few concerns that I have read on the internet about it causing heart disease and lymphoma, but if I feel better while taking it, I guess I will take it.

I have had some improvement, but I have also had 3 different infections in as many months, uti, staph infection in my eye, and now an infection in my esophagus. This had never been a problem on my other meds. I will be discussing this with my RA doc in the upcoming week, and hopefully find a resolution.

I only take Pentasa when I get the side effect from the Cimzia. I have decided that Cimzia is a good drug and I did love it while it lasted but its not for me. Joint damage is setting in and also nerve damage, not sure wut the reason for that is though, (nerve damage)... I can't feel a simple touch right now and I deffinatly felt it before.... any one with any insight, e-mail me hotlips_2007@rock.com

Crohn's Disease	whymoore, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	7/25/2010 4:36:58 AM	I've been on this drug for 5 months now, and it has helped with the abdominal pain.  However, the diarrhea is still a daily occurance, although generally limited to only 1 to 2 times a day, which is an improvement.  My concern is I have very little energy, get shortness of breath a lot, and now my muscles have started hurting.  I'm used to having joint pain, but this muscle pain is new to me.  Also, I have gotten a pretty bad bacterial infection twice that was very painful and required a double does of antibiotics both times to get over, not fun!  My doctor really wants me on this drug, but I am not sure I'm going to last much longer on it.  I've been fortunate in that I've always only had moderate Crohn's, no hospital stays or operations, but my doctor thought I was headed that way and that's why he put me on this drug.  I just don't know if it's worth it though.  Wondering if anyone else has had the muscle pain issue?  I think that is what is scaring me the most right now.  Also, I self inject and have not had any real issues with that, sometimes there is stinging, but not too bad, and sometimes I barely notice any stinging at all.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Tricia, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/27/2010 3:16:13 PM	I was diagnosed with R/A in 2000. Like many of you I've had several different medications to try and control the pain, stiffness, and overall yuncky feeling. Some worked for a while then stopped others didn't work at all. I'm scheduled to start my first dose of Cimzia tomorrow. However, after reading your reviews I'm doubtful that I'll preceed with the injections. One thing you all stated as a side effect was the tiredness for several days along with vomiting. Some of you also mentioined rashes in area other than the injection site. I believe I'll ask to restart Enbrel. I wish you all the very best in your health.

So far yes...but not if I develop cancer because of the drug.. which at one time I had to stop it cause I thought I had..But have now resumed. Do your reasearch..and make sure you always talk to your GI doctor about any of your concerns.

Tried Remicade and then got Serum Sickness - so no more Remicade.  Tried Humira - didn't work. 3rd loading dose of Cimzia last Sunday. I feel good and have a ton of energy the day after the shot then it is downhill from there. I am gaining quite a bit a weight and I don't understand why.  I hope this will help me but I still feel sick with diarrhea, pain in the lower right side.  Just don't feel well. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	tggatsby, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	4/1/2010 7:47:18 PM	I have had RA for 5 years (diagnosed); had allergic reactions to Remicade, but had pretty great success with Humira until about two months ago, then was switched to Enbrel and experienced no relief.Just started Cimzia, and have been on Methotrexate the entire time. Nothing really has changed, but this is my first &amp; second dose only. I am really hopeful for pain relief and some relief from overwhelming fatigue and accompanying depression...I will keep posting as time progresses. Right now my frustration level is so high, any kind of relief for the pain and exhaustion will be so welcome.
Crohn's Disease	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	35-44	3/29/2010 10:03:27 PM	I have had Crohn's for 20 years and have been on every available medication and nothing has worked other than prednisone. My doctor prescribed cimzia after Humira failed to work in order to help get me off the prednisone. I've been on Cimzia since Feb. My abdominal pain has become less severe and other than extreme fatigue the day after, my overall level of energy seems better as well. However, I've experienced extreme weight gain 12 lbs in 6 weeks and my diarrhea has actually gotten worse. Unfortunately for me, I'm not sure the small improvements will be worth the side effects.

I feel good. I do have brief morning stiffness of my hands in the morning but that's it. By the time I'm dressed and leaving for work I'm great. I have not experienced any swelling or joint pain since starting this drug. I have noticed small rashes on my arms and legs. Other than that I'm good. I've been living with RA since I was 13yrs old and at 28 its good to know that I've finally found something that appears to be working! Good luck to everyone living with RA.

Never been in remission and has always been very very sick. Feeding tubes for 3 years, Remicade, even a Broviac Central line for over a year. Nothing really helped her. She is very small and weighs 60lbs.  This drug has been amazing! Literaly after 48 hours of the first dose, she said she felt no pain anywhere for the first time in her life. :) Painful BM's, gone. Eating and gaining weight. Whatever side effects may pop up, we don't care. It feels so good to see my child feel good for once in her short life!

Cimzia has been a miracle. I have gained a little weight,  # of bowel movements have significantly reduced, joint pain totally gone, energy level way increased (in fact am walking 90 to 120 minutes a day) This drug has been a miracle. I was tired, hurting and depressed, and although i had been able to work, there were times that i could not work a full day, i can now work a full day with full energy. I still have some stomach pain, and lots of intestinal noises, but I have lost the hopeless feeling that nothing will get better. Although the drug is expensive, the change in the quality of my life is beyond expectation. ( and my husband is enjoying not only my renewed energy,and renewed interest in activities I had long ago abandoned). Cimzia has given me be a life I had lost.  
Crohn's Disease	Trina , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	2/1/2010 3:54:03 PM	I have had Crohn's for 10 years.  Had my ups and downs.. Imuran had been the major treatment for me up until 2 years ago I decided to take a break.  I was feeling good and wanted to give my body (mostly my liver)a break from the mutagen quality of the drug. I stayed off to long and flared (shocking, I know). After 5 months back on Imuran I was seeing small gastro improvements but no help with joint symptoms. My rheumatologist suggested Cimzia.  I am due for my 3rd loading dose next week and have drastic improvements with my gastro symptoms and my joints are being held at bay.  I do seem to be hungary all the time.  I work midnights so it is difficult to tell if there is fatigue, I'm always tired. But the drug is addressing most of my problem areas.. though I worry about the trade and side effects.

I can't seem to give the shot to myself and by reading everyones testimonys, I will check on a home health care nurse, thank you! I will give it some more time not counting it out yet!

I was initially diagnosed in March 1992 and had tried virtually treatment available over the years. This is the first that has allowed me to live something approximating a normal life. I've been on Cimzia since April 2009 without major complications. I do suffer from shortness of breath, but my joint pain is less than experienced from corticosteroids. I cannot attest to hair loss, as others have complained about - I lost most of mine years ago. :) I have noticed one seemingly unique side-effect and wonder if anyone else has noticed the same: about once every 5-6 weeks, I will have an episode where I spend upwards of 90 minutes in the bathroom; the effect is similar to that of prepping for a colonoscopy. This first began appearing in October. Other than not knowing when this will strike (it typically occurs in the evening once every 5-6 weeks), it's not a show-stopper.

However, I have gained probably 15-20lbs since I've been on it this past year!  No other side-effects except hives, but that started after my first surgery. Hopefully I can get the weight off during yr 2 AND stay healthy!

Was in the hospital for 36 days the first time. 1 week later for 16 days. Ive had 26 blood transfusions and countless procedures and meds. Remicade didn't work. Ive n=been on Cimzia sence October.  Just started having side effects.  Weight gain, joint pain (real bad in my hands and and elbows)lost most of my hair, my vision is blurry, rash, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain.  I have a hard time talking sometimes because the words don't come out of mouth right.  Its like my brain says one thing and my mouth says something else. I take anxiety meds, but my Dr doesn't seem to thing I am in real pain.  Its good to know I'm not alone with these symptoms.  I thought I was going crazy.

Then there was getting off the Drug, made me very hungry all the time weight gain if I did not control my eating.. I wanted more my stomach tole me to eat but I knew different.. and the worst thing was SHAKES. Doctors told me that there were no issues that what I was feeling was not from the use of the drug, however it seemed that the Doctors that told me this were the same Doctors pushing the Drug. They do not discuss the problems the drug causes of the effects of coming off this drug.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	11/14/2009 11:21:07 PM	I tried DMARS and NSAIDs for awhile but kept having to use prednisone. I took a few months of this drug, but its finally working. My fatigue from the RA is almost completely gone. I do feel like a bus hit me the day after injections but its worth it. There is hardly no pain with the shots and very easy to give. No side effects so far

After the loading doses 9/1; 9/16 and 9/30 I developed Hives, Lupus-like rash, heart speeding up, anxiety, severe hair loss - almost 50%, extreme fatigue, nausea and no appetite!  My Crohn's is about the same as before starting it, if slightly better - but that may be because I really don't feel like eating.  Upon contacting my provider with these symptoms several times and requesting alternate treatment, they basically refuse to believe it's the Cimzia and want me to continue on it and participate in the side effects study. No alternative treatment is even being considered.  The NERVE!  I still have these effects ongoing and it's 10/28/09...I'm filing a MedWatch report with the FDA - and anything else I can do to report my provider because they don't care about me - they just want guinea pigs for their study of this fairly new medication.

It stopped working as well so they switched me to Cimzia. My diarrhea has gotten worse and I had to go on Prednisone. I have been on it for 4 months now and I have literally been sick with something (fever) for the last 3 months. I have been tested for everything under the sun and the only thing that makes sense is the Cimzia. My lymph nodes are the size of golf balls and I have a fever of around 100 degrees every day non-stop.

Suffered for over 20 years. Numerous surgeries, fistulas, abcessess. After my 7th injection I started to notice significant improvements in my flare which had started in Feb 08 and did not let up until May 09. Mine are administered by homecare nurse, 2 shots, one each side of lower abdomen. And I got to avoid another surgery. Hope it continues to work!
Crohn's Disease	thistle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/15/2009 8:02:17 AM	I have had Crohn's for 15 years-had my first surgery a year ago, which helped with the pain. I have been on this medicine for about 6 months now, and have gained weight, but still have diarrhea with frequent bathroom trips. However, I do believe it has helped me to an extent. I cannot take remicade as i am allergic to it, and Humira did not help me either...this is my last resort to help control the disease.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Aubrey, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	9/2/2009 9:29:31 PM	I was diagnosed with JRA at 10months of age. I have been on every treatment available including gold shots. I am 42yr now. I have just gotten my 2nd set of shots and the first set , I saw somewhat relief after the 4th day. My JRA hit me hard this yr staring in Jan. I have went downhill spending most days in bed. I was on Humira most recently Q 7 dy and wasnt helping. I also have Psoriatic Arthritis. Since the second shots within 4 days I was able to be up and around walking which is so wonderful.My disease has affected ALL of my joints and I have osteopenia because of the disease process.  I have slowed on taking all of my pain medications but still have days of not being able to care for myself. This drug is promissing even though there have been some side effects I dont like. Nausea, headaches, fatigue, weakness. I have found that if my husband, a surgeon lets the syringe sit out for about 30 minutes before injection it doesnt burn so much. This may help you out some.  The humira always burned and I had horrible reactions with it. I am on a rather large regime of other meds but with Cimzia , it is getting smaller.  Sleep is the biggest problem for me. It is very hard to sleep with this medication on board. I hope this helps anyone and everyone.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Linda, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	9/1/2009 10:43:16 AM	I have had Rheumatoid Arthritis for 9 years. I have been on many drugs that my system over time has made ineffective. This will be my 3rd month on Cimzia.  I have seen good control of the RA, but the shots are extremely painful, very burning.  I am used to pain, but this is terrible. I am wondering if the mg strength of the dosage plays a role and if the preservative used in the medication is also a factor? Also have developed a red rash on my cheeks and arms. Will still continue for now.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	jessbee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	8/30/2009 9:11:25 PM	I have had rheumatoid arthritis since i was a child and i am 27 years old, i had an allergic reaction to humira and enbrel so i was nervous about the cimzia. i have had 2 injections and so far so good. i am currently trying to ween myself off of methotrexate so that i can become pregnant in the next year, so hopefully the cimzia will work. i will keep posting my progress. 
Crohn's Disease	Robyn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	8/24/2009 5:36:55 PM	Hi all. I've had Crohn's for 30 years now. 1 surgery and that did wonders for the 24/7 pain. I have 3 fistulas and do well. Most days I only take a bunch of prescription lomotil so I can teach. I recently had a bowel obstruction and now on 40 ml of prednisone. After so many years, I lose the obsession with food after a week and I don't really get moon face. But I need to get off it so I'm starting cimzia. I had my initial dosage and didn't feel tired or the other stuff. But I also don't feel any different. My next dose is this Sunday. But I have 1 comment to make: WHAT'S WITH THE HORRIBLE BURNING!!! I almost can't handle it. I don't know how I'm going to be able to do this to myself. The nurse is coming again to push the plunger; I'll do the injection. But if it burns still so badly, my girlfriend said she will push the plunger for me each month. I can't believe how bad it feels. I've done it in my thigh and the first show was bruised and swollen. The other was swollen. I can't imagine doing this in my stomach. Good luck to you all. A positive attitude is the key to this horrible disease. catlady27406@yahoo.com
Rheumatoid Arthritis	SherBear, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	45-54	8/21/2009 6:10:30 PM	I was on Enbrel for a year and Remicade for a year (but due to the ridiculous cost of Remicade...I chose to change.)  I am now on Cimzia and have only received one injection and due for another in 2 days.  My body is ready for some kind of treatment because the Remicade is gone and I am feeling the RA hitting a level I haven't experienced in a while.  I have tried to research this drug on the internet to see how much time to allow for RA symtom relief and have not found any information on that subject.  I am a patient person to some degree and will give this medicine a fair shake!
Crohn's Disease	Dee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	8/20/2009 5:59:44 AM	I am a former Remicade user.  That was making me sick so I had to give up on it!  Started with Cimzia and in the early stages.  So far looks good.  I like the abiity to be in control and able to administer myself, not tied down for 4 hours.  No problem with injections not sure why others have to have nurses administer when on the package instructions it clearly shows the &quot;patient&quot; how and where to do it yourself.  I give it on the weekend but don't really see to much loss of energy, but I don't let it get to me usually.  Bottom line I think this is going to work!
Other	UCer, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/15/2009 11:47:49 AM	I have Ulcerative Colitis and had been using Remicade for 30 months.  Still was not seeing a lot of improvement.  After stopping Remicade, had the worst flare up in 24 years of disease.  Started Cimzia and after the first month, went into complete remission and doing great 7 months later.  Seems it works for UC as well as Crohns, maybe better.
Crohn's Disease	Dezi58, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	8/6/2009 11:51:19 AM	after trying all meds.for 4 yrs. had remicade for 22 months body built up anti-bodies against it.only 2 drugs left to try-Humira or Cimzia.Started Cimzia 9 months ago.Hasn't helped me with diarrhea at all.Seems to wear off after 2&amp;1/2 weeks.Had 3 infections since being on it.Waiting to see if I can get the shots every 3 wks. instead of every 4. Still willing too give it a chance since only 1 drug is available for me to try if this drug fails to work for me. It's easier then having to have the remicade infusions every 6wks.because of every vein I had was blown due to IV's hospitalizations.The Co. provides free of charge a home health nurse to cone &amp; give the 2 shots in the abdomen. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	mommyofthree, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	7/27/2009 11:46:16 PM	I have only taken the first dose of the medication but had some scary side effects. About four hours after injecting Cimzia I was awoken by severe dizziness, numbness of my tongue, tingling in my arms, hands, and legs, shortness of breath, swelling of my lips...I have never felt like this before.  I had been on Enbrel for 5 years and I have not had any allergies to medication before. I have had a slight improvement in small joint swelling and pain as well as a decrease in the duration of my morning stiffness. After several years of waiting for a new drug I am disappointed.  Good luck to everyone-hope it works for you!
Crohn's Disease	bunna, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	35-44	7/14/2009 8:31:48 AM	First of all, like another patient, Remicaide had given up on me too. I also read someone saying they now have allergies to bandaids. I actually developed this with Remicaide and was told that it was a hypersensitivity issue- that and the lack of response eventually caused me to quit using that med. I have been on Cimzia for 11 months now and have mixed reviews. It never lasts the four weeks that it is supposed to. For the first couple of weeks, I see great improvement then weeks 3 and 4 go downhill quickly. My doctor was going to try an intermediate dose but I cannot stay healthy long enough to do that. That is my biggest complaint- I am always sick- with something...- I had total knee replacement in 5/08 and now think I have a bone infection- If so, will have to have the whole knee taken out, bones scraped, and a new knee put in. I am not sure if the short lived improvement is worth the side effects. Also, I saw many posts about the use of Narcotics- I was there (Fentanyl, Percocet, Oxycontin) and all I can tell you is that they almost ruined my life. I understand the pain and am not trying to judge but if you have any alternatives, try to get off these. Since I have been dealing with the pain so long now- 14 years- I usually just cope. At most, I take 2 Vicodins- They help but do not get rid of it totally. All the others eventually made me non functional. It always seems to be a no-no win situation with Crohn's. I wish someone would come up with a cure instead of all these funky meds...
Crohn's Disease	Chubbs, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	55-64	4/13/2009 11:32:27 AM	I have only had my first two shots. I seem to have gotten severe joint pain. I am not sure if this will last or go away, but I am going to stick with it for awhile longer. Remicade seems to have given up on me.
Crohn's Disease	elleswraps, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/20/2009 10:05:36 PM	I think everyone who has Chrons should try this drug.  It is easy because it is shipped to your home, a nurse comes and gives it to you, and it really has worked like no other! It doesn't make you gain weight (like steroids) either! YAY!I agree with the posts that say it makes you sleepy the day after.  It does the same to me.  I also seem to get a cold, or coughing the next day.  But like many, I wouldn't stop taking this medicine!  Oh, I too, feel that the second shot stings more than the first!!...whether it be the thigh or tummy! Weird!I do have a question i was hoping someone could help me with?  My doctor has had me on pain killers for the past 2 years with my severe chrons....although no surgeries, I was in TONS of pain.  I was on fentynol and lots of opiates.  Now, I am only taking 10mg Norco, 2 every 8 hours.  Now that I'm on Cimzia, I feel that I can go with no pills.  But I am afraid of the withdrawl symptoms i have gone through before.  Does anyone have any advice for me??  I am thinking of asking to take Suboxone, but I'm not sure if that will make things worse!  Or do you think that I should stay on my Norco?  I am quite functional on them, but i do not work now, and since the new shots are working, it is time to get back to work!   Thank you to anyone who posts on here to help me! Please feel free to email me at Elleswraps@Aol.com.THANKS~!!!
Crohn's Disease	indeegirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/7/2009 10:25:44 PM	This drug has done wonders for me.  I have never needed pain killers like another reviewer on this site, but my diarrhea has improved significantly.  My energy has improved and I am able to travel with my husband without as much concern of problems.The day after my shots, I have extreme fatigue. I am fortunate enough to be able to give in to that feeling, and I take it slow and rest the day of my injection and the following day as well.I have a question for the other users.  I am not allowed to give myself the injections, I am required to have home health nurses come and give it to me.  I was told the drug is not approved for self administration.
Crohn's Disease	Chronnie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/21/2008 3:46:54 AM	This has been a huge improvement for me and extremely rapid. I cant wait to see more improvements. 5 of 8 active fistulas stopped within 1 week, swelling way down energy up.Nausea almost nonexsistant. I have decreased my pain meds to 1/4 of what I was taking(Fetanyl,Vicoden,diladud) The only &quot;side effects&quot; if they are really side effects are kinda wierd. I can not stay awake for nothing the next day, my face has broken out(acne not this ad since teen years) and I have developed a allergy to bandaids(non latex even) But there is NO WAY I would discontinue Cimzia because of these. I FINALLY see a light at the end of this horrible Crohn's tunnel and hope to resume my life within one yearif I keep improving as I am. P.S. for some reason the 2nd injection stings like CRAZY even though it is in a different site each time(Tummy then thigh or vice versa)
Crohn's Disease	chuckie, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3		35-44	12/5/2008 8:54:26 PM	I feel as though the joint pain and bladder pain is from this med Dr not certain yet still real new for me.
