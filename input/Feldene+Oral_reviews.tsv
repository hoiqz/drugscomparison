I don't have any of the side effects but I do take it with a full glass of water and with food.  It has allowed me to hope to run again!!!

A terrible rash that felt like I had hundreds of needles sticking into my skin &amp; it itched horribly. I became very sun sensitive &amp; anywhere my skin was exposed to the sun, even for a few minutes I either got a horrific rash or a sunburn. A horrible experience. Take this drug off the market! I had to have emergency treatment with steroids for a week to overcome the rash!

The thrush was caused by overloading me with steroids - so they given me a non steroidal for  inflammation  and pain. I am so done trying to get away from all these  meds that say DO NOT TAKE IS YOU HAVE LIVER DISEASE.

Other	Fedup, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/4/2010 8:16:57 PM	I took Feldene for roughly 10 years; first prescribed for an &quot;all-over&quot; pain, undiagnosed, but presumed (by the quack dr.) to be issues with the sheaths over tendons. When the FDA(?) pulled it, I was prescribed something else and decided to just see how things go. Much to my surprise and relief, the debilitating charlie horse cramps all over my body (preventing me from driving, no less, and many other things such as dancing and exercising) quickly disappeared! Why couldn't any of my doctors figure out it was the Feldene causing the charlie horses? I suffer a lot of pain from spine stenosis, fibromayalgia, arthritis, and am on two other pain meds: Vicodine and Flexril. Now I'm afraid that these meds are actually causing more pain and damage than good.

Definitely would not recommend to anyone with even mild back pain. It made me kinda dizzy though, so if you like feeling mildly intoxicated and being in pain, this is the drug for you.

I am not one to take narcotics and have taken many anti-inflammatory pills which did nothing. I was so glad this actually took my pain away. I was drowsy for a few days when I took it but did at night anyway. Now I can take it during the day and it doesnt make me drowsy at all. I can also get this at Walmart for $4. I have had no stomach problems from it, and my stomach is quite sensitive. I would recommend it to at least try it for your pain.

I took the med for one month and it worked well, but then my stomach begin to burn about 30 to 45 minutes after I had taken it also experienced nausea.

Now, I,have started having nose bleeds, and had surgey, on my arm and the Dr. had a really hard time in stoping the bleeding. I, have to test my blood sugar, and it takes 10 mintues to stop that little amount of blood. I, believe this bleeding is cause by this drug, and I want to try something else, or just stop taking it all toghter, and just hurt. Really, can't tell that it is working all that good, now that it has turned off cold. thanks
