If you look at the drug company charts, you can expect a testosterone decline after the initial boost.Hate fighting with the tube during sticky application. Hate the smell and smelly shirts.Concerned about risks to wife as tshirt can rise when on couch. Showers will never get everything out of skin prior to contact. Just hoping transfer only increases her testosterone by small amounts.Would not take this drug if children in the house.Concerned about tiny numbers of people used for Testim trials (and similar drugs) and big long list of side effects. My main effect so far is jump of blood pressure requiring medication to control.

I am 41 yrs old and have been on this medicine for about 2 months. I was put on this because of a low testosterone count. My levels had adjusted very slightly so far but if you read different articles it is different for everyone. By the way it does leave a musky scent so be aware of this fortunately for me my wife likes it that does not hurt if you know what I mean. I will follow up on this article in a month after the 90 day cycle that the test are based on is complete.

I applied it in the morning, and nod off during conversations. I have mild sleep apnea and it makes sleeping much more dificult. I took a 100 mg (two tubes daily) of this treatment for 45 days. I stopped and immediately felt and slept better, and eliminated the drowseyness problem the next day. The medicine at this dosage is effective, but don't dare drive while taking it.   
Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	7/12/2012 5:48:54 PM	I am a 47 year old Caucasian male. I've been on Testim for three months and at two months my Dr &quot;upped&quot; the dosage to two tubes a day instead of one as my levels had not come up yet. My T level on the first test was 158 and the second test was 130 - both before starting Testim. I go back in three months for a follow up and another blood test to check my Testosterone levels. My levels are extremely low for my age, which is why I'm taking it. I have slightly elevated BP (very slight as the Dr put it). As far as ease of use it is easy to put on just a pain to get it all out of that metal tube. If you rub it in (keep rubbing it till your skin &quot;feels dry&quot;) It does feel a little &quot;tacky&quot; but a little baby powder fixes that. As far as the smell goes it does have a strong alcohol smell but my wife loves the smell and I've had compliments from other women about how I smell and wanting to know what cologne I was using. Overall I'm still too early in it to really know if it's going to work well for me but will follow up after my next Dr visit and get the results of whether my T levels have come up to normal or not.

Testim hasn't improved my condition greatly. And the smell is very annoying. Gives my wife migraines to the point where she doesn't want to be near me because the smell NEVER goes away and it doesn't even wash out of my clothing. My wife keeps begging me to go back to Androgel which is scent-free, but our insurance company only covers Testim.

Having done some research I started rubbing in 2 grams per shoulder of DMSO over the Testim. After two days of this I noticed increased daily erections. More aggressiveness, stronger erections and generally I am more sexually agressive. I was on an anti depressant for years, after a week off the medicine as directed by my doctor the depression is virtually gone. I feel that steroid pump guys at the gym talk about and I like it. My strength has increased and I feel more motivated. Give this medicine a chance.

I used this medication 1 month.  My joint pain vanished.  I put on 3 lbs of muscle mass.  I do 150 pushups/day + curls + 100 situps/day.  I gained flexiblity.  My body was no longer in pain.  Side effects :  skin reaction, redness, that wouldn't go away ; a change in aggressiveness ; trouble sleeping.  No change in sexual performance.  Still ok but not like when I was 30.  Still need occasional Cialis.  I reviewed the clinical trials and I saw no reason to put the medication on the uppper arms except that's where they put it in the clinical trial.  I experimented by putting it on my legs for awhile.  Why not ?  They have skin too.  Didn't seem to matter.  Still the same benefits and side effects.  Testosterone levels in my blood still went up.  Wish they would make a cream versus the alcohol base, however.

Ask lots of questions - take the Dr.'s time - he's getting paid! This medication may cause severe physical and emotional effects that are very easy to fix.  I find proper diet and exercise essential.  Unless you are medically unable don't be so lazy.  Low blood sugar can cause emotional roller-coaster effects.  No, you are not dying or facing divorce.  This is not an aphrodisiac.  If you are having emotional or intimacy relationship issues this will not help.  Pray.  Meditate.  Get counseling. Study the Bible.  Whatever...  Never think this or any other substance (herbs, vitamins, capsules, etc.) will may you a better partner.  Don't be that stupid.

Doctor had me on Androgel for 3 and half years. That ended when my T levels shot up to over 1400. Doctor took me off of Adrogel completely. I was fine for the next 9 months, but then I noticed a lack of energy, and most importantly, lack of sex drive and the ability to maintain an erection longer than a few minutes. I was tested and my levels were back down to 200. Now Doc has put me on Testim. So far I don't know how its working. Too soon. But I do NOT like the smell at all. It's very strong and my wife and daughters complain about it all the time. I'm going to give it 2 weeks and if I don't see a noticeable improvement, I'm calling the Doc and asking to be put back on Androgel. I know that works for me. And it doesn't smell.

The Urologist prescribed Testim due to having alot of symptoms (i.e. low energy level, no sex drive, lack of erections, depression), so I started taking Testim on 1/01/10 and after three (3) weeks my testosterone level was in the mid 500's.  However, it has been almost 7 weeks and I have not noticed any improvements.  I am still depressed (I am on an anti-depressant too), tired all the time and I actually think I have less of a sex drive than I did before taking the medicine and I have a decrease in erections. On the positive side my partner says that my mood has been more stable, but I can't tell a difference.  I am going to give it 6 months (since it is free)and hope to see some improverment soon.  Very disappointed.

My doctor tested me and my total T was at 304 ng/dl. He put me on 5 gm of Androgel and after 2 months it was 357. He upped it to 7.5 gm and it was at 277 after another 4 months and I still had all the signs of low T. I read that Testim might absorb better and asked him to change me to 10 gm of Testim and he agreed. After 6 months on 10 gm of Testim, my total T was 862, but my free T, DHT and estradiol are a little high. I cut my Testim to 7.5 gm daily a month ago and I still feel great. I will get bloodd work in another month. While on Testim my libido is very good, the ED is almost completely gone and I no longer need Viagra, my depression is gone and my strength has returned and I an using more weight than I have in 5 years. After 7 months on Testim I am very happy with the results so far. The one thing that was better with Androgel is that it was not sticky after it dried, but then it didn't work for me either.

Other	puffpwr6, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/3/2009 5:49:00 PM	I am a 40 yr old woman who uses this--although not prescribed. I went to an endocrinologist because of my inability to loose weight and had some tests run and found that I had a slightly below normal testosterone level. The doctor thought the levels were fine even though I was tired all the time, never wanted sex, and not able to loose weight despite working out. Since using this--(the amount that I apply  is a pearl sized dab on my shoulders once per day)--I have energy, increased memory, noticebable loss of body fat, my muscles are more toned and I am more &quot;in the mood&quot;. I do watch for any changes in my facial appearance, and my body (excessive body hair or a change in my genitals) and I havent noticed any as of yet; although I have only been taking it for 3 weeks.
Other	man, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	35-44	3/22/2009 1:05:04 AM	I am 37 years old and diagnosed with hypogonadism. I have been on Testim for 4 months had to double up the last two months due to levels not rising. I have not noticed any difference in mood, hopefully I will after I have been on it for a while. So far I am not that impressed but, it is the only drug my insurance covers at this time.

It's greatly improved his sex drive...... to the point where he wants to hump everything that walks by, struts around like a rooster and acts like a teenager.  He's hateful, hostile, aggressive and driving me insane. He's been told to reduce the amount he's using, but seems so &quot;hooked&quot; on it, he can't give it up.  It has turned a once considerate and caring man into a monster and ruined a 20+ year marriage. He's so bad our teenager thinks he's out of control! He dodges trips to the Dr. and &quot;forgets&quot; to take time for the blood work because he knows he's going to be told to cut it back. This stuff is dangerous.......

I see a BIG difference in his behavior. He was lethargic previously, but now seems happier and more alive. I love the scent of the medication. I did notice his hair was thinner after use.
Deficient Activity of the Testis	franco, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	11/26/2008 11:09:13 AM	I was diagnosed with osteopena a few years agos, which lead to detailed blood tests revealing very low Testosterone levels. I was also being treated for depression (Cymbalta). Upon starting therapy with Testim, the depression went away (as did the Cymbalta and its side effects), i have better erections and increased libido, and hopefully less bone loss (the bone in my back!). I avoid the sticky problems by rubbing in to skin very well and then hitting with cool air from my hair dryer before dressing. Also, wearing a Nike synthetic rather than cotton Tshirt helps a lot. I also combine with Propecia to reduce the chance of hairloss.  One other side effect.....my body is super ripped from strength training.  My advice....hit the gym hard and you will be very happy in a few months!

Only drawback is the drying time...I'm glad I found this supplement!

Generally my energy level has increased to the point where I can exercise again. I have also had an increase in libido and potency, altough not to the levels of 7-10 years ago. Application is sticky but I have found it takes about 20-30 minutes to absorb into my skin and I can cover with a shirt. I have found it easier to apply at night. My wife and I have worked out the contact issue when we have sex.

On the down side, this is a bit sticky for a short period of time after application, and it is best to wait a while before putting on a shirt. There is a noticeable odor, but my wife tells me that it is no worse than a light cologne, and more than once she has admitted that on occasion &quot;It turned her on.&quot; I have noticed that my chest hair and hair on my legs are starting to thicken back up.

It was affecting my position as a teacher at the company I was in. Now I have more energy and on occasion random spurts of high energy and havent had an episode of concentration loss or forgetfulness lately. My wife is also thankful in and out of the bedroom.  She can count on me to remember what I need to do and where I need to go. My sexual desire never disappeared but now it seems to be in high gear. I have also noticed further hair loss but i was blaming it on my father. 
Deficient Activity of the Testis		2	2	1			7/16/2008 8:09:36 PM	halfway into my second month of treatment.  stronger erections were obvious (quite) in a couple of weeks.  application is significantly sticky and smelly (i've had strangers ask &quot;what's that cologne you're wearing, it stinks.&quot;  Oh, and in the last week, it is quite clear my hair has thinned by a LOT.  i never used to see my scalp, but now i can....weird and annoying.  Dr. didn't say hair loss was likely but it is obvious from searching around (which i should have first) it a common problem.  I was hoping general strength etc was going to increase, but it hasn't.  probably time to quit.

For my age, 33, 750 is average. I am just beginning 2nd month, but had panels done and I am already at ~500. PROS- increased energy, focus, drive, fuller erections, and to some extent increased libidoCONS- mild insomnia, slightly oily facial skin, and as noted earlier, &quot;sticky&quot; application (However- pubmeds show much higher efficacy gm/gm than Androgel) Overall: highly recommended    
Other	Picto, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/19/2008 6:28:42 PM	A wonder drug.  Changed my whole outlook on life, reduced several yrs of progressive depression and anxiety to virtually zero (have been able to come of other medications within 4 weeks), has increased my libido to that of a 25 year old.  I feel the best I have felt in years.  Side effects have been insomnia (I just have more energy), random erections and sudden sexual desire.  Combine all 3 and you've got yourself one helluv'an evening!
