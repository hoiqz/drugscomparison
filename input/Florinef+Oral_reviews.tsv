The med I was put on to lower heart rate also lowered my blood pressure to the point of could hardly function. Florinef helped keep blood pressure for dropping so low.

It was a little difficult to find the proper dosage as there seems to be a delayed effect of a few weeks.  I have had some trouble with headaches but they go away when I drop the dose slightly.  I am much more of a functional person with this drug, though not as &quot;normal&quot; as I used to be I would hate to try and manage my POTS without this.  I have tried several times to wean myself off this drug very slowly to see if I can function without it but with no luck.

No known cause.  Doc put me on Florinef to see if it would improve.  Started the pills yesterday and within two hours was itching all over.  Itching lasted a good 8 hours.  Took another pill today and had the same reaction.  Called my doctor and he told me there is no possible way I am itching from this medication!  Anybody else had this reaction??  Am I just crazy??

It got really bad in the past few years and my normal BP would be 90/55 or thereabouts. I was unable to drive as was afraid of passing out at the wheel, my GP tried various drugs but to no avail. January 2010 I was seen by a Cardialogist, had a full set of tests from stress to ECG to Angiogram and he put me on this drug. Since taking it - just 1 in the day and increasing my salt and fluid intake, my BP is now 120/80 on a regular basis and I have had just 2 fainting episodes - wonderful! Yes there is a down side, I have gained almost 1 stone in weight and sometimes get headaches, but I can live with this as I am back driving again. I have my checkup with my Cardiologist in this coming January and we will see where we go from here. I feel for people on this drug or any drug long term that they should have regular blood tests in particular to assertain any problems with the liver. My mother suffered from this same problem but unfortunately this drug was not around to help ease her symptoms.

Go through phases of once to 4 times feeling quite faint while resting in a recliner with feeling faint for 5 minutes up to 20 minutes. Taking 1 mg Florinef every morning. However blood pressure bouncing around daily anywhere from 117/94 to 192/87 , all readings taken while sitting in recliner reading and watching TV. Have been continuous care by both an Endrocrinologist and a very well reguarded Cardiologist as well as a Rhumatologist. Just completed an at-home 14 day continous 24/7 EKG with remote telemetry to a contral monitorin/recording center and concurrently undergoing a 4 day at-home 24/7 24-wire EEG monitoring with recording and telemetry with continous Audio/Video Recording with one camera in the sitting room and one camera with low-light and no-light video and audio. Do not have the readings evaluation and results but should have them within at least 20 days. Actually, hope something shows up to help us move in a direction where further in-depth diagnosis can be established and an additional treatment regimen implemented.
Condition caused by Excess Secretion of Male Hormones	Christina, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	3	5	2	Female	3-6	12/8/2009 6:55:20 PM	My daughter was diagnosed at 10 days old with a congenital condition. For the first 2 years, all was well - fairly normal weight - true to size.  But then it was determined to up the medication (after her 2nd birthday) and within 3 months she gained 12 pounds.  That was a little over a year ago.  My daughter is now 3 1/2 years old and 60 pounds.  I have been to the major children's hospitals in the NE.  All want to say it is her diet.  So I journaled everything she ate - she doesn't eat her needed amount of calories in a day - only around 800 - 1000 and she is VERY active.  My older son, is thin and tall.  She does not ask for food and typically only eats at meal times.  I have begged her doctors to look at the florinef - it is almost as if they are not listening and tell me her metabolism is slow . . . grrrrr.  One doctor actually told me to feed her LESS!  And we eat NO pre-packaged or processed foods, with the exception of the occasional hot dog or mac and cheese.  She eats no &quot;whites&quot;, no white potatoes, bread or rice.  Besides, she is not a big carb eater at all.  As you may tell I am frustrated to no end - although my pediatrician is on my side and our next visit may be to CHOP (Children's Hosp of Penn).  He has seen my journals (they had too) and knows my kids.  I have put a call into her endocrinologist to almost &quot;demand&quot; a reduction in this drug.  As a trial to see if she will start to decrease.  Anyone else have a similar situation!?!?!?

It has not helped, and I intend to talk to my doctor about stopping it really soon. This drug may be effective for some people, but not for me.

After getting the proper medication mix and dosage (including this one) she has been able to go to school fairly regularly and gain a more normal childhood. This drug doesn't cure her condition, but has made a tremendous difference.

It took 13 years before I was able to stand w/o BP dropping.  The long term side effects for   me are horrendous, but the many years of being mostly functional I suppose were worth it.  There was nothing else available but a pressure suit in 1962 and I don't believe there is anything else yet available.  So yes I am very grateful for it.  I still take a small maintence dose daily. I can't use any salt.
