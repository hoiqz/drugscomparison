Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/15/2012 12:14:59 AM	Prescribed after complex hand surgery, for several days. It was quickly effective and did not cause nausea, as some pain meds in the past have done. There was a definite sedation effect, but since I was recuperating at home this was not a problem. I would NOT feel safe driving after taking it. I was able to stop taking it with no discomfort or &quot;craving&quot;, although I have heard of addiction potential. I only took it for 4 or 5 days, so no tolorance occurred. Good medication for that brief time.

I only took one pill after my surgery because I wasn't in much pain.  But I do use it for my cramps. There is a chance that I have endometriosis and this helps ease my cramps and pain.  It doesn't take it away completely but I am able to do things without being in pain.  I have tried everything from iboprofen to toradol, and mepergan almost works 100% on me.  This drug doesn't make me dependent on it, or addicted. It makes me feel a little off-balanced if I walk around and makes me sleepy but still awake. It's not a restless sleepy, but if you are willing to lie down and go to bed, you will sleep well. Don't drive when taking this pill obviously, since it may make you loopy.

Pain	Marginally Effective, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	45-54	12/29/2008 4:32:06 PM	I was prescribed this med after knee surgery.The pain after just a scoped/knee surgery was, to my surprise so very painful to me. This med did not ever take away the pain entirely.  I just tolerated it and toughed it out without ever reporting the lack of pain relief to my Physician. The bright-side of this med was that it did not cause the &quot;itching/sinus/skin crawling sensations&quot; that often accompany pain meds that I have been prescribed before
