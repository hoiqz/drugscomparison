Other	tennesseeRN, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/15/2008 1:32:03 AM	I began taking this after a bout with PVCs (as a result of taking diet pills) and thought I could quit taking the medication because I felt great while taking it. No more problems. But as soon as I went off of it, my heart began doing the same thing only worse. I have since went back on it and my heart is doing fine. I am taking 120 mg a day and it works great with no side effects what so ever for me.
