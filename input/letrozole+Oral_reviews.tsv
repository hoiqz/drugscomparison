Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	65-74	8/28/2012 7:48:57 AM	I have been on Letrozole for about six weeks.  Experiencing hot flashes, energy level has plummeted.  Could be partly because of the radiation treatment I am also taking.  I have had a persistent cough which has gotten worse since using it.  Wondering if others have been affected by an annoying cough?
Other	Mikey G,  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5			7/15/2012 3:14:11 PM	Taken to reduce estrogen levels (I am a male) my estrogen had climbed over 100 ng/dl and the highest level should be 39 ng/dl in a male.Amazing drug, knocked the estrogen down to 22 ng/dl with 1.25 mg twice a week in only two weeks.Joints got a little stiff, you need estrogen as a man just not a lot.

I have severe vaginal dryness. I cry all day. I am overwhelmed. I can't focus, my hair is thinning. It seems physician don't care about the human being just the physical body. People are made up of emotions, my depression is paralyzing. I need help, I am overwhelmed and can't fight anymore to be the person I was I was strong, always moved forward when things got tough. I would like to crawl in a hole and never come out. I feel angry, betrayed, unimportant. No purpose. I was a young 59 yr old, always on the go, physically fit.

I can't really blame my extreme hot flashes on the medication but what I have noticed is the muscle/tendon pain.  I have been treated for a trigger finger twice which is apparently a common complaint.  I now am seeking treatment for carpal tunnel and tendonitis in my hands.  I guess it's a small price to pay to stay cancer free.

Other	whit222, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/22/2011 4:50:30 PM	I started .5 of Letrozole in June 2011 to help get pregnant. The doctor found nothing wrong with my husband and I after all the testing and felt this would be a good first step. I took a second round in July and found out I was pregnant. I don't know for sure if it was the drug or just good timing finally, but something worked. We had been trying for almost a year, trying very hard. I didn't have any side effects with this drug. 
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	luckylady, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		6/28/2011 1:44:58 PM	I have just recently been switched from Femara to Letrozole (I am certain cost was a major factor in this decision).  This is just the first month I am on Letrozole so it is really too early to tell the outcome.

All the way through the treatment  quite bad hot flashes (different levels from plain hot sweats to hot sweats with panic attacks). Glad to say only 1 month left now, and I will be medication free ( fingers crossed that all will be ok afterwards-that does concern me a bit). Good luck to everyone going thru' this.

My first month I produced 2 good looking follicles, but did not get pregnant. The second month I took the same dose of medication and produced 1 good follicle. I am happy to report that I am pregnant! I have PCOS and am very pleased with the outcome.

Now I am starting 7.5.  I have high hopes for this dose due to the results of the lower dose.

It worked the first time but I miscarried again and since then it hasn't worked.  It does increase mentraul cramps and bleeding.  Hopefully along with 3 other meds combined with it we will soon be pregnant again!

I haven't really had any pain as a matter of fact it eased my endometriosis pain. I am trying for a second baby now- with this drug it is odd to see that it is used for breast cancer as well as other cancers and menopause.

After 1.5 months of treatment I convinced her to stop taking to see if the sever joint pasin in her knees went away.  After 6 weeks of being off, not a single ach in sight.  Here's a lady that could barely get out of bed in the morning.  Well, the MD have scared her so much into taking this painful drug that she will begin using again Monday.  In her case, I don't see the cons outweighing the pros.  Its a Quality of Life issue.

I have decided the pain will subside the cancer will not! So I pray alot and am anointed at church for healing as well!
