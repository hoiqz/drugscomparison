I don't remember any side effects at all. I still have had trouble getting pregnant...trying for 6 years, just failed my 3rd IUI. I was just wondering if parlodel masks pregnancy symptoms. Does anyone know? Thanks!

Other	Mad mommy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	4/9/2011 9:31:06 AM	I was given this medication many years ago by my OB even though I clearly told the hospital that I planned to breast feed my child.  I did not know that I was getting this medication or even knew that something like this drug existed.  I tried to reverse the medication and almost committed suicide when I could not reverse the medication.  They no longer use it on maternity wards because they think that it causes cancer and obviously other problems too.

Been on 2.5 mg now for a week after gradually increasing dose upwards from 0.625. Since starting am finally sleeping! Have lost 22 lbs in 21/2 weeks, can make fists again and dont have chronic headaches! Most important that every two people with the same condition may respond very differently to each medication. I started initially on Cabergoline for elevated Prolactin and Growth Hormone. I felt awful, could not get off of couch and GH levels didnt budge, took a two week drug holiday (with exception of Testosterone replacement) and started Bromo 31/2 weeks ago. I am very happy with it! Be patient, be honest with your Dr and be willing to try different things till you find the one that works for both you and your condition!! Good luck!

I stopped using because it was decreasing my human growth hormone, which, in turn, decreased muscle mass and bone density.  While on this expensive prescription in my thirties, my body was having aging symptoms of someone in their seventies.  After stopping usage, human growth hormone increased to a normal level, muscle mass increased, and body is acting it's age instead of 40 years older.  No more brain fog nor fatigue.  Although my prolactin level decreased while on this medicine, it was not worth the side effects I experienced.

Absence of Menstrual Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	5/14/2010 3:41:53 AM	I have had irregular periods since i was a teen and had recently taken a blood test to diagnose the problem.  My ob found a slightly increased level of prolactin, but found no hyperprolactinoma after an MRI.  I was put on bromocriptine anyway and three weeks later, I had a period.  The side effects (extreme drowsiness, headache and stuffy nose)were a bit strong at first, but subsided after a few weeks.

My question is about the cost.  My once a month shot costs about #3,200 every month which drives my insurance rates thru the roof.  Can anyone give me an idea of the costs for this drug?

My levels were 3900 and dropped to around 8.  I successfully went through 2 pregnancies while taking the medication (slighly lower dosage).  Although I still experience morning nausea if I do not eat anything (usually a handful of cereal is all it takes), this medicine saved me from having to have surgery and has kept the size of my tumor from growing all these years.  
Other	Mary Kay McCarty, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/17/2010 2:07:18 AM	parlodel was given to me in 1985 and it enabled me to get my thoughts from my brain to the muscle I was trying to use, it also helped control the pain  with my spastic tortocollis, I have tried the generic for 2 months after taking the brand for 22 years, and when I was totally on the generic I got into so much pain I was curling up on the floor, like I did when my first slow onset of tortocollis in 1977 after a snow skiing fall on my basil ganglia stated my dystoniaand so little was known about it, but is has been a saving grace to my quality of life and I stay on a low dosage, it used to be twice as much 5mg three times a day

Other	ConcernedCousin	5	5	1			9/21/2009 9:16:11 AM	My cousin took this     , in 1995, because she chose not to breastfeed her 2nd daughter. She had a severe reaction: multiple seizures and then a massive heart attack which resulted in oxygen deprivation, and is now in a vegetative state. The      was given, even though there were warnings against it for this use. The settlement from the      company has allowed my uncle to care for her at home. (My aunt was battling breast cancer during this time and died) My cousin's daughters have only known her in this state. This was documented on the news a year or so after this occured.

I started taking parlodel in December and 8 months later the medicine is awful for me. Although my prolactin levels went back to normal it was not worth it based on my side effects. I was so nauseaus all the time and my doctor kept telling me the symptoms would subside. I would wake up in the middle of the night feeling nauseated and this did not change even when I took it at bedtime and with food. I even had fainting spells with it. Today, my doctor has switched me to dostinex...I am hoping that the symptoms are better for me.

I had nausea every day, and often a bloated stomach.  I was miserable!  A close friend who is a clinical pharmarcist recco'd trying the generic brand of Dostinex.  At first one of my docs was hesitant, saying there's not enough research on it, but it has had &quot;B&quot; rating, which means there's been a lot of studies on it.  I'm going to try the generic brand, and say goodbye to the horrid Parlodel.  Good luck to you.

Also sometimes feel dizzy and lightheaded. Have constant drainage from the nose. Unfortunately I need to take this medication to prevent the tumor from coming back. I also need to be on an anti depressant but for some reason everything I take seems to give me mind fog especially if the drug contains an anti anxiety agent. I'm not sure if there's a relationship between the parlodel and these drugs that is giving me a bad reaction.

I was given the option for surgical removal of the pituitary tumor, but since there was not a 100% success rate, I chose the oral meds.
