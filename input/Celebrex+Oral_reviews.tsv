He went off of it due to a poor liver panel and then was put back on after a while because it was all that worked for his thoriatic arthritis pain. When he went back on after a 2 year hiatus he experienced all sorts of weird problems. Bruising was especially bad. If he touched something (literally) with his elbow he would bruise. He ended up wearing elbow pads a lot. He developed a severe neuralgia that effected his arms and shoulders. He has been off the Celebrex for one week and the neuralgia is almost all gone. The bruising has minimized and his pain is manageable. He also at one point experienced skin eruptions right after he went back on the meds. These lasted about a year and were only controlled with a huge vitamin regime. All of the symptoms have started to subside after he stopped taking Celebrex. This is why I feel the issues are drug related. We are very unique in that we have medical insurance because this drug is outrageously expensive. The ins. company made him try 8 other drugs before allowing him to use Celebrex. Most people we know could never afford it.
Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	PAULA MM, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/9/2012 8:38:27 AM	I am a 58 year old female attorney with osteoarthritis in multiple joints. Recently, I had right thumb tendinitis secondary to arthritis with much pain and some loss of function,to avoid pain. I took Celebrex about 7 years ago for a torn meniscus and really liked it. Then it was taken off the market, and subsequently, is now again available.  It gives superior relief from pain and inflammation than OTC NSAIDS.  I have experienced no side effects.  I have been taking it for approximately 2 weeks.  My only complaint is the high price, as I no longer have health insurance.  But I am researching, via the web site Needy Meds and the company that makes Celebrex, how to reduce the price.  I can hardly wait until it is available in generic form.

(I was told that my Synthroid and Symvastatin medication would not be a problem)  On both days, I took it in the morning, as directed.  I was fine all day.  did nothing different.  Ate nothing different.  Slept normally.  Same linens, same pillow. The following morning,  I woke up with a totally swollen face.  It subsided 80% by the night.  On the second morning, rationalizing that it couldn't be the Celebrex, I took it again.  I was fine all day and the following morning, when I awoke, I was swollen all over again.  I stopped taking it.  I cannot really comment on its effectiveness in relieving my tennis elbow because, clearly, I didn't take it long enough

Acute Pain Following an Operation	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	2/2/2012 8:21:13 AM	I was given this drug after a hip replacement surgery for pain.Within 24hrs about 2/3 of my skin blistered up and sloughed off. It was extremely painful. I contacted my doctor he advised me to stop taking the Celebrex. I did and the symptoms stopped. A year later I had to have a tumor the size of a softball removed from my small intestines. The tumor had caused a bowel blockage which was incredibly painful. When I asked the G.I. Doctor why I had this tumor and what caused it. He said I had very small perforations in my small intestines probably caused by NSAID use and the tumor was my body's way of trying to close the holes, Celebrex was the only NSAID I had ever taken that gave me any adverse reaction. When I asked the Dr how long he thought it took for the tumor to grow that big he said months to a year or more. Read carefully the warning label for Celebrex one of the more common side effects is intestinal bleeding and perforated bowel. I was lucky most people just die from septic shock when the contents of their bowel leak into their abdominal cavity. Celebrex is very similar to Viox and Bextra both of which killed untold numbers of people before they were forced off the market. If you go to the official Celebrex web site they have 28 pages of serious side effects. Narcotic pain medicine is much safer.

But, I need and want to stay active. We are still farming and are responsible for numerous species of large animals that require us to be stong and agile.  Celebrex has made a difference.  Not often, but once in a while have forgotten to take it for a few days and I became so stiff. Again, I have told myself that I don't need this drug, that I can do without it, but after a few days it is apparent that if my work is to be done, I must move and I DO need the Celebrex!

Had arthritic spurs in spinal column( back surgery required) , and deg. Disk/herniated disks in L3,L4,L5. Super narcotics were not providing any releif( just an &quot;AIR-HEAD&quot;, and frankly I depise taking any meds. As a result of the fracture, placed on Celebrex for a mgmt. Has done a WONDERFUL job, no stomach bleeding, no tinnitus, and a second benefit of No colon polyps in last 3 colon exams. With a neural disorder, this is the ONLY medication that has allowed me to function at my normal capacity. Now, after living my life, THE INSURANCE Company says they will not cover the expense. $ for a 30 day supply = $391. 200mg./bid(twice daily) Simply stated is it worth it,well, since it is the only NSaid left on the market that does the job, without destroying my pancreas(acetominophen), does not cause my stomach to bleed(due to thin stomach lining) , what is the answer? Vioxx failed, Bextra WAS close, Naprosyn worked like a &quot;sugar pill&quot;, Daypro caused constant naseau, tarry stools, Clinoril did not work, NAlfon was a failure as well. Indomethacin cannot be taken with (Dilantin) sodium phenytoin, so I guess it is back to Flexeril, Loratabs &amp; Oxycotin! I am fascinated how insurance companies now have the authority to practice medicine(overriding a Dr.'s order and instructions). Looks like I may be retiring/going on disability about 20 years earlier than I choose to!

I did get relief from my joint pain and felt &quot;normal&quot; for about 3 years. I became increasingly tired and leathargic.I had a full kidney panel and the test showed I have developed some kindey failure.I stopped taking Celebrex immediately and within 4 days the edema in both feet and calves went away and at 3 weeks my fatigue is less everyday. I am Ultracet 37.5 for the pain. I will have Synvsc injections starting next week. I am 63 and have no other health problems.

It is more expensive than I can afford but it is the only thing that has worked for me so I take it.  Improvement in mobility is unbelievable.  I was using a power chair or walker.  Now I walk unassisted and can even clean my house which I haven't been able to do in three years.  Nice not having that expense!  Overall I am more than satisfied with effectiveness, not so happy about the costs.

Darn! I will take it only when I am going to have a very active day and/or go hiking. Kind of scary.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Lilylee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	4	5	5	Female	55-64	5/6/2011 3:23:06 AM	I have rheumotoid arthitis and have fibro mylagia with it. I have been on celebrax since it came out. I had many problems with other anti-inflamatory meds. I get an annual physical and no side effects so far. The RA joint pain is hard enough to treat but fibromylagia pain can often not respond to pain meds. I was surprisd that Celebrax works so well on fibro pain. I take a celebrax 200 at bedtime and my all over muscle/ body aches are gone in a short time and I sleep well. I don't take celebrax in the day but occassionaly do. Celebrax decreases the pain enough so I can exercise by lap swimming. Celebrax has helped me a lot, alhough it doesn't take away all the pain but helps to keep me going. I have talked to some people who say celebrax does not work for them. The big draw back is the expense.

New primary dr prescribed Celebrex and kneew pain has become nearly unbearable since I've been using it.  Also, BP which was a little on the high side, got even higher even on BP meds, and I can't help wonder if the Celebrex is the reason.  It's so bad I'm ready to just go cold turkey until I see the orthopedist and see what else we can do.  It's too much of a coincidence that this excruciating pain (prior to starting Celebrex I knew I HAD arthritis but wasn't in any distress because of it) started after I started taking Celebrex.  If the pain eases off when I stop I'm going to be VERY vocal about warning people about this drug.

I finaly ended up with an ulcer so now have to be very careful with anything I take. I had some relief with Celebrex for months but due to other arthritis didn't realize the swelling was due to side effects of Celebrex at 200mg. It also raise my usually low blood pressure to a dangerously high blood pressure. I was taken off the Celebrex for a few years. Once again I had to go through some nsaids with same results of stomach pains, water weigh and not much results. Recently my doctor suggested we try Celebrex again at a lower dose of 100mg once a day. I was to call immediately if my blood pressure raised 20 pts. I was also warned by the pharmacist to make sure I take with food (which I always do). I do feel the relief with Celebrex but after 1 wk same results--blood pressure raised, now heart flutters, water weight gain, extreme stomach pain...stop Celebrex immediately. Now I'm waiting for appt with doctor. I'm needing to take something to be able to get out of bed and to the living room. I take 2 ibuprofen to help but again must take with food and have to stop after a week or so. I have ran through several meds...Naprosen, Relafen, Vioxx, Motrin, etc. I have had cortisone shots in my spine(no relief), back surgery(failed fusion). Running out of things to take.

CELEBREX IS A MIRACLE DRUG.  I SAW ALL KINDS OF SPECIALS IN BOSTON, AND IRELAND AND WALES NOBODY SUGGESTED CELEBREX.  I ONLY HAVE TO TAKE IT IN THE SUMMER AND LAST SUMMER I CLIMBED UP A MOUNTAIN ON IT.  WITHOUT IT I WOULD HAVE ENDED UP IN A WHEELCHAIR.  I ONLY WISH SOME DOCTOR HAD RECOMMENDED IT 10 YEARS AGO.  IF YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM ARTHRITIS PLEASE TRY THIS, IT REALLY IS A MIRACLE DRUG.

Other	smilinganyway, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/17/2011 4:37:58 AM	As I am unable to take steroids, this medicine has been a godsend.  For me, the anti-inflammatory property is the best. It doesn't do much for the pain, but with the inflammation down it doesn't hurt as much anyway. I've been taking 200 mg a day, but can take up to 400 mg in a day. I have osteoarthritis as well as a very high ANA which can only be classified as &quot;inflammatory arthritis&quot; because blood work done up to now is inconclusive. I'm also a type 2 diabetic with high blood pressure, and I'm only 46. Both RA and Lupus run in the family so I'm figuring it's one or the other for me. Celebrex works well at keeping me moving, but the doc recently put me on Methotrexate (oral) as well and I've had severe heartburn ever since. I think I'd rather stop the Methotrexate and stay on the Celebrex since I know that it works well. I also take Vicodin (hydrocodone) for an acute herniated disc at L4-L5 since the Celebrex does nothing for the nerve type pain that I have there.

I have been recovering from a pelvic and sacrum fracture. They gave me Hydrocodone for the pain, but I still hurt badly. After taking Celebrex I noticed same day relief for my all over body pain due to arthritis and it helped with the pain from the fractures. It has side effects, none of which I have experienced so far. But the big plus is it's not a narcotic or opiate, so no addiction issues. I love this drug! Made a difference in my life :)

After taking Advil every day for years which only dulled the pain, I ask my doctor if I could try Celebrex.  It took my pain away within an hour and lasted almost 24 hours. Because of my concern of its side effects, I decided to only take it when I was having a lot of pain.  The second time I took it I had a memory loss one day like never before. I stopped taking it and everything was fine. Tried taking it one more time a couple of weeks later because of unusual back pain, and the same thing happened again.  Needless to say, I won't take this drug again.

Other	casey, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female		2/20/2011 10:48:08 AM	My elderly mother developed severe crippling arthritis in her back (though she's still able to walk w/a cane) and it has gotten progressively worse over 2.5 months. Previously, she got around fine with no history of arthritis.She was first given ibuprofen, then meloxicam which did nothing. She's been on Celebrex (200mg) for a week, still not a hint of relief. I've read this med can take 2 weeks to kick in. Have others similarly experienced no relief until after 2 weeks? It's been frustrating, as I've seen so many wonderful reviews for this medication.

I don't digest capsules well, so I take the capsule apart and put it in applesauce with some ground cinnamon, as part of a large meal. Maybe the cinnamon helps, I don't know. The only side effect i've had was that sometimes I had a little gas.

Dr. advised me to cut back. Started having pain in chest when I swallowed and in stomach. Now have ulcers from it. Advised not to use aspirin, aleve, advil, ibuprofen (which I had used only occasionally), and no more celbrex...I believe it caused these ulcers in my throat and stomach.

My orthopedic doc recommended me to start taking Celebrex to see if it would help. If it didn't, I was going to need surgery. After taking it for only 4 days, the small cyst went down. I was so relieved and impressed by the results of this medication. I never rate anything but I want people to know this is a very good medication. 
Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	mishi girl,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female		6/22/2010 1:32:04 PM	I only use this medicine as needed. Recently I took it for only 4 days to treat hand/wrist inflammation. Took 1 200mg a day, and on my fourth day experienced problems with my vision. I could see but my peripherial vision on my left eye was extremely compromised and couldn't see anything but a haze. Plus, I saw a &quot;wiggle&quot; effect on both my eyes. I'm glad it didn't last long; it took over an hour for it to go away. It's an unfortunate side effect, since it works great for pain but the consequence is not one that I want to continue to live with just to get relief.

After only four doses I have hearing loss in one of my ears.  I understand that this is an allergic reaction to Celebrex, but I cannot find any information as to whether, or not, this is likely/unlikely to be permanent damage.  It has helped with the pain, but unfortunately my hearing was a high price to pay for trying this drug and getting about two days of relief. Of course I quit taking the Celebrex.  
Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	BillS, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		5/31/2010 12:29:23 PM	! first used Celebrex some years ago as a remedy for shoulder pain after a fall. It worked beautifully, and It avoided the need for a rotator cuff operation. Then a year or two later I injured the shoulder again and an operation was necessary. Several months ago I injured the other shoulder similarly and also the elbow tendon. I got relief from cortisone shots in both places, but it didn't last long. The orthopedist gave me Rx for Celebrex 200 mg a month ago and the result is amazing- pain gone, and 95% motion restored. Some stomach pain during night at first, but now I'm making sure I take it with a full meal. I also  feel tired and drowsy- falling asleep when I don't want to, but not at night when I do want to. Perhaps this will clear up.

I have have a hard time hearing today and yesterday.  I have discontinued taking it.  I only took it for a few days and it's been over a year since I took it a couple times then.  I take this for extreme endometriosis pain in my sac nerve in my right hip.  Some times I can't even walk...and Celebrex takes the edge off.  I think I would rather spend the whole day in the pool then kill my self with Celebrex. Kicking and doing laps in the pool is the only relief I get from this pain if I can't take Celebrex

My palms started itching, then my feet &amp; head. Within 15 minutes I was itching over most of my body and my skin turned bright red. Shortly after, my face blew up like a balloon. I could barely speak. My arms, hands, fingers and feet also swelled up. From the time I first started itching until the full on swelling took about 10 minutes. Upon arrival to the emergency room they immediately took me into a room and started an IV. 30 minutes later, the itching was gone, my skin color returned to normal and most of the swelling had subsided. I was there for 3 hours before 90% of the swelling went away. I left there with 2 epi pens and instructions not to take any more Celebrex.

Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	ligle22222@sbcglobal.net, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	2/21/2010 10:48:15 PM	In Oct. 2008 at age 57 took Celebrex 2X daily for 2.5 months for pain from spondylolisthesis (L-5 slipped forward 40%) from motor veh. accident and general arthritic joint pain.  It was a miracle drug! It allowed me to walk and stand, and exercise in a pool without pain. At 2.5 mos. allergic reaction-facial cheeks turned red, then dry, cheeks peeled and burned. Stopped for 1 mo. with pain returning.  Tried Celebrex 2nd time-same allergic reaction.  Stopped for another mo., tried 3rd time with same allergic reaction.  Had no choice but to have triple fusion on my back to relieve pain enough to stand and walk.  At 4 mos. after back surgery I took 2 Aleve daily for 6 mos. for arthritis and back stiffness with good pain relief.  Then I switched to 2 naproxin (generic Aleve)daily and cheeks turned red, burned, peeled again.  Now taking 1 naproxin daily and cheeks are not red but still dry.  Exercising in 91 degree pool 3or4 times weekly works wonders on joint pain.  I highly recommend Celebrex for those who could tolerate any side effects. Always take with food or stomach hurts.

So celebrex does nothing but damage to your kidneys

After years of Ibuprophen and Aspirin and Naproxin in varying doses at various intervals; my doctor prescribed me one 200mg Celebrex capule per day.  It provides me better pain relief than any of the other OTC or prescription drugs, and I only need it once a day (Lunchtime with food).  In brief, it works; and is worth the risks inherent in any NSAID drug.DON'T take any other NSAID with it, though; doing so increases your risk of bleeding exponentially!It isn't a blood thinner, though; so an Aspirin regimen (81mg once-per-day) may be approved by your doctor, but ask first!Don't take this drug and the Aspirin together, though; and always take it with food, and don't assume buffered aspirin is any safer than plain aspirin in this case.How happy am I with Celebrex?  I can enjoy the winters again; that's how happy I am.  I'm not a shut-in when it gets cold anymore, which used to be the case.

I have been using it in the 5-10yr range, however, now it is causing chronic kidney disease and I was told to get off of it.  I tried using it very sparingly - 3 to 4 days a week for a while and my kidney function went up but on the days I didn't take it I felt horrible -- could hardly move.  Then my ankles started swelling.  I thought it was my heart but it was my kidneys.  A doctor once told me that I had a choice.  Feel good now and take a couple of years off your life or feel lousy and die younger. I haven't quite decided yet.  I'm at the age now when living longer doesn't sound so great!

Now,I can cross my knee to tie my shoes again. For the most part I am very happy with this. Side effects, Some issues with muscle cramps, Feel tired for a while but it does pass. Overall to this point it is one of the good guys.

I saw a specialist who recommended fusion surgery, but I decided to get a second opinion.  The second doctor asked me to try celebrex first, which I agreed to, and what a difference!  I can move again, although bending still causes alot of pain.  I am concerned, however, that when I don't take celebrex for 7 days or so, I've noticed that my hands/fingers stiffen up and ache terribly.  I wonder if that is caused by prolonged celebrex use or do I just have arthritis in my hands?

Not a cure-all, but definitely an extremely helpful medication.Also, anyone who wants to take Celebrex off the market does not understand how awful being in constant pain is; every single day is a struggle.  Celebrex relieves some of my pain and a great deal of the inflammation at the 200 mg. dose -- and I am grateful for it.  I just don't like the expense, at nearly $4 a pill (I have no insurance at all).

To avoid taking another tablet when the effectiveness of this one wears down, I take 1 Tylenol-Arthritis tablet. This combination works most of the time for me. I have also had knee shots that work for months at a time.  Knee replacement is down the road for me.

I have had RA for about 6yrs.  I've taken it since my first encounter w/RA. It is the only drug that has stayed true to its effectiveness.  However, it's not effective enough to stand alone to stop &quot;severe&quot; RA inflammation/joint pain.  I've taken it with plaquenil, MTX and Leflunomide, all of which I had to stop taking because of the side effects, but no effects from the Celebrex.  Six years later, I'm still taking Celebrex.

I took Bextra for several years and it was very effective for me.  But when they removed Bextra from the market, the only drug left I could take was Celebrex.  Celebrex was not as effective for me.  It did not remove the pain in the joints or muscles nearby.  But I took it every day, 200 mg morning and 200 mg at night.  Recently, I quit taking celebrex because I felt it was being ineffective.  Sure enough, without the celebrex I was not very much worse off for pain.  So I have been off celebrex and everything else now for two months and I am doing quite well.  I wish there were some other cox-2 med that was approved for osteoarthritis pain control, because the cox-2 mechanism seems to work well for me.  But celebrex just does not do it for me.  And it is expensive.

Vioxx was by far the best for me with no side effects! Celebrex helps some and is better than nothing. Sometimes I have to add Tylenol Arthritis to get relief. The other meds I mentioned caused allergic reactions, i.e. face/throat swelling, and hives.

I took it for a year, daily for back pain. Dark red splotches appeared around the groin area, spreading on to the leg.  Stopped taking.  Hope this is not a serious problem.

Even though I took it with food, it gave me severe heartburn and diarrhea. Had only taken 1 dose. I had told the Dr. I could not take Advil or Elive and he said this was gentler. NOT !!! I am a nurse and was aware of the previous recall of this drug.  I would never take it again.

After rehab, I began taking it daily in early mornings and am blessed to be almost totally without pain...just some swelling in the joint.

A couple of years ago, I decided that I could probably wean myself off but after 10 days, I could hardly walk due to the pain in my knee, so I started taking the medication again and have had very little problems with pain in my knee since.  I do have to get an annual approval from my insurance company to continue taking it, but the pharmacy handles it for me.

I have sever Rheumatiod Arthritis and this drug is a life-saver! I take several other drug for RA, but I would not have any quality of life without Celebrex. I've not developed any of the stomach distress that some people have developed. It is expensive so your insurance company may give you problems approving it, especially if you are like me and take it twice a day, but it's worth the fight. I tried the other anti-inflamatories that were on the market before the FDA removed them, but at least for me, none worked as well as Celebrex. I would recommend this drug to anyone with RA. 
Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	55-64	4/13/2008 9:28:10 PM	One Celebrex taken daily worked great at relieving the pain in my knee which was debilitating.  I stopped due to gastrointestional distress.  If forced to restart this med, I will take it with food to help alievate that side effect as the relief of pain outweighs the side effects.  It is a great product.  Unfortunately, it is very expensive and insurance companies make folks jump through hoops before they allow coverage for this drug.  My co-pay is higher than what my health care provider pays! I was thankful that my physician supplied me with samples!

Other	Island Gal, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	4/2/2008 9:26:27 AM	I am a healthy 58 year old retired (1994) triathlete put on Celebrex as an anti-inflamatory (feet/tendon problems). I would suggest everyone be very careful with this drug! After less than 3 months of 200-300mg per day, I developed several severe side effects- swelling in hands and leg, severe congestion,unusual tiredness and head pain. My previous doctor did NOT monitor any development or progression of side effects! Had I not checked on Web MD and realized why I was having so many problems, my new doctor (got rid of the other one) would not have alerted me to discontinue it immediately. After 48 hours off Celebrex, the swelling is diminishing and hopefully all problems will go away in a week or two. Thank you Web MD for the opportunity for self education!! Perhaps this drug would not have been a problem, had I been monitored for side effects; it did get rid of the inflamation; if I'd have been taken off at that time, perhaps none of this would have happened.

I do also buise easily but there is less bruising than with the nsaids. My doctors have warned me of the complications, including heart problems but I think the benefits far outweigh the risks.

Even though my doctor gave me samples to try. It's put me in more pain than I was in before I was on anything. I recently have been diagnosed with Fibromylagia. Now, I have aching muscles all over, tenderness to-the-touch, shortness of breath and flu-like aching body feeling. I've only taken three pills and refuse to take anymore. Not only because I'm worse now than I was before, but all the warnings about it that I've read.

Also have minor IBS and a sensitive tummy.  2 pills before tennis helps during exercise.  1 pill/day keeps inflamation and headaches down but I still have some pain every day.  I will get stomach discomfort and lots of heartburn now, but not too bad, but need to really watch coffee and other irritants.

I don't believe that I can do without it.  I have been told that the reason that my legs are swelling each day is that they had read that it was caused from taking Celebrex, I would surely like to know if this has been tested and approved by the FDA as a cause of swelling in the legs. thank you.

After starting with a rheumatologist who could not come up with an RH actor in my bloodwork, he diagnosed me with fibromy-algia only and took away my Celebrex andPlaquenil and would only give me musclerelaxers and pain pills(both of which gaveme extreme constipation). Within a short time I was an invalid, needing help to even get off the toilet. He still refused to give me back my meds. After months of excruciating pain, I limped into his office without an appt., crying, and told him if he didn't give my meds back, he might as well put a gun in my hand so I could shoot myself, because  that's what I thought my life was worth at that point. I couldn't even take care of myself, let alone my husband, house and two children. He wrote me scripts for both meds right then and within 24 hours I was walking again. At my next appt., he asked me if I needed the mg's upped. NOW he listens to me. I do have to say,though, that was his first experience as a private practice doctor and he mighthave had a little bit of a God complex,but he has mellowed a LOT since then.

I have been on percocet mostly but my doctor wants to get me off narcotics.Percocet is the only thing thus far that has worked at all.I DO NOT think that it is as addictive as many people and doctors would have you think.I wish these docotrs would just let you stay on what works for you individualy and stop trying to constatly find something new or differant to put you on!

This is the first product that has helped me. It is not a miracle cure. It does not take the pain totally away from all of my envolved joints, but enough so that it allows me to function doing my everyday activities of daily living.Those who were trying to have Celebrex taken off of the market due to the &quot;potential side effects&quot; obviously never needed Celebrex in the first place; because the relief of the pain  and the freedom to be an active member of society that it provides is worth any potential side effect.People who are not affected do not know or understand that living in a constatnt state of pain/discomfort dosen't just cause a physical hurt; it is emotionally and physically draining. God bless the makers of Celebrex for providing a product that has allowed me to keep my independence.

I also have a problem with almost all of my joints requiring multiple surgeries.  To complicate that, i have arthritis in my joints.  Other anti-inflamatory drugs burned my stomach and didn't really help the pain.  I am currently using a spine doctor to treat my problems. He asked to try this drug.  After the second pill (200 mg.) I noticed a dramatic difference.  My joints stopped hurting.  I could move and walk much better.  I have rarely had to take a stronger pain medication.  For me, this has been a wonder drug.
