Because of poor cast placement, my thumb has been very swollen.  The surgeons answer was to make me take this stuff.  It was only a five day dose, but I feel like I've had the flu for a week.  Sore throat, puffy eyes, no energy. I finished the dose and the swelling is still there in my thumb and very painful.  I'm not happy with anything at this point, but I'm sorry I let this stuff into my system.  Not good!!

The 1st time I took this I had no side effects at all. Now, on day one of the multi pack I have had nausea, vomiting, headache, face and chest flushing, and sleeplessness. But I will continue to take it because I am no longer wheezing and only having to use my nebulizer 2 x a day and inhaler 2 x a day!

Contact Dermatitis	camogirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	8/14/2009 1:52:17 PM	I was perscribed this because i had poison ivy very bad! I got a shot and never phased it and then was perscribed a cream and still did nothing. My body is very diffrent then normal people. I cant take night time medicine because i stay up all night and benadryl makes me hyper. So in most cases i get the opposite reaction if any at all. And this perscription has a side effect of sleeping trouble and of course i did experience this problem!! But other then that- overall it started clearing it up quickly!

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	25-34	4/19/2009 11:23:29 PM	I was prescribed this medication for Bell's Palsey by a neurologist.  I've never had this condition before, so unsure if it's working.  I've read that Bell's goes away on its own w/ or w/o medication, so unsure why I'm taking a medication that I can't sleep while taking, will potentially make me gain weight and break-out like a teenager.  It's not enough one side of my face is droopy, but I'll be fat w/ acne too??!!

Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	55-64	3/13/2009 1:36:30 PM	An ear, nose, throat dr prescribed this to try treating an inflammed and discolored tonsil.. It helped lessen infammation, and discoloration some, but a week after taking, I had nose bleeds, never had them before taking...went back to dr and was given a gel to put in my nostrils to help alleviate dried out sinuses.  probably caused by medicine.  Now dr recommends removing the tonsil, so guess it didn't work.  possible abyss on tonsil

I can't realy tell a difference in my sinus, but I am terrible thirsty and my heart rate is fast and irregular at times.  I can't sleep and feel dizzy.  I'm done with the pack and you can believe I am never taking this again!
Asthma	iceman, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	55-64	10/2/2008 6:34:17 PM	This medication was prescribed to &quot;see&quot; if I had Acid Reflux OR a chronic respitory problem OR infection of the larynix.  The idea is to see what stops.  Chronic cough and chronic green mucus when coughing.Don't know if it works, all I do know is after one day he coughing is worse, but the mucus production is down and the color is almost gone.I do ache all over, very tired and at times somewhat confused. Not very good feelings to simply find out, but it is the least expensive avenue and predisone has worked well in the past.

Bronchitis	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	4/3/2008 11:23:50 AM	Doctor recommended methylpred for my 7 year old. 4mg. She took the 6 pills the first day and had trouble sleeping. medication warns about insomia, so I was patient and continued the second day with the 5 pills. At night my daughter woke up crying and having muscle spasm and bone pain. Uncontrolled movements of the lower body and made her scared and miserable. This medicine slows growth in children. I am having a hard time accepting the fact that the doctor gave this medicine to a 7 year old to treat cough. I am not using the rest of it. Called the doctor she said stop using it. 44mg are already in my child's system. Horrible experience for my daughter.
