I wish something was as effective but now I take Vicodin for the pain, which I really hate to do.

Absolutly the best tendonitis med. It just needs to be prescribed responsibly. We need to start a campaign of some sort for a review of benefits and risk. How many other pain relievers out there are actually more dangerous or addictive. Or have strange and disgusting side effects.

I was on the max dose for three years without any problems what so ever. I was very fortunate that I did not have any adverse effects while using it.  No other drug does what Vioxx did for me.  After suffering for three or four months looking for a suitable replacement, I found Celebrex.  I am on the max dose of Celebrex and it only lasts about 18-20 hours. I often wake in my RA pain.  Vioxx lasted 30 hours and was just wonderful for me.

There are lots of drugs out there with way worse side effects. Obviously, people with heart conditions should not take most of them. Bring it back!

It eased my pain (lower back disc) and I was very upset that it went off the market. Since then, I have been given less than adaquate drugs for my back. I wish they would do more studies with more people than just a few complainers before stripping medicine that works for most than just the few.  I say do another study and stop cry babies that just want to make a buck.

I had two lumbar surgeries and a lamaonectomy. The lowest dosage has completely removed all of my pain from inflamation. Bring this drug back!

The dr. gave this to me and I really don't know if it helped or not because It still took 5 months to heal but I developed a blood clot in my leg and stopped taking vioxx. Now after 7 years the clot has broken up and my whole leg is swolen sore and black and blue and am being checked to see if it traveling to my lungs. I am a very active 43 year old women with 4 kids. I only weigh 115 lbs and work 2 jobs. I play softball and ride horses regularly. So the person who said they would probably have the same problems without even taking vioxx is very ignorant. If I didn't catch the clot right away and kept taking the drug I may not be here to write this now. I hope they can help me without having to take my leg.

While drugs work differently on different people, this really helped me and I would take it again because nothing I have taken since has worked as well.

OF COURSE THEY TAKE IT OFF THE MARKET BUT STILL LEAVE ADDICTIVE NARCOTIC MEDS AVAILABLE.  WHAT A SHAME!  CAN I FIND IT IN ANOTHER COUNTRY????

It's sad that the few people that had negative effects were able to sue this product out of the hands of the many who were helped using it. I'm sure if each negatively affected person's case could have been studied on an individual basis there would be other contributing factors causing results such as stroke and other cardiovascular problems without linking them to Vioxx. In other words those individuals who had cardiovascular complications most likely would have experienced them even if they had never taken Vioxx. When the courts, lacking medical expertise, decide that huge settlements should be awarded to pacify people wanting millions for their unfortunate disbilities good medicine and treatment options are taken away.
