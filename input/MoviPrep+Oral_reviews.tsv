Emptying of the Bowel	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	7/20/2012 9:04:21 AM	Was not effective for me.  Really had no effect after first dose - after second round, did have some bowel movements but it was not successful in cleaning colon.  Dr was not able to complete colonoscopy next day.  Still have bloated feeling, gas, and minor diareha day after taking.Not at all happy with performance or effectiveness, and have to re-do prep and colonoscopy with another prep.Just didn't work - I guess that's why they need the rebate coupons.
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	45-54	7/18/2012 12:15:18 PM	I was nervous about having my 1st colonoscopy knowing the prep part would be the worst - especially because I'm hypoglycemic. Read a lot of these reviews which seemed better than the Osmoprep pill reviews. Spent prep day eating mostly broth &amp; saltines. Only had chicken broth for dinner at 515pm and then waited the alotted 1 hr and began drinking the prep at 615pm. I will agree with many of the reviewers, the night before you have to drink it, mix it with Crystal Light lemonade - I used 2 regular packets. Shake well and stick in the back of the fridge to get cold. Definitely use a straw! The Crystal Light makes the taste portion bearable but there is nothing to mask the overwhelming salt taste!! Like drinking the ocean! I drank the first 16 ozs in 20 minutes than had to slow down because of the God awful saltiness. But I also had an ice cold glass of water as my chaser which helped a lot. Finished the 1st liter in 1 hour and within 25 minutes I was going. I lucked out and didnt have to take the 2nd liter which was a good thing because I'm not sure I could have choked down a whole 2nd one! No cramps, nausea (although I did feel a bit queasy while trying not to gag while drinking it down), I did get that full stomach feeling like if you drink a lot of water on an empty stomach, but overall everything went better than I thought. 
Emptying of the Bowel	NormaGold, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	7/17/2012 3:03:04 PM	Didn't work for me. First BM was 4 1/2 hours after taking it. Stomach was bloated and sore. Some relief after first BM. Have to return for another colonoscopy I assume using a different prep. Very disappointed to have to go through the prep all over again. I am 66, 5'4&quot; and 117 lbs. Dr blamed me for not taking it properly but I did follow all instructions. Moviprep is refunding the cost of the drug to me.
Emptying of the Bowel	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	65-74	7/5/2012 3:42:29 PM	The taste is awful, but I chilled it and drank through a straw while holding my nose.  It does help to take a drink of water after each sip also.  It does cause that full bloated filling, but no stomach cramps like the last stuff I took.  My doctor had me scheduled to take it at 6:00 pm and 4:00 am.  I changed that to 4:00 pm and 11:00 pm.  That way I got to bed by 2:00 am and slept until 7:00 am.  I was due to go to the surgical center at 8:00 am.  I could not have tolerated drinking that stuff at 4:00 am.  Sorry doctor, but I had to change the time or I couldn't have gone through with it.

Emptying of the Bowel	Susan, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1		55-64	6/7/2012 12:13:52 AM	Well I have followed everything to the T and 4 hours after taking my first dose I have had one normal movement after 3 hours and that is it...I didn't mind the taste but so far just cramping and no action. I used a diff. product 10 years ago and had no problem. I am having small chills now.
Emptying of the Bowel	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	19-24	6/6/2012 12:26:15 PM	Holy sh*t does this make you go!  I wish I had read these reviews before I began!  I did use a straw, which like many of you stated, helped tremendously!  I used plain water as a chaser; I was afraid adding another taste/flavor would make it worse, but it seems like Apple Juice worked for a lot of you.  Didn't know you could add flavors to it; next time, I'll try that! Nothing to do with the medication itself:: Get magazines, desitin/vaseline, baby wipes, and a candle.  Even with the vaseline and baby wipes, your booty hole will be raw and bleed.  Procedure itself is a breeze, the prep is the worst part. You can do it!!
Emptying of the Bowel	damian, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	45-54	5/23/2012 8:56:37 PM	The product does what its supposed to do. And it does taste vile. Helps to use a straw, hold your nose, and drink apple juice in between gulps. The prep is definately worse than the procedure.
Emptying of the Bowel	gabbie0427, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/14/2012 11:47:22 PM	Wow you all had me scared to death to take Moviprep. My experience with it was not bad at all. While I am used to having diarrhea the affects of the Moviprep were not bad for me. I did use some of the advice I saw on this site. I made it up ahead of time and chilled it, added lemonade mix, drank it with a straw and used apple juice as a chaser. While it wasn't the best thing I have ever  drank it wasn't that bad. Just do what I did and put your big girl or guy panties on and go for it!

It did what it was supposed to do. I would recommend drinking lots of fluids during the day to stay hydrated. It did not give me stomach cramps like a previous prep I'd used 7 years ago. I mixed it up about 8 hours ahead of time and got it really chilled in the fridge. Also, drink it with a straw as you bypass a lot of taste buds that way! It is very salty, but wasn't intolerable for me.
Emptying of the Bowel	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	65-74	4/18/2012 6:46:20 PM	Read all the hints before using Moviprep. Made sure it was ice cold..and had apple juice/ginger ale for a chaser. Mixed it with Crystal Lite, but I think the second batch I used with a &quot;tea bag&quot; steeping in it was a bit easier to get down. Worked quickly and easier than I thought!
Emptying of the Bowel	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/13/2012 6:51:15 AM	I mixed as directed, and then chilled ice cold. I was expecting something really nasty, but I didn't think it tasted horrid. Chased it with a glass of chilled water...it was fine. Be rested, cause if you are doing the two in the evening, you will be up late till it is finally over. Be very close to a bathroom.
Emptying of the Bowel	Anonymous, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/7/2012 12:02:36 PM	If you have to take this product, be prepared. I chilled both the prep and the glass before drinking, added a half a serving of Crystal Light Lemonade then ice. Used a straw and after every few sips took a swig of Ginger Ale. It took two hours to get the first litre down, but my doctor emphasized that it is more important to get it down than to stick to the schedule. I was very lucky, because this product worked so well for me that I only had to drink the first litre. I was extracting clear, urine-like poop halfway through, and I can also say that my Colonoscopy went great! Also, there was no running to the restroom or going in my pants. Very easy experience. The worst part for me was a headache and hunger pains. My best advice is to prepare your body before the liquid diet so that you don't have a lot to evacuate and then you can drink less of the liquid. Two days before I ate a white diet (scrambled eggs, white bread, white noodles) and the next day I did not stray from the liquid diet. If you are eating huge meals or food that is hard for your body to break down such as red meat or high fiber, you will need to consume more of the liquid and you risk having explosive diarrhea.
Emptying of the Bowel	Satisfied, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	3/22/2012 4:45:10 PM	I'm writing this for my husband because I know he wont' do it.  Being the &quot;worry wart&quot; that I am, I read ALL of the reviews on this the day before my husband had to start his &quot;prep&quot; for a colonoscopy the following day. I must say, I was afraid for him considering most of the comments I read. I took the advice of some people and bought him Crystal Light, Lifesavers, straws and &quot;wet&quot; wipes (I already had vaseline).  I mixed it up for him the night before and refridgerated it to make sure it was nice and chilled. I smelled it and it didn't smell that bad to me. Kind of like salty lemonade. He started his &quot;prep&quot; at about noon time and finished off a full liter by about 1:00pm. He said it started to work in about 1/2 an hour. I asked him if if made him feel sick or bloated and he told me he only felt a very slight stomach ache that went away after each &quot;movement&quot;. He said the worst part of the whole thing was having to keep getting up to go to the bathroom! He drank &quot;most&quot; of the second liter at about 7:00pm. He didn't feel the need to finish it completely since he was passing &quot;clear&quot; liquid. He had a very good &quot;full&quot; nights sleep and had his procedure at 9:30am......his comment of that part of it was &quot;That was easy and painless&quot;. As far as he was concerned the whole thing was well worth it (his results were clear and normal) :) and he would do it again without any worry at all. Now it's my turn!!!!!!!! I thought it was important to document this so that anyone out there doing what I was doing (reading and getting really scared for my husband) would feel at least a &quot;little&quot; better knowing there were some satisfied consumers out there regarding Moviprep.
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/13/2012 9:32:29 PM	I added Crystal Light, which helped a lot.  It does not taste bad and is soooo much better than NuLytely.  It worked well.
Emptying of the Bowel	Jeff, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	45-54	2/20/2012 9:00:54 PM	Had a colonoscopy today and used MoviPrep last night.  It's doesn't taste real good but it's not designed to be tasty. It did what it was supposed to do and gave the doctor a very clear view of my colon.  No nausea or pain.  Chill it and drink with a straw quickly and you should be fine.  It's a necessary evil to clean your colon. The colonoscopy itself was fine as well.  Get Propofol!
Emptying of the Bowel	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	1/31/2012 1:09:24 AM	So I just had to come on here and write a review about Moviprep.  I was really scared to start this prep because of the horrible reviews I read.  I started my day off by drinking lots of liquids, broth, basically anything clear to keep myself hydrated. At 4pm I started the Moviprep...I was SO nervous.  When I started to drink it I thought to myself, this isn't bad at all! Sure, it wasn't the best drink in the world but it wasn't the worst either.  What helped me was that I paced myself.  I didn't chug the full 8 ounces every time.  I drank it through a straw and chilled it (that helped a lot).  Also, I mixed some of it with Crystal Light (that helped only sometimes, at times it was just better to drink it straight since it was so sweet as it was). It did its job and my colonoscopy went very well.  I wouldn't freak out about this process...just pace yourself and don't worry, it will all be over within 24 hours.  Just remember, keep yourself hydrated and pace yourself!
Emptying of the Bowel	JamesJ, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	65-74	1/20/2012 5:14:03 PM	I was a little aprehensive about using this after reading some of the reviews, but it turned out just fine.  The stuff will never be a prefered mixer for coctails, but it didn't taste all that bad.  I chilled it and chugged it down, knocking off each glass in a minute or so.  Followed that up with a Life Saver to suck on.  It kicked in after about 45 minutes and most of the action was over after a couple of hours.  I used Tuck's astringent pads after most of the evacuations and didn't have any trouble with soreness.  I started the procedure at 5 PM for a 7 AM colonoscopy and managed to get about 6 hours of sleep, in spite of having to do the second round at 2AM.  My best advice is just 'Man Up' and do it.  About 14 hours of prepping that went as well as could be expected.  The only cheating I did on the instructions was to treat myself to a shot of a very nice single malt Scotch after completing the first stage.
Emptying of the Bowel	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	65-74	1/18/2012 11:11:41 PM	Wish I would have read the reviews before I started this...got the first liter down at 5PM..just the thoughts of the 2nd round has me gagging.  Bloated...chills.  Wish the instructions had said to coat the anus with petroleum jelly before you &quot;start&quot;..right now I feel like I'm expelling thumb tacks...would NEVER use this prep again. I'm going to ask my doc how much stock he has in the company that puts this stuff out.
Emptying of the Bowel	jbarelli, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	1/4/2012 7:24:38 AM	Roughly ten hours after starting the first treatment, I have yet to have a bowel movement, but have gone through about eight hours of the worst gas pains I have ever endured.  Normally, regularity is not a problem for me, but if this keeps up, I will not be able to have my procedure.  It is now 4 AM and I cannot sleep because of the gas pains and gut rumblings.
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	1/2/2012 7:40:35 PM	Was prescribed because golytely made me vomit.  You drink much less Moviprep.  My dr said I could mix in crystal light which helped taste, tasted like salty lemonade, not the best.  I got first dose done, then did only half second dose but it cleaned me out just fine.  
Emptying of the Bowel	Dutchman47, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	12/30/2011 11:32:36 AM	DIDN'T WORK!!!!  It didn't completely cleanse by colon even though I followed the instructions completely.  It generated many bowel movements very quickly after starting and eventually only light yellow watery discharge.  However, during the colonoscopy right side of the colon was still too packed with fecal material for the Dr. to complete the procedure.  Now I have to undergo the whole procedure again.  What a waste of money and time.I would never recommend the use of MoviPrep.

IT'S NOT THAT BAD, PEOPLE!!!!!  I mean, really-consider why you are taking this.  :-)  I had my 1st batch at 4PM-yes, it's really salty-I made it the night before so it was really cold and chased it down with Gatorade.  The next batch at 10PM, again chased down with Gatorade.  It's only 2 liters-totally do-able.  I would recommend from reading others' experience, put some Vaseline on your tush and use flushable wet wipes instead of toilet paper-your hiney will appreciate that.  I was asleep by about 1AM and clean as a whistle for my procedure the next day.
Emptying of the Bowel	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	12/13/2011 10:56:31 PM	Tastes like salty Gatorade. Could consume both liters and additional required fluids in one evening (as per instructions) with minimal difficulty. No nausea or vomiting. No stomach cramps. Was unable to get off of toilet for 3 hours, but then slept well until awaking at six a.m.  Diarrhea continued next day, although in smaller more predictable(?) amounts. Dr said prep very effective. Minimal discomfort after procedure probably due to surgical gas during procedure. Would certainly recommend this prep, just be prepared to be stuck on the toilet until evacuation complete. Began prep at 6pm, BM starting at 6:45 until around 10:30pm.

I drank the 32 oz of Moviprep with no problems. As suggested I got it nice and cold, then drank it through a straw. I followed every few gulps with apple juice. During my 3rd dose, it took effect, so I had to finish the last one in the bathroom, but there was no pain or cramping. It's not as bad as I thought it would. Tomorrow morning, I drink it again. 
Emptying of the Bowel	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	11/22/2011 2:17:43 PM	Insufficient cleansing, &quot;poor prep&quot; result  although instructions were followed exactly as written.

It isn't that bad. I am 17 years old and have a very sensitive stomach. I did not vomit or have painful cramps. I did the split dosage and drank both liters completely. I was starving but other than that my experience was fine. If I am 17 and can do this so can you. * Also I was diagnosed with Celiacs Disease so thats a big bummer but the Moviprep wasn't bad just the not eating part.
Emptying of the Bowel	Tee Gee, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	11/9/2011 11:36:17 PM	Had a colonoscopy 2day n did same day Moviprep starting at 6am. The taste was repulsive but I expected that. The first round I barely got the 4th dose down w out vomitting. 1st bowel movement was after 3rd dose in 1st round. 2nd round was at 9am n by then bowel movements were light in color n water. So, in the 2nd round? I quit after dose 3. I knew I would vomit if I continued n also knew I didn't need more as I was almost having clear color water bowel movements. And, I was right. Part of what bothered me about this product is it's the exact same dose for everyone. I'm 5'6&quot; n 120 lbs, there was a 274 lb guy at the center who took the same dosage. Seems odd. I can say eating light tge day b4 n not eating after 5pm seemed to make things easier. Overall the product worked well, minimal cramping n did the trick. Make sure it's well refrigerated n I found washing my mouth out after each gulp helped a lil. I also tried to drink it down quickly it was too gross to sip. 
Emptying of the Bowel	SF, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female		11/2/2011 2:06:40 PM	If there more than 5*'s for 'Very Effective' this prep drug would take the cake.  It's way too effective; within 1 hr. as it said on the instructions bowels felt almost cleaned out already.  The drug is vile as far as its effect that's like runny diarrhea from a stomach bug.  It forced me to use the toilet every few minutes for half the day.  Then the instr. wanted me to drink another set of the fluid.  Being butt sore and totally tired from the diarrhea effect I had to ask the doctor if it was necessary to drink the second set.  After asking me questions he determined that I didn't need to drink anything further, but if I could stand it to drink 8 oz. more which I did and again had the severe diarrhea after an hour and a half.  This stuff is terrible to say the least.  If everyone had the reaction I had they would refuse to undergo a colonoscopy procedure.  They ought to invent something else that is not as harsh!  I would never recommend Moviprep.

What a pleasure in comparison to the night before prep using Movi Prep. If I knew how bad it would be to drink that prep I never would have used that product. It tasted so vile even though I &quot;chased&quot; each 8oz glass with ginger ale. I was able to get the first liter down with limited retching, however I only drank 8oz of the second liter before I vomited. I will definitely use any other product the next time I under go this procedure.

Emptying of the Bowel	Sauntay, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	65-74	9/15/2011 1:53:43 PM	Two weeks ago I had my 6th colonscopy by the same doctor.  Each time I have had a different prep prescribed.  While none of them are pleasant, they have all worked in the past.  This time I was prescribed MoviPres along with Reglan &amp; Bisacodyl.  The doctors instructions and the MoviPres instructions were not the same but I followed the doctors instruction.  The product seemed to go straight through me and I suffered from extreme chilling of the body inside and out.  Could not get warm no matter how much clothing I put on.  I followed all the instructions and was clean as a whistle.  However, when I had the colonscopy the doctor said that I was not clean inside and that I must not have taken all of the Moviprep which I did.  I always have polops and had seven this time which came back fine.  When I went for my follow-up yesterday my doctor said I have to come back next year since I wasn't cleaned out and told me again that I had not followed instructions and had gotten lazy since I retired.  I found that to be offensive.  I believe that there is a problem with this product for some people after reading the reviews on several sites and finding that others had similar problems.  Interesting that a friend is have the procedure done next week by the same docter and he was prescribed a different method of preparation. 
Emptying of the Bowel	Just do it, 65-74 Male  (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	65-74	9/11/2011 1:45:43 PM	After reading all the negative reviews, I tried to find another product but ended up using Moviprep anyway. I don't know what people expect from a medicine but my suggestion is to just grin &amp; bear it and follow directions. I mixed and chilled the liquid in the refri for over an hour before starting to drink it. Follow each glass with some cold water to rinse the taste away. During the colonoscopy I could see my colon was clean and it did the job. (I chose not to be sedated.) My doc rated the cleansing as excellent. I wouldn't want to see what he sees with those who go in with a partially clean colon because they would rather complain than consume. The physicians are looking for cancer after all and are trying to help. In the end drinking Moviprep is not so bad, esp., considering what colon cancer can do to us.

Those who said it tastss like salty Lemon Pledge are absolutely correct.  I have a cast-iron stomach and have no vomited in over 40 years but came very close after only drinking approximately 10 oz.  Had to stop and call the doctor.  Cancelled my colonoscopy.  Also had the chills after drinking this small amount.  If someone offered me a million dollars to complete the prep I would have said no.  Took Fleet's Phososoda 5 years ago and while nasty, it tasted like fruit punch compared to Moviprep.  It was like trying to drink poison.

I can never use lemon Pledge again because it will remind me of what it tastes like.  I read to use a straw, that was the only thing that saved this very wrong experience. Forgot to mention the ridiculious cost, never again.

NEVER AGAIN.

I called the Dr. on call &amp; he said I could switch to MiraLax &amp; Gatorade, which was more palatable &amp; a lot less expensive--&amp; it worked. I will never use this again. Ask your Dr. about the Miralax prep before investing in MoviPrep. I wish I had!

I took the split dosage. Each time, I was through within about 3 hours from the first glass full. Stay close to the bathroom. I did not experience any nausea or bloating.
Emptying of the Bowel	Christie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	55-64	8/6/2011 1:14:08 PM	I took the first 4 doses of Moviprep as instructed at5PM with no results, then I took the next four doses every 15 minutes at 7PM. It still didn't work for a while and my stomach was like a balloon. Then I started vomiting and emptying my bowels over the next half hour. I was up most of the night still emptying my bowels. It was not a pleasant experience. I was clean and went through the colonoscopy. In 5 years I will have to have another one, but I will hope to be able to use some other form of medication.
Emptying of the Bowel	shaking, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	55-64	8/4/2011 2:03:05 PM	BEWARE! Followed instructions exactly prior to taking this.  Took first cup of first liter, had to rush to bathroom.  By third cup all fecal matter was flushed out.  Finished first liter.  Had to keep running to the bathroom for 6 1/2 more hours just flushing out clear salt water.  Couldn't get to sleep so it was time for second liter.  Was only able to get 3/4 of it down.  Continued rushing to the bathroom passing clear salt water for 6 more hours.  Went in for my 8:45 appt with no sleep for over 24 hours.  I was out of control; my body shaking furiously, my blood pressure spiking, unable to think clearly. Will NEVER take this again!  The nurse said my electrolytes and other body chemicals were all out of balance from the treatment.  I probably should not have taken the second dose but wanted to follow instructions. Doctor said I should have called him - BUT I do not want to call at 3:30 am - if he's working on me the next day I want him to be well-rested.  Doseage is WAY too high and product is barbaric!  Colonoscopy was yesterday, still having the runs today.
Emptying of the Bowel	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	55-64	8/4/2011 6:03:29 AM	Are you kidding me? It's called low volume, high efficacy!  This is horrible!  It's not so much the taste as the volume of liquid.  My first dose was pretty bad.  By the time I was done with it, my abdomen was like a bowling ball and I was freezing cold.  The thought of doing this over again 6 hours later was torture.  By the way, at the time of the second prep I was totally cleaned out!  I only drank half of the second dose and will take my chances tomorrow am.  No way I would use this again.  Also, I'm starving!

The lemon flavor of this medicine gave it not only a roadkilled zest, but a rather dirty diseased taste. Take the damn lemon out, Jesus. I hope I never have to drink this stuff again.
Emptying of the Bowel		1	1	1			7/21/2011 12:33:53 PM	I am scheduled for a colonoscopy and the doctor prescribed MoviPrep.  After reading the reviews and looking at the ingredients I realized that those who got so sick from the drug -vomiting and headache are most likely allergic to ASPARTAME - which is an artifical sweetner.  I vomit for 3 days if I get ASPARTAME or any other artifical sweetner into my system.  It took me years to figure this out so I just wanted to pass it on in hopes it would help someone.  I have not taken it but gave it low stars because it would not work for me and would be a terrible experience if I had.

Emptying of the Bowel	LemonT, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	45-54	6/29/2011 9:53:01 PM	My prep was for a routine colonoscopy, of which I've had four in the last 12 years because of family history. I learned a lot by reading previous reviews, and I used the chaser trick after every few swallows. I liked ginger ale for this purpose. I found the first dose actually more difficult than the second, perhaps because by the second dose I was already pretty well empty. Having used the PhosphoSoda previously, I'd say this was somewhat more difficult to take both because of the volume of fluid and the taste and texture (slightly viscous), but it did not dehydrate me as much as the soda. I don't think any method is pleasant, but this was okay enough that I'd do it next time unless by then they've come up with something better.
Emptying of the Bowel	turtledove, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	55-64	6/26/2011 4:17:03 PM	I took the advice of one reviewer and drank apple juice after each sip or gulp of MoviPrep. The apple juice absolutely saved me. Also, my doctor's office recommended sucking on lemon slices which helped keep the nausea at bay. The instructions from the box allowed 15 to 30 minutes per 8 oz. of moviprep. Therefore, I took my time and stopped drinking when I felt bloated or ill and waited for the feeling to pass before continuing.  Even though, with this method it took me twice or three times longer, I felt in control and didn't experience the dreadful reactions others reported.

Aside from MoviPrep costs at least twice as much and tastes far worse.  My doc prescribed MoviPrep, but I think I'll pass on this one based on reviews and cost/benefit analysis.

Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/4/2011 11:20:48 PM	OK, I don't know if I'm a freak or what, but I had absolutely NO trouble with Movi Prep.  Yes, of course it does not taste like champagne, but I had absolutely no trouble getting it down.  I had a glass of diet ginger ale nearby in case I needed a chaser, but really didn't need it.  I took the split dose and was completely cleaned out for my colonoscopy the next day.  Please don't let the majority of these posts discourage you.  This stuff was way better than other products I've used for previous procedures and I would absolutely use it again.

I am one of the users who had a bad experience, and I could relate to the &quot;torture&quot; comments of others.  I had a very hard time getting it down, and did vomit more than once, in addition to much gagging.  I cannot honestly say that I would ever do it again.  Maybe I would just take my chances.  It was just horrible.

Everything went fine. Follow the instructions EXACTLY and you should be OK too. The taste is as everyone says; very salty lemon drops. I good trick that helped to cut the taste was to take a drink and quickly take a sip of apple juice. The super sweet against the super saltly worked well.

Emptying of the Bowel	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	65-74	5/10/2011 9:52:03 PM	Although this product was effective, it has the most DISGUSTING taste.  True, I don;t know what other flavor could be used, but the lemon flavor is sickening.  I thought several times over the course of drinking MoviPrep that I might throw up, but luckily I didn't.There should be suggestions on the box as to what could be used to ease the burning of the rectum area. eg: petroleum jelly, diaper rash ointment.  Anything to ease the discomfort.

Stomach will fill full- after drinking the 32 ounces in one hour,first bowel movement occurred after 30 mins- then the watery bowel movements occurred about every 15-30 mins until I went to sleep at midnight- woke up a 5:30 am and drank the 2nd 32 ounces- watery bowel movements occurred until about 8:30 am- colon was clean because the morning bowel movement was mostly clear with some smallish particles
Emptying of the Bowel	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	55-64	5/3/2011 11:08:17 PM	I am not usually one to complain nor do I encourage my personal experiences to compromise those of others. However, my wife and I recently were prescribed MoviPrep for colonoscopies that were to take place about 3 weeks apart. During my wife's prep, she was ok with the first round, although the quantity and the taste seemed to continue to get worse. By early morning after she started the second round, she began to vomit so profusely that I considered a possible trip to the hospital. The next morning at the colonoscopy, she needed an enema since the prep did not evacuate all fecal material. For my experience, my first round was a bit uneventful except for that foul taste, quantity and torture of having to endure this 4 times at 1/4 liter each. In any event, within a two or so hours, the prep did what is was designed to do. Now, I had to get up at 2:30 for round two. After the first 1/4 portion, I started to get severe stomach cramps, so severe that I began to sweat and double over in pain. I, like my wife was about 15 minutes from an emergency room visit. Once the cramps subsided, I was ok and thus continued with the remaining 3 portions. I had to remain awake for almost three hours for fear of ruining the furniture. In the end, and no pun intended here, my colonoscopy went ok. I did have some ill effects after, but I am not sure such can be linked to the Moviprep. In the colonoscopy center, where I overhead others talking to the nurses, one women complained of severe nausea as well.I called my local doctor to ask about my post colonoscopy symptoms and she did not speak highly of the MoviPrep citing cases where it may have contributed to renal failure.Seems that 2 liters of this potion distributed to someone 115 pounds or 315 pounds might require some adjustment but I do not see any limitations of the two liters due to weight.We are pleased with our doctor, but both my wife and I have vowed to never use this MoviPrep again regardless of the doctors o

I took Moviprep following the instructions rigidly to the minute. It was utterly useless it did not have the desired effect and my bowel was half emptied. Result I got an admonishment from the doctor. The procedure was painful due to feacal obstruction and it took twice as long for the procedure to be accomplished. I have to go over the whole procedure again in 3 months. I will do some reserch so that can enhance the effectiveness of this disgusting fluid.

I wondeered if I could keep it down. On the second batch, I chased each swallow with something I liked on my &quot;allowable&quot; list. I used coffee. MUCH improved. You will need to be near the toilet for four or five hours after a dose.Overall, not so bad.

I was given this MoviPrep to take.  1 liter last night and 1 liter this morning.  NOTHING I have been through has been as horrible as this TOXIN!  I have a cast iron stomach but after drinking the 1 liter (which tastes like lemon saltwater and windex).. I started vomiting profoundly, chills, shakes, confusion and an overall HORRIBLE sick feeling.  I will NEVER EVER take this wretched, vial mixture again! I can't believe they can't make this taste better!!  The inventor should have to drink a few gallons of this evil stuff!!!!  COMPLETELY DISATISFIED!!!!

I have not had a bad experience at all, the flavor leaves a lot to be desired (tastes like saltwater gatorade mixed with nasty) But no cramping, pain, vomiting or real discomfort Can't get far from a bathroom, but thats just part of it I suppose. I'll be taking the second dose in about an hour and if  my condition rapidly deteriorates, I'll repost.  Honestly, this is much easier than I thought it would be!

I followed the directions perfectly...fasting, drinking all the awful stuff at 5 p.m.  I kept waiting for something to happen...Nothing happened for 5 hours.  So I was up all night and was still trying to evacuate my colon and I had to start drinking the second portion.  I was still having liquid in me at the time of my colonoscopy. 6 hours after my colonoscopy, I am still having liquid come out.  It took way too long for it to work on me.  
Emptying of the Bowel	Bobo, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	3/22/2011 9:58:19 PM	I recently had a positive experience with Moviprep.  Yes, I read some reviews which stated it caused high blood pressure, but to my knowledge, I did not experience elevated pressure when I drank it.  My B/P is under control.  That's not to say it would not happen to other people.  The taste was not that bad and it cleaned me out for a good colonoscopy the next day even though I had light breakfast the day before. I did look at the testing that Salix Pharmaceuticals included with the package and it did not mention blood pressure tests.  Probably they did not anticipate a problem, but I would encourage them to conduct another test with blood pressure measured. If you are concerned about this product, contact your physician's office or a responsible health provider.  I did.

I don't remember if it was before or during my second dose I experienced a rapid, irregular heart beat which resolved itself after consuming jello and thus was quite likely caused by a low blood sugar resultant of the starvation aspect of the procedure.

Very nervous about the whole process.  Mixed it with Crystal lite lemonade crystals - so didn't find the taste too bad.  Had a hard time taking the full liter the first night - gave me a few chills and felt bloated, was able to do better with the second session.  Dr. said it was very effective.  Had more issues with the actual colonoscopy than the moviprep.  Would definitely recommend it.

I did 1pm and 5pm and only finished at 11pm even though I had to go in the night and the next morning. The last scope I had I used FLEET and by god was it harsh, but Moviprep gave a gentle action. The only problem I found taking this stuff was the so called lemon taste this drink is nasty and the only way it went down was with orange juice. Would I do Moviprep again yes I think so I did not have any soreness to my bum may be because I used baby wipes and zinc and caster oil cream but I had no cramps. My consultant was quite happy with the outcome but while watching my insides on the tv screen I could still see poo. So I think they might have to give you more to get a full clean.

First dose yesterday at 7-8 PM, second dose between 3-4 AM this morning.  NO movements at all before leaving for appointment at 7:15, did not have a movement until after 8:30!The prep was easy to use, except for getting up in the middle of the night for the second dose.It is now 4:30 PM and I am still gassy and having fluid stool about once every half hour or so.  Talk about a delayed reaction!

I tried using a straw and it just made it harder to swallow. Best method for me was to take a deep breath, drink a big gulp of it and after swallowing exhale to get the smell out of your mouth. Not a great experience but not the worst thing I've had to go through. Good luck.

It took about an hour to start working for me, I finished the cleaning out in about 3 hrs. I did get chilled for a while. I finished the second stage Monday morning in about3and 1/2 hours. After the colonoscopy was done the Doctor said I was not cleaned out completely that it was a little cloudy but that he did complete the procedure. I was very disappointed because I followed the directions for the medication very carefully and for the price(54.00) expected it to do a MUCH better job.
Emptying of the Bowel	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	65-74	1/12/2011 12:07:34 PM	I took this prep as instructed, went in for the colonoscopy and after completion I was told that the bowl prep was poor as there was some liquified as well as solid stool remaining and the test would have to be taken again at a later date and with 2 days of prep.  I'm going to try to get a refund of my $69.00 as the product didn't do the job.  
Emptying of the Bowel	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	55-64	1/7/2011 10:56:21 PM	Was not expecting to have any effects from this prep other than emptying my bowels.  On that score, it was excellent.  There was no pain or discomfort and it evacuated my bowel completely.  However, I found the prep difficult to take.  My lips burned-very salty.  I was only able to ingest about 75% of each portion due to gagging and nausea.  My systolic blood pressure was up to 200 after completing the prep.  It has been three days since the procedure, thank god my blood pressure is continuing to drop.  Had experienced left chest discomfort with a heart rate of 92.  No where near my normal rate.  Was contemplating going to the ER.  Had never experienced anything like this before.  The only thing that kept me home, was the gradual continual drop of my blood pressure.Will never take this prep again.

Started at 5pm and it worked after the first 8 oz. I did experience chills, but overall it was ok on taste but salty. I did not refrigerate because I felt it would cramp my stomach. Someone's post said they drank other liquids ( 64 oz)  after the first dose......they must have misread the directions. It is only suppose to be 16 oz.It was very effective and my doctor was pleased with the result.

I had a split dose... the first liter went with no problem.... I had trouble finishing the last 8 oz. of the second liter, but made it through in the end. It tastes of lemon pledge with a little salt... I would use it again. Not that I loved it, but it produced great results

I had the option of a three day fast and enemas.  I would definitely choose three days of fasting over this nauseating mess. I got through the first bottle.  Nearly vomited the fist cup of the second liter, my stomach cramped and told me it would definitely throw up if I chugged any more.  My stomach is still cramping.  There are reviews stating it tastes like mountain dew.  I think moviprep put up these comments! It tastes more like syrup of ipecac.

The instructions are easy to follow. BE SURE TO CHILL! My only complaint is that it tastes a bit like lemon Pledge. I wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as I thought I'd be. 
Emptying of the Bowel	HaroldTheAngel, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	45-54	10/15/2010 6:00:37 PM	I took Movi-Prep for a colonoscopy.  It tasted like salted lemonade.  The taste was not nearly as bad as other people have said.  I drank 2 quarts, starting at 6:00PM the evening before colonoscopy.  The only drawback is taking this medication is like getting enemas.  Be prepared for 4 or 5 long stays on the throne.  Make sure you open the window, and have the Oust.  By midnight, I was finished my &quot;business trips&quot;, except for a little water left the next morning.  At 1:00PM, I was sedated for the colonoscopy, and the next thing I remember was was seeing the clock at 1:45PM.  I was fully alert by 2:00PM, and home by 3:00PM.  The doctor removed 1 polyp.  I have to have another colonoscopy in 5 years instead of 10.  Be then, I'm hoping there will be a prescription laxative which isn't quite as harsh.

Just make sure you get the prep really cold and drink it from a cold glass.  It really does not taste that bad (my opinion). Kinda like a lemon drink but a little salty. I chugged the 8 ounce portions and was visiting the bathroom half way through my first liter. I didn't have any cramps and thought it was much better than drinking a whole gallon of prep. My procedure went fine the next day, the prep did it's work and everything went well.

The horrors that I heard, well, they just didn't happen. This stuff did not taste bad at all. (I recommend getting it really cold before drinking.) Took it 1pm and 5pm and by 2:30 or so, the first one started working. Nothing horrible, no pain, no cramps. Nothing catastrophic. Followed it w/ lemon lime gatorade. By 4:30pm, I was flushed out. Then repeated at 5pm. Even easier. By 8 or so. done. Clean as a whistle. Had to go a few times more. Just water. The procedure the next day at 9am went fine. Next one. 5 years. Do not be afraid of this prep. It's really OK.   
Emptying of the Bowel	Jay H, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/10/2010 8:57:39 PM	No problems for me.  Had to take the split dose regimen - one in the evening, and one in the morning for a 12:30 colonoscopy.  I drank lots of Gatorade and Apple Juice all day before I started prepping.  I refrigerated the Moviprep the night before and drank 4 8oz glasses 15 minutes apart.  The liquid didn't taste bad - it was cold and I chugged it.  I passed lots of watery stool, but no pain because I greased up with Vaseline before starting and used baby wipes instead of toilet paper.I slept through the night and rep eared at 7 the next morning.  All in all, no problem.I was still passing water when I arrived, but whatever was left they picked up with suction during the colonoscopy.  Got home and was back to normal before suppertime.This was my third colonoscopy and tuis prep was the easiest by far.  Last time I had to drink a full gallon of a high volume liquid and take dulcolax in the morning.  That cramped be up badly.The time before that I used phospho soda and dulcolax - also very unpleasant.  I would go with MoviPrep every time!

I was given Moviprep because no pharmacies in my area had the Half-lytely the doc originally ordered.  Anyway, I chased each nasty dose w/ ginger ale and sucked on green sucker.  Stay close to bathroom...first wave hit me and you know the rest...:-)And the colonoscopy itself was a breeze.  I don't dread the next one in 10 yrs.

This is wrong because you have to drink 32 oz. of movi prep plus 64 oz. of water in 1 hour.Then at 4am I have to repeat this procedure for a total of 192 ounces( 1.5 Gallons). Overall a bad idea.

I am sorry that I did not do my research before getting this as prescribed by the doctor. I took a different product a couple years ago that was much better-I believe a fleet product. At $70 a treatment the phar cos much be dining these prescribing doctors well!!!

Medicine and science must get better than this if they want folks to embrace colonscopies!
Emptying of the Bowel	Sandy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/12/2010 4:27:38 PM	I must be one of the lucky ones with no real problems using this. I followed all the instructions. I did use a straw to drink it which I thought was wonderful.  I put it far back in my mouth so I hardly had to taste it. Someone also suggested sucking on a jolly rancher in between drinks. I used a green apple one and it helped.  Keep the drink very cold. 
Emptying of the Bowel	55-64 Male  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	6/11/2010 5:31:46 PM	I followed all MoviPrep instructions to a &quot;T&quot; except one bowl of fruit 2 nights before.  The taste of MoviPrep (where did they get that name??) was ghastly - a mix of bitter lime and biodiesel.  I was surprised it didn't take effect until the middle of the night.  I was also surprised that it didn't seem to completely finish its job by the time of my 7 am appointment.  My nurse agreed MoviPrep was a difficult sell, and told me the previous (convenient!) small shot of medicine was taken off the market because two elderly women suffered kidney failure.  After my colonoscopy my doctor chided me that my preparation was only &quot;fair&quot; and instead of returning in 10 years I would have to come back in three.  I agree with previous reviewers  -- colonoscopies should not be limited to people with super-human tolerance levels and cast-iron stomachs.

Couldn't even finish first container. No bowel movement occurred. I was bloated and gassy after taking it and the next day. Fasted for nothing and had to postpone my colonoscopy. Very disappointed!!!
Emptying of the Bowel	35-44 Male  (Patient) 	5	2	3	Male	35-44	4/8/2010 10:02:15 PM	The whole time I kept thinking about Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince and the horcrux cave scene, where Prof Dumbledore is forced to drink a basin of potion that causes pain and horrific visions.  Art imitating life?  That said, it did its job.  And I did not have any vomiting or nausea.  I couldn't chug it.  My strategy was to alternate between a sip of prep and a swish 'n spit of grape flavored aquifina, both chilled.  Good luck.
Emptying of the Bowel	karen55, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	55-64	3/21/2010 8:11:44 AM	I guess my doctor wanted to take no chances! I had to start Miralax 7 days ahead, twice a day. Low residue diet with NO fiber for three days prior to colonoscopy. Clear liquids only all day on prep day. First MoviPrep mixture at 5:00p.m. prep day. Second mixture at 5:00a.m. day of procedure. I gagged, choked, throat muscles ached,inhaled the nasty stuff, was nauseated and exhausted by the time I was done! I finished it &amp; it did clean me out, but late that day I had a terrible sore throat. Same the next day. Now 72 hours later, my chest hurts and I'm coughing up green, my glands in my neck are swollen and hurt. Looked up &quot;chemical pneumonia&quot; and this looks like it qualifies! Could be a coincidence, but I didn't have a thing wrong like that prior to this prep, and it was a very bad experience. I've had to take acid reflux medication for years and it just can't be good to have this in your already bad stomach &amp; breathe this liquid into your lungs! I'll be heading to the doctor shortly. Wish me luck! I now have more problems, as if the colonoscopy which showed infection, diverticulitis and a polyp that was sent for biopsy wasn't enough! I don't believe I can go through that prep again. They'll have to find something else for me!  I'm 55, and in worse shape than my 93 year old grandma!  She told me that!
Emptying of the Bowel	Bethann, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/24/2010 5:37:20 PM	Horrible experience! Wished I read these reviews before buying this disgusting drink. Went through half of the first bottle before vomiting. Drank a lot of water instead to help flush my stool out. Couldn't drink the second bottle at all. With my wieght being 116 lbs, one bottle was sufficient. In the morning, I was so nauseous that I kept vomiting every 15 minutes to the hospital before my colonostopy. While in the prep room, the nurse gave me a nauseous medicine through the IV. Then my vomiting stopped. The nurse said that I had an allergic reaction to this MoviPrep in which others have had the same reaction that she experienced. Now it makes since why this company is offering a $20 rebate because their sales are down from all the bad reactions that people are having. I would not recommend this product to anyone ! And believe what you read from others on this web page.

Prep was adequate but not thorough. Paid $57.00 for it at Walgreens, sent in the rebate for $20 by the deadline of January 15th and got it back via return mail. Will be calling the 800 number to see what's up.

My only issues were that the taste was pretty nasty.  I eat or drink anything and I had to chug it down. Not sure anyone who is the least bit fussy over taste will tolerate this.  Also the doctor's instructions that I take the last portion 5 hours before my procedure was a pain.  My procedure was set for 8 am and I had to wake up and take some at 3 am.  Of course the question becomes...should I fall back asleep or wait for it to work.  I waited and it took an hour or so before it kicked in.  Made for a tiring day.  I also have a question about the rebate.  I too wonder if there are new rebate forms for 2010?  I kept my receipts but the form the doctor gave me also expired in 2009.  I paid 30 dollars co pay for this so it is a pricey item.  I will see the doctor in a week or so for a followup so I will ask the office then if they have a new coupon.  I understand the MoviPrep rebate people are pains so I dont want to chance sending my receipts when they have an out for not paying and I could lose my original receipts.Anyway good luck with this stuff. 
Emptying of the Bowel	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	3	Male	55-64	1/29/2010 2:47:30 AM	I had flu like symptoms including head aches, chills, loss of energy from long 24 hour fasting period and inability to sleep with early morning second dose. More urination than bowel cleansing from excess clear liquids added to use of Movi Prep to prevent dehydration. Developed kydney stone problems day after colonoscopy.

Rcv'd a $20 rebate slip when I went to the Doc in December when the test was scheduled for 1/19. Should have read the fine print on the rebate... it expired 12/31/09. Thought I'd google to see if I can fine another Rebate coupon. I was thrilled to only have to drink 32 ounces. My spouse used a diff med and had to drink a gallon when he had his exam a few yrs ago.Friends gave me some tips for &quot;easing the misery&quot;.  I only ate small meals on Sat. Apple sauce and 2 bread slices on Sunday. Monday liquid diet. Started drinking the med at 6 p.m. Monday. Only drank 2 of the 4 doses in the a.m. before procedure because I had already &quot;cleaned out&quot; the night before based on the modified diet prior to taking the meds.   The only problem I had was a terrible headache from not eating enough and not getting my caffeine on Monday.Tastes and smells like salty 7-up. Sucking on ice cubes might have helped. Did that once, but after the first time it was just to much hassle. As soon as 8 oz was down, I drank a little Sprite to rinse out the salty flavor in my mouth.I'd use the stuff again.

I followed the instructions and got almost all of it down me but...never had a bowel movement! Not once. Went to the procedure the next morning and informed them. The doctor said I should go get two enemas and he was giving me MORE moviprep and I should come back later same day. Thankfully, my required driver was busy!! I have to reschedule the procedure. Didn't have a bowel movement until much later that night and it was almost normal. Nausea and some cramping have lingered.

I have been sick for 6 days. This stuff is poison.

Emptying of the Bowel	GoPhils, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/6/2009 1:35:09 PM	Had a very good experience with MoviPrep compared to the prep method I used for a previous colonoscopy (pills). I was given permission to substitute citrus flavored Vitamin Water for tap water for mixing the MoviPrep powder solution. It was definitely palatable after being in the fridge all day but by no means delicious. Salty/sweet with an aftertaste. Sipping ice cold water after each gulp of the prep made it even better. I had a split dose regimen (1 liter at 7:00 p.m. the evening before, and 1 liter at 3:00 a.m. the morning of). I couldn't quite finish the second liter - there was about 8oz left, but I had been running clear long before starting the second liter and was pretty confident the prep I was able to consume was sufficient. Turns out it was. I had zero cramping with Moviprep and zero nausea. The bowel emptying was far less violent than with the pills, and far less frequent than I expected (although I still spent plenty of time on the toilet). I lined a trashcan with a plastic bag and used non-flushable, alcohol free baby wipes to &quot;pat&quot; dry instead of using toilet paper. Worked like a charm - no burning or soreness at all. The only side effect I experienced was a pretty wicked headache, but I was able to sleep from midnight to 3:00 a.m. and the headache was gone when I woke up for my second liter. It did return afterwards but was not as intense. I would definitely use this prep again. 
Emptying of the Bowel	ukjeff, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	11/3/2009 3:52:35 AM	A follow up to my earlier report on taking Moviprep (next but one under ukjeff). I was sedated during my colonoscopy and cannot remember much but I do remember one short time of comparative awareness and seeing the inside of my colon on the theatre monitor. The colon looked clean to me with just the tiniest amount of residue liquid. The colonoscopy inspection was entirely succesful though I have one polyp that was too large to simply burn off safely and we are working towards surgery. But, I dont have to go through that procedure again and we are making progress. The bit that got chopped off my previous report on actually taking Moviprep is as follows: My advice would be to be no more than 4 metres (or 4 seconds) from the bathroom, with either litre, and then only so long as you are fit enough to run and hang on tight to the water that soon  comes through. We are all different but be warned: with me it was so forceful I could have pressure jetted the concrete on the outside patio or put out a fire for the fire department.

Emptying of the Bowel	ukjeff, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	10/29/2009 2:32:30 AM	I found that Moviprep worked well for me. My hospital appointment was for just after noon so I split the doses; one starting at 5pm the previous day and, because it took 6 hours for that treatment to stop, the second starting at the following 3.15am. I wanted to be sure I could shower, have everything finished by the time the colonoscopy took place and also minimise the chances of a failed examination. So, I had nothing to eat after 8am the previous day and followed a diet regime that seemed sensible to me - as for Picolax. See this web page for a Picolax diet:http://www.guysandstthomas.nhs.uk/resour ces/patientinfo/acute/bowel_prep_for_colonoscopy. pdfThere are advice sheets from a selection of UK hospitals on Moviprep and I found these two sites useful:http://www.royalberkshire.nhs.uk/wards__ departments/g/gastroenterology/endoscopy.aspx?the me=gphttp://www.gatesheadhealth.nhs.uk/patien ts-visitors/patient-leaflets/a-c.phpOne suggested making up the potion some 4 or 5 hours before it was needed and refrigerating it so as to make it taste better and I found the cool mixture, with its lemon flavour, palatable enough. Worried about the taste I gulped the stuff down each time from a 250mil mug like I was in a competition i.e. without it touching the sides of my throat (rather than sipping it) and finished each 1 litre dose after 4 mugs spread over 3/4 of an hour. My consultant had recommended Tonic Water, if necessary, to help it go down but I did not need it. The first 1 litre took two hours to start me running to the toilet but with prior stomach cramps. These eased off and the final visit to the pan ended at 11pm though I was a bit afraid to go to sleep. The second (early morning) dose was much quicker to start coming through, just 1/2 an hour, but with hardly any cramps. This time the potion was coming through like a non-stop 150mph express train. The treatment finished this time in 3 hours  the worst was over in 2 hours. My advice would be to be no more t
Emptying of the Bowel	WilliamB, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		9/14/2009 8:08:27 PM	Before starting my MoviPrep process yesterday for this mornings colonoscopy, I came across this website when checking for reviews of MoviPrep. All the terrible experiences described were very disheartening to read, &amp; I was very apprehensive about starting my process later in the day.I hope people reading these reviews get as far as this one so they realize that experiences can vary, &amp; not all are bad. Mine was an easy experience, &amp; I had no nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, or other problem. Im sure some of it may have to do with some people being more sensitive to some things than others. If you look at the paper which comes in the box, it shows a percent of people have various problems with the MoviPrep. Thus, it could be that the people writing about bad experiences were people who would normally fall in the group w/problems.My colonoscopy was scheduled for 9 AM today. The instructions from my doc varied from those from MoviPrep, in that on the prep/pre-colonoscopy day my doc said to eat no food. Thus, yesterday I could only drink clear liquids like Jell-O, apple juice, broth, coffee, tea, &amp; Ensure or Boost. No red or purple colored liquids, nor milk. Between 8 AM &amp; 5 PM I drank 4 Ensures, + 12 oz water &amp; 16 oz apple juice. it could be that the lack of food may have made a difference in having no problems. I started the MoviPrep at 6 PM, drank apple juice for the 16 oz of liquid required after each MoviPrep series &amp; was done w/everything &amp; in bed before 11 PM.

I am taking it in preparation for a colonoscopy and not only does it provoke gagging, but it has been completely ineffecive.  There has got to be a bette way to accomplish the same result.

It is the most god-awful stuff to drink! I could not finish the 2nd container. Hope it has cleaned me out good enough. WILL NEVER GET ME TO TAKE AGAIN. You'd think they could give something easier, like in pill form. If they want more people to have this test, they will have to improve the pre-prep in my opinion. I won't have another with this stuff!
Emptying of the Bowel	kristin, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1		55-64	9/6/2009 11:45:37 AM	Used prior to colonoscopy.  Worst thing I've ever had to take.  Had to take night before and morning of colonoscopy.  Gagged but got it all down.  I had very clean colon.  I'm convenienced this caused burns in colon, small ozing hemoroids, acid reflux, nausea, and stomach pain.  Diarrhea and stomach pain continued for days after use.

Not only did it NOT work, I was unable to keep it in my system as I kept throwing it up. I'm not new to these procedures or the preps, but this was BY FAR the worst. I contacted the maker of this and they were no help. So in the end, I paid $35 for this horrible medicine that did NOT work and was unable to proceed with the colonoscopy.

I found the only way to consume it was to make it as cold as possible and chug each 8 oz. portion.  Of course, the elimination part was inconvenient, but that is what should happen.  I had minimal cramping, but no nausea.  Just make sure to drink a lot before during and after.  You will need it!

A person I work with said her doctor just had her do clear liquids and Miralax next time I will try that but I hope there isn't a next time!
