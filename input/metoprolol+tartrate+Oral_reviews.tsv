High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	9/2/2012 3:18:58 PM	I have taken this medication for over 3 years.  I have been chronically depressed most of my life, and if anything, that is better.  My BP is at a normal level (I also take amlodipine), and I'm not really having any side effects.  I haven't had any nightmares, and am not overly tired.  I do seem to get a pounding, fast heartbeat at night, but don't know if from medication.  I take 100mg/BID.  Read all the scary reviews in here, but won't to let people know that not everyone has them.  I'm been happy with the medication.

Did not lower my blood pressure.  Now I have arthritis in hands, never had before, so bad I have to put a splint on fingers, it is very painful.  anyone else get this.  I stopped taking the drug immediately, not gradual, would this have caused the arthritis?  I would not advise taaking this drug.

Today pain in legs and hips started not fun, drug makes me tired, but I have not slept well at night. I'm going to give my system some time to adjust to the drug. I figure I can deal with leg pain better than I can with a heart racing like a Nascar race.

Looks like if one was there to do a job, I wouldn't need the other. Hair loss, bad dreams, itching uncontrollably, gained 10 lbs, and feel like busting out in tears over every little thing. This is not me, but my Dr won't let me try anything else. May have to find me a new one that will. Have hated ever second of taking this drug. I traded one illness for five, not a good trade! Watch out for the side effects.

Overactive Thyroid causing Life-Threatening Symptoms	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	5/1/2012 10:54:59 PM	I was put on metoprolol (25mg twice a day) for my hyperthyroid symptoms (mostly PVCs and occasional tachycardia).  It helped, but not totally - I would still have 2-3 palpitations per day.  Initially, I was thrilled, because it kicks in for me in about 15-20 minutes.  However, over the few months that I took it, I noticed how lethargic it made me.  I was an absolute slug, which was especially strange given the huge amounts of energy pulsing through me from my out of whack thyroid.  Additionally, it contributed to my brain fog and caused a ringing in my ears.  As beta blockers tend to do, it lowered my blood pressure (which is probably not a problem for a lot of people, but is for me, and a fair number of other hyperthyroid sufferers, from what I hear), causing me to feel very faint/lightheaded, especially when standing or going up a flight of stairs.  Other cons: possible interactions with a lot of meds; I stopped taking oral contraceptives because of the possible effects of mixing the two.  On the other hand, it gave me quick relief when I needed it, and worked well enough to get me through until I could get my health a little more sorted out and switch to a different beta blocker (which, so far, has fewer side effects and less of an impact on my BP).  It's also cheap and easy to take.

Abnormal Heart Rhythm	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	55-64	4/2/2012 10:52:12 AM	I take 25mg 2x day (breakfast and dinner). Instructions say don't take with alcohol.  In my case they mean it.  Even a 1/2 glass of wine and I feel irratable and lathargic the next day or two.  However if I stay away from alcohol, don't drink more than 1/3 to 1/2 cup of coffee per day, take 45-minute power walks 4 to 5 times per week I feel good. I noticed some weight gain when I first started taking it but got that under control with a modest change in diet and exercise (I'm 6'1&quot; and 170 lbs.).  It slows my heart rate down so very important to push when I exercise to try and keep the heart rate up enough to exercise the heart muscle.  Other side effects that cause me to rate satisfaction as &quot;somewhat&quot; as opposed to &quot;very&quot;:  ability to concentrate seems to be less and I miss having wine with meals.  As far as controlling heart rythm, it works fine.  I've considered having the ablation done but the risks don't outweigh any of the downsides of taking the medication . . . yet.

Anyways,  this med did get my bp down to 100/30.  The side effects were horrrible,  terrible depression, confusion, angst, inability to carry on a conversation without getting powder off, and I lost my coordination.  I cut down from 2 pills a day to a quarter in the morning and half @ night, that seemed to help.

Abnormal Heart Rhythm	Jack k, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	3/14/2012 7:47:25 AM	I was on metoprolo suc for yrs no problems. Caremark sends me a pink pill version made by teva phar claiming they were out of the brand I had been taking. I find it hard to believe a company as large as caremark would run out more likely they got a kickback from Teva to push their product. After 4months I started having unexplained pain in the back of my thighs. The pain moved to my hips shoulders arms and hands. I hurt soo bad I could not function. Numerous tests proved negative for any disease. After getting off pink pill made by Teva and numerous injections of steroids it took 6 months for me to start feeling better. I used to work out with weights this destroyed my muscles. Anytime you get a pain that you can't explain from exercise or a accident take a hard look at the last drug you started taking.

My husband has been on this med for only 5 days, and it's been a living nightmare!! He's not eating like normal at all, his bp is still very irregular, 150/99 at one moment and then 5 mins later 109/77. His pulse is the same way. 90 bmp then goes to 61 bpm, which can't be good on his heart!! then there's the nausea! Oh my dead LORD! Since being on this medication for  5 days, he has vomited 3/5 days! He can't seem to keep a good meal down, and what little he does eat, he can't keep down. Plus he is so dizzy, he can't even drive. He has had horrible stomach problems, and severe head aches. He will be calling his doctor on Mon. and getting off this HELL drug!!

Saw the doc yesterday and bp had lowered so he told me to go down to once a day. My headaches are awful and I can't sleep. I do take Paxil at night (60 mg.) or I think that the depression from this drug would really get to me. I am slightly overweight and don't get the exercise I need but I am not sedentary. It did, at least temporarily, lower the 202/110 BP at the docs. Yesterday, was 130/80. Good luck to all!

Not many problems at first but now it is losing it's effectiveness. BP keeps getting higher, frequent nighttime urination, dizzy and lightheaded, and the worst is a low platelet count on last blood work. Didn't realize that it was a rare side effect and I don't think the dr. knew it either. Was sent to a hematologist to find out what is going on. They just want to give you more medicine to treat the side effects.Has anyone else experienced this issue?

High Blood Pressure	Natural E, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	11/8/2011 3:26:34 PM	I am a 26 year old mom and I have to say that I am a big stress soaker. I can easily get stressed out about finances but NEVER depressed. Not until I started taking this medicine that is. I started taking it in September for my high blood pressure. When my doctor first prescribed it to me back In January I got it filled but I never actually took the pill. Now when I went back In September I wanted to be put on medicine because of the symptons that I was going through. My right arm will get nubb from time to time and it was times where my heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest. So, I went in and got the prescription. The first time he gave it to me in Januray I was told to take a pill once a day. Now that I am back on it he has me taking the pill twice a day. When I first started to take it I thought it was making me feel better. I got a refill in October and that's when I really started to notice a different in my mood. I was feeling more sad, lonely, and just confused as to why nothing in my life seems to be going well when nothing in my life was going wrong. I found my self crying almost everyday about a whole bunch of nothing. What made me start to realize that it was serious was the fact that it was interferring with my household. My fiance noticed that I was stressed out more and more and notice that I was crying even more. he would try everything to make me feel better but it seems as though nothing was helping. He stayed on top of me about my stress and always made sure that I took my medicine so that my pressure wouldn't get high. Of course not realizing that the more I took it the more depressed I became. I heard that you cannot just stop so suddenly because it may cause other effects. But, I decided to slow down on it by taking 1 a day then ended up not taking it at all. Last Friday (11/4/2011) I had a huge breakdown and now here I am reading all of these side effects and reviews. I go to my Dr on Friday and I am done with this medicine.

I started sleeping during the day which is not my routine. I had bad dreams and woke many times. Prior to taking this med. I experienced tightness in my chest and irregular heart beat. While on meds. I noticed those symptoms disappeared. However, dealing with sleeping so much was not what I needed. No life!! I started cutting doses in half, then 1/4, then 1/8. I was not finding relief. Called dr. he said this med. does not cause drowsiness and to stop taking it since I cut it so much. He was not willing to listen to how sensitive I am to meds. I am now searching for a new dr. My chest tightness and palpitations have since returned.

I am constantly tired, fall asleep early then wake up during the night/early morning, then oversleep and get to work late. Not good. Even though I'm getting plenty of rest, still feel tired through the day. Have had trouble keeping with my workout routine with feeling lethargic. Also didn't think anything of my dreams, but they have been pretty strange when I think about it. No nightmares though. This is just affecting my work, personal life, and sleep. Will have to discuss with my doctor at my next visit.

Then it started causing massive stabbing pains in my stomach when I took it. The doctor thought I had a stomach ulcer, but we checked and I don't. He tried injection of it at half dose and it still did it. The doctor says I'm the first to have this type of reaction. Switched to Coreg hope it works. So beware!
Abnormal Heart Rhythm	Mary, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	65-74	6/23/2011 12:09:35 AM	67 yr old female, mitral valve surgery in '62, done well since until 5 years ago when A-fib began in ernest.  Electro conversion last August, failed in Oct., ablation in March.  On Amioderone and wanting off due to severe side effects, also on Metoprolol and concur with most of the symptoms of each drug but things are controlled, however, BP's consistant @ 110/50 with 65 heart rate but VERY little energy compared to old and the side effects worry me.  Am contacting cardiologist ASAP to get weaned off them.  Otherwise, I'm trading one illness for multiple others.  Vision is already worse, night especially and I work swing shift.  Oh, the joys of getting older but I'm still here and feel blessed to be so.  Some side effects, particularly with Amiodorone appear to sometimes come on suddenly and they can be so severe that they are frightening so am checking into alternative medications.

I was on the extended release version at 25mg twice a day. For the first three months I had terrible stomach pains but they subsided and all my symptoms were controlled. But I've lost wieght and now no longer have high blood pressure so when I slack on the medicine it no longer controls all my symptoms. And my cardiologist just told me to drink salty drinks (propel water or gatorade) which I dislike. Don't really know what to do...

High Blood Pressure	fernbanks, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	5/29/2011 12:42:21 PM	Began taking 25 mg 2xdaily two weeks ago. BP numbers lowered quickly to very good levels however, I became EXTREMELY fatigued, woke up during the night for 1-3 hours, became nauseated off and on during the day, and had frequent headaches. Switched a few days ago to Amlodipine (Norvasc) 2.5 mg1xdaily and fatigue is almost gone as well as the headaches. I am experiencing some swelling in my feet and ankles which I did not have with the metoprolol. I am also concerned with the effects this new RX may have on my gums and teeth. I have a feeling that this may not be my permanent BP med either.

Other	RuthDV, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	45-54	3/30/2011 11:27:05 AM	I'm embarrassed to say I've been on this med. for 8 years now, and today was the first time I looked at all of these patient reviews! And now, I'm wondering. I took 50 mg. per day of Metoprolol for years, due to extreme tachycardia (NOT high BP), and didn't really notice any harsh side-effects. It controlled my heart-rate wonderfully. (Brought it down from my normal resting heart-rate of 137! - to a normal 90 or so.) But just prior to my double-mastectomy (for breast cancer) in April 2010, my cardiologist upped my dosage to 75 mg. of Metoprolol a day, as my anxiety level was through the roof. Ever since my experience with breast-cancer, I believed some of my new &quot;side-effects&quot; were all being caused by the cancer-drugs I'm taking ... but I'm seeing here that various reviewers are also experiencing these same side-effects:  numbness and tingling in hands/fingers, joint pain, insomnia, and weight-gain. I never thought about attributing any of these side-effects to my increased dosage of Metoprolol! And the hand/finger numbness/tingling/joint pain has become unbearable, ever since last Spring ... getting worse every month now. Perhaps it's also an unknown drug interaction? (Metoprolol combined with my cancer-drugs?) Hmmmm ... I think I need to call my cardiologist, and see her again soon. After all these years, I may have to try something else that does NOT have these side-effects. I'm a fine artist and cannot live without FUNCTIONING hands!
High Blood Pressure	Judie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	3/30/2011 3:44:38 AM	I had double bypass nearly 4 years ago. Since then I take 150mg twice a day and 5mg lisinopril. My bp and heart rate stay low IF I watch sodium intake which is important. I have tiredness and get anxious but I keep busy, dont dwell on it and keep my mind active. I work out twice a week at fitness center which helps greatly. I do the cardio water aerobics and recumbant bike.  Working out helps keep bp down and people should not think that medicine alone is enough.  Excercise and proper diet is a hugh contibuting factor. I would like to decrease my dosage and am going to discuss this with my doctor and cardiologist.

I was already taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothzide for high blood pressure. This drug is awful. I've taken it twice and won't be taking it again.  First time I had mild problems going to sleep, neck &amp; back pain, and itched all over. The second time I did not sleep the entire night, had same itching sensation, and found my self gritting my teeth.  I won't be taking this again.

It has helped lower my blood pressure, which is hereditary &amp; not that high. But at what cost? I am taking 50mg once a day. I am going to call my doctor &amp; wean myself off. Not worth it to feel this way.

It did not control the A fib so Flecainide was added.  Eventually, I had a heart ablation that corrected the A fib but then I developed PAC's &amp; Atrial Tachycardia.  I have been on this drug for 5 years and have gained 70 lbs. I too have experienced extreme fatique, hair loss and depression which I now take Pristique for.  Had my 2nd heart blation in July and just slowly weened myself off the Toporol.  Still taking the Flecainide and going to my doctor today for follow-up.  He will not be happy with me when he hears I stopped the Toporol.  I lost 6.5 lbs the first week off the drug.  I really believe this drug is effective for heart arrythmeas but everyone should seek out all options.  Heart Ablation is a good option but you do have to stay on meds until it works.  Results are not immediate.  For me, I'm convinced stress, caffeine and alcohol all affect heart rate.

I also take this in conjunction with Lisinopril for high blood pressure.  It seems that this medication worked for a few years but now I am trying to determine what really is the cause to my side affects, which are:  Erratic heart rate (usually on the high side).  However, in the past week, BP reduced to 100/70 and I have fainted 5 times in the past 2 weeks.  I have hives all over my body, extreme fatigue, memory loss, vertigo, dry eyes, numbness in hands, swelling, lithargic and my hair is falling out.  Is this really helping me or hurting me?  I'm miserable.

Abnormal Heart Rhythm	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	45-54	5/22/2010 1:23:45 AM	My dr. switched me from propranalol to metoprolol due to potential issues with asthma. In just over a month, I have gained 5 lbs., experience more gas/bloating, difficulty concentrating and sleeping, and reduced sexual function.  While it helps the palpitations (not nearly as well as propranalol), I don't think it's worth all the negative side effects.  I will be asking my dr. for something else.  (Propranalol is much better in all respects except greater sexual dysfunction, which is also not acceptable.)
High Blood Pressure	Beast, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	45-54	5/21/2010 6:27:33 PM	I was prescribe this medication about a year ago at 49 years old. At first i took it sparenly and then stopped. I stopped to try different herbs that was said to help BP such as, CoQ-10, Garlic, Grape Seed Extract, and Fish Oil. I noticed my bp looking better with the herbs, but it was still slightly high. So about 5 months ago i started to take this medication on a daily basis. Since then i have noticed Frequent urination, blurred vision, weight gain (almost 20 lbs), leg pain, tingling in my feet and toes, awful joint pain and the most scariest of all(CHEST PAIN). After reading about 125 reviews by other people, i truly believe, this medication is the root of most of my problems. I scheduled a stress test next week because of the chest pain. But now i think i know where the chest pain is coming from. HBP runs in my family, so i'm pretty sure i'll have to deal with it the rest of my life, but it's got to be a better way. I love working out, but since this medication, i have so many aches and pains, it has caused me to have to stop some of my routines. i don't know if losing weight with exercise and diet changes will help, but, i'm going to give it a try. Thanks for the reviews, it has really helped me with a lot of questions!
Abnormal Heart Rhythm	55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4		55-64	5/20/2010 11:44:53 AM	I was diagnosed with mitral valve proplapse 28 yrs. ago.  I was taking Inderal as needed until 2 years ago.  Went to a different Cardiologist and she told me I didn't have MVP I had irregular heart beat which causes palipitations.  She put me on this drug and I take 25 mg. twice a day.  It works most of the time.  If I'm tired, stressed, drink alcohol or eat/drink anything with caffiene it doesnt work.  I'm not tired and have low blood pressure but have always had low blood pressure, no weight gain.  I work out 3 times per week and eat healthy most of the time.  Overall it works and stops the palipitations.  If I miss a dose I start having the palipitations.

It worked to bring down the BP and eliminate the extra heart beats. But the side affect I had is serious rash on neck and face. Looked like someone had thrown hot water on me and high sensitivity to sun and heat.Swelling of face and neck. Dr cutting to 25 mg per day to regulate BP. Will see how that works for me. Has anyone experienced serious rash issues?

I had a heart attack two years ago. Resting heart rate went from 80 to 56 which at first was scary. BP went from 135/95 to 115/78. Reccommend that you get the more expensive time release brand or cut the pill in half and take it twice a day. I took all 50 mg at once and had to sit for a couple of hours! Wierd drams sure, but at least I wake up.

Had to drink energy drinks to get through work...only to come home and crash on the sofa and then not sleep at night. A vicious cycle I could not break. Left me feeling worse than the reason my doctor prescribed it.

I am very tired and out of it all of the time.  I feel like I'm living a nightmare.  After reading all comments I will be visiting my doctor for a new pill.  I would not recommend this pill to anyone.  I've never been depressed before and I don't like it now.  The lack of sleep and nightmares are aweful. Here I come Dr!!!

Soon after starting, I began to have cramps and insomnia.  This was tolerable untl the HORRIBLE fatigue set in.  I rapidly gained twenty pounds because I was so lethargic.  I began sleeping 10-15 hours which led me to think I was depressed.  I began sweating from the face and neck like a fire hydrant and had constant dry mouth.  I stopped taking it for a week (AMA) and I noticed right away I felt better.  My experience ended with severe (debilitating) muscle and joint pain.  This medication ruined my summer as I had no energy for recreation and was barely making it through work.  To make matters worse, my (now ex) doctor dismissed me when I complained about the severe side effects.  I think death by heart attack is better than the side effects of this medication.  Thankfully, my new doctor listened to me and got me off of this horrible drug.  If you are reading this in reference to beginning this medication, I can not be more emphatic -- DON'T!!!

The Metoprolol definitely lowered my heart rate from the 90+ BPM to the 60 BPM area but I am starting to see side effects: Tingleling in the feet/fingers, very tired all the time and recently depressed for no reason. Stopped lifting weights and working out because I'm too unmotivated now. I do get confused and have memory loss at times. I have to try to stay focussed on things at hand more. I've only been on it for a little over 2 mths but may have to find something else. My BP used to get up to 170/102 but now stays around 130 to 160 /90 depending on what I'm doing. Good luck to you all.

I was placed on metoprolol. My chest pains have subsided significantly, have been on 9 months, but reciently in last month have had a return of chest pains but not as severe I believe due to recient weight gain and inactivity. This medication has been overall effective and relieves chest pain when taken regurarly.

I noticed that my body ached all over, so I stopped the Zocor Chlor went up. I have IBS and in the last year have cronic constapation, lack of energy and very depressed. I was wondering if it could be from the Metoprolol Tar, I take 12.5 in am and 12.5 in PM. Now they want to put me on paxil for depresion. My blood pressure has been good yet I do not know if it was ever high. I did have a heart attack and a stent put in when this all started. I also have IBS, the constipation is alful, entire abs are always sore, and I have to take a milk of mag to go. I stay bloated. Could it be from the Metoprolol. I have to start taking something for my high chol, but afraid my body will ache again. Is there a med that does the same as metoprolol Tar that does not cause constapation.

Fatigue, lightheadedness,cold hands &amp; feet, nausea,irratibility, then my throat swelled up!Called my Dr. when I finally realized why I was so sick, he did recommend that I stop taking it, even though the drug facts state that you should NOT suddenly stop taking this medication. I was in the ER the night that I stopped taking it with very irregular heartbeat (palpitations). This has been a horrible experience for me!

What did stop them 100% is a a combo of 50 Mgs.of this drug and 50 mgs. of Tambacor. SIde effects of one of these is the weight gain, hair loss, and ringing in the ears. I am considering cardiac ablation as when off drugs I have over 1000 per day. I will go to the Cleveland clinic for this operation as it is the best. good luck everyone, i know this is a bummer to go thru. Be persistent with your MD til you are satisfied!!

Heart Attack	ScenicCourt, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	8/27/2009 11:46:25 AM	My cardiologist put me on Metoprolol Tartrate after my heat attack in February 2009.  After my heart attack I was also diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.  As I worked to improve my health - stopped smoking, low fat, low carb, low sugar, and low sodium diet - and exercised every day I was continuing to gain weight (20 pounds in 5 months).  Because I was a diabetic my primary care physician was continually telling me that I needed to loose weight to improve my health.  I explained to her my lifestyle changes and asked if the Metoprolol Tartrate or insulin could be causing my weight gain.  She said that she didn't think so, but was not entirely sure and even suggested that it was due to poor Diabetes management (my A1C levels went from 11.5 in February to 6.9 in July)!!After doing alot of research and talking to countless Doctors and Pharmacists I discovered that yes one of the side affects of this drug is excessive unexplained weight gain.I discussed this with my Cardiologist and he decided to take me off of the Metoprolo Tartrate.  Guess what, I have now lost 8 pounds within the last two weeks following my same diet change and excerise regimen!  I have also been able to  more effectively control my blood sugar and reduce my insulin intake.As with any drug you should always discuss quiting with your Doctor, or maybe get a second opinion.I'm glad that I did!

I have have had weight gain, inability to walk at a cardio pace, dry eyes, lack of sexual desire, extreme fatigue, depression, the return of hot flashes, dry mouth, IBS-type problems.I called my doctor to be switched over to something else but she was in no hurry to return my call.  I'm also on doxazosin which is for treating high blood pressure and BPH with a prostate that I don't even have. When I went to the cardiologist, he left me on these meds and added another (Benicar) to help counteract the side effects of the other two drugs.  The 3rd drug took care of the breathlessness but not any of the other problems...I think it made the depression worse.  I've started weaning myself off the metoprolol tartrate and will see the cardiologist this week.

High Blood Pressure	Randellds, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	6/30/2009 9:26:49 PM	I have had hypertebsion all my life, now I turned 50 I am concerned about it-a lot. Six months ago I had a heart attack that did damage to the out side of my heart, I did the cardiac cathider exploritory and they said the interior of my heart was fine. I have been on just about every single blood pressure med in the book with little of no results. i am now on this med despite of the side effects, my doctor feels that I may benefit from it.I used it for awhile with no big changes, i did what you shouldn't and stopped it suddenly-my pressure shot up even more, now I am back on it and my pressure is still around 200/110. The only med that works is a form of morphine that when delivered by IV, knocks it down to normal for the day-they do this at the VAMC when I end up in the ER.I will be discussing this therepy with my doctor, I really do not want to go to such extremes, but at the moment I do not see any other alternatives.

I can't put up with these side effects when I have three children to care for.  To make matters worse, I learned that this drug should not be taken if you have a history of asthma. I had childhood asthma and dont want it ever again.  I spoke with my doctor who changed the medicine.

This medicine is horrible! I am so tired it is unbearable, I have numbness in my feet and my left hand, sore throat, low bp, and extremely low pulse (43).

Abnormal Heart Rhythm	lace, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	5/26/2009 11:26:31 AM	Back in Jan 09 I was diagnosed with frequesnt PVC's. (preventricular contractions)I started with 1/2 pill (12.5 mg), then 1/2 in Am and PM, then whole in AM, 1/2 in PM,...at present 2 whole in AM, 1 whole PM. This all started Jan.09 and it's May 09. Each change involves about 5 weeks before the dose gets changed. I've been extremely frustrated with the results. There has not been a day that I have not had PVC's. They might be less strong but not by much. I take the meds faithfully yet still wonder why I bother. I see a cardiologist and am told that although it is bothersome it's not going to kill me.  If it's not going to work for me then I may as well just live with the palps since I'm still getting them anyways. I don't really want chemicals in my body that are not doing any good. i know this drug works very well for some patients but for me it's not doing its job.

Abnormal Heart Rhythm	cris, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	55-64	5/5/2009 1:28:30 PM	I have taken Metoprolol for well over 8 yrs for PVCs (palpitations).  I was having thousands everyday.  Tried other beta blockers that caused me to have HAs and sluggish. Have had no appreciable side effects with Metoprolol, however after reading these comments, I have to wonder about this constant tinnitus and neutral and/or negative thinking pattern.  I take 50 mg twice a day and if I skip a dose, PVCs remind me that I have forgotten dose.  (Twice a day dosing is hard for me to remember).  I also drink at least 2 liters of water every day and not by choice, but have symptoms of dehydration (eg, excessive sweating &amp; very hot).  I don't know if it is just coincidence that many of us share common symptoms or if it really is the medication causing some of the side effects.  I had thousands of strong PVCs every day without this medication, and they really get frightening.  I am not willing to give it up.  My total cholesterol has gone up 20 pts since stating as well.

Not getting the side effects that most are complaining of, but it does make me feel SLOW. Tends to zone me out and I still get angina. My BP is down but it historically was low before the stent anyway. My Doc has reduced the dosage but I can't tell how well it's working.

I was prescibed for 125+ heart rate.I have been sooo tired, unmotivated, burning tingling in feet/body, blurred vision, not able to sleep well and urinating frequently at night. I have also gained weight after losing quit a few pounds, although I can attribute that to lack of energy, I think. I was on lipronosil(?), but quit it to see if that was the problem. Symptoms still there but not as bad. I have tried stopping but had to continue as my heart started racing and blood pressure went up. I am also on blood thinner, wafarin, as I am a blood clot factory. I have noticed people with like symptoms wanting to switch to a different medicine. My question &quot;Did you find another med that did not cause these symptoms and what was it?&quot;

I must admit though, it has helped with my irregular heart beat, so I don't know what to do about continuing with this med.
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	3/19/2009 11:38:06 PM	Started taking the medication after a hospitalization for kidney stone and my blood pressure went from normal to 182/102.  Side effects I noticed after 6 weeks were lethargy, severe leg cramps during the night, could not quench my thirst, constant headache, blurred vision and had decreased energy level and tired all the time.  Prior to taking this med, I had lots of energy and was very motivated.  It did lower my blood pressure somewhat but not enough to continue its use.  My Doctor started me on another med that should have less side effects.

High Blood Pressure	pixietwin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	3/5/2009 2:15:02 PM	My bp was always elevated at the doctor's office as I have serious white coat syndrome.  I take my bp at home with a wrist monitor and it's always lower.  I have very large arms so I always ask in the doctor's office to use the proper size sleeve but often they use one that is too small and it reads higher.  I recently went to the ER with a high bp and racing pulse that woke me up in the middle of the night.  I had the complete battery of tests which all came back normal but they gave me 50 mg of lopressor in the ER.  It took awhile to get my pulse down from 120+ to the 90s.  I was prescribed 25 mg of metoprolol tartrate generic.  The first two weeks I took the pill right at bedtime and it was great.  I slept well and woke up feeling refreshed which was a pleasant change from waking up with a rapid heartbeat.  Doc thinks I am anxious and suffered a panic attack when I came into ER.  After 2 weeks, I noticed that an hour after taking the pill, I experienced terrible restless legs and insomnia.  For three nights this happened and it was horrible.  I finally was able to sleep after about 5 hours of laying in bed with RLS.  I also was waking up twice a night to urinate which didn't happen before.  I am going to try to take the 25 mg in the am with breakfast for a change.  I tried to take it the very first day with b'fast but it made me very sleepy.  Now that it's in my system, I am hoping it works better.  If not, I will call doc office next week and see if she will try something else.  My bp now ranges in the 90s to 120 over 50 to 80.  Pulse now ranges between 50 to 90 at the top end.  My pulse used to stay in the upper 90s to 105 resting.

Dr's put me on metoprolol 25mg 2x daily to help lower bp and heart rate even more, but after 1 wk I opted out with the cardiologist and primary care doctors consent. I was fatigued, very short of breath, wheezed with every breath, had frequent urination, and had to sit down to rest after walking 25-30 ft. The FDA must have had their power turned off the day they tested this drug.

Stayed on it a month symtoms got worse.  Called Dr. TOLD her I wasn't going to take it any longer.  She put me on this medicine been on it a week now.  Gas, bloating BAD...diarea and tired... I'll give it a few more weeks but if the symptoms don't stop or get worse I'm going to call Dr. and tell her I'm not taking it any longer. What choice does she have but to try me on a different hbp medicine.     One thing I've learned over the years medicine affects everyone different. Doctors hear so many complants they don't listen unless you make them listen. I just tell them I'm not taking it anymore and why they seem to listen to that.    I believe in the quality of life if a medicine makes you feel as bad as what I've been reading about this medicine it's not worth it.      I'll keep tring a new medicine till I find one my body can handle. (Everyones body is different just like some people are allergic to peanuts or shelled sea food if they eat one it will kill them.

I have gained about 10 pounds since I have started it.  I started it a month ago. It has controled my bp mostly. Sometimes it goes to 130 but, mostly it is very good.  No real dizziness or being more tired than normal.  I will have to say though I also had hernia surgery the day I started the medication so, the weight gain could be from it.  I definitely have bloating from it.  its not that comfortable but, I will start working out and we will see if any of these go away.

I have high BP and I take Hyzaar 50mg/12.5 once a day with this medication that I take twice a day.  At first, both medications kept my blood pressure under control but I have since lost 15 pounds.  Now I am petrified especially at night!!!  I have anxiety attacks, numbness in my left hand, shortness of breath, sweats, and can't sleep.  Sometimes I have headaches because my BP is too high.  Sometimes, I feel pressure in my throat especially while I am walking for cardiovascular exercise.  I am afraid I am going to cause my self to have an heart attack!! My feet and ankles swell even after I exercise for 30 minutes.  I have lost weight but I suspect I won't after a while because I believe this medication will go into reverse affects like the rest of you have experienced.  I am glad to know I am not alone.  I am really scared and will call my Dr.  tommorow and beg to get off of this.  I am a separated parent right now and I can't live with this medical fear!!!  I am afraid!!!

After 44 hours of it last Jan, at age 56, it's great to not be in that condition today.     Our only disappointment is that I didn't regain as much strength as most other A Fib patients do.
High Blood Pressure	MaidMarion11111, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	45-54	12/14/2008 4:27:38 AM	What the heck is going on with this medication?!  NEVER have I had to deal with GAS from a high blood pressure medication!  But, the most ANNOYING side effect from this medication is perspiration!  Wait.  Wrong.  I shouldn't label it 'PERSPIRATION'.  That is too gentle a word for it.  And just MENTIONING the word 'SWEAT' is too minor a way to handle this catastrophe of facial and neck sweat. 'MAJOR TRIBUTARIES OF SWEAT FORMING ALL OVER MY FACE AND NECK, DUE TO MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF SWEAT EMITTING FROM THE PORES OF MY OVER-WORKED AND FREAKED-OUT SKIN.' is a much more realistic way of putting it.  I have never before experienced such bodily mayhem from such a teensy, tiny pill in my entire life!  I had to carry around a washcloth from my linen closet just to be prepared to wipe away all the sweat from my face and neck! There has GOT to be a medical word in one of your medical encyclopedia's that can adequately describe what I experienced this evening, at the 'hands???' of this evil pill!  This is one of those pills you innocently ingest at the instruction of your physician -- only to be left wondering halfway through the ride of the pill that you're wanting to shout to the world, &quot;Let me off this ride!!! Please! I'll even pay you money if you point me to the exit!&quot; -- does my physician hate me or something?

Also causes pulse to race to the point that I am afraid that I am going to pass out. I have also gained weight on this drug, am tired, short of breath and have a cough that is ongoing. I feel that I do need to get the VA to change this medication.

Six days after taking this drug, I was back in the hospital with a 2nd heart attack resulting from coronary artery spasm as a result of this drug.  My doc prescribed calcium channel blocker instead and I have done fine since...the doc said I was allergic and he felt it was the cause of the artery spasms

I'm not crazy!  I have gained a significant amount of weight, feel tired all of the time and have terrible aching in my joints.  I will certainly contact my cardiologist about this now.

It has lowered my blood pressure some, but also has left me with side effects.......ankle swelling, severe body pain, and lightheadedness.  After reading the reviews from the listed patients, I am contacting my doctor and asking him if I can be on a different medication.  The doctor claims the medicine doesn't cause some of the pain I am experiencing, but after reading the reviews of people with similar side effects, I can't believe they don't exist.  My husband is also on this medication and he has severe edema in both legs up to the groin.  He's had all kinds of tests.......MRI, ultra sound, cat scan, x-rays, etc. and they all come back normal. I think his medication is causing his problems too.  Being weined off of this for awhile will tell the story, and I will write again after the results come in to see if it was our problem.

High Blood Pressure	Leroy, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		7/16/2008 7:29:04 PM	I started using this medication following quintuple bypass open heart surgery in 2005. I also use lisinopril. I was not happy with the results at first but experimented with the doseages until I came up with a regimine that worked for me. I have my own blood pressure monitor and used it twice daily to check results. I wouldn't recommend this method for evertone as this requires patience. I finally settled for what ammounted to half the dose of each med taken twice daily. This resulted in less side effects and an eventual bp of 115 over 60 and a pulse of 60, varying by a few points up or down. This was done on my own iniative, my cardiologist is not aware of the changes I made. The problems I had at the beginning were not the fault of the medication, it was the doseage which he was too stubborn to change.

I do better when I take it later in the day rather than early AM.My BP is not as stable as it was even thougbI am at a good weight and doing at least anhour of exercise daily.  My has recently increased the doseage and that may account for the dizzyness.

It was the only one I could tolerate and it took over a month to get used to. However, once I got used to it and the side effects went away, I felt like a new person! It was amazing. Unfortunately, after many years of not monitoring my HBP, I suffered a mini stroke. But it was my own fault not the medication. Now I'm taking Lisinopril which is fine and I monitor.

I had an episode of atrial fibrilation coming out of surgery.  This condition was accompanied by a long history of hypertension.  This drug worked quickly to control both the high blood pressure as well as the fibrilation.  I have been taking it in the 25mg dose for three weeks with none of the side effects related here.  This drug has worked very well for me.  In fact, I forgot to take my AM meds yesterday and my heart rate went over &gt;109 bpm, after taking my meds my heart rate went down to &lt;70 bpm.

Myocardial Reinfarction Prevention	Bob, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male		9/21/2007 8:01:03 AM	I experienced a angina and a mild Myocardial Infarction in 1991, requiring a triple bypass. In 1999 I experienced a mile angina, requiring angioplasty and 2 stents.Since then, my health care provider has been the Veterans Administration, who have monitored my cardiac condition and provided Rx. Within 8 hrs of ingesting a 25mg tab of Metoprolol, I experienced gross edema of both legs, from calves to toes, extreme tingling amounting to pain @ level 4 of 10 and could not fit shoes over the swelling. This is the 2nd Metoprolol Rx by VA, even after relating the same problem using the 1st Metoprolol Rx and attempting an Atenolol Rx. Considering VA appointment scheduling, they cannot monitor this side effect and question it's existence. Either they don't believe I have a problem with this medication, they consider the medication to be more important than the side effect, or they don't care. I sought a 2nd opinion of a cardiologist, who immediately took me off the medication and ordered an Ultrasound scan for possible clotting. A future exam is scheduled for a Myocardial Perfusion Scan.
