I had huge amount of fluid in my stomach and other parts. After taking this for a few months I went from 160 back to my 115 weight. I had no side effects at all like I did when my doctor tried Cyclosporine. This drug turned my labs back to normal and made my weekly kidney appt to 4-5 months apart. GREAT DRUG!!

I had the tremors and the headaches in the beginning but they went away after about a year I believe. It was rather annoying but I was still alive! It has been 13 almost 14 years now and I have had only one rejection episode. That was due to mixing non-compatible meds. My meds have just been reduced to 1mg 2x daily. That is the ONLY anti-rejection drug I am on and things are going well. I can only hope to make it another 40-50 years this way. Please feel free to contact me if you want to know more about my experience with this medication. bak2good at yahoo.com. Thanks- BB
Prevent Kidney Transplant Rejection	randysandy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/17/2008 1:48:11 AM	I have been on Tacrolimus since my Kidney/Pancreas Transplant in May of 2002.  This is, quite honestly, the best drug that I'm taking right now and I've NEVER had any rejection.  I lost the transplanted pancreas in Feb 2003, however, that was due to thrombosis when a blood clot moved into the artery and blocked the blood flow to that particular organ.....but my new kidney rocks!!!

I was placed on Prograf after having experienced numerous rejections the first months of my Transplant. I was apparently rejecting the Meds, not the heart!!
