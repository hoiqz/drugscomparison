Had several VTach episodes of 8 ectopics in a row for 15 mins. Was hospitalized and put back on Tambocor. Started on 50mg twice daily. Still had 9.5% of beats being ectopic. Increased dose to 200mg a day and after a full month on increased dose have had 3 decent days with minimal PVCs. Am also taking verapamil 240mg daily.
A Type of Fast Heartbeat - Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia	keith,  Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		3/5/2012 5:33:26 PM	26 years ive been on, longest person in world to take it Ive been told.  Never had any problems few slight side affect dizziness, fatique no long term major issues to this point . Went from 400 mg after 23 years to 200 to 100 to 50 to nothing in the last year and as of last 5 days nothing and my issue seems to  be gone so I think God has cured me of whatever it was but for 26 years nobody would try reducing it they said it works leave it alone .  All though i know the side affects of having a heart attach seem to be  a bad deal possibly. especially at 400 mg which i was one thats  a heavy dose.

A Type of Fast Heartbeat - Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia	Boolee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/13/2011 12:32:10 AM	I was diagnoised with a high heart rate in 1992 and started on Tenormin, it worked great by itself until late 1994. Have been on several meds and had an EP study with radial ablation that was unsucessful, with tachycardia that never slowed down after the procedure. In fact, it was so bad that I had to start Tambocor before my heart was healed from the surgery. Have been on Tambocor ever since 1995 and am very exhaused all the time but I also have chronic fatigue syndrome. I still have tachycardia but usually only last a few minutes. I would probably have died had I not gotten on Tambocor.

Taking 3 times a day instead of twice seems to help on the days when I have breakthrough arrythmias.  Some days are better than others.  Also, I use accupressure bands and they seem to work.  I was skeptical but they do help with breakthrough arrythmias.  No serious side effects.  Have mild problems with peripheral vision.  Overall, the benefits are worth the side effects.  
Prevention of Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation	B Smith, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	8/3/2010 4:31:27 PM	Perfect treatment - Tambacor Controls irregular heartbeats completely - with no side effects that I am aware of.  However one Cardiologist informed me that he would not prescribe this drug to anyone for any reason - even if it was the only drug that worked.  It is too hard on the heart- saying to me - You must have a strong heart.  I had taken this for 15 years and could have run from LA to NYC without any concern about going into irregular or rapid arrhythmia

I tried ablation, however since the problem only lasted a very short time the problem was difficult to find and fix.   A dose of 50MG twice a day of flecainide has solved the problem for the past three months...no more episodes.  Follow up ekg was normal.
Atrial Fibrillation	mick, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	55-64	6/9/2010 7:14:57 PM	I was put on this medication in a hospital in July '08 where they did a stress test because it's not recommended if you have blockages. In Jan '10 I experienced Sudden Cardiac Arrest. I'm only here because someone knew CPR. I was NEVER told that SCA was a side-effect! How can that be an acceptable side-effect? Death??? The book &quot;Deadly Medicine&quot; by Thomas J Moore was written in 1995 and is out of print now. What has happened since then? I wish I had read it before I agreed to take flecainide/tambocor. This is NOT acceptable!

When i wore a holtor montor my doctor told me my PVCs have decreased quite a bit, but i've found myself feeling dizzy and anxious, and i've had a difficult time falling asleep and i've gotton sligtly irritable. Wondering if anybody else has experienced these symptoms?
Heart Ventricle Rhythm Problem	karmaexists, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female		5/19/2010 4:28:16 PM	Holter monitor of my ventricular tachycardia showed it was occurring 50% of the time.  Started on 50 mgs twice a day which stopped the arrhythmias but...also totally depleted my quality of life.  I've been struggling with trying to adjust the dosage for over six months...and continue to feel miserable,  Dizzyness, disorientation, increased hunger, tired all the time, bruising badly and breaking out in rashes. Rotten disposition too!

Went to Electropysiologist and he started me on 50mg of flecainide twice a day in August....have not had any incidents since then..it is now Feb...had one incident with congestive heart failure, never had it before...dr. says he might not give the drug with congestive heart failure...he is too conference with cardiologist.

Atrial Fibrillation	Chester, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	1/27/2010 12:20:58 PM	I had AFib every couple days so Dr put me on this drug 200 mg-100 mg in a.m. and 100 mg in p.m.  I hated it--caused tremendous amount of flutters (which I had not had any of these prior to the med-just AFib),pounding heart, numbness in arms and legs, short bouts of AFib and then convert.  I called Dr after two weeks and wanted to go off med.  He advised quit cold turkey and wanted to start me on Sotalol (sp?) three days later.  I asked the Dr about just reducing the amount of Tambocor and he just thought it would be better to switch meds.  I was against this much drug changing going on with my heart so I reduced the Tambocor on my own to 50 mg in a.m. and 50 mg in p.m.  The first day of changing things were already better--  No more flutters and pounding.  Sleeping better and less &quot;foggy&quot; feeling.  So glad I just reduced instead of bouncing around to other drugs.  Only been a few days but it feels wonderful to have a heart that I don't feel every second of the day.  If you're struggling with this med, it may be the dosage, not the med itself.

I was given intravenous flecainide in Holland on a business trip ten years ago; it was the first drug that had any effect. In 5 years previous, afib episode would last for hours to days; cardioversion was ineffective.  When I returned to US, I started on 75 mg bid, along with metoprolol.  When metoprolol was discontinued due to hypnogogic hallucinations, I started having fainting spells.  Replacing metoprolol with atenolol solved the fainting problem, and for ten years my afib episodes happened only once or twice a year, and they last only about 4 hours (with an extra 1/2 dose of flecainide after 2 hours)  During this time the daily flecainide dose was increased to 150mg bid.Last week I began a swarm of 2-4 hour afib episodes, 5 so far.  Flecainide level in the blood is not yet back from the lab so don't know if bad batch of drug, or what; have an echocardiogram and stress test are scheduled in case something has changed for the worst. (I came to this site to check out rythmol, which will be considered if flecainide is no longer working)

Been cardioverted numerous times. Up until last January 2009 I was in A-Fib 5-7 times a month. I started Tambocor and have been in a short A-fib spell for a couple of hours. Fantastic!  I now walk/run and work out 4 times a week and feel great. I can not say enough about what this medicine has done to change my life.

So far the treament backs up his opinion, and I have almost total control of my tachycardia - maybe a short episode a few times a year. I have concerns about long term usage, or what happens if I have a cardiac attack or issue unrelated to my tachy.

Atrial Fibrillation	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	5/19/2009 5:21:25 PM	I had a fib and mitral valve prolapse.  I feel so much better, no shortness of breath, more energetic since starting meds and getting heart rythym under control.  I take 50 mg. 2-3 times a day.  Medication should always be started in hospital so that doctor can control heart rythym and find right strength for you.  Can have severe side effects.  It has been a lifesaver for me.
Atrial Fibrillation	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	55-64	4/30/2009 5:35:26 PM	The smallest dosage of this drug is 50mg. I am currently taking 1/2 pill twice a day. Even with this low dose, I still occasionally get a flutter or two during the day. Aside from the inconvenience of having to cut such a small pill, I have had very good results with Tambocor.

I have been taking 50mg twice daily for the past 5 years. Heart specialist wants me to stop taking medication.  I decreased to 50mg once daily for the past 3 monthas and have done very well.  I am nervous about not taking any medication b/c I don't want to go back to where I was. The last 3 days, I have not taken any and so far so good!  I keep saying my prayers!!

My pulse is about 55, however my heart is now beating and hesitating at which time I become light headed. I have atrial fib.  I was taking 75 mg twice a day and did not experience these hesitations which also is causing me to feel extremely light headed when my heart hesitates. I believe that 200 mg. is too strong for my body.  I have been on 200 mg. daily for 3 days.  I take this at 100 mg twice daily.
