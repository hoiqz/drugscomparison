Other	Christy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	9/30/2012 6:15:06 PM	throughout my life i have had a lot of stomach problems. i've recently had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, ct scans of my pelvis and abdomon, along with a lot of blood work etc..my doctor put me on pentasa 4 days ago. my biggest inconvenience is the fact that i cannot swallow large pills, which pentasa is. my doctor told me i could open the pill up and put it on a spoon with apple sauce, pudding, ice cream and what have you. i take 2 capsules 4 times a day. i  know the medication doesn't absorb into your blood and just sits in your colon. this morning i noticed some of the beads from inside the capsule in my stool. is this supposed to be happening? i feel like i would have noticed this on day 1? i need to call my doctor when he returns to his office, but needed some peace of mind until then &amp; was curious if anyone else is on the same boat as me.

Works quite well. There have been a few times I have had to supplement with Entocort (corticosteroid, very good quality!) if I flare up. Always the flare-ups have happened because of poor food choice. As the years go by, there are fewer flare-ups due to the learning curve! The only difficulty I have had with Pentasa is remembering to take it after lunch at work.

Crohn's Disease	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	1/27/2012 2:45:24 PM	Doctor prescribed 4 pills daily. I took 1 at lunch , thought I better take only one since I am pretty sensitive to medications . Within 2 hours had a severe rash with hives from shoulder blade to thigh. Called the Doctor and they said this was a severe reaction and Do Not Take anymore , DUH ! Was left with a almost full bottle worth $200.00 that got thrown into the trash can ! Next prescription will ask for samples or only a few days worth , just in case I can't take them.

When first diagnosed my doctor prescribed PEntasa and it worked wonderfully for me, When I felt a flare up beginning I would take a couple extra and within a few days I felt a million times better! My insurance will no longer pay for Pentasa and am now on Asacol, which is by far inferior, I am sick and been hospitalized far more than when i was taking the miracle drug Pentasa!

I take 2 caps before breakfast and 2 before dinner. Recently my liver function is high and I'm not sure if it's from the med or just a side effect of Crohns.  I have lots of inflamation lately and the Pentasa doesn't seem to help that at all.  But it does allow me to eat pain free.  I have cut back my dosage in the past and it always comes back to haunt me!

I was prescribed pentasa at first. I used it for the first couple of weeks and it had no effect. Popping pill after pill and even upping the dosage still did nothing at all. I was swallowing these pills for nothing. My case isn't even as bad as what I've read about some people having. It was until I was prescribed prednisone that I felt back to normal(thank god). This pill is a waste of time and money especially when you don't have insurance.
Crohn's Disease	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/21/2010 7:14:20 PM	Started taking Pentasa times aday about 7 months ago..had a horrible headache for the first few days, but that was the only side effect I had. After about a month I started to notice a difference. I am not completely symptom free, but it definately helps! I would take it 8 times a day if I had to. After almost ten years of being told I had IBS or nothing at all I finally found a doctor that I love...the right doctor means everything to someone with Crohns. Good luck to you all.

I take 2/day (when I remember). Rather than diarreha I have the opposite condition most of the time. Cramping, for me, seems to be related more to stressful situations than any other single thing.  No operations as yet, nor will there be any with any continuing good fortune.

It made the diarrhea and cramping worse. It was very expensive, even with insurance the co-pay was $75+. After taking on/off over the past 10 years I still ended up having surgery for a small bowel obstruction and had a small fistula attachment to the bladder. While I realize every case is different, this med was totally useless in my case, and a waste of time &amp; money!

After 1st dose, had some diarrhea within 2 hours. After second dose, started having increasing diarrhea and watery stools.  After third dose, abdominal pain, nausea, light-headedness, back pain (in the area of kidneys) along with increased frequency of watery stools. After 4th dose, couldn't leave the house. Stopped med. It took two days for diarrhea and nausea to end.  Spent another 3 days off med and tried again, this time 1 pill 3x/day.  Same thing happened.  I obviously cannot tolerate this drug.  Have started Sulfasalazine and will see how that goes.

Crohn's Disease	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	10/31/2009 3:23:56 AM	Diagnosed Crohn's 04/20/09.It seems starting Pentasa can be hard. Feeling lite headed at times. After five months of use, had chest pain and went to ER. Follow up with Cardiac DR, now on heart medicine for one year. Was told I had an irregular heart beat. Any correlation with drug? Personally, I don't know. Cardiac DR said NO. Back at two months of use, I took myself off of Pentasa for one month, (I was in denial of having Crohn's), I went back to having diarhea and abdominal pain. Got myself back on Pentasa. Ninety percent pain free. Bowl movements are solid and easy to have as long as you drink plenty of water.I take two capsules, 500 mg each, for times daily. I work Grave yard and want to sleep. It's hard to wake up to take the medication and then wake up later AGAIN to go use restroom due to full bladder.  Botom line, as one person said it, the inconvience of taking the medicine is nothing as compared to the extreme pain if you don't take it.

I am 99% of the time pain free and can eat whatever I like. However, my inflammation is no better. Pentasa has at least kept me comfortable but not &quot;fixed&quot; anything. Yes, VERY expensive. But we order it from Canada and save nearly $300 a month on it.

It was pretty much just flushing money down the drain.

The doctor prescribed this medication take 2 pills 4x a day.  After only 3 days on this medication I had to be taken off of it.  I had a hard time getting the pills down, getting worse than I was.  Once, the doctor took me off what a difference it made.

Long story . . . 4 tabs;4x each day, plus 2 purinethal, lab tests each month to see if I was destroying my liver. Quit taking meds altogether. Extremely bad news. Tried something new. Garden of life primal defense, works unbelievably well. Started eating 5 - 8 times a day smaller portions, cleaner foods, following a low impact carb style diet, working out more. Now, no more purinethal, 1x1 pentasa each day, 1 &quot;dirt pill&quot; each day. have the symptoms so well under control I was able to go to Iraq for a year and use my professional knowledge to support coalition forces.

Crohn's Disease	cam, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	9/18/2008 4:46:48 PM	Pentasa has really helped me, at first the initial side effects made the conditions worse, but within a week and a half they were gone. I feel normal again taking these. The only thing is my dr has me taking 3 pills 3 times a day, so it's a lot to take. Thank goodness for insurance too, w/o it's around $500

Have not noticed any significant side effects. It is expensive, thankfully I have a decent health plan but even then the deductible still costs me $50 every 3 months.  The dosage has become routine for me but I miss the odd dose and it has not caused any problems.
Crohn's Disease	shiloh, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	8/19/2008 1:51:50 PM	I started taking Pentasa for Crohn's and I started to feel better in about 2 weeks, then on the 3rd week I started having heart palpataions and racing. I could barely breath when walking. No one could figure out what was wrong with me and I felt like I was having a heart attack all day. I finally stopped taking it and within 3 days the heart symptoms stopped. Just beware because my gastroenterologist didn't want me stopping the meds and if I hadn't I think I could have done some perminent damage. 
Crohn's Disease	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/12/2008 2:35:48 PM	Pentasa is a miricle drug for me.if i miss a dose i get very very sick &amp; end up back in the hospital.
Crohn's Disease	Cambria, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	6/3/2008 10:06:41 AM	I have only been taking this for a couple weeks now, my pain has gone, but the side effects have been pretty bad. The worst is the sickness to my stomach and the lack of energy. I hope these will go away after I've become more used to the medicine. I was taking Asacol before and that caused a lot of hair loss, my dr mentioned this may help prevent that.
Crohn's Disease	dgreen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	5/23/2008 6:14:05 PM	My overview should be taken with a grain of salt since I have only been taking it for about 2 weeks. Nonetheless, my pain has lessened. The only drawback is the sore throat, fever and flu like symptons. My doctor said this could happen and sure enough. I was sent home from work with a temp of 101.5. The flu is no fun. I'm not looking forward to this being a normal side effect of using Pentasa, though.

Ulcerated Colon	Diane, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	9/22/2007 4:54:36 PM	I had to go on this medication slowly as it increased my symptoms with the full dose. It takes at least a mo. to work and you can open capsules as my doctor recommended due to the fact that I do not take pills. The medicine is coated in side and is also time released.
