Heart Ventricle Rhythm Problem	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	8/23/2012 10:43:59 AM	I have taken Sectral since March, 2012.  Last week the dosage was doubled to 400mg twice a day.  I have episodes of irregular heartbeat several times a day and also two of my valves have moderate leakage.  I am so tired on this medicine and have had some gastro side-effects.  My biggest complaint at the moment is the vivid dreams I have every single night.  Have others experienced this?  Please reply.  Thanks

Sectal changed my life. Three months after taking it, I went from complete house arrest due to rapid and abmormal heartbeat to now being able to drive again and stand and sit for longer periods. I take it also for dysautonomia. Love this med. I have no known side effects, and never did.

Fear it is related to long term use. Anyone else have this result? Otherwise, it's been great drug for my irregular heartbeat problem.

When it was detected with the use of a monitor, I was prescribed Sectral and Digoxin, which have remedied the problem.  Never had an adverse side affect from it's use.

The drug works well but I had to be very adaptive to finding the right way to take it.  It causes gas and about an hour after taking it I need a restroom.  This can be very uncomfortable in an office job.  I eventually found that I had to reduce my dose by half.  Then I started taking it every other day, when I left work in the evening.  I also found that the med had an even greater GI effect if I took it first thing in the mornning before I had sufficient liquids to drink.  I also discovered through trial and error that it is much easier on your system if you have food to eat with it.  I think that it makes the absorption of the medication a bit slower.   I am glad that I have found ways to adapt my system to the drug because it works well for my heart.

I have taken this medicine for 2 months, the only problem I have had so far is that i'm so tired. My doctor said that it will go away in time i'm not so sure about that after all its been 2 months.
Other	jsellman, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	25-34	6/6/2008 4:24:52 PM	I was prescribed this medication to hel lessen the number of times I wake up with migraines. 200mg wasn't enough so I'm going up to 400mg. I take it at night so hopefully there will be no negative side effects because I have naturally low blood pressure.
