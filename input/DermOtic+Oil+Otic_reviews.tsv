They would itch so much that I would scratch them raw (even in my sleep). New ENT prescribed this and within days it has worked wonders. I am going to recommend that mother who is a hearing aid wearer, inquire about this medication with her doctor.

The doctors all told me that it was a crystal flake that broke loose and told me to do sone exercises to get the crystal to move. I asked my new ENT for some ear drops for itchy earsand he perscribed DermOtic Oil. The very first time I used it the room stopped spinning around and my ears no longer itch. I can now go to bed at night without the room spinning. This medication is worth its weight in gold. It cleared up both conditions for the price of one.

I would itch them until I was bleeding, fluid running out of them. They drove me absolutely crazy!! Finally I went to an ENT and he prescribed this. I am SO happy with it. It works wonders and feels (and smells) good!

Inflammation of the External Ear Resembling Eczema	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/20/2010 6:57:19 PM	I've had dry itchy ears that sometimes bled for years. The rememdies doctors prescribed did nothing for me.  I finally visited an E-N-T doctor who prescribed DermOtic Oil for me.  All I can say is that it works!  My ears stopped itching and I totally forget about them. The oil leaves the skin nice and soft.  No more itching, flakiness or bleeding. I am very satisfied with this medication as it is the only one that works for me.

This med works so well that I can hardly express my almost immediate results. Wish one of my dozen or so previous MDs had prescribed this for me years earlier. 
Other	Relieved patient, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/22/2009 1:13:09 PM	I've had itchy ears for years and have battled external ear infections for years; I would get them several times a year until a specialist prescribed me this drug which literally saved me. I don't know why no PCP could prescribe it sooner but this has been a lifesaver for me. Provides relief within days and lasts a long time. I now use these drops after I wash my hair. I don't have to use them after each wash but if I use them occassionally I don't have any problems. I have not had an ear infection in 2 years!

Is this a new drug?  I have been so pleased with the results and it works within days.  The 2nd best thing I have used is over the counter (no Rx necessary) Miracell, however this Dermotic oil is definitely the BEST.  I've forgotten I had itchy ears.
