Breast Cancer	MEM, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	55-64	7/10/2012 8:15:44 AM	After 3rd and last cycle I experienced loss of balance.  Following a neuro investigation 2 years after the administration of the drug I was found to have damage of the balance centre in the brain linked to this drug.  I have seen the results of a small study showing womenn over 60 treated with this drug for breast cancer are more likely to be affected by damage to the balance centre.

Breast Cancer	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	55-64	11/12/2011 9:26:31 PM	I had Emend so I did not get nausea.  Neulasta brought my WBC count to normal. I did have anemia through the 4 cycles I was given ( along with Cytoxan) 3 months after treatment ended I developed congestive heart failure luckily a mild case but still it was CHF. I am now on daily meds for CHF

They normally follow it the next day with a Neulasta shot, and THAT made me sick until I learned that if you take an antihistamine like Claratin one hour before the shot, you won't get sick.  Ask your doctor about this.  It really works.

Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	35-44	7/8/2010 5:57:00 PM	I guess the best thing is that I am in remission. Probably due to this and the combination of drugs. Not sure if heart symptoms I experience are from this or not.  Since chemotherapy 3 years ago I have not been able to exercise aerobically much beyond walking or I feel like I can't get adequate blood flow and breath well enough, like I'm going to faint. My heart beats very rapidly with minimal exertion. Wondering if it's because it was effected by this drug.

Breast Cancer	Atlanta GA, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	55-64	7/11/2008 6:01:30 PM	No worse than I expected - I had Adriamycin w/Cytoxan every 2 weeks for 4 cycles. Had great anti-nausea meds (Emend) and made it through working full time. It leaves you feeling pretty bad on day 4-5 for a couple of days but it beats the alternative (metastasis) of having a very aggressive breast cancer. Not easy - but doable!
