I have taken pain meds w/muscle relaxers for years for herniated discs and spurs from neck to tailbone. I take the generic. I'm so happy to have it!

Muscle Spasm	whatever41, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	10/16/2011 1:02:38 PM	I have been using this medication for some time. Any drug can be addictive, but I have found it to relieve pain and muscle spasms so I can have a normal day without vegetating on the sofa or in bed. It helps me to sleep easily &amp; without any hangover effect in the am. I had a terrible experience with back surgery that left me with spasms &amp; nerve damage. This med has not made me dizzy or sick @ stomach. I've not become dependent on it, and function quite well when taken as prescribed. I have regular Dr. appts. &amp; have not been advised to stop the treatment. I'm sorry others have had bad experiences w/it, but I considered it a lifeline to a pain controlled life. I was taking an oxycodone along w/the parafon when I first left the hospital due to the discomfort. I don't need the oxy any more. Thank you. Please don't let the &quot;nuts&quot; take it off the market!

Muscle Spasm	45-54 Female  (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	7/22/2011 6:38:46 PM	This med was prescribed for my husband, but as a nurse (for 18yrs) I have never seen such an unusual reaction. He had hallucinations for 4 days, didnt recognize any loved ones, or even knew he was in his own home. He fell at least 4 times - that I saw - that required a trip to the emergency room. He cracked two ribs and had a small crack to a vertebra. He had a somewhat nasty-looking lump to his head that bled lightly, but luckily suffered no permanent danger to his skull or brain. I know other people who take this same med with no noted side effects at all, but if its a first-time use for you, be careful and try to have a loved one around to monitor you in case this drug affects you in the same way as my husband. My husband is an example of a small number of people who have opposite, even violent reactions to mild medications; so chances are this will not happen to you. However, better safe than sorry. I had to repeatedly keep him away from the gas stoves in our home until that 4 day nightmare had run its course!

It can make you a little dizzy or woozy and maybe a slight headache, but not bad enough to stop taking them. I'm a 13 year fibromyalgia sufferer and muscle spasms were 1 of my first symptoms, so I've tried a lot of things. If you take them in conjunction with a pain pill, I suggest taking them 30 mins apart. I don't know the mfr name of them, but the green hexagonal ones work better than the white caplets made by Watson. This is an older medicine, so Drs don't automatically prescribe them. You should ask for this brand. To me, they're proven effective and safe.
