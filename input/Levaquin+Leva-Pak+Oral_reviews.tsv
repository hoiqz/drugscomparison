After beating the Sinus infection, the lungs/bronchitis persisted.  7 days on Levaquin knocked it out of me.  I had no side effects like some others had reported.  It is certainly worth a try if you are struggling with an infection.  It does work!!!

Influenzae Bacteria Infection	rarelyill, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	1/25/2010 7:54:48 PM	I was given Levaquin to take for 5 days &amp; told it would work at alleviating the infection for 10 days.  After the third pill I had a worse headache than I had originally from tne sinus infection.  My cough increased and I could not sleep more than 15 minutes at a time. When I did dose off I had strange dreams.  On the fourth day I got a very severe stomach ache. It felt like gall bladder attacks I had prior to having the gall bladder removed.  My legs began to ache and I felt exhausted just climbing up three steps.  It is now day 6 and I have slept about 8 hours over the last 6 days, my sinus infection has settled in and my gums are sore making it painful to eat even if I felt like it. I am also dealing with extreme constipation. 
Skin Infection	nenalatina, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	1/24/2010 7:32:44 AM	I took this medication for 35 days due to an infection after I had arm reduction surgery. I noticed that I was having difficulty getting up &amp; that my angles, knees &amp; shoulders hurt but I thought it was because I wasn't moving around alot due to the surgery but I've been off it for 23 days &amp; I'm hurting so bad, I don't know what to do! I'm a very active person &amp; work out everyday but the pain is still here. I got on the internet &amp; found that alot people had joint pain &amp; I realized then it was the medication. I've had any side affects from any medications that I've taken; this is the first for me. I just want the pain to go away! It cleared my infection but now my joints hurt really bad!

It also seems to have interfered with my Zoloft and am now trying to re-stabilize that medication.  The doctor said Levaquin would not interfere with the Zoloft, but when I started having difficulty I called the psychiatrist.  She said it was very possible the Levaquin interfered.
