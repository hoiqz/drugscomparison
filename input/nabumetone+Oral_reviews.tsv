My muscles are constantly tight, inflamed, and aching. This gave me no relief whatsoever, and caused me great discomfort. The nausea and stomach pain was almost unbearable. Headache, irritability, and insomnia was debilitating. The worst part of it was at night when I would try lay down to sleep, I felt as though I was going through opiate withdrawals. Severe pain and aching in all my muscles, especially my legs and back, causing me to be restless to the point of having anxiety attacks. There is no relief for withdrawal symptoms - only waiting until the toxin is out of your body. I asked NOT to be given opiates for this reason, but now I wish I had, because at least opiate pain killers relieve the pain before putting you through so much misery. I also read from these reviews people with CHF, high blood pressure, and asthma should not be on this medication. My doctor should have known better than to prescribe me this evil drug. I will never take this medicine again.

Any I had a small dinner with a piece of bread and an antiacid pill (I am acid reflux prone) in hopes to eliminate any stomach problems. Well that did not work. Tonight after I showered I noticed two new bruises that do not hurt and are new and bright. Kinda scary since I do not bruise easy nor have I bumped or hurt myself. I took the pills tonight before noticing the bruising but I will stopping it and call my doc tomoorrow for a new pill. It works for the pain but the reflux, gas , and brusing is not cool.

This med has helped with the numbness and pain but have some adominal pains and ringing in the ears.  Rough trade off,  but ease of back pain worth it.  Published side-effects are disturbing, but try not to think about it.  Hopefully if it kills me it will be a quick death. LOL  Blood pressure has gone up slightly.  Bowling score still pathetic.

I have osteo arthritis in knees and hips. Originally tried for very painful hips. Didn't help the hips at all but found that it greatly reduced the swelling in my knees. No releif from pain so I continue with two Tylenol arthritis strength in the morning. I have since had both hips replaced and continue with the nabumetone. I'm feeling pretty good now. No long-lasting side effects (for me) that I know of.

Dr. said take 1500 mg, i now just take 750mg. i use it for chronic neck pain. Have noticed a feel bloated after eating. Constipated about once a week. Sure beats having bad headaches which cause vomiting and shuts me down for a day. I see the dr. every 6 months to check up on blood work and a full check up. It works on some but not others. Good luck!!!

After using the med for about 3 months I no longer need the sticks and the pain is minimal. It worked for me and I have no complaints.

I have bee on Nabumetone for about a week and it works well to keep the pain at bay, but the stomach problems are not worth it. I was on Bextra for 3 years and never had a problem...Now I can't seem to find an NSAID that won't upset my stomach

Along with that I have pain in my knees, hands, neck, hands and sometimes I hurt elsewhere. I cannot get around well. I take a codine drug (the strongest possible) and it just doesn't help. Adding this to it gets rid of almost all my pain.

I got lower back surgery four years. The after math of surgery left me with lower back pain for life! I needed some kind of medication to help me with my pain. I also take Lyrica. So far no problems with this medication.
