Migraine Headache	CC, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/15/2012 10:34:07 AM	I have used Fiornal for over 30 years.  Within 20 minutes I can feel relief from the pain and aura without side effects.  I tried many other pres. with side effects such as heart palpitations, extreme itching and most of all little to no relief. I have also tried meds to prevent migraines with no success.  Even with no negative side effects and great results while never exceeding the dosage, my dr.gives me a hard time with refills.  I also have FM with constant daily pain, with no meds. that help with that pain, so having something that takes away any of my pain is amazing.

It is the only treatment that eliminates a severe migraine and allows me to get on with my life. No side effects--just welcome relief.  Even though I only need it about 4x/year, I am greatful to have learned about this treatment option.

Migraine Headache	footballmom89, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/7/2012 2:16:14 PM	I have had migraines for the last 20 years.  The only medication that seemed to control it was Darvon (I can't take Tylenol).  That medication was discontinued about a year ago and I have been stuggling ever since to deal with the pain.  After numberous dr appts and prescritions, I finally went to a neurologist and he gave me this.  I had been suffering with a migraine for 9 days and within hours it was gone!  It was really a relief to know I finally had something to help me.  I wish dr.s didn't treat everyone as if they were drug addicts.  There are some of us who simply need pain reflief to function in our daily lives.  I would recommend this drug to anyone who suffers with migraines.  And I have had no side effects which is wonderful!

Migraine Headache	ahjune, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	11/4/2011 3:48:16 AM	I get Hemiplegic migraines with an aura so I was very limited to the medicines I was able to take due to high risk of stroke. I tried pretty much every other medication before Fiorinal and none were successful in ridding me of my migraines.  Fiorinal has helped dramatically.  I used to be stuck in bed for at least two days when I had a migraine, now I can function after about an hour.  It has literally saved my life.

When the pain is greater and I take it two hours after Hydrocodone it is effective in continuing to keep my headache at bay.  I do like this medication and make sure to have it with me at all times, I just wish it worked on my bigger migraines/HAs.
Tension Headache	Dal, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	3/24/2011 2:09:52 AM	I have been taking this medication for almost 30 years with great results. There is no OTC med that helps me most of the tome. I have to have #3 which means with codeine. I tried without one time and it did no good at all. My doctor of 25 years questions me with the same dumb questions ever time I go, but I always get my Rx.

Idon't feel any withdrawal from not taking the drug and I was afraid I would.  I have taken it for months and then gone off it for months with no trouble.  I prefer this to any other pain med.

If you have 2-3 headaches a week, I would simply caution you about the seductiveness of these drugs, and the strong possibility of becoming addicted should they be used on a regular basis.  Also, be careful of rebound headaches if, for some unknown reason, you must take Fiorinol/fioricet. I have experienced this firsthand, and the headache pain you feel during withdrawal or rebound is MUCH worse that the original migraine.So,  great drug for the OCCASIONAL migraine sufferer!

But if you are on a antidepressant, fiornal is not recommended because,it's a depressant on top of a depressant.  And if your doctor takes you off of the antidepressant it can cause seizures.  trust me I know it happened to me.  Otherwise it does work!

That was 50 years ago and it still works better than anything. No dependence symptoms, just pain relief.

It also helps with nerve ending pain, but doctors will not give it for that.  Instead for back pain they want to give you the oxicodenes and the codenes.  This works and is much safer.  I just do not understand why this being much safer and it working why doctors are so  reluctant to prescribe.  It is a medicine you can take and get relief and go on with your daily life

I started having migrains about 3 months ago, which put me in the emergency room 3 times in 2 months, after a horrible experience in the emergency room i called my doctor and he called in this prescription and it works.  Ihave to take 2 at a time but works great when i do.
Tension Headache	LB, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	7/25/2009 8:50:40 PM	I was prescribed this med after 4 days of an annoying dull headache that would not go away with OTC meds. This did not get rid of my headache either and instead I had a headache and stomach upset. I am still on the med (going on 1 week) as I am scheduled for a CT scan in a few days. I have the green pills w/o the Codiene as I am allergic. Will be asking my practitioner for something else during my follow up.

Tension Headache	Rae, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	7/1/2009 6:48:14 PM	HI, I have used Fiorinal, with tylenol and with aspirin, and it is a miracle drug. I started it in the 80's and use it once or twice a month and within a half hour or so it can kick out the headache most of the time. Truly a wonderful medication with no side effects for me. Thank you, Rae Eunice, ST. Paul, mn.

Also, I get severe migranes about other week. They get so bad I literally cannot swallow my own saliva without vomiting repeatedly. For tension headaches, they are great. For migrane, useless until finally tolerating anti-nausea(phenergan).  Then I can take them and they dull the pain. Is it odd to be prescribed two daily?  They are a barbiturate opiod.
Other	screen name, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/24/2009 6:56:10 AM	Back in the 80's I was prescribed this medicine for migranes. It took 15 different trial meds to find out that this was the only med that worked in which I still function and feel normal. I later found out that I had Hypoglycemia, changed my diet and my migranes disappeared. As I got older I started having major PMS Symptoms in which 1-2 weeks prior to I had tension headaches, all over body aches and extreme fatigue.  I was missing 1-2 days a month from work and eventually had to start my own business in which I could schedule my appointments and work schedule around my PMS.  I went through a couple of years of trying different meds.  Finally I was put on Fiorinal and again it was the only medicine that worked. Instead of having 2 bad weeks I was down to 1 really bad day.  Fiorinal looses it's effectiveness if it is taken too often.  So I would highly suggest to take it only when needed and not everyday.

I went to my md and she told me to take 4 ibuprophens every 4 hours.  I did this for 3 days with no relief.  My mother suggested I try a few of her fiorinol.  The results were immediate.   The next day I could stand up strait and walk with little or no pain.  This drug is remarkable for back pain.

Migraine Headache	Bella's Mom, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/25/2008 2:25:40 PM	I have found this medication to be phenomenal in the treatment of migraine headaches.  I have been successfully taking this medication for 28 years, with NO problems whatsoever!  Sometimes, I take one extra strength aspirin with one fiorinal/codeine, and this proves more effective when I have an extremely difficult migraine.  This way, the prescription 'lasts' longer and the benefits are greater.  Also extremely helpful is to lie down in a quiet/dark room 30 minutes after taking this medication.

I have taken this drug for years with no problems. When I ran low on the capsules on one prescription, I took a Fiorinal and a Tylenol ... for me, that combination worked even better. So to save money and stretch my prescription, it's one Fiorinal and one Tylenol! In a pinch, Excedrin Migraine usually works, but sometimes I need more than one dosage.

I had them from age of 17 to 20 then they just stopped! They started agin at age of 23 and I am now 46. My Dr.'s keep wanting me to try something else. Nothing I have tried has given me as much relief. I wear sunglsses indoors and have to use ice packs. I keep ice packs at home,and at work. When I take the Fiorinal with codine I can function. It takes away the sick feeling and takes away all or most of the pain.

Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/8/2007 1:42:36 AM	Love This medication!! I go from wearing sunglasses in the house to playing outside in an hour.  Usually take 1-2 once a month and it just knocks a migraine flat. I don't feel drugged or tired.  Try not to drive though, it dulls your reaction time. It does not seem to be effective on a 'normal' headache.  A consideration:  Fioricet comes in a tablet and can be split when the headache isn't that bad.  I think the only difference is Fiorinal has aspirin and Fioricet has Tylenol

Tension Headache	krazymnd, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	10/1/2007 2:39:42 PM	i don't know what doses others are on, but mine is a generic white pill. i find sometimes it works quite well, when other times it doesn't work at all and i find i am taking another one an hour later. I'm not sure of the strength, but it doesn't work all the time.
