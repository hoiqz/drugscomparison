Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/31/2012 12:40:11 AM	I suffer from adult acne on my face, neck, chest, shoulders and upper arms.  This medication has been wonderful!  I've been using it every night for 2 weeks and my acne is almost completely gone!! I am also taking minocycline 50 mg (morning and night) and washing with Cetaphil. I am very impressed with this drug.  
Acne	FLus345, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/13/2011 8:13:12 AM	I use about twice a week, 3x if necessary.  It is nearly magical at making blemishes go away and it leaves my skin clear and glowing.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	10/13/2011 2:27:50 PM	DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT EVERYDAY UNLESS YOU HAVE REALLY BAD ACNE!! IT WILL RUIN YOUR SKIN!!!I had horrible skin problems from 8-14 years old. I tried all treatments including all sorts of Retin-A's...nothing worked. I finally went on a low dosage of Accutane for 6 months and started ortho lo birth control--from then on--miracle! My skin was crystal clear from 14-22. However, I stopped taking birth control for a very stupid reason and my skin started breaking out again ( a few large pimples on my jaw line). I freaked out because of the history I have had with acne and immediately started taking birth control again and ran to a Derm to try and nip the problem in the bud. She prescribed altralin and told me to continue using MD Forte glycolic face wash (which I had been using for 8 yrs at this point and swear by it). Basically ALTRALIN RUINED MY SKIN! IT WAS WAY TOO STRONG FOR WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR ONTOP OF THE ACID FACE WASH!! It literally gave me horrible blisters/boils on my face that were worse than my acne was when I was 8-14 (hard to do). It was very debilitating . I work for Fortune 500 company and have to interact with people every day! This was awful! Luckily my manager let me work from home for a week or so to resolve (it was bad enough for him to agree...that should say a lot right there).I ran back to my Derm and she told me to stop using aAltralin immediately. I was having a reaction called vesicles (blisters)and prescribed high powered antiobiotics to try and calm it down and my face is pretty well cleared again. But, am nursing some scars and acne antiobiotics are harsh on the stomach.  UNLESS you truly have horrible acne RUN AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT IT WILL GIVE YOU AN EVEN WORSE PROBLEM!!! Alsodump bad Derms.

Other	Nat , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	5/21/2011 5:00:41 PM	I have rosacea, large pores and occasional cyclic acne. This gel has been amazing in reduction of redness and pore size. I have a very sensitive skin and I had no problems with this medication. The down side is that 1. My skin started to flake at times, but a good moisturizer took care of it and 2. One tube of it costs 260 $. My HMO doesn't cover it, but it is worth the money.
Acne	dANI, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	13-18	3/15/2011 8:32:53 PM	Ive been on this for 6 months. It wasnt doing a thing, so 3 months after i started using this, i got blue laser treatment, which also didnt do a damn thing. Now im only on the atrilin and it makes my skin worse. My skin is 5 times worse than it was when i wasnt usng this. IT HAS RUINED MY SKIN. Despise this stuff
Acne	laurenwms87, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	11/18/2010 1:33:55 PM	I have had acne for over 10 years and the only  thing that has cleared it up was accutane. Unfortunately it only kept my skin clear for about two years. I tried to get back on it but could only do a month because I had liver problems. Now I have been using this consistently at night for a little over a week. I am not seeing too much improvement but I am getting a lot of embarrassing peeling around my mouth. I'm going to give it some more time before I call my derm and ask for a different prescription.  
Acne	capnbill23, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	9/9/2010 1:03:06 AM	It will definately dry your face, however this has only lasted the first 2-3 days at the beginning of use.  After that, most dryness disappeared.  It takes 3-7 days to remove most pimples and 7-14 for severe acne prone areas
Acne	amaramck, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/4/2010 12:28:18 PM	I have been using the product for a little over a week and i love it. I was using another product that increased my breakouts dramatically but this medication has made my acne disappear. I even notice that my fine wrinkle lines are disappearing. I have extremely oily skin and this is the first product that i have used that works. There is a little dryness and peeling but it doesn't bother me that all, as the pros far outweigh the cons.
Acne	jcoop, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/8/2009 11:47:33 AM	My derm prescribed this for my adult acne. Truthfully, I very rarely have trouble with acne. I am 32 and concerned about wrinkles. After using this medication three times, I have seen noticeable improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles - they have nearly disappeared. I know this is not the approved usage for this drug, but I like it. I started out by using it every other day to minimize the dryness, and so far I have had no trouble with dryness or redness, although the fingertips I use to apply it have dried out significantly. I use a cold cream type cleanser on my face, and a thick moisturizer the next morning. 
Other	bandit, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	11/24/2009 9:51:02 PM	It cost 240.00 so I couldn't afford anything but the free sample my Doctor gave me.
Acne	Shelly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	10/20/2009 4:30:24 PM	I was using atralin Gel for almost a year and hated it. I thought I just needed to give it time to work but after all that time I still got break outs and it made my skin feel so greasy shortly after I applied it. I had my doctor switch me to Retin A Micro and I love it!!!
Acne	nihaoma, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	25-34	10/9/2009 8:38:07 PM	I like this medicine for a few reasons:1. It is very mild on the skin. I am allergic to Benzoyl Peroxide, so I am very limited in the acne treatments I can use. I have very sensitive skin2. Easy to use. Put a pea size amount on your skin before bed and you are good to go.Overall, I saw a decrease in acne with 1-2 weeks. I did not have any initial severe breakout. However, as always, I am skill getting some acne, which is annoying. It is not a cure for my oily skin. I do not really seem to have any drying of the skin except for my nose. I used a water based moisturizer I get from my dermatologist. As a note, I have been on Accutane 3 times since I was 20 years old. I love it (no real side effects, skin is crystal clear on it), however, the effects of Accutane dont necessarily last when you come off of it, that is to say, your acne will likely be better but not necessarily disappear altogether. 
Acne	bulldawgbaby805, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	8/6/2009 10:25:59 PM	I am 14 and once I hit puberty at 13, I started getting acne on my face. I went to my dermatologist and he recommended Atralin. I applied a little dab to my whole face every night and I started seeing results within days. It's easy to use, works well, so I highly recommend it. I'm not self-conscious anymore about my skin and I am very pleased with this product.
Acne	beautifulunderneathitall, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	4/28/2009 1:17:44 PM	I have struggled with moderate acne for about 9 years now and Atralin has been the least irritating medication I have used. I started out using this medication every third night for about a month and then went to every other night, I am currently using a small pea sized amount every night and although I have experienced an initial increase in breakouts I am more satisfied with the &quot;side-effects&quot; of this medication than any other I have tried and I have tried TONS over the years short of Accutane. (Too scared to use that)! I use the Atralin topical each night after washing with Cetaphil for normal/oily skin. I then follow with Cetaphil moisturizer and the Atralin. So far even though I am breaking out I am super impressed as the breakouts heal quickly and I am excited to see how it will end up in about 6 more weeks!
Acne	kristy , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	3/25/2009 8:48:29 PM	I have used this medication each night for about 6 weeks. It has helped  to clear up my skin but I am peeling horribly around my chin and mouth. I tried mixing it with moisturizer but it hasn't helped so far. Other than this the medicine has been effective in clearing up the skin but has caused drying and peeling. 
Acne	happy camper, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/4/2009 1:04:04 PM	I am happy to report that the acne I've been troubled with has started clearing up.  I am using this medication in conjunction with Duac topical gel, and I am so glad that my acne is starting to clear up.  Nice to find products that work!
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/28/2008 1:55:45 PM	Atralin is much better than Retin A Micro for me. Just as effective in treating my moderate cystic acne without the extreme dryness, redness and peeling.
Acne	dlee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	11/6/2008 2:51:07 AM	I'm using it in conjunction w/Solodyn and Spironolactone. The cleanser I use is Cetaphil. On 10/18 I began using Atralin Gel 0.05% and have used it for 20 days. I have cystic acne and I've seen improvement. It hasn't caused me to have an initial breakout or made my skin peel or flake. Atralin is helping to dry up and shrink the cysts.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	10/23/2008 12:28:14 PM	This gel is great. My skin is looking so much mor clearer after only a week of treatment. It caused a little peeling around my mouth and chin areas but that I can live with temporarily. Overall, best that my doctor has had me try so far!
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/30/2008 11:38:33 AM	My acne cleared within a week! I used Clean and Clear cleanser along with it.
