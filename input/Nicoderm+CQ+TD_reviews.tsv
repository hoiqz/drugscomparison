Stop Smoking	Sun4Fun, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	8/30/2012 7:35:55 AM	I've been on the 21mg patch for a week and it really seems to be working.  It is one week today, but yesterday I began to feel sick to my stomach, headache and numbness/coldness in my right arm.  I did not put the patch on today to see if it subsides, so far, still feel sick.  I also take a multi-vitamin, calcium and Wellbrutrin daily.  Could this be contributing to my feeling this way.  I still don't have an urge to smoke even without the patch.  Any advice????

Stop Smoking	Lygia, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	7/10/2012 12:21:27 PM	Tried it and it was working. Had an allergic reaction, severe itching all over from head to toe. Is there a way around it?
Stop Smoking	nellie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	65-74	7/1/2012 3:04:22 PM	I've tried this several years ago &amp; now I really need &amp; want to quit. It's only been 10 days &amp; I find it helpful.  My biggest problem is the awful itching anywhere the patch has been &amp; the red square is very evident from 5 days ago.  I've tried cortesone cream with some relief.  It's a small price to pay for help.  Vivid dreams can be entertaining or not so.  Think I'll try taking it off before bed as another reviewer suggested.
Stop Smoking	cighater, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/30/2012 4:02:12 PM	Been wearing the patch for 2 days.  I stopped on the first day I applied it.  This is my second day and still no cravings.  Really think this is going to work.  Have to remove at night though for sleep reasons but reapply as soon as i wake.  Also I take Zanax so I'm sure that is a benefit for any sideaffects that may try to occur.  I reccoment this to anyone that is serious about quitting smoking.
Nicotine Addiction	dandiele, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	25-34	5/7/2012 7:42:36 PM	So far it has been working wonderful. Its amazing how you finally realize how nicotine has a hold on you once you start the patch. I found my self the first day going all day at work not even thinking of smoking were as before I'd come up with any reason to take a smoke break. Couldn't wait for a delivery so I could smoke. One thing I would tell EVERYONE is that the patch will stay effective for 48 hours. Do not let Glaxo smith Kline lie to you. I have been using the patches for 2 days since I started 2 weeks ago and have not had any redness or irritated skin. I do switch arms each patch. I have not noticed it wearing off at all. The price of these things I'm sure they don't want you to know its effective for 48+ hours. This is step 2 also. I started with step 2
Stop Smoking	Erin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/31/2012 2:07:22 PM	I smoked for 8 years and was able to quit in 1 week by wearing this patch.  I stayed smoke-free for 5 years and unfortunately started again 2 years ago.  I've made the decision to quit again and started using the generic wal-mart brand patch since it's cheaper but found that I still wanted, if not needed, to smoke.  I went back to Nicoderm and have had much better success so far.  Hopefully I'll be able to quit again and never need to use another patch.  I'd recommend Nicoderm to anyone ready to quit.  As others have mentioned, my skin also usually itches for a few minutes after putting on the patch, but it doesn't last long.  Sometimes I'll also get a cramp in the area, but that doesn't last more than a few minutes either.
Nicotine Addiction	I can breathe, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	1/6/2012 12:04:32 AM	I am a woman 63 years old.  I had been smoking for 43 years.  I wished I had never started. I had used the patch one other time and because of extreme stress I began smoking again. At that time in the first few days I really had a craving and took a couple of puffs off one and I got violently sick to my stomach! This time I have been smoke free for 5 1/2 weeks.  On a few occasions I really want one but I resist the urge.  I chew on a cinnamon stick.  I find one that is about the size of a cigarette. It feels like the paper on one. That gives me something to do with my hands. It really looks like I have a small cigar in my mouth but I don't care.  The side effects I have are the vivid dreams!  I could write a book on the wierd dreams I have but they are almost so wierd they're funny.  I also wake up several times a night with a dry mouth.  I keep a bottle of water beside my bed for that affect.  The program I'm on is supported by my insurance company and they call once a week to check on me.  I told them it was almost too easy.  The very worst part of quitting was making up my mind to do it. I have gained weight that I can add to the rest of what I need to lose but I'm not even going to get on a scale until I've kicked this habit for good.  One vise at a time!   I hope those who are thinking about quitting just make up their mind and do it.  Good luck to all of you.  I'm now a non-smoker!
Stop Smoking	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	11/6/2011 8:54:02 PM	This is the third time I used this porduct. I've smoked for 38 years. This time I have been without a cigarette for 57 days. It works for the nicotine habit but I still once and a while want a cigarette fot the time habit. The patch is great but evertime before I quit because I get a itchy rash at the site of the patch. This time I didn't care and stuck with it.
Nicotine Addiction	tvl85, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	25-34	10/26/2011 8:25:42 PM	I have used the patch several times to quit smoking and overcome my severe nicotine addiction. I think the difficult thing about this product is that is just takes the edge off. If you are hardcore addicted to smoking, sometimes even the highest dosage of nicotine isn't quite enough. If you aren't an avid smoker, this might be a good choice for you. Make sure that you do some sort of therapy to help with your addiction. I tried 3 different times with the patch, and all the times, I relapsed.
Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/8/2011 3:31:49 PM	I put the patch on full strength for 4 weeks and weaned down to final step and have now been quit for 3 months today.  This does work for the nicotine withdrawals but psychologically you have to try other things.  I was a smoker for 35 plus years and I am very excited about quitting.  Thanks Nicoderm CQ
Stop Smoking	SmokeFolk, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	4/7/2011 12:23:28 PM	I have tried quitting cold turkey, nicotine gum, gradually weaning off, and taking welbutrin. I was going to try hypnosis if the patch didn't work, but the idea of subliminal messages scares me, be it effective or not. Luckily the patch has provided amazing results. 4 weeks w/o a cig. Here are some bullet points from my experience so far:-constant nicotine(patch) is better for me, rather than emergency situation nicotine(gum) which can result in cravings so great it's almost too late-have oral fixation supplement: favorite hard candy, toothpick, throwaway toothbrush. (chupa chups are a spanish lollipop that has a plastic stem, so you can keep the stick in your mouth after you're done, and it doesn't get soggy like the paper sticks on other brands) It also works to substitute the habit, unwrapping the candy or toothbrush replaces the &quot;pulling out the pack and lighting up&quot; procedure.-Heard horror stories of someone falling asleep w/ patch and getting terribly sick. Does NOT apply, this is a 24 hr patch-Did get an occasional rash (who cares?), rotate patch location day to day. have 3-4 go-to areas of skin-stick patch where you don't bend, stretch, or sweat a lot (i.e. back, hip, upper arm)- you can shower and exercise w/ it, but its not fool-proof!-I have slight AD/HD. Best guess: I self-medicated with smokes using nicotine as a mood stabilizer and to improve focus. Trying to quit cold turkey was incredibly tough because this disorder enhanced the withdrawal symptoms. The patch offers better results as a mental crutch aside from the obvious health benefits. As a smoker, my nicotine levels went down significantly within an hour after a cigarette. Once an hour was up my brain would start hitting the panic button, as if on cue. Also the frequent breaks stopped progress on anything I was doing. Now I take breaks on my time and I still have nicotine in my system to prevent my skin from crawling.-No noticeable extra cash... I thought I'd be rolling in $$$! ;)
Stop Smoking	lorrfroh, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/25/2011 12:24:05 PM	I smoked for 45 years--1 pkg/day.  Using this product helped, but you must want to stop.  I stopped mainly to improve health and appearance.  Smoking made me feel stupid, and I consider myself pretty intelligent.  It isn't easy, but it can be done with this product, self-discipline and determination.

No such luck.This product gave me rashes hives and made me crave cigarettes just as much as always.I cut done for two day in 2+ years of using this awful product.  None of this companies products worked for me as a smoking cessation aid.What finally worked was an eGo kit from cignot.com!  ecigarettes rule!

Almost instantly I could feel my breathing improving.  My cough is gone.  No more wheezing.  I couldn't be happier with this product.

I stopped using it due to that fact, which is a shame.

I am on Day 32 and the real cravings have gone away. I started with Step 1 for four weeks and am now on Step 2.I plan to use the this dose for 2 weeks and go to Step 3 for 2 weeks. Fight through the initial cravings and you can do it.

Nicotine Addiction	Donna, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/1/2010 12:41:57 AM	I used this product two years ago with my husband and we had quit for six weeks, having used the product for only two weeks. My husband passed away suddenly, and I started smoking again.  January 10, 2010 I tried the patch again for two weeks and I am almost to three months without cigs.  The only problem I had when using the patch was very vivid dreams.  That happened the first time I used them also.  Otherwise, I am very happy to have quit smoking. 
Stop Smoking	George In Ontario, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	3/9/2010 10:49:10 AM	I have smoked for over 40 years and enjoyed it. Quitting due to potential health reasons/social pressure. Very hard to do. The patches are helping. I'm 5 weeks today without cigs.Symptoms of odd dreams and waking every few hours. Often light-headed. Benefits of cessation are overrated. Sense of smell, taste etc. not significantly improved. Put on 10 pounds. Spend more money now on snacks than cigs cost.Good luck to all trying. It is challenging.  
Stop Smoking	 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		3/5/2010 8:56:32 AM	quit smoking twice with this method.  I found that altering my behavior, along with the patch, has been most effective. Cut down on the alcohol, chewed gum after eating &amp; still took small breaks throughout the day - just with no cigs!
Stop Smoking	Nina159, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	3	1	Female	35-44	7/6/2009 3:43:58 PM	I only used product for about 3 days. I bought a 2wk supply and expected it to last 2wks. No such luck.  I live in AZ and it is very hot.  The patch would not stay on for more that a couple of hours at a time. Anything I did that caused me sweat(even walking to the mailbox) made the patch fall off as it does not breath so sweat builds up under it.  I tried using first aid tape to keep it on still no go.  It soon became clear that I paid for a 2wk supply that was not even going to last for 1wk since I had to replace the patch several times a day.  For the price I paid I might as well have bought a carton of cigs as at least I know that they would have lasted a full 2wks. I will say this that for the time I was able to wear the patch it did seem to work, but the effectiveness was incomplete because the patch did not stay on long enough to make a difference.  I have switch to another product (commit) and it seems to be working very well. 
Stop Smoking	amanda29, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	4/19/2009 4:57:35 AM	Using the patch has made my craving fewer and farther between. My biggest complaint is that I cann't sleep more than 4 to 5 hours at a time. I dont think I can take the patch off at night since my craving for a cig in the morning is the worst. I am only on day four but hopefully it will get better.
Nicotine Addiction	Tim, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/1/2009 4:30:14 PM	I had to go into the hospital 12-12-08 to have a procedure done and when they found out I smoked they just slapped a patch on. I was already planning in quitting so when I got out in a couple of days I just bought the Step 1 Nicoderm box and kept going. It's been 19 days and I really haven't had the urge to smoke. The first couple of days I found myself automatically reaching for a pack that wasn't there because smoking had become so automatic. I smoked for 39 years and I really thought this would be a lot harder.I feel better already (no morning coughing)and food tastes different. My house and vehicle smell better and I tell everyone I know I quit just to keep the pressure on myself so I don't fail. After this 21 day box is gone I'm going to step down to the 14 mg patches and see how that goes.

I have been 8 weeks non smoking now i have started having headaches the last few weeks that are persistant from dull and achy to migrain type.  I pulled the patch off and have been 12 hours without and realized that the headaches have eased and passed almost completely away. plus have had some pain in my arms from using the patch in the same area to often.  now have broke the habit now to go cold turkey on nicotine and finish becoming a non smoker.

Also at the beginning I was putting it on my upper arm and it irritated my skin leaving a patch of dry dark skin the shape of the patch on my arm and still hasn't gone away. I switched to my stomach and haven't had that problem anymore. I am going to see my pcp to check on the other symptoms though. Good luck to everyone who's trying to quit-Angela E., Oklahoma
Stop Smoking	Mike P., 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	5	1	Male	55-64	1/20/2008 2:59:09 PM	I applied the patch just prior to boarding a flight to Korea.  Approx 10 hours into the flight, I noticed my tongue was starting to swell.  Within an hour, I could barely swallow.  Fortunately, an English speaking doctor was aboard who administered an antihistamine (twice) which finally reduced the swelling of my tongue.  He told me afterwards that if the antihistamine did not work, a tracheotamy (?) would have been necessary, and at 35,000 feet, with the equipment available aboard an aircraft, my likelihood of surviving would have been very poor. I am trying to find out what ingredient in the patch I am allergic to, or should be tested for, but have been unsuccessful, so far.  It seems to be a very secretive society.If anyone has any ideas that would help, please post them.Mike, Timonium, MD USAIf anyone knows where such information
