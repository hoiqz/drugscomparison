I had two unusual symptoms that came one after about 3 months of implant. Were they due to Vantas? - I don't know but there seems to be some correlation. (1) I began to have medium-level bipolar disorder. For the first time in 50 years, I would start crying (with tears) over dumb things. It happened 3 or more times a week. I also began to lose control of my anger with minor disagreements. I would rapidly go balistic. I knew something was wrong, and I should run away, but I couldn't for a couple of minutes in which I managed to direct some hateful blows of vindictive. (2) I reacted strongly to a flu shot, with my are going numb and tingly for a full week. The effect was strong enough to interfere with sleep. It slowly disappeared, in all but my thumb which remained numb for a month. This was probably my 20th year with a flu shot, and it was the only reaction that I ever had.
