Nausea and Vomiting	TatorTot, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/14/2009 10:22:29 AM	I've been taking this for about a month now for nausea/vomiting. I have yet to get a diagnosis but my doctor told me to take this in the meantime. I've had no side effects at all.  This was truly a lifesaver. My nausea/vomiting is completely gone when I take 1 dose (10mg) of this once a day. I can now function like a normal person instead of living in fear of possibly vomiting in public or at work which I was doing before taking this medication. I guess I do have 1 side effect &amp; that is constipation but if you take Senna, you should be fine. I also do not know the difference between Edisylate &amp; Maleate for this medication so I'm documenting this comment under both. My prescription bottle just has the abbreviation of Prochlorper &amp; that's it. Otherwise, I would totally recommend this to people having the same issues as I was.

Its also very effective for nausea caused by the hydrocodone I take for the pain. The hardest thing is getting it down my throat but its very effective !

However, since being diagnosed with MS, this is NOT a good medicine to use for severe nausea. i am on Tysabri and Lyrica for the MS havin severe nausea as a side effect. I naturally turn to this medicine, it, unfortunately, makes it worse. I didn't see a category, so I thought I'd share a warning..
