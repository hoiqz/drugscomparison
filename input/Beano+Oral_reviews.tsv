Indigestion	Marion, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		9/8/2012 9:25:55 PM	 I have found it works very well. If I take 2 tablets when I eat beans I have no problem at all and they used to just tear me up. Also, I just had a gallbladder attack which left my whole digestive system messed up, anything I eat causes gas, and a Beano tablet with a meal helps a lot. 
Indigestion	LikesWebMD, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	8/18/2012 4:12:31 PM	Took Bean-o as directed to prevent gas several weeks ago. Thought it was all in my head when I felt sick to my stomach about an hour or so after taking it.  Took it again just today and had terrible stomach cramps, then began vomiting.  I will never take this medication again. The side effects are horrible.

Indigestion	Dean_Gartner, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	4	1	Male	45-54	8/5/2012 3:49:29 PM	I'm never going to use Beano again. I started taking it a couple of weeks ago. It's been moderately effective for reducing gas. But I've been feeling poorly for two weeks and assumed I had a lingering case of flu. But after reading Beano side effect comments here - dizziness, fatigue, stool issues - I realize Beano must be the culprit, not flu. Additionally, I'm gluten intolerant and only today learned that Beano contains wheat, a major source of gluten! So no wonder I've been feeling so poorly. Beano has been absolutely terrible for me. I was worried I might be seriously sick. This product is terrible for many people and should include detailed warnings!!!

Within an hour of taking this product, I was feeling uneasy. I tried to relax and put it off. Went out of town for the evening and stopped to get a bite to eat. Within 30 minutes I was violently vomiting and this is 24 hours later and it has not stopped yet!
Other	PrincessJen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	7/1/2012 11:22:34 PM	This is NOT good to take! I was taking it for several months and still had major gas. Also found out that it causes HYPOGLYCEMIA because it breaks down complex carbohydrates, which if you are an athlete like myself, is very BAD for you. I had to buy a glucose meter and started using it. I would eat 2 beano right before my meal, eat and check my blood sugar. It causes a veryfast, high spike when then results in a terrible drop. My blood sugar would drop below 60 within an hr of eating a high carb meal. Low blood sugar causes dizziness, confusion, fatigue, aggitation and coldness. It is a TERRIBLE feeling to have. I will NEVER take this again and I will BE reporting this to the FDA.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/2/2012 1:31:45 PM	Started taking it to control flatulence. It's been very effective. After 20+ years of frustration, embarrassment, etc., I seem to have found the cure. I'm a believer!
Other	Can You Hear Me Now?, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	3/31/2012 12:45:13 PM	I will never take this product again. I took Beano twice for the same cause. To prevent gas and abdominal bloating when I drink a whole-fruit smoothie. The very first time I took it, I swallowed two tablets BEFORE MY FIRST BITE OF FOOD and six (6) hours later, I had pit-of-the stomach nausea that made me leave work early for fear of vomiting at my work station. Second time taking it, about three weeks later, I chewed two tablets in compliance with the directions (Swallow or Chew 2-3 tablets BEFORE YOUR FIRST BITE OF FOOD). I waited about twenty minutes before I drank my Odwalla Smoothie in Mango Tango. Approximately seven (7) hours later, I became severely nauseated and no mint would abate the thick saliva that formed in my mouth; also, chewing gum made it worse. So, I had to be excused from my customer and my trainer and hurried to the ladies room. In the ladies room, as I was washing my hands (due to touching money), before I could flee the sink and go into a stall, I began to vomit vehemently all over the sink and floor.  
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	35-44	3/26/2012 2:17:14 PM	I have had success with this product when using it for before one meal.  When using it for an entire weekend, it stops gas AND bowel movements, which makes it worse than not using it at all.  For awhile I thought it was just coincidence, but it has happened enough times now to be pretty conclusive.

Indigestion	PAW, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	3	Female	45-54	11/29/2011 12:14:06 AM	I have had success in treating gas, bloating and even a reduction in acid reflux. However, my uterine fibroid's started bleeding so badly I was ready to go to the ER. I have never had them bleed like this before, it was like water running out of me. This happened after about 2 weeks of using the product daily 3 times a day. The bleeding has lasted for 5-15 minutes once or twice a day for 3 days.  It may not be the product causing it but I have stopped taking it and the bleeding seems to have stopped for now. I will wait for a week or so and try the product again and see if the same thing occurs. I hope it doesn't, I really liked the benefits of the product. I hope the bleeding doesn't happen again.

We are 2 weeks in and he is having severe stomach &quot;cramping&quot;, diarrhea and is vomiting after meals.  I'm so grateful that I've checked here because obviously, he is one who can not tolerate beano.  I have also checked on Gas-x.  I find no negative reviews.  I will take this information to the radiologist tomorrow.

Other	sharon, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/10/2011 7:21:56 PM	I took Beano a few times but didn't put the side effects I went through to be from taking Beano. Although I had upper abdominal pain and acid stomach, I just thought it was from air bubbles and that Beano just wasn't working. But the other day I took it again right before eating my lunch (12 PM)and with in 1 1/2 hours I started getting upper abdominal pain. I thought again that Beano just doesn't work. But the pain kept getting stronger and by 7 pm that night I had sever upper abdominal pain. So sever I almost had my husband bring me to the hospital. The only thing that stopped me from going is embarrassment thinking they would send me home because of gas pain. Then I started vomiting my guts out, had diarrhea , gas pain, and blotting.  My upper abdomen was in such pain, I still cant believe I went through that! I mean I am still recovering from the pain I went through from taking that product. Please do not take it my inner chest is still painful from vomiting so much and my stomach muscles feel like someone beat me up inside.

I started taking it for a timed 2-day exam, and it kept me peacefully and quietly seated for 12 hours! A life saver!

Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	3	1	Male	35-44	3/1/2011 9:14:46 AM	Beano did prevent stomach and gas pains, but I took one in the evening and when I woke up at 5am to use the restroom I feel like I was sea sick and thought I may have vertigo.  I then assumed I had a inner ear infection but then one month later I took another beano to prevent gas pains and once again woke up and was feeling motion sick.  Took some motion sick medication to get me through the day.

Other	Bluegroove, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	55-64	9/14/2010 6:58:32 PM	Works well for gas, but must be if the meal is very large or excessive, then it doesnt work as well. Also if there is already constipation, it seem to cause diarrea or gas because its trying to move through that blockage!(but that stuff needs to come out anyway - so bonus..) Works for me as long as I am not overeating. 2 with lunch, 3 with dinner.

My employees don't want to come in my office!BEANO WORKS FOR ME!!  For me it is MUCH MORE effective if I take ONE with food, one thirty minutes later, and with certain foods a third even later.  Taking two or three at once wasn't very effective.
