My first treatment I had MANY side effects, headache,aches and pains etc.  I read if Zometa is given over a 30 minute time span instead of 15 side effects are minimal. I don't know if it is coinsidence or my body got used to the drug but I don't have any side effects other than Fatique since changing to the 30 minute dosage.

The following ones have been with no side affects at all..  I am now in my 7th monthly infusion.  This last one made more tired for some reason.  I must say I am very pleased with the ease of use, and very satisfied.  As far as working, only time will tell.  I did not have pain until I broke a bone in my shoulder.  That is how the metasteses was discovered. Now have it also in sternum and in back ribs.  None of them ever caused my any pain until the shoulder break occurring from attempting to button my jeans...  That was the worst pain aside from giving birth! !... It took about 8 months to heal and very little pain when truing to reach up to high..

My only complaint seems to be with the fatigue factor since.  It seems to be pernicious and it is possible that is linked to some anemia issues.  Blood test results are going to be checked again in a few days to see if that is a contributing factor.

Sometimes after a treatment I have flu like sympstoms, sometimes I do not and even feel like I could run a marathon that afternoon after the treatment. I tolerate it well and think it has helped me immensely where other things have not. I would not be doing well without itl. If you want to write to me please feel free to.l

My doctor reduced the dose by half and I was able to tolerate the the side effects more easily. Again I had a fever and body aches but they lasted six hours. The following dose produced no side effects. My physician increased the dose to the full amount. I am tolerating the drug and I have much less pain in my neck. Basically, over time and with patience, this course of treatment seems to be helping.

I've been radiated in the hip and it worked thankfully.  However because its in the bones my Dr. strongly suggested taking Zometa to prevent possible fracture.  I just completed my 4th treatment and after the first one I only had some body aches for a couple days and then the next 2 treatments I had no side effects but the most recent treatment gave me some pain in my hands and feet-not too bad-I can still walk and exercise so I'm not complaining.  I just wanted to write because its seems every time I read a review of drugs I'm on, only the women who have horrible side effects report so I'm one of the more positive testimonies, thankfully-I'm sure there's more positive stories out there as well.

I was prescribed extra-strength Vicodin, which barely &quot;touches&quot; the pain.It is now 4 months later, and the pain has continued (in both shoulders, arms, and lower back).Just last week I was dx with adhesive capsulitis, as result of the Zometa.I tolerated the drug pre-transplant.  I have to wonder if others have suffered as I have as post-transplant Zometa users?

The side effects wewre terrrible including chills, fever, flu like symptoms for two days, pain in my hands, feet, and hips that so far have lasted for 10 days.  Dring this period I was unable to use my hands for about one day, unable to wear shoes for two days and I am still having difficulty walking after 10 days.  I wonder when the side effects will end.  In my opinion, this is an awful drug.  Any possible benefits are not worth the consequences.

I will definatly continue next year.My fracture is still causing pain.
