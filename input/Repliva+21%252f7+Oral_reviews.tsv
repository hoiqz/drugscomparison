Within the first week of being on it, I felt better than I had in two years.  I did not experience any side effects.  I finally had energy.  I felt like the &quot;old me&quot;.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/27/2010 4:32:14 AM	I went to the ER with a hemoglobin of 3.8 and had one pint transfused.  Someone told me about Repliva 21/7 so I requested a prescription.  By April, my hemoglobin was 13.6.  As soon as I stopped taking it, my blood started dropping again (I have crohn's disease).  The next time I received a generic.  It did not seem  to be as effective and it is much harder on my system.  Repliva 21/7 did not bother me anywhere as much as the name brand.  Since then, they seem to give me a new generic each time and each time it seems harder to take.  The pharmacist tells me he can't get the name brand.  Insurance didn't cover Repliva so I paid cash for it.  They cover the generic but I'd rather pay for it if I could get the real thing.

None worked! Now, I am 35years old with the same problem. I went back to the doctor because I couldn't take it anymore. I was so tired all the time. The doctor gave me Repliva. I worked great. Now I am sad because they don't have the medication. It has a recall.

I tried to stop couple of times, but I went tofeeling bad again. Repliva was originally prescribed by my OBGYN. After my family doctor told me I had to be admitted to the hospital for blood transfusion. My hemoglobin was 7.??Well after I took this medication, it went up to 11.0. Which is huge difference. I absolutely love the fact that it does not have any side effects on me. Recently the pharmacy gave me a generic name. and told me that the manufacture did not make any money, and they closed down. Let me tell you it is not the same at all. I am feeling bad again. As matter of fact worst. My fingers are numb always. I have difficulties everyday. They feel like piece of wood. and its real painful. I wish they bring Repliva Again. It was super.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	7/13/2009 12:07:46 PM	I've been on the repliva for about 2 months my iron level has increased from 9 to 11.8. Although I take it at night I've had some severe stomach cramps and diarreah some mornings. But as compared to most iron replacements I have tried these side effects are minimal and not unbearable.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	earthwitch68, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	4/9/2009 12:11:33 PM	My OBGYN gave me samples of this medication as it was discovered that I am anemic.  I don't experience any side effects - but I have not noticed an increase in energy as I was hoping to and I have had a very poor appetite as well.  After reading the other comments I was surprised that this medication was recalled.  I have another appt with dr today to see if she is aware.

I started it two years ago after having duodenal switch surgery and I have had no anemia complications.  I take it at bedtime, on an empty stomach.  If I have any alcohol, I wait an hour before taking it.  I have noticed the darker stools, but that happens with any iron supplementation, so I'm not alarmed or upset by that.  With the recall, I had to be off it for three weeks and I really noticed the difference in my energy level. I found one pack left at a pharmacy, and despite the recall, I'm back on it and I feel my old self.  That should say something - that I'm more afraid of not being on it than a recall!  I hope the manufacturer gets their act together SOON and either sells the patent or starts manufacturing it again.

I was given this because my body was litterallyrejecting nurishment, losing over 60 pd 1yr.I wheigh 86 pd. Problem is the stomach cramps are so severe I can't straighten out of fetal postion. I have to RUN to bathroom &amp; pray I make it! I'm so hungry all the timeI am literally sick no matter how much I eat or how often, which is constantly and as much as I can shove in my mouth at a time! They are so big they get caught going down and hurt severly till either they do go or dessolve.  My problem is I HAVE TO take them because my illness is killing me. If I don't do this as part of medicine I could be dead in 2 years.  So what do you do?  The only other option is IV iron and I get enough of those. I am hoping that symtoms go away and things work out. I really don't have any other choice for recovery. The other problem is I can't leavemy house because of needing the bathroom constantly, anything I eat or drink does not stay for more than 15 min if lucky. Imodiom ad DOSE NOT help! I am hoping since I have ben on them almost 2 months it will soon calm down.

My blood count is just under normal right now, 11.5, but my iron stays at a 4.  My hematologist put me on repliva last month and I hate it!  It makes me dizzy, loss of appetite, stomach pain and tired.  I was not concerned with the bathroom issues since they were expected, but the side effects don't make sense.  Iron is susposto make you have more energy, not less.  I have taken the medication in the morning and at night.  Night is better, but I still feel tired during the day and I colapse by 9:00 pm, after only being awake 13 hours.  Since this is susposto be just vitamins and minerals, dizziness and tiredness doesn't make sense.  The stomach pain and nausea is to be expected.

I decided to look it up because it's my second day on the med. and I woke up with the worse vertigo (dizzy), the entire room was spinning.  Maybe it causes indigestion because sometimes indigestion gives me vertigo.  I'll keep taking it.  I'll keep you posted.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/20/2009 4:07:29 PM	I have been off and on this drug for the past year and a half.  I have never had a problem with any side effects.  My doctor prefers me to be on for 3 months then off.  I can tell when my hemoglobin levels drop.  I usually feel better again within 7-10 days after starting this again.  I have been anemic since I was 16 and nothing else has ever worked this well.  My levels were below 8 before I started and now they are back up to 12.  Aside from the expense, I think it is great!

I am in my fourth month of Repliva therapy and can assertain no appreciable benefit.  I had gastric bypas (Roux-en-Y) 08/2006 and have a slight anemia since.  My biggest complaint is the ridiculous packaging!  I'm an adult and can take a pill out of a bottle when I'm suppose too.  I'll give it a longer chance but I am sceptical...

I have a lot of energy and feel great. one thing I do not like about this medication is that, it increases your appetite. Unfortunately, I have gained 23 pounds since stating the medication 8 months ago.

The pain usually hits me a few minutes after taking it in the morning. It's unbearable and leaves me feeling like Im about to pass out. Im going to contact my dr in the morning about it. I see other comments that others started taking it at bedtime, so Im going to do the same and see if it will help.

Supposed to take on an empty stomach? Not real directions on the package to address these issues.I'll take it at night as some suggested.  It's not a pleasant medication.

I thought I'd sleep thru any side effects and get the best results because it would have 8 hours without food in the stomach to work. Then  I woke up 2 times with pain and feeling like there was a ball of fire in my stomach.  I now take it in the morning with food and have not had that problem again.  I feel much better.  Blood work next week will tell the real story.

I was diagnosed as being anemic after surgery. I feel much better and on day 26 of the pack.
