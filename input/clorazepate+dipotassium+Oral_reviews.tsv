I take one in the morning and one before bedtime. It removes the uncomfortable symptoms without putting my head in a fog or any noticable other symptoms. I do wish, though, that it would help with temors in my hands when I'm nervous. Doesn't really help that much.
Anxious	Pop, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	6/4/2011 7:50:21 PM	I have been taking cloraz-dipot (3.75mg)tabs since the '70s. I began taking it because the daily trek to work in the morning used to make me practically psychotic. I am now retired but still continue to take it for a general feeling of well-being!

Anxious	30 years and counting, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/2/2010 2:57:21 PM	the best drug for me.  it has calmed me down, relaxed me, taken the edge off anxiousness, helped me sleep, helped me cope with every situation.  have been on this 7.5 mg for approx 30 years.... it's been around for a long time and i think i will always take it.  cant imagine life without it, it has been my lifesaver - a better choice than anti depressents - i have tried other &quot;relaxer/drugs&quot; dont work, always need and want clorazepate

I take it two times a day and don't have the violent spinning episodes that I used to have.  I have been on it for over a year and could not function without it.  Recently, I went to one pill a day and within 5 days, I was back to being dizzy.  I must stay on this medication in order to function as a normal human being.  Without it, I have violent spinning, nausea, hearing loss, and can't walk.  It has made a major difference in my life!!

Anxious	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	3/24/2009 10:21:27 AM	I am 65, was diagnosed with Agoraphobia in the 70s, and not much was known about Anxiety Attacks. I suffered with it, AND IBS,and was house bound for a time.Finally a doctor understood in 2007, and prescribed Clorazapate. We worked with adjusting the dose, and now I take 2 a day of 3.75. I can take an extra for stressful social events. I love it and to me it is a miracle! I feel &quot;normal&quot; for the first time in years.

Epileptic Seizure	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/28/2008 12:47:48 AM	I have epilepsy as a result of an arterio venous malformation that ruprured at age 19 (I'm now 44) and have taken this med ever since for what has been described as 'breakthrough seizures' or panic attacks. I've also been on a host of other meds as primary seizure control AED's (Anti Epileptic Drugs) and have found this to be extremely effective in easing the flushing, sweating, nervous, anxiety, dizziness that occasionally 'breaks through'. Deep breathing and controlled mental discipline along with a walk around the block frequently also help me overcome these 'episodes'. Basically, the key is to realize that they will go away - once you convince yourself of that: take the pill ( I take 3.75mg at 240lb male) and try to get my mind on anything else and within an hour they're gone.  
Anxious	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	10/17/2008 9:49:03 AM	I have taken this on and off since 2000. I never just stop taking it I go off it slowly &amp; start it again as needed usually after consulting my MD. To avoid the side affects I take it at bed time and sleep through them.
Anxious	Shadow, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	8/12/2008 3:01:43 PM	Not a daily user. Just use when I feel an anxiety attack coming on. Makes me feel relaxed. But if I've taken it for a few days, I start to feel a little dizzy-especially at night.
Anxious	Hinder_Chick, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	7/28/2008 2:07:44 AM	I haven't been on this medication too long, but the time I have been it has worked pretty well.... BUT I am VERY afraid of becoming addicted to it after reading some of the comments left on it. And also I was sun sensitivity as a sun side effect, but ever since I have been on it I burn like crazy and I use to react so well to the sun. I am wondering if the medication is right for me.
Other	CindyM, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	7/4/2008 8:10:58 AM	I took this medication the first time after my first back surgery, as a muscle relaxer. I soon realized it worked pretty well on my fibromyalgia symtoms, plus anxiety. I've been taking it 3 years and I am afraid it is becoming a little less effective, but I have not found one better for tight, painful muscles, plus the added bonus I stay more relaxed, thus, less anxiety.

After being on this medication for 6 years. I am horrified of running out of the medication. If I am even 2 to 3 hours late I slowly begin to have anxiety attacks and slight hallucinations. If you take this drug or any benzodiazapine -TRY not to take it long term. Biggest mistake of my life. I had a much easier time coming off heroin and morphine. My doctor said it may take 2 years to come off this med.
