Atrial Fibrillation	TorontoAFIBguy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	7/27/2012 3:04:05 PM	Persistent or permanent aFibber for 2-5 years until diagnosed! First ECV ineffective (quack cardiologist did not know what he was doing). Changed to top rated cardio/EP in top rated hospital. My left atrium had enlarged and was not candidate for ablation. Plan is to take Tikosyn for as long as it takes for my LA to shrink to normal; then ablation(s) as required and Tikosyn as required. Three days in hospital for Tik uptake and required ECV to put me into NSR. Have been in NSR since Dec 2011 99.99% or have simply had skipped beats when my Potassium has gone low. Drink lots of Low Sodium V8 and supplement 2g Potassium daily. Avoid caffeine, MSG, salt, etc. and feel pretty good since December but noticing side effects as of late (mild nausea in mornings, erratic sleep, anxiety, etc.). Overall am a happy camper and hope Tik keeps working for me. It is not for everyone but if you tolerate it and any side effects it is A1. Watch for drug interactions and for supply shortages! Take exactly EXACTLY as directed (I have an alarm set for 10AM and 10PM). Avoid trigger foods.

Atrial Fibrillation	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	4/3/2012 3:59:04 AM	Been on Tikosyn 26+ months with one AF after 19 months (had cardioversion and resumed Tikosyn). No noticeable side affects but am borderline with long QT. WARNING!! YOU must check for interactions with any other prescribed drugs: I had two drugs separately prescribed by a GP and then a Cardiologist that could both have resulted in death even though they were advised in writing and discussed with both doctors and the pharmacists! Check every prescribed drug yourself for interactions!!!! Trust no one. Wonder drug for me.

Stayed that way for 6 months and finally gave up on it.  At least there were no side effects.  Moving on to other measures.

On Monday 5 minutes before the cardio-version was to take place I went into normal sinus rythum.  Take that Nurse Rachet!  I had been in A-fib for almost a year after Rythmol stopped working after 7 years and Multaq failed.  I don't know how long this will work but it is sure as hell better than doing surgery first.

Hardly ever go into atrial fib. (once or twice a year now) and it doesn't last long (a few minutes).  No side effects that I notice.  It is now easy to get via local pharmacy, at first it was very difficult to get.  I would recommend this drug if your doctor suggests it.  I have an implanted pacemaker/defib and it has not gone off at all.

Atrial Fibrillation	florida granny, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/7/2010 11:58:05 PM	I started using tikosyn about 2 months ago for afib that was occuring at least 2x per day. Since I've started, I've not had one episode and my cardiologist has taken me off the 5 other heart meds and coumadin that I was on. I feel 100% better and for the first time in many years am able to function with some energy. My appetite is back, my thoughts are clearer, and I am hopeful that this will continue to improve my quality of life. It is very expensive for me but well worth it. I had a hard time finding a pharmacy who could fill it, but finally Walgreens could and I need to fill it earlier than usual to allow them time to get it in.

I have an enlarged heart and was cardioverted 3 times since March 09 being in the hospital 7 times, and since I started taking Tikosyn I have not been back in Afib once.  I do have a defribulator/pacemaker combo and it does show I have not been in Afib since July!

I couldn't deal with the side effects and went to many different physicians and one told me that I had 3 options: deal with it (couldn't), surgery (didn't want it) or tikosyn; I still have a few episodes of a-fib of short duration on a monthly basis but the quality of my life is so much better; my concern is long term success &amp; potential negative side effects,

I went back into aFib after having a cardio ablation and managed to stay out of Afib for 6 months but unfortunately went back into AFib.  Cardio versions could not get me back to normal rythum but after 18 hours and 2 doses of Tykosyn I was back in norm aql rythum.  The drug was easy to takle without any side effects.

In march they told me to &quot;push It&quot; I did and got de-fibed hard. In August I wasn't even doing any thing, went into v-tach, go full defib 3 times, it didn't work, but I came out of the V-Tach. Cardiologist decided on Tikosyn, 500 mcg 2 x a day, in hospital for 3 days, then he put me out for about 20 minutes, reversed the polarity on my defibrilator leads. Won't know if Tikosyn is working until of if I go into V-Tach again. Side effects have been extreme exhaustion, low blood pressure. Reduced it to 250 mcg 2 x daily, feel better, but if I do much, all my joint ache and burn. They tell me this is not a side effect??? I am a 59 yr old woman.

Continued with 500 MCG (micrograms.) One lady here reported 250 to 375 MG (milligrams?) In Sept 09 I had an ablation. Still AF most of the time. Also, heart rate was 0 (for up to 4 seconds from time to time) to 165. On Sept 14, 09, I received a pacemaker to keep pulse above 60 bps. Then added metoprolol twice a day and diltiazem 4 times a day to lower my pulse. I do get some short periods of sinus rhythm which doctors say may be the result of the healing of the heart after the burning of the ablation. Another ablation may be in order.

After 2 ineffective catheter ablations (1 with robotics), I was started on Tikosyn in 12/08.  I converted permanently after 2nd dose.  I take 0.5mg twice a day.  No side effects except I am now energetic and able to exercise and am losing weight.  Neither Sams nor Walgreens stocks it, so you may have to wait a few days.  Be sure you bring home enough from the hospital.  All in all it's an A+++ for me.

Atrial Fibrillation	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	65-74	5/4/2009 10:43:44 PM	I find this medication to be hard to get. I live in a small town where no one can prescribe it, so I must get help from a larger city nearby, (where my EP is).After initial headaches etc, I tolerate it well.

Prevention of Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation	durtro060, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	5	Male	65-74	11/14/2008 11:18:11 AM	After years of using Amiodarone, which induced in me a thyroid problem (which is a nightmare to deal with) I finally got off that drug and tried to manage my AFib with electrical cardioversions as needed. After 3 zappings were needed in fairly quick succession earlier this year,we decided to try me on Tikosyn, and so far (6 weeks later) the results have been very satisfactory. My heartbeat feels solider than it has in ages, and that is reassuring and worth a lot! The only negatives I experience are very occasional 5 second bursts of rapid heartbeat, and the requirement to take the Tikosyn on a strict every 12 hours timetable.  This is hard for me as I travel a lot to different Time Zones. As an alternative to Amiodarone, I feel much happier using Tikosyn, because it does not have the long list of damaging side effects that Amiodarone does - reading those I wonder why it is still the drug of choice to treat Atrial Fibrillation.

My only complaint is similar to one above: the supply from the manufacturer is spotty and unreliable.  The drug itself is a Godsend in my opinion - virtually all meds tried prior to Tikosyn had no effect whatsoever for me.

Atrial Fibrillation	Sis, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	9/19/2008 4:11:50 PM	I have not experienced any further symptoms of AF since starting Tikosyn.What I have experienced is difficulty getting certain other medical procedures completed because of the medication interaction problems. Dental procedures requiring local anesthetics are not possible since I can not use any of the &quot;cains&quot;. Treatments for skin problems that might have steroids in them can not be used as steroids can cause an adverse reaction with Tikosyn. Since I'm so new to using this drug I expect it will take a while to learn how to get Medical procedures done without the use of typically used medications. I will be in contact with the manufacturer as will be my Pharmacist and Cardiologist to determine the proper course of action to take regarding the rest of my health care needs.

Tikosyn has shown absolutely no effect to date.  The main problem is a 200 mile round trip to have an EKG and blood work.  It seems to me most doctors are afraid of tikysin and those that aren't are aloof.  Don't take this drug.  I went from hypothyroidism to hyperthyroidism.  My thyroid number went to 34 and now my kidney has given me problems.

She can't get anymore of it. Now she has to go back to get changed to something else. If you are considering using this, don't. It is not available and the places that have it won't give it to patients who are just starting.
