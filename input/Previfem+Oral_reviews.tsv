Birth Control	lmpups, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	9/27/2012 9:43:21 AM	I was switched to Previfem from Sprintec and I noticed that my breasts are more tender and I have a lot more spotting between periods.  Sex also seems to be more painful.  I didn't experience any of this with Sprintec.  I'm glad to be going off BC all together soon.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/9/2012 9:59:36 AM	This was my first birth control at a very low dose and I have had no side effects what so ever-which is Good (except I was lookingf forward to my breasts getting a bit bigger). It has been a year now and I have noticed I do still get the normal side effects of my period- slight cramping and slight breast tenderness. I am very dry during sex- but the only thing I have to compare it to is not being on any bc- so it might be the same with other brands- its not worth it to mess with a good thing so lots of lube it is!

I Have been on Previfem for over 2 months and have been experiencing major mood swings due to high hormones in the pill. Depression has worsened and breast tenderness has increased constantly. i do not recomened using this pill. as of tomorrow ill be off of it.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	6/6/2012 4:03:45 PM	I was previously on Sprintec (another generic) with no problems, my insurance company switched me to Previfem. The side effects have been extremely disruptive. In addition to serious mood swings around the time of my period, my sex drive has markedly decreased and sex is extremely painful.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	AuriannahRyalynnsMommy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	4/11/2012 12:46:31 AM	I started taking this birth control after giving birth to my daughter after a 3 year battle with P.C.O.S (Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrom/) It is easy to take and has worked well with leveling out my cycles, but has made me an emotional wreck and on top of that I have NEVER had acne and I have BAD acne my last week of blue pills. I would recommend this pill to someone that has a missing period to level out your cycle, but that is all.

Acne	lucky, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	11/18/2011 11:47:00 AM	I gave my low rating because I went from Sprintec to this and to be honest, I didnt care for this at all, I feel like I completely lost my sex drive using this pill and I still broke out. I know everyone's body is different and my body just didnt agree with Previfem...
Birth Control	fivl3i, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	9/21/2011 2:27:40 PM	This birth control NEVER made me have a normal period.  If I took my placebo pill to actually have my period on a Sunday, I MIGHT get it on a Thursday. Other birth controls, I would have gotten it on Monday night, maybe Tuesday morning. When I would get my period, they wouldn't last, which made me worry that I could be pregnant.  The worst thing, Quilitest (The Pharmaceutical company in charge of making this birth control) has recalled it &quot;because of a packaging error that could lead to incorrect dosing and unintended pregnancies.&quot; You might want to check to see if your serial number and expiration date are on here: http://www.qualitestrx.com/pdf/OCRecall.pdf

Everything was great until two months ago when I started spotting a week prior to taking the white pills.  The next month was great again.  Month 6 I spotted a week prior again &amp; began my period 2-3 days early.  I'm going to look for an alternate pill to take so I won't have to worry about bleeding when I'm not supposed to.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/24/2011 4:23:21 AM	I'm still on my first month of Previfem, so I haven't had much exposure yet. I had a prescription for Sprintec but CVS send me home with this instead... I was previously on Yaz which turned me into an emotional train wreck my second month, as well as Lo-estrin which made my cramps unbearable and ruined my sex drive. So far, the only effects have been a rapid expansion of boobs. (None of my bras are wanting to fit - and it's not just weight gain because my pants are on the loose side!) And along with that growth, I've been having extreme tenderness in those suckers. Going to stick it out through three months to see how, or if, my body will tolerate this pill. (Crossing my fingers, this is my 5th attempt at finding the &quot;right&quot; birth control for my body.)
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	2/27/2011 9:43:45 AM	I was on another birth control before (Levora) and it worked pretty well, but I decided to go off of it for a while and then try another kind.  So I went on Previfem after about 4 months.  I have only been on it for 2 weeks and I know it takes a while for medications to fully develop in your system, but I have started having side effects.  I am on a depression medication as well and recently I have been feeling increased sadness and very increased loss of interest in everything!  I have also been having stomach/ingestion issues.  Levora worked a lot better for me personally.
