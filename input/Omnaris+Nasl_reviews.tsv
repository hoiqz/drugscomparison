Non-Seasonal Allergic Runny Nose	jennifer_33, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	8/2/2012 10:29:08 AM	This is the first medicated nasal spray that I've tried. My &quot;allergy&quot; symptoms went away after the first use, but unfortunately it gives me THE WORST headache I've ever had. I can't even turn my neck, it's awful. It's also causing my period even though I've been on birth control pills for years and it's not my time. It's great that it works so well, but I can't take the headache pain. No amount of Advil will take the pain away.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	LilyTortie, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	6/4/2012 11:29:57 PM	Omnaris worked wonderfully for me. But unfortunately, I am not on this medication now. I had tried several other prescription nasal sprays and other types of medications for my seasonal and year-round allergies- none worked. I have sinus problems, nasal congestion, congestion and itching in my ears and eustachian tubes. I have had ear infections and severe sinus infections. A few years ago, my doctor prescribed Omnaris. All of these symptoms stopped after I started using it. I can't remember exactly, but I think I did have headaches for the first several days, but they subsided after that. I've had headaches from other drugs that were much worse. I can't remember any other side effects. But after several months, my insurance stopped covering it. My new insurance won't cover it either. I would pay for it myself, but it is really expensive. In the long run, my insurance could end up paying more for sinus cat scans, antibiotics, and allergy meds that don't work, etc. than they would have just paid for the Omnaris.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	5/28/2012 8:05:30 AM	Went for annual eye exam.  I was told that I had borderline glaucoma in left eye. I have never been told this, but noticed that it was a possible side effect of this medication. I don't know how common this is but I'll probably stop using it until my next eye check in August and see what happens.
Seasonal Runny Nose	red, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	5/27/2012 6:29:55 PM	Terrible reaction.  Couldn't breath, tongue felt fat, lips numb, felt like I was fading out, very very thirsty.  I only used it for days.

I finally went to see an allergist who recommended Omnaris. I was hesitant because standard nosesprays give me chronic nosebleeds. He gave me a 3 week sample and encouraged me to just try it. Best 3 weeks of my life! After two days I had completely stopped sneezing, my congestion was minimal and the constant sinus drainage had cecased. After a week of using the spray, it was like I didn't have allergies anymore. The only side-effect I experienced was an ear infection about 2 weeks after starting the spray. But that could have been my inexperience using nosesprays because it cleared up quickly and I haven't had an issue since. It is a painfully expensive prescription but, when factored out, it costs about as much as I spend on pills throughout the summer and works a thousand times better than those pills ever have.
Other	Matt PSU, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	25-34	3/14/2012 1:11:53 PM	This is the ONLY thing that has helped my non-allergic rhinitis induced sinus headaches.  I tried other sprays, but they caused a horrible sore throat.   I've used it for 3 years now and am somewhat dependent on it.  It makes my headaches go away and stays in the spot it's supposed to.Now, I find that the manufacturer (takeda- nycomed) is in some sort of blood fued with the marketing/distributor Sunovion, and they have stopped manufacturing!!! All we got was a letter saying they will not take new scripts or even back fill until they get their problems straightened out.  Supposedly there was a bad batch that got out in the field but that's only part of the story.  What am I supposed to do, go to Canada?  It is a disgrace that these two companies let this happen!

He suffers from allergies to trees, grass, cats, weeds, etc.  We tried Nasonex which took us only about 2 seconds to stop after he started screaming and his entire nose turned red and was warm to the touch.  Doctor said he had never heard of anyone allergic to Nasonex.  Hmmm!  His new Allergy Doctor (we moved) prescribed Omnaris and it has done nothing but relieve all his symptoms.  We will stay with this as long as we can.  Our son also takes Singular and Zyrtex everyday in addition to his Omnaris.

Omnaris was the only medicine that cleared the infection.  Also, I have suffered from headaches and migraines all my life, Omnaris has lessen my headaches/migraines, and I no longer have to take daily allergy medication for seasonal allergies.  I highly recommend Omnaris.

I have had almost a daily headached for the last 7 months.  Also a pretty consistent earache.  I primarily have a severe cough due to allergies-no sinus issues.  I still have the cough although not as severe.  Why do none of these allergy meds address cough??  I sound like I have croup.    headaches if continue will try to discontinue Omnaris to see if they subside.

I still have some sneezing and some runny nose episodes but i can breathe and be outside and enjoy the fall weather when ragweed allergies usually keep me inside.  I have been using it for about 12 weeks and like the relief so far.

I used to have debilitating migraine headaches but have not had a severe one in decades.  I still have a very mild migraine once or twice a year but they are not severe - more of a nuisance than anything else - and I just keep on doing whatever I was doing.  I am lucky.I have not used Omnaris long enough to tell if it would have done me any good, but my stuffy nose is more of a nuisance as well, so I wont try Omnaris again.  
Seasonal Runny Nose	S Hoving, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	6/29/2011 4:20:42 PM	I have always been nervous about nose sprays, it's just not a great feeling.  This allergy season, I am willing to try anything!  I used it for the first time on a completely stuffed nose and it seemed to clear up in a matter of a few hours.  I did get an immediate headache and sore throat, like the muscles in my throat were strained and now I have been hoarse for 2 days straight.  It is now Wed and I have not had a dose since Monday. Not sure if I should retry it.  I am still straining to speak.  Any feedback on this reaction?  My doctor says keep taking it, but not speaking effects my job!

I couldn't take it after that, I took 6 (a medical dose) regular advils and couldn't kick the headache. I lost a day of my life because of this stuff.

I had migraines for 10 straight days before I went to my chiropracter and discussed what could be causing them. He suggested I stop the Omnaris for three or four days and see if it helped. Within 48 hours, my migraines ceased completely. Although I liked the fact that my nose didn't bleed with Omnaris (unlike all the other nasal sprays I have been on), the migraines were a worse side effect than the chronic sinus congestion.

My nose was blocked for a couple of hours; nevertheless  I continued to use it only to get a sore throat. I took several days off from using it. Once the sore throat subsided I began using it again and I've had nothing but wonderful results. I am used to having nasal blockage,running nose and sneezing 24/7 365 but now both nasal passages are clear, no running nose and very minimal sneezing when I first wake up in the morning. Overall I am very happy and will continue to use this Omnarius.

I started this product today and received INSTANT relief. It is now 9 hours later, no side effects, clear nasal passages, and less of a tendency to hyperventilate (breathing through my mouth since I could not breathe through my nose). So far, so good.

Omnaris first gave me terrible headaches upon initiall use. Stopped using it, I then began nasal irrigation with the Neti Pot! Started to decongest somewhat. retried Omnaris and it seems to be working better sine the Neti pot. The onlt reason I gave it 4 stars, is because i've only been on it for a week. No side effects now. Hope it keeps working. I highly rec. 
Non-Seasonal Allergic Runny Nose	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/9/2010 7:25:06 AM	I'm one of those people who has tried every nasal steroid under the sun for relief from my constant running nose, plugged up ears, and cough.  My doctor told me Omnaris will burn your nose at first, which she said was a good thing, and then eventually you'll feel it burning through your sinus cavities.  I never experienced this feeling after the initial burn.  I've been using Omnaris for about 2 months and have received zero symptom relief from it.  So my quest continues....For yourselves I'd really inquire with your doctor how Omnaris differs from all the other nasal steroids out there, if anything because this is a Tier III drug at the moment.

With very little improvement from these medications I turned to over the counter nasal sprays which totally gave me bad rebound effects!  Finally another ENT doctor prescribed me Omnaris and I thought I might as well try it since my headaches and stuffiness was never ending.  Within the first doses I felt immediate relief!  I had no adverse reactions and have been living faithfully with Omnaris.  It's a bit costly but it's worth every cent.  I recommend anyone to give this a try if you've been experiencing allergies.  I no longer am insecure speaking out loud to people where as in the past, my stuffiness affected my pronunciation of words.  Thank you Omnaris.

None ever really worked. My biggest problem is nasal congestion, and I kept reverting to Afrin (which is WORSE THAN BAD!) I got relief almost immediately after starting Omnaris.

One nostril was so swollen that I had trouble getting the spray tip in, and as I used the drug, the swelling went down.  When I went for my follow-up the doctor said things looked better; my ear was not completely relieved but I can tell a difference and he said it looked better.  Very effective drug.

How do you spray a medication into your nasal passages without spraying it onto your septum? That is ridiculous, and impossible. I have tried every Rx and natural sinus spray, this is one i will not be trying. People who make incoherent statements about their products are not to be trusted. Don't  spray the sinus medication onto your septum. These people are nuts. Beware. $65 is a ripoff. You can get generic for the most effective nasal corticosteroid, Nasonex, for $25 from overseas pharmacies.

The doctor scoped my upper airways and thought I would need suregery to unclog my nose. He first wanted to go the less invasive route and try Omnaris. In about 3 days my nose was clear for the first time in months. I use Omnaris and take a Claritin or Zyrtec once a day. My eyes have not itched and my nose hasn't been congested since using omnaris for the last 2 months. My allergies used to be so bad that I couldn't even open my eyes. All that is gone now as long as I treat it. I went one day without it and I could feel my allergies coming on again but 2 sprays in each nostril and a Claritin took care of that real quick.

Could not tolerate the burning and stinging sensation.  Hated the smell as well.  Was then given generic Flonase most recently and noticed it was worse than original Flonase.  Nasonex just gave me headaches but did seem to work better.  Then my doctor gave me Omnaris.  Said it was newer but same class as others I tried.  Don't know why but it seemed to work better and I had zero side effects.  I will be refilling Omnaris from here on out.
