About once a year, usually around winter, I have a pinched nerve/bursitus flareup in my hip.  This year has been horrible.  A toredol injection at the doctor's office is the way to go.  Got one today, after trying to deal with my hip pain for almost two months.  I am feeling better already.

Anyway, my back really flairs up at times, and my regular pain meds weren't helping.  I went to a walk-in &amp; rec'd 60mg of this.  I didn't feel any pain from the shot, nor any burning or itching like some people have repoted.  By the time I was pulling out of the Dr's office, I could already feel my back and muscles starting to relax.  The severe spams I had been having stopped. No side effects at all, Thank the Lord..........  Didn't last long enough...Only about 24 hours....Would be willing to try it again...

I works pretty good but it over time leaves me sick and groggy feeling and I thought that it wasn't supposed to do that. Then again some people are more sensitive to certain drugs than others are. The main thing is that it gets rid of my headaches because without it I would be completely unable to deal with these headaches and get back to my normal life.

I had a severe migraine over the weekend and went to ER asked for this and they acted a little odd but gave me the injection and I went home went to bed and woke up with a slight hollow feeling a little linger of headache but soon felt better!  This definately works for me as I was in so much pain I could only hold my head and cry with I am sure made the pain worse.

Acute Pain Following an Operation	sparetaco, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	9/29/2009 11:43:52 PM	Was given Toradol for post Coloectomy and illostomy surgery.  Was given for 5 day on 6hr intervals.  I did not experience the narcotic effects of morphine, and provided steady predictable results while used.  The Morphine I was given upon request at any time, only seemed to cause nightmares, and lower pain thresholds, and withdraws.  Toradol over the 5 day period was consistant and effective. I was glad it was perscribed by my surgeon and given regularly on schedule.

Toradol has always helped for the more mild pain and as a good sub for narcotics. I don't like having to give myself the shots, but it's worth it compared to having to go to the hospital or doctors office.

After a fall, I was given an injection of toradol, and it was by far more helpful than the handful of narcotics I usually take. The only drawback, the short length of time it can be taken. For me, and my situation, it was a miracle drug.

However, I noticed pain in my hip on the side of the injection.  The second shot I took on the other side of my muscles caused the same hip pain.

Pain	Granna, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/29/2008 2:41:46 PM	I suffer terribly from fibromyalgia and arthritis. The pain had become so severe without letup for so many months that it got to the point I asked God to just let me die so I could finally have some relief. I tried almost every pain med and for the most part I either slept through life or it worked about as well as a sugar pill. My doctor suggested a Toradol shot several times and I finally gave in as a last resort (I hate needles!). I was SO glad I did!  It was the best decision I have made with regard to pain management. Before I had even left the doctor's offie I was already feeling some relief...and by the time I got home I felt like I had been given my life back! For the first time in a couple of years I had found relief from the pain.  I slept like a baby last night for the first time in years.  I wish I had been willing to try Toradol sooner! It may not work for some, but it has been a godsend to me. Now my prayers are asking God to please let me live...and thanking him for Toradol.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	7/20/2008 6:43:32 PM	I went to the ER with Abdominal pain and bad dehydration. The nurse asked me if I was allergic to any meds and I gave her the rundown on all my allergies. She didnt think I would have an issue with the Toradol Injection. I ended up having a severe allergic reaction to it so they gave me Benedryl and Ativan and a breathing treatment. Then they told me to go home 30 minutes later! Even though I was driving myself home! They said that the combo of the drugs should have no effect on me. I wont be going back there or getting any more Toradol. And fyi, that combo had me hallucinating quite badly.

I go the doctors office to get toradol injection and within minutes the migraine is slowly going away. The injection is a lifesaver and there is no side effects that I have had from it. 
Pain	jantaygar, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/22/2008 12:33:41 PM	I had a stomach virus and migrane on top of that.  I felt I was never going to get better.  My doctor gave me an injection, and almost immediately I felt better, and my nausea pain were gone.  I could eat and drink again and probably avoided being admitted to the hospital.

Pain	Mark, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	25-34	3/28/2008 4:07:25 AM	A number of years ago I was taken to the ER with horrible abdominal pain, which turned out to be a bad case of gallstones.  It was the worst pain experience I'd ever had.  The doctor administered Toradol into my IV, and I felt a cold sensation moving up my arm. About 1 minute after the cold sensation reached my chest, the pain turned off like someone flipped a switch! Best of all, I didn't experience any disorientation or dizziness as happens with other pain meds, and was able to drive myself home a short time later.
Pain	Keek, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	3/27/2008 9:42:09 AM	I was given an injection to sto migraine pain.  It gave some relief for several days.  However, I began to suffer nose bleeds shortly after receiving the shot.  It went on for two weeks until I went to emergency room with uncontrollable nose bleed.  I ended up having a cardiac cath to my mastoid arteries where two were blocked off to stop the bleeding.  It was a terrible experience.I cannot difinitively say that the Toradol injection was the root cause of the condition, which I NEVER had before in my life.  I never had a nosebleed as a child and am now 61 years old.  No history of heart problems either.

Well, it didn't do a thing for me, maybe reduced the pain a little that evening, but it hasn't really helped.
