Tylenol PM worked for me. First three weeks were the worst and side effects subsided one at a time. I take it at night cause I get BAD DEPRESSION side effects for about 6 or 7 hours after taking. I try to sleep through those first 6 or 7 hours. It see,ms to work. I have no other drugs to comapre this to.

Have nothing to say but great things about Truvada and Reyataz combination therapy!  This once a day regiment also makes it much easier to handle.

Prevention of HIV Infection after Exposure	DD, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/15/2008 4:46:32 PM	I just finished one month on this drug after exposure to the blood of an HIV infected person.  I hope it worked but will need further blood tests.  I felt mild nausea while taking the drug and these symptoms seemed to get a little worse after I finished treatment. HIV is not just a disease of drug users and gays.  If a 57 year-old, married, hetrosexual, managomous person can be exposed, anyone can!  And thank God for the researchers who have created these drugs.
