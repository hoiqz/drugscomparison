Rheumatoid Arthritis	Sueann, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	65-74	9/12/2012 3:57:41 PM	Just too many side effects after one month. Stopped taking it and am seeing my doctor in the am. Would not suggest this drug to anyone.
Other	mary, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	8/27/2012 4:34:22 PM	I started this drug 2 months ago to help with flareup from Lupus. I have had diarrhea, flu-like symptoms, trouble breathing, cough, tiredness, weakness, severe headaches. I actually feel worse than I did before I started taking the medication. The side effects are not worth the bebefit.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	roar119, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	8/7/2012 9:04:00 PM	Swallowing a pill a day is the easiest form of treatment in my opinion however if it makes you sick(er) it certainly isn't worth the ease of use! I ended up with more symptoms and pains AFTER starting the meds. My fever went up to a 101 degrees every day causing chills, tremors and headaches. A UTI ensued and I went to bed within approximately 1 hour after taking this medicine since I felt so awful. All of this happened after a few short days of taking this medicine. I had already taken methotrexate with folic acid after taking other meds for pain and prednisone for inflamation. My next step is to try Remicade according to my rheumatologist. I hope that proves to be a better medicine for me!

I noticed lots of hair in the shower and when I ran my fingers through my hair it was coming out in my hand. I stopped use and within a year my hair was nearly back to normal.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	GLORIA, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	4/23/2012 10:04:38 AM	I was finally diagnosed about a year ago and was put on Plaquinil...developed clots in my bladder so I had to stop it.  Then was on methotrexate for several months and it was really helping me, but developed a fungal pneumonia.  Have been on the leflunomide for about 3 1/2 months. I started out on 1/2 a pill every other day and then increased to 1 pill daily when I wasn't showing any side effects.  I have been on folic acid from the very beginning of my treatment regimen.  I absolutely love my rheumatologist...she is right on top of everything and I feel blessed to have found her !!

Rheumatoid Arthritis	ICKYM, 65-74 Male  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	65-74	7/8/2011 2:37:10 PM	I SWITCHED TO LEFLUNOMIDE AFTER ALMOST DYING WHILE TAKING METHOTREXATE - MY IMMUNE SYSTEM WAS LOWERED AND I CONTRACTED FUNGAL PNEUMONIA (VALLEY FEVER).  SO BOTTOM lINE FOR MTX, IT IS A DEATH DRUG AS I SEE IT.NOW FOR LEFLUNOMIDE,IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THROUGH MEDCO, (MY PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROVIDER), BUT THE LITTLE STORE DOWN THE BLOCK HAD IT?  MEDCO TRIED TO SELL ME AVARA (WHICH COSTS $952 DOLLARS FOR 90 DAYS SUPPLY.  LEFLUNOMIDE COST $12 FOR 90 DAYS SUPPLY.  SOMETHING STINKS HERE ON THIS MATTER SO I HAVE ASKED MY SENATORS FROM MICHIGAN TO GET THE FDA TO INVESTIGATE.  NOW, FOR THE EFFECTIVNESS OF LEFLUNOMIDE, MY BODY HURTS AND MY JOINTS ARE STILL SORE, MY EYES ARE BLURRED, AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE LEFLUNOMIDE IS WORKING OR NOT - IT HAS BEEN ABOUT 6 MONTHS.  I GUESS I NEED TO CONTACT A REAL RHEUMATOID DOCTOR AND FIND OUT WAHT WORKS.  I WAS NOT ENCOURAGED BY THESE WRITEUPS AT ALL.  GUESS I WILL KEEP USING GOOD OLD HEAT TO LOOSEN ME UP.  I have concluded that this is an illness that needs lots more investigation.

There is time for that I guess. It matters what brand you take Sandoz (sp?) for me. It did take a 4 months to reach potential.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/4/2011 12:25:32 PM	I developed nodules with methatrexate so doc put me on the Leflunomide.  I had a rash in the beginning, but doc changed dose to every other day and it went away.  In combination with Remicade infusions every 8 weeks it has made a big difference in my pain I have had stomach problems and some hair loss, but worth the benefits if caused by the leflunomide.

I have to go for atest today to run a tube down my esophagus and check my stomach and then he wants me to see my Rheumatologist and see what to do from there. After reading all the problems caused by Leflunomide I really think thats my problem. Should fond out something within the next 1 days. I just want to feel better again.Maybe I will be able to use humira only without all the problems. I will check the sideeffects out more closely this time.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Will, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	3	Male	45-54	12/22/2010 9:20:40 PM	RA for 20 years, on meds for 16.  Prednisone works great, MTX made me nauseous after about 10 years.  I've been on Arava for 2 years, am having a lot of numbness and tingling, muscle weakness, no appetite and weight loss.  Hair loss too.  Bad infection, almost lost my big toe and still may.  Humira didn't help.  Rheumatologist keeps pushing  Orencia.  I hate my Rheumatologist.   3mg of naltrextone reduced the number of flares and the intensity.  No more visits to the ER in the 18 months that I've been taking it. Gold shots worked but lowered my platelet count and had to quit.

About 2 months ago I started experiencing extreme amounts of hair loss. I thought this was suppose to be a rare side effect. I was wrong. I stopped taking it 9 days ago and am thinning out. I know this is a superficial thing to be picky about, but I miss my hair. Be cautious when taking the medicine and report this side effect early to your doctor or you can end up like me.

RA got worse when not on med, then stabilized again when I was able to resume taking it. It's helped me a lot.

There is a very bad odor when I perspire, urinate or have a bowel movement.  This is only happening since I started taking these drugs a couple of months ago. It is a sickening smell to me, which I can only discribe as cooked meat. This odor may be fine if you're making a dinner. buy not if it is coming out of your body. I'm wondering if my ORGANS are slow-cooking.  This is not a joke!  Has anyone else had this problem?  Help!!!

The doctor had me stop taking it for a couple days because I developed a rash on my arms,top of my feet and the backs of my knees itched, This morning I woke up with a sore on my tongue and my lips were swollen. I got somewhat better through the day. The rash on my arms has decreased. I haven't taken the medication for 5 days. The doctor wants to start it up again in a smaller dose when all of this allergic reaction calms down. I'm hoping my body gets use to it.

This is the second script- 2nd month.  I'm going to stop taking it today.  It's causing real bad, bad, low back pain and shooting/tremulous pain in buttocks. I'm also experiencing shooting pain in various parts of my body.  Similar to what I experienced with MTX. I also have a mild rash. Was on MTX for about 2yrs.  It gave me bad crippling pain in lower neck and under and around shoulder blades. MTX also gave me burning, stinging, pulsating feet. Off that too. Throughout my affliction, Celebrex has stayed true to its effectiveness and what it is suppose to do.  I've just been prescribed Humira (Pen). Will start today. I pray this will be my answer to my inflammation, joint pain in legs, toes, heels of my feet and my poor fingers and wrists. And this horrible all-over feeling.  I'm just tired.  I read the opinions of the Humira users and overall, they seem to be satisfied with its effectiveness.  Thanks Web MD for allowing us to share our experiences. It really does help!
