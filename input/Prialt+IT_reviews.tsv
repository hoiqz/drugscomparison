Chronic Pain	tonicar, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1		55-64	9/24/2012 12:29:22 AM	Almost immediately after the Prialt was put in my pain pump I began experiencing extreme urinary retention, constipation, instability, drowsiness, trouble talking coherently and absolutely no relief from the pain. I'm getting it out of my pump at the first opportunity.

Chronic Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/15/2012 5:15:18 PM	I had my pump implanted 6 weeks ago and so far am only able to tolerate 1.2 mcg. I had every side effect listed including the sensation that my skin is burning, electric shock sensations, memory loss, and an overall increase in my pain. This is by far, the worst medication I have ever used. My doctor is putting me on IT morphine and I can't wait! This medication has been awful. I had to go in 3 times to have the dosage lowered. I wish that it would have worked for me as I am tired of the narcotics but I'm only 25 so I can't afford to have side effects like this.

Chronic Pain	retired officer, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	45-54	3/7/2012 9:56:56 PM	I was given Prialt as a trial for a pain pump. I had 3 injections trying to prove effectivenes prior to getting a pain pump. First dose was nothing. Dr doubled dose for second injection. I had some delayed side effects (nausia, dizziness, confusion)but I did not get the pain relief the Dr wanted. HHe increased the dose again for the 3rd injection. This time I had very severe reactions with 7 hours of the injection. I was taken to the ER and treated as if I was allergic to the med. I was vomiting, having hot and cold flashes, I was so dizzy that I could not stand. I had a severe sensation of burning shin and eventually I had breathing problems. Needless to say, I will not take Prialt again. by 30 hours after the 3rd injection, I was back to normal, but without back pain for the first tim in 6 1/2 years.

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	triger, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	45-54	9/26/2011 7:09:01 AM	I have had 26 muscoskelatal surgeries with 12 on back in last 8 years.  also have avascualr osteocronosis.  I was so sick of having to take duragesic 200McG's every 48 hours, 240 30 mg Roxicodone a month, 3-4 Actiq a day at 800McG's just to walk without extreme pain. I was out of it 24/7 but could not use morphine pump as would need over safe dose.  When prialt came out and protocal was also severe chronc pain, my Dr. who is diretor of hospitals Advanced pain Medicine for 3rd ranked hospital in US, said he could use hydromorphone which by itself does not travel farenough up spine, I was elated.  Yes I lost 50lb's and yes some phycosis at 1st and memory loss but at 9mg's daily f dilaudid and 2.25McG's of prialt, i now take only 180 roxi 30mg's a month and have pump and get better relief besides obvious not drugged up.  it to me is a miracle drug and people nee to weigh symptoms before judging as I know some people have underlying problems which I can see would worsen but if pain is severe enough or you do not have severe enough pain which only you know, then maybe is not for you.i do believe is pain drug of future when can be given safely in pill form.
Chronic Pain	liam, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	8/29/2011 11:06:53 AM	I wish there was zero stars! I'm worried this medication might have ruined my memory for life, as well as my weight. I was given this for chronic nerve pain &amp; it actually worked ok for the 6 months I was on it. The doc told me the only side effects people might have is a little memory loss. I developed major memory loss, a major psychotic breakdown &amp; loss 45lbs in 3 months. I have been off of it for a yr now and my memory is still very bad (I'm only 33) I also can't gain a pound back &amp; have been eating 3600 calorie's a day for several months now &amp; haven't gained a pound. I'm only 5 lbs over my recommended weight. I'm hoping this is not permanent and hate that synthetic venom! CALL the FDA for side effects. Get this stuff off the market. 
Chronic Pain	chronicpaingrl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/30/2011 7:29:36 AM	I have not tried this BUT PLEASE report these side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.  Unless you do this nothing will be done with this drug, nothing will get done just by posting on here but helping others, you want it off the market, tell the FDA!!!!!!
Chronic Pain	Catty1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/3/2011 2:13:30 AM	I've been on Prialt for about 4 years.  I too heard music-really twangy country at first.  It's almost gone now and sometimes I miss it.  Drove me nuts at first. I talk faster than I use to, but my memory is getting better.  I don't know if others do this, but I've noticed I talk to myself a lot and I constantly am singing to myself as well.  Has anybody had this effect from this snail spit?
Severe Pain	Peanut, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	6/3/2011 1:49:01 AM	I do very well on Prialt.  I have an interthecal pump and I have been able to let my sitters go, drive for the first time in 10 years and do many household chores, such as changing bedsteads and cleaning the kitchen.
Severe Pain	kylee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/2/2011 6:08:27 AM	a great deal of pain relief without ANY side effects!
Chronic Pain	Lman, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Male	35-44	4/25/2011 11:44:49 AM	First off... if I didn't find these reviews I'd probably be institutionalized right now. This medicine did help my nerve pain (moderately) but the memory loss is horrible, I lost 50lbs in 6 months, I can't concentrate well, agitated, no motivation, have extreme anxiety and have a very very hard time being able to remember words or finish my sentences. Then... I started having a pungent perfumey like smell constantly, which started to become an obsession because no one else could smell it on me and it is so strong and disgusting. This slowly led up to a full blown manic episode lasting 5 to 7 days with no sleep (can't remember now), thoughts of not wanting to live anymore and perhaps boarder-line psychosis. I've been off this medication for over 2 weeks now but still suffer from some of these side effects, but they're slowly going away (THANK YOU GOD!). Again, I can't stress enough how these reviews helped me because my doctor never mentioned these side effects and definitely should have but took me off of it right away. I'm glad this medication has helped many people, but be careful if considering taking this medication and READ ABOUT THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS FIRST!

Chronic Pain	Brown eyes, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	4/3/2011 12:02:33 AM	My husband was put on Prialt after 6 yrs.of chronic pain due to surgical procedure to remove part of a lung. Nerve damage. This is a drug from HELL. Hears music,complete personality change. Jekll and Hyde. Nause vomiting no appetite. He now weighs 128 lbs.  Says he just wants to die as he cannot go on this way. Sleeps when he can or lays in bed. Told Drs. This and only give more pills. Depression and anxiety.  How can you not feel these things.  Has effected our whole family and grandkids. Gets aggressive and I want to leave, sad thing is after he acts this way he feels bad as if he has no control.  He feels sick all the time and hardly goes anywhere.  I could go on and on. Pain is worse now than ever.  I am glad it has helped other people but the Naha seem more than the yeahs.  I just want my husband back.
Chronic Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	3/29/2011 6:08:21 PM	I have Complex Regional Pain Disease and this medication changed my life both good &amp; horrific. I was able to walk again after 5 yrs. in a wheelchair that's the good news. I have had terrible side effects I've lost weeks at a time that I can't remember as well as very severe hallucinations that caused me to attempt suiside &amp; was still haveing them once hostpitalized for it, a smell that I could taste when every time I took a breath similar to just waking up from surgury that smell you can taste. It has changed my personality to the point my children even told me when I asked them if they thought it had changed me. I'm glad I can walk now, but I would rather be in the wheelchair &amp; happy than walking &amp; being crazy. I know this medication isn't right for me &amp; I have asked the meds in my pump be changed. It may be a mirical drug but the personal cost is so very much more.
Chronic Pain	itcac, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	3/2/2011 5:06:39 PM	This for me has been a &quot;Life changing&quot; positive experience.I have been on the drug well over six years with NO side effects wahatsoever. I was totally drugged up before and asleep for long periods on traditional medications. This has changed my life for the better as I am now able to do Volunteer work and promoting self management.I had my occipital nerves sectioned as wall as steroid induced osteoporosis, so tottaly endorse this drug for neuropathic pain.

Chronic Pain	RottieLover, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	55-64	1/24/2011 4:46:11 PM	My pain was due to cancer which is now in remission. My first pain clinic pushed me too hard to increase Prialt and side effects were bad! I heard music and it felt like my teeth were melting! I kept reducing my Prialt until it was mixed w/a narcotic and that combination  made my pain level from a constant 9(with 10 being unbearable) to a livable 5-7! This is the lowest my pain level has been in 9yrs! I do require 9hrs sleep each night to reduce my confusion and lethargy. I am finally pleased with my Prialt and my Life. After 8 years of trying different combinations and Prialt Levels and 1pump reposition and 1 pump replacement I am finally able to Live. I can meet my husband for lunch most days and able to keep most of my appointments. I am able to increase my Prialt level when/if my pain level increases. Yes, it took several years to get the level just right and the side effects lower, but it was totally worth it to finally have a more normal &amp; happy life!
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	wife/mom/gma39, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/5/2010 8:42:01 AM	I had my trial for Prialt back in May of 2010. IT WAS MIRACULOUS! Then we had the pain pump put in. I cannot get past 4.5mcg. The first time we hit 3..I was in bed for a solid week with nausea/vomiting. Thought I was going to die but that was only the beginning. I have been telling dr all along that I had bad dry mouth, and increased sweating. He said it was the MS Contin I was still taking and I had to get off of it since this was helping me now. WHAT?! This has not given me any relief since trial. I TOO HEAR MUSIC! I was so glad to see that from someone else, but so sorry at the same time. I LONG FOR QUIET TIME...but it never comes. I cry frequently. I have this taste in my mouth...oh my God...I pray more...I can't hold a conversation. I can't think of what things are called. AND I AM ON A RELATIVELY LOW DOSE...only since August 3rd this year! Dr doesn't want to believe me it is this drug. Doesn't know about the music yet. I see him again next week. GOD BLESS EVERYONE AND THEIR FAMILIES who have tried this drug. I pray for you all. REALLY! I am married to a saint, and he is about to lose it. The music is building to a climactic end, so I Will just leave it there...
Chronic Pain	informyourself1st, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	9/30/2010 2:47:10 AM	I was using Prialt for chronic back pain, secondary to Multiple Sclerosis, this was the most HORRIFIC experience of my life. I had almost every side effect listed on the Full prescribing Information sheet. I was hearing music playing, seeing things that weren't there,the most severe sinus infection I ever had,confusion, having conversations and not able to rember them, the Radial Pain down both arms, difficulty speaking,severe neurological symptoms,vision problems anxiety and depression. These are the things leading up to the Psychiatric problem that caused me to be rushed to the ER 4x within a month. I didn't realize until after I had the pump removed, that this medication had COMPLETE  control of my brain and way of thinking.The biggest problem is that I had symptoms several weeks before I had to be rushed to the ER screaming uncontrollably, but I did not know they were warnings that I was in trouble with Prialt, because I had NEVER been given the Full Prescribing Information. If my Dr had given me this just ONCE, I would have known to let him know something was going wrong. I tried to report these symptoms anyway, but I was ignored. If anyone out there is thinking about using PRIALT, please read the Full Prescribing Information before you get this PRIALT.

She cannot remember much of the last 14 months.She also had increased breathing problems. She often would just sit in a chair and just stare at the walls. Several times she told me death would be a welcome event. The nurse practioner would not listen to my concerns about the side effects. We were finnaly able to talk to a Rep. from Elam Pharmaceuticals, she had the pain clinic discontinue the use of Prialt. She has been off of Prialt for over five months and is slowley regaining some memory,however she never wants to leave the house or see friends. I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT !!!        
Chronic Pain	nancyed2003, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/18/2010 2:53:27 AM	Prialt almost cost me my life. It didn't help with my pain at all. I heard music 24/7. It was so loud in my head that it drowned out any conversations. I was very confused and was severely depressed. I wanted to die. I was hospitalized for a week on suicide watch plus an additional 1.5 years of therapy. I lost about 4-5 months of my life. I can't remember much from that time period, only snippets here and there. I would not recommend this medication to ANYONE!!! The side effects are too bad. I currently have dilaudid and baclofen in my pump and they are helping a lot. I still have pain daily, but the meds in my pump keep me from being bed-ridden. For those of you that are currently using Prialt- please watch for the side effects. They are very real and they sneak up on and make you feel like you are losing your mind. For those considering it, please do careful research before you take it. Take it from me, I am glad to be alive today. 
Chronic Pain	55-64 Male  (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male	55-64	3/12/2010 7:18:14 AM	I have a pump with prialt at a very low dose,the side effects out way the help. I can relate to the woman and her husband, about no one believeing them. They try and tell me it is everything but the prialt,that I have depression, Well I do now! I think?

I've been on Prialt for over a year and I have gone through several bad experiences and I always stuck it out since the relief was so good.  It's no longer worth it.  I have no life, hardly leave the house and spend most of the time talking to myself.

Chronic Pain	GodHelps , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/14/2009 11:07:02 PM	I week ago, I started an IT pump trial with Prialt.  On the second, fourth, and fifth days after trial initiation, I returned to the pain center and the med was increased slowly (started out with about 4 mcg/day, increased eventually to about 7 mcg/day).  With the first increase, my pain improved (decreased).  With each successive increase of Prialt, my pain increased and so did side effects.  I became extremely dizzy, nauseated (with vomiting), confused, lethargic, my vision blurred, and I was unable to do anything but lie in bed and wonder what Prialt was doing to my brain.  I had to use a wheelchair for mobility, and it became difficult to understand what others were saying. I was unable to read as the appearance of words confused me, and I could not write legibly because my hands shook violently.  I developed a headache that was unbearable, and my blood pressure skyrocketed (systolic &gt;160, diastolic   &gt;110).  On the sixth day, I could no longer stand the side effects and the increased pain and I turned the pump off.  At this point in time, I have been off Prialt for 21 hours and I am slowly returning to normal.  Earlier today, the catheter and external pump were removed and my doctor did not hesitate to say that Prialt was not for me.  I am a very methodical and analytical person, but after all I had been through, my response was, &quot;Ya think?????&quot;I entered into this Prialt trial because like most long-term chronic pain sufferers, I have tried just about everything else (epidurals, physical therapy, massage, chiropractic, TENS, SCS, narcotic pain meds (HATE THEM), pump trials with morphine and dilaudid, exercising on my own, etc.  Obviously, to voluntarily submit to a Prialt trial I felt a sense of desperation and that I was running out of options to live a life relatively free of pain.I pray that something effective and serious side effect-free will be developed and come on the market soon.  For me, Prialt does not fit that description.

I couldn't tell where i was , if it was day or night or what i did the week i stayed by myself when my husband was out of town.
Chronic Pain	jonoshko, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/10/2009 4:48:27 PM	I had 2 spinal operations and was using  morphine, roxicet and even harsher drugs which didn't help to ease the pain.  I had a Medtronic pump inserted and even though there was some relief it was minimal. When my doctor told me about Prialt I jumped at the prospect of not having pain running down my legs and interferring with my ability to walk.  Since I've had the pump (Prialt as the primary &amp; fentanyl piggy backing)the pain is no longer in my legs.  I will be ever thankful to that little snail and it's ooze. God bless researchers.

Severe Pain	Old Blue, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	2/2/2008 4:35:59 AM	With having RSD for 12 years (diagnosed for 10)I about every procedure and medication available from guided imagery to a SCS implant to Fentanyl, Dilaudid and others. This has been the most effective by far for easing the pain. Still took Morphine for breakthrough pain. Had to stop due to severe mental impairment. No history of any mental illness and now I'd get lost in a store, not recognize my husband, and became paranoid. Pain came back in a fury after I stopped the medication. Is was not worth the ease in pain. I lost a year of my life and have no idea where it went.
