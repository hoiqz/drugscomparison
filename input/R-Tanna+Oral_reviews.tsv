For some reason  I couldn't get a previous prescrpt decon store said not made anymore?  so Dr. had to sub with this, this is not as effective as I recall the previous decongestant was, it just doesn't seem to be working as well, I am still clogged for over a week under doctor car with this stuff.  Previous stuff had me all done in like 4 days
