Bipolar Disorder in Remission	Why Not? BP aTX, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	45-54	4/28/2012 2:11:22 AM	I took Risperdal when I entered treatment for Bipolar 1 (Major Depressive) along with alcohol and meth addiction (snorter).  I was in psychosis from the substance abuse and untreated bipolar. I needed the antipyschotic. It worked well to help me get back to reality. I experienced pretty bad side effects: rapid weight gain, major ticks and uncontrolled body movements, saliva gathering at creases in mouth, body core overheating without notice, extreme lethargy. But! I came back to reality during my seven months on the drug. And sixty five pounds later I was happier fat and sane than skinny and insane. It stabilized my mood, eased the delusions, started the brain chemistry back on track and allowed me to think again.  I had brain fog.  I moved onto Invega a second generation of Risperdal from what I was told with far less side effects.  I'm glad I was not on it very long.  As far as antipsychotics go, one must be aware of the potency and how strong they can be as far as side effects. Please take precautions ie avoid heating up as I did not realize how I could suddenly heat my core and hit the ground.  But  you can take other drugs for the ticks and it really worked on the psychosis for me. I toughened up on this drug. It made many I went onto the past six years seem tame... Relativity... and sanity. It did work. It hurt and I got fat but I got better.

I'm gonna take her to the er I know they will do a ct scan. after they read about what this shot can cause and its side affects. I was sure she would get better when I did not take her for the 5th shot, but this medicane stays in you and releases medicen over time. I feel shes really messed up from it, and I will get a medical Dr, to look at her and run tests. shes not takeing anything else. my daughter is not the same anymore, just really unhappy and confused . it really breacks my heart, and to think I trusted the dr, who said oh she will be fine on this medicane. nohes not fine, she matbe goin on 24 but you can still have a stroke if something causes it?

Other	reva, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	6/26/2011 12:39:57 PM	I have been on risperidal consta for the last 5 years because i was hearing voices in my head which stopped on its own but not due to the medication.  Is there any way I can stop the psychiatrist from giving me the injections.  I am completely normal for the last so many years and I don't know how the medication can be stopped once it is started.  The psychiatrist has said that I must take it all my life.  It is very expensive to take this medication all your life and is a drain on my resources.  Among the side effects are weakening of the muscles of the eye (I am not able to open my eyelids when i get up in the morning).  doctor refuses to stop the injections.  Even my calf muscles seem to have weakened and I fear that my heart muscles and other muscles in my body may have weakened also due to this strong injection that I have been taking for so many years now.  I have also put on weight due to the medication but psychiatrist is not attributing it to the injection and continues to treat me wiht it because he thinks the more expensive the drug, the better it is.  I would like to know what will make the psychiatrist stop the medication all together.

Impotence, restlessness, loss of concentration, it damages your brain. After having awful suicidal thoughts the doctor has withdrawn the treatment 8 weeks ago but I am still feeling dreadful. Don't take it unless you want to say bye-bye to happiness

It has worked miracles but I have VERY HIGH prolactin levels because of it and have to take pills three times a day to try to keep it from going higher.  I don't know which is the worse of the two evils...but my prolactin is definately a concern and MAJOR inconvienance.  My Bi-Polar is totally under control though.  I do not like having to drive to twon to my Dr pffice every two weeks though, it is a bit inconvienant for me, but the pill form did not produce the results of this shot.  I would highly recommend it, but beware of your prolactin levels.

I wasn't like this this before, so it seems as thought the medication actually caused negative symptoms of skitzophrenia by treating them. 
Schizophrenia	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	8/21/2008 11:13:02 AM	I was being hospitalized every 4 to 5 months before being put on the shot. It makes me very tired the day I get it. But other than that I have had no side effects and been taking it for 9 months.
Other	Sarah, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	9/8/2008 10:27:28 AM	I took this for about 3 years for Bipolar 1 mania.  I was non-compliant on oral meds, and in the hospital more than I was out because of my symptoms.  It took a while for my moods to regulate, but eventually,it worked better than anything else. I have not had an episode in three years, nor, of course, been hospitalized.  It helps me because it takes away my ability to be non-compliant, because I do it in a doctors office, and because it is only every two weeks.  Overall, it is one of the things that helped me return to a normal life.

Continuing improvement came over a two year period.  Has now been 'normal' for over three years!!  Doesn't necessarily like the shots but the results are great.  No noticeable side effects.
