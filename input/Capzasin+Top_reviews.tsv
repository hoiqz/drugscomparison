Nerve Pain	pegmorlen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	35-44	9/14/2012 7:30:14 AM	I have had severe itching which is related to nerves misfiring, someone recommended capzasin, so I bought and applied to both arms one arm caught on fire the other felt like icy hot it seems to have worked for now, but I told my husband that it burnt the top layer of my skin off so they where no more nerves lol.
Pain associated with Arthritis	none, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/12/2012 4:26:51 PM	I had total knee replacement 5 months ago. I still have joint pain especially after exercising/rehab. I ran out of the generic muscle rub I had been using. I bought a tube of Capzasin P and have been very pleased with the performance. I can feel the pain subside immediately after applying Capzasin P and the relief lasts about 4 hours. The relief is comparable to Icy Hot or Equal Line. The cost is about the same as Icy Hot but more than Equal Line. Capzasin has one major advantage to the other products. It comes with a sponge applicator attached to the tube. I never have to get the ointment on my hands like with the other products which is a major advantage in my book. I will continue to use Capzasin over the other products for this reason.

Pain associated with Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	12/27/2011 6:26:31 PM	It was easy to apply, but my skin inched immediately, which subsided. The nightmare came hours later when I woke up feeling like my knee was on fire. I used an icepack, which helped. When showered the following morning the hot water reactivated the burn. I will not use this product again.
Pain associated with Arthritis	Grantthegreat, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	12/5/2011 10:50:29 AM	Used Capzasin HP for Arthritis pain in back.  Within minutes of use, back turned bright red and SEVERE INTENSE Burning!!  Followed directions on box with no relief. Last resort before going to ER, called poison control, who recommended towels soaked with milk applied.  This gave &quot;bearable&quot; relieve but did not allieviate.  THIS NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OFF MARKET!  Pain was 2nd to childbirth!!

Joint Pain	Cindy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	8/15/2011 8:41:10 AM	All I experienced was irritation of the skin surface, a burning sensation that I could not stop. Washing with soap and water made it worse and lotions gave no relief. Joints still hurt.

Sprains and Strains	Gem, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/17/2011 12:28:20 AM	I used this product on my neck one night because I had strained it and thought it work like Ben-Gay ointment, which has been helpful in the past.  Within 30 seconds of rubbing it into the side of my neck, my skin was on fire and after 15 minutes, the pain was so intense I dug the product out of the trash where I had thrown it, only to see the warning that I should have saved the carton to find out what to do in case of &quot;severe burning sensation&quot; (which of courser I had not done).  I ended up on this website, at least I know I don't have to drive myself to the emergency room! I am using cold compresses and will try the vegetable oil also. The side of my neck is beet red and I actually have raised welts (like hives) on my skin where I applied the &quot;treatment&quot;.  I will never use this product again and will try and warn others away from it as well.

Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	3/18/2011 11:36:02 AM	I used this on my daughter and she was burned very badly. I would not recommend. Vegetable oil seemed to stop the burning. 
Backache	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/20/2011 10:50:37 AM	I have tried everything for back pain! I read about Capzasin and thought I'd try it, in the lowest strength possible. Day one, seemed to help. Day 2, seemed to help. 12 hours AFTER applying on day 2, I was woken up from a dead sleep by the sensation that my back was ON FIRE! I washed it off as best as I could at 1 AM, took a Benadryl, I truly thought I was going to go into anaphylactic shock or something! I had a bright red spot on my back the size of a softball. A couple of showers and a soothing lotion the next morning, and it seems to have taken care of it. This product is DANGEROUS! It SHOULD NOT BE ON THE MARKET!  The FDA really needs to look into this!
Other	linda, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	11/30/2010 1:55:43 PM	It was the first time I have used this medication and two of my doctors recommended it. I had a severe adverse reaction which included very severe burning and skin turning very bright red which  lasted for a couple of hours despite taking a shower, washing with soap, putting vegetable oil on it and then cold cloths as the package recommended. On a scale of pain of 1 -10 with 10 being the most severe pain you have ever experienced this was a 9. It was very severe and I howled loudly. It burned like it was on fire. I was in SEVERE PAIN. It has left the skin very sensitive and uncomfortable even though it has been nearly 24 hours. The redness has dissaptated as has the severe burning, but the skin is very tender and itchy. I will report this event too to the FDA. 
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	55-64	11/18/2010 5:02:54 PM	Don't know about &quot;pain,&quot; but I have constant itching around the shoulder blade.  This condition has a name I can't recall at the moment, but there is no cure and the doctors don't care.  On the Internet, I found that someone had used this ointment.  I have used it for a couple of days and am thrilled.  The slight burning and hot sensation is a welcome relief to an intense itch I can't reach.  I don't care what it does to me otherwise.  I've now had two days of not itching in five years - thanks to this ointment.

Joint Pain	idontknow, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/1/2010 9:10:25 PM	Burned the Day lights out of me with no relief for three days. I tryed every thing the package said. Finally in my cabinet I found some neutralize gel called Miracle 2. it instantly removed all pain and all burning. I will never use this product again.

Nerve Pain	Karen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/31/2010 9:06:56 PM	After trying multipld medications, over the counter and by prescription, I finally tried capzasin. I read the direction inside the box and outside the box. It worked wonders!! Before, I could barely walk or sit in the am due to excruiting pain. After using the capzasin I almost felt like new!!It is the ONLY thing that has helped with my back and leg pain. Aplly spaingly at first to see if you have any reaction. I HIGHLY recommend this ointment.
Pain associated with Arthritis	Keith, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	8/19/2010 11:46:19 PM	I applied this moderately last night to my hip and back. Within one to two minutes I was suffering excrutiating burning pain. At 52 years old, I was crying like a baby and in distress. I was scrambling for relief. Cold shower, scrub with soap and water, covered with ice. The directions on the outside of the box said to find other instructions printed inside the box itself..ie., cut the product's package open and read additional instructions for severe reactions. The pain was absolutely as severe as having burned myself on the stove or having caught on fire! The only relief came from dousing the skin with vast amounts of vegetable oil as recommended inside the containers packaging. Obviously I had some sort of untypical reaction, however it must not be that uncommon because they do disclose two or three emergency responses if you have the wits about where to find the information. I can not believe this product is allowed to be sold in the U.S. Having said that, my dad has used this for months with no side effects. It scares the hell out of me though, that others could experience what I did and I would not wish that on anyone.

I have a tube of Capzasin next to my bed, in the bathroom, and in the bag I carry during the day. It is highly effective. Perhaps it takes some getting used to, which is why people used to over-the-counter treatments that are ineffective were surprised by the heat. I'm sure that highly sensitive skin could be strongly affected by this product.
Pain associated with Arthritis	BL Brown, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	7/14/2010 7:20:53 PM	Do not use Capzasin!  The burn from the ingredient, HOT PEPPERS, is much worse than the pain of arthritis.  I used it one time and the burning was so bad I couldn't sleep.  It lasted for 24 hours.  No where on the outside of the box or the tube did it warn about the chance of severe burning.  Nor it mention the ingredient until reading on the INSIDE of the box. Also, there is no 800 number to call for help.  This medicine should be pulled from the shelf!
Pain associated with Arthritis	Capzasin, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	6/19/2010 12:16:25 PM	I applied it to the back of my hand for arthritis paid.  The pain is gone, but it burns like I stuck my hand in the oven.  I have tried washing with several different soaps and applied several different types of cream.  Redness and burning remain.  Will not use again.  I wish I had read other reviews before I tried it.
Nerve Pain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/6/2010 7:25:36 PM	this product made me feel worse.  It increased the burning and caused swelling.  When I showered the next morning, the burning was just horrible, in my feet and in both hands.  I will never touch this stuff again.  It only increased my pain.

The pain was unbearable and not wanting to go to the doctor just for pain meds, I remembered this awful burning applicator I'd used before.  Certainly, the burning was better than the pain.  And I was right!  Burn baby burn!  But finally, I can sleep, and work and do what I need to do again.

Severe burning to my skin and it will not wash off the severe burning and tingling in my wrists and arms are still present 24 hours later. This product should be banned from the market.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/4/2009 7:01:01 PM	I applied the medication to my hips and was unable to work the next day due to the severe pain caused by the capzasin. My skin felt like someone was holding a blow torch to it. I tried to remove the medicine, but was unable to get it all off. 20 + hours later, I am still burning. I was unable to sleep due to the burning and had to put ice packs on to get relief. Taking a hot bath just now to ease the initial hip joint pain(20 some hours after first application and multiple attempts to remove) seemed to reactivate the medication. I am on fire again, but not quite as severely. I will NEVER use this product again and will never recommend it to anyone.

Backache	Kay, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/16/2008 5:39:37 PM	Capzasin numbs pain in my spine and muscles. It also numbs arthritic pain in my joints (ankles/knuckles/shoulders). The mild itching/burning that sometimes occurs is well worth the pain relief. I am taking fewer pain relieving meds (Tylenol and oxycodone) and muscle relaxers (Soma) since using Capzasin. I experienced immediate relief upon the first application. Wish I had known about it long ago.
