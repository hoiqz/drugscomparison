Migraine Headache	goneauburn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/24/2010 3:25:51 AM	I've taken the Zomig and Maxalt oral dissolving pills and the nasal spray and the Zomig spray seems to work quicker and better every time.  The only down side is after taking the nasal spray, I can feel the medicine dripping down the back of my throat and often times it makes me want to throw up.  However, if I can fight the urge to do so, the medicine is more effective in stopping my migraine symptoms (blurry vision, numbness, excessive pain and nausea).  I've never had to take a second dose to control migraine symptoms.

It changed my life.  After suffering with terrible migraines for years, I now use Zomig and 20 minutes later, my migraine is gone.

When my doctor wanted me to try Zomig I was not expecting to much. I was so happy to report that since using Zomig for about 2 years it has been a god send.
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	1/19/2009 3:27:48 PM	I have been using Zomig since the first part 0f 2008 as a migrane sufferer. However, in the late summer timeframe, I experienced a loss of taste and smell. My neurologist states that this is not from the Zomig. I feel that it is. Even though it helps with the pain of the migrane this is a serious side effect to me. I will need to go to my ENT doctor to determine what is the solution to my problem with no taste or smell.

The taste was bad but not awfull. Relief came after about 3-5 minutes. I really don't know how I could have functioned without the help of this drug.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/16/2008 12:06:53 PM	I could not function without Zomig.  My migrains are awful.  It does taste TERRIBLE but as long as you have something to munch on or sip for about 45 minutes it's fine.  I have some trouble with dizziness for the rest of the day.  And there are times that I need to take it twice however doses are usually 4 or more hours apart.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/20/2007 4:48:15 PM	I used this alone and in combination with maxalt. It's very effective but when it starts to drip down the back of your throat it tastes AWEFUL!!! I recomend having a strong flavored or fizzy to drink when that happens to help kill the taste.
