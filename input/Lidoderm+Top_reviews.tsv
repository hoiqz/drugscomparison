I tried handfuls of ibuprofen and it did not work, tried several anti inflamitory meds and they did not help much.  The doctor put me on this medication and hydrocodone.  This medication helped far more than the hydrocodone alone.  It still hurt a lot after just a hydrocodone and then I tried this patch and suddenly for the first time in weeks was not in unbearable pain.  I have found I can skip the hydrocodone and just use this patch and it works for 12 hours and a few hours after it is removed.  If you have lower back pain I cannot say enough about this patch.  You must try it.  I just woke up in pain an hour ago and could not even sit on toilet and put on one of these patches and now the pain is totally gone.  I would choose this patch every time before a narcotic.  I don't even know I have a back and left leg now.  Excellent.

I was hoping to get off Altram (Tramadol) by using these instead. Anyway, I ended up taking 2 1/2 doses of the pain med, at least 6 hrs apart, along with the patch. Last night I got out of bed because I couldn't sleep, feeling very hyper. My pulse was 80 when I first got up, Then after I removed the patch, it went down to a more normal 63. Also I felt shaky. I was able to sleep after taking off the patches.

It is the greatest pain relivier I have every use with no side effect.  It is expensive but it is so worth it.

That is deep muscle pain of stinging and swelling of my neck and shoulders and knees and sometimes elbows..I use them at night along with my other pain medications..They help with the pain and swelling so I can sleep better during the night. I have Costochondritis, and it's causing swelling and some choking at times. Right now I'm getting some relief using this patch..only problem so far is they tend to come loose from movement. They are also expensive, but worth it at this point..I read some others say that these have caused cancer in rats,tumors, and heart problems..I hope not, because they work well for me while they are on, but pain comes back...so it is also a temporary fix, but it helps !!

One way to prevent patches from rolling up on edges is to use elastic surgical tape.  The brand I use is called Elastikon (made by Johnson anb Johnson) and you can get it at most pharmacy's.  It's flexible, never rolls up off of skin, and firmly holds the patches in place.  I've also used this tape for holding bandaids in place.

Using this as directed as relieved back pain,osteoarthritis,sciatica,hip,shoulder pain as well as leg pain and leg cramps.Back injections were ineffective even after multiple years of them. These patches work! Now I have just found out that our insurance will no longer cover them.Since I don't want to take, nor get real help from pain drugs(which they DO cover)I am not looking forward to what to use when I run out of my current supply. Does anyone know wat can be done to let the FDA clear this for multiple pain relief uses or other ways to et insurances to cover this pain patch? I agree with many others who have reviewed this here...how does a drug plan override my doctor's prescription on what is best for me?

I still had to do neck circles throughout the day to keep the stiffness at bay.  I'll report back to my doctor in next 3 weeks to get his opinion on pain mgt.  As for me, the jury is still out on this depending on what type of pain you are experiencing.

For my back injury and muscle spasms, I also used it for osteoarthritis pain of my right hip while walking. I had shoulder pain due to exercise and I used it there as well. It worked. Now I have to come up with $1400 for a 90 day supply. The FDA should approve this patch for use of pain due to spinal injury pain, herniated discs and muscle spasms of any condition and arthritis joint pain. Like another post, It does not cancel out all of the pain but it kept me going. Now I have to find a way to pay for it. Maybe medicare's drug plan. How does a drug plan decision override my doctors prescription who knows whats best for their patients?

He went into detail exactly how to apply these for the best relief.  I have been using them regularly for approx 8 years now.  I would gladly give up the pa8in medications that could lead to addiction and other problems to use these pads.  Since the FDA only approved the patches for relief of post herpetic neuralgia, I can no longer get the patches, but am in the process of trying to go thru Endo to get these.  These have always been a tremendous help to me in controlling my pain. They help 100% better than the pain medications that I am now forced to take until I can find a way to get these patches again.l
