Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy	clarkcl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	35-44	5/13/2012 6:41:12 AM	This drug worked for me while I was pregnant to stop my nausea, but it did make me very tired.  Here's my biggest problem with this drug however: I took it every day for several months when I was pregnant and then just stopped taking it cold turkey when my baby was born (my doctor never told me not to do this).  I experienced a terrible post-partum depression that I believe was brought on by going off of this medication - I just recently found out that phenergan has antipsychotic properties.  My doctor knew I had had problems in the past with depression/anxiety and never told me that I should possibly taper off this drug.  It is was hell.  Be careful.

Helps to increase effectiveness of pain meds &amp; prevents nausea due to the same pain meds. I have chemical burns in my throat, can't assalt these burns by vomiting, so Phenergan allows me to take medications for pain and protects my throat from vomiting. It makes me a little sleepy yet if taken w/food, no drowsiness is experienced. Has been a very beneficial drug for me.

Nausea and Vomiting	mcp2002, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/3/2012 5:50:16 PM	Phenergan works great for me when I have severe vomiting from severe migranes, I have had it both intervenously and in tablet form.  I just want everyone to know the dangers when receiving this drug intervenously.  This drug is to be dilutted and injected very slowly into a iv and not to be administered into a iv in the wrist or hand.   I have severe blood clots in my arm from receiving this medication through and iv.  the nurse did not follow the protocol and injected in very quickly into the iv in my wrist and it was not diluted at all.  Because of this i have a blood clot that goes from my wrist all the way up to my shoulder.  The vascular surgeon said i was lucky that i could have had severe tissue damage and gangreen could have set in and I could have lost my arm.   It has been 7 months since this happened and I still have the blood clot.  and have minimal use of my arm.   Because I do not have insurance I can not have the appropriate procedures done to remove the clots.

It kicked in about 20 minutes later but my stomach hurt so bad that it took about an hour to fall asleep. The only downside is the drowsiness the next day. I woke up at nine and by 12 I was still very drowsy.

Feel Like Throwing Up	Kta, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/7/2011 10:38:17 PM	My mother was very sick and went to the ER for fluids, help. She was given fluids and sent home with a prescription for this drug. My dad filled it, she took it around seven PM, then went to bed. An hour later I saw her crawling past my room, Dad in hot pursuit. She was saying she was hungry and wanted to see if she could fix something herself. Dad went in to the kitchen with her, a few minutes later I heard  a commotion. Dad came rushing into my room and asked me for help. Mom was talking incoherently and, not aware of that, was being combatative. I was concerned about the language issue, so began asking her questions. She answered simple questions ok with a few words confused. I then asked her to tell me about some events from the morning so she had to put together a coherent sequence of events. She got part way through ok, and then just lost it and began throwing totally unrelated phrases together, but thought she was making sense. We got her to the ER, the incoherence got worse, but by about ten the next morning, she was again lucid. The hospital kept her for three days, did lots of tests including looking for strokes and have found no reason for her sudden behavior and confusion. This scared the heck out of us. After reading the reviews of it, it should be taken off the market. My mom is 73.
Stuffy Nose	vlynnf, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/17/2011 8:29:57 AM	We used this for all 4 of our children, even under the age of two, without a hitch. As a nurse we used it on our pediatric patients in the hospital. I disagree that this should be completely banned for all children.  Big mistake!

Motion Sickness	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	4/11/2011 4:22:38 AM	When I went to the ER with severe abdominal pain the doctors ran some tests and I was prescribed Zofran for Nausea and Demerol for pain. After 30 hours or so, the Zofran/Demerol mix was counter productive. I went back to the ER and they prescribed Phenergan instead of Zofran with the Demerol. I took this mix of meds for the next week and did not have any more issues with nausea.

Recently had a parotidectomy or tumor resection of my parotid gland (IN MY NECK). Cancerous tumor came in which required 7 hour surgery and 25 radation treatments. I'm prescribed this Oral now, but scared to death of it! After reading the lawsuit from 2006, other comments/opinions of the drug. AVOID IT! Our local ER won't even offer it in IM. STAY AWAY from this. ALSO, this is the drug addicts BEST friend. Save yourself and body. Never administer or let anyone! God Bless

It usually stops the headache from progressing to full-blown migraine status, but I always end up losing a day in bed; totally out of it. It's worth it if it keeps the migraine at bay. The suppository form acts even faster. I only take it when my normal headache med (maxalt) doesn't do the trick and I feel a bad one coming on.  I always make sure I have some in my medicine cabinet.

Although be prepared to sleep, so make sure if you have small children someone else is home with you. It really is terrific for neusea.  Do Not DRIVE you will get very SLEEPY.

My neurologist gave this to me to treat nausea associated with my migraines.  After taking it, I began to have SCARY hallucinations, &quot;out-of-body&quot; sensations, and several fainting spells. I ended up at the ER with an IV in my arm to flush the drug out of my system.  Be very careful if you take this medication!!

In the hospital they gave me an IV injection of Reglan and Phenergan. My headache only improved 10% but what I got was a case of severe restless legs and arms. They could not stop twitching, I could not form my words and could get no rest. It was a nightmare!An hour late they gave me benedryl which heloed a tiny bit so I could rest for 10 minutes or so.

First time i took it i was knocked out with in 30 min and slept like a baby.  Every time I get severe nausea now i take a 12.5mg tablet.  Though i dont get nauseous often, this really helps when i do.  However only after taking 3 tablets i think im growing resident to it.  I don't get knocked out like the first two times.  Kind of wish i did, haha.

Other anti-histamines don't work, but a 25mg Phenergan eases it in a few minutes. I only use it at bedtime, so it's safe. I have also used it to stop my teenage son car-sickness with very good results, even if it makes him sleep the trip away.

Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/1/2010 7:07:50 PM	I took this throughout my pregnancy and also while recovering from a surgery.  I've taken it both orally and via IV and I have to say, I LOVE it!  I was recently diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and now understand why I always turned to phenergan, even when I wasn't nauseous.  It would knock me out for 12-16 hours at a time, and I'd always wake up feeling more calm and relaxed.  I know now that there are better medications more suited to treating anxiety, but phenergan got me through the roughest few months of a teen pregnancy and the aftermath of a horribly botched surgery.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone needing to get some deep sleep when suffering from anxiety or severe nausea.

My arm,wrist and forearm have swelled up 2 times thier normal size. My vains in my arm are all inflamed. I have now been diagnosed with thrombophllybitus. We have to wait and see if there is any lasting damage. This is 2 weeks later!! I don't recommend EVER being given this drug through a IV. My sister has had great results with the pill. Unfortunately I was vomiting and couldn't keep it down.
Nausea and Vomiting	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	2/8/2010 6:44:45 PM	IV Phenergan worked VERY well, but it caused my wrist and forearm to swell.  If you're in the hospital, ask to have it diluted and infused slowly from a bag.  Straight IV push can damage the tissue in your hand/wrist/arm.  Pill form works well also, not as well as IV, obvisouly, but it works.  I've tried everything - Raglan, Tigan, Zofran - this is the best, by far.

I recently just realized this started causing me some shortness of breath. NO doctor would tell me this. I kept wondering why I was short of breath at times. It's after I take this. It helps if you are really nauseated. That's all I'm taking it for, and sparingly now.

My 66 year old father was prescribed this medication as an anti-nausea for his terminal pancreatic cancer.  This medication makes him see things that aren't there........ like smoke, spider webs, bugs, hallucinate, talk to people who aren't there, sleep for hours on end, etc.  He is NOT on any other meds that have any similar side effects.  I am mortified that pregnant women are taking this medicataion.... What in the world is it doing to your unborn fetus?!?!?  I'd rather be sick for months and have a healthy baby than ever go through what my Dad has experienced without knowing what you are doing to your baby......... WOW.  Wake up ladies and do a little more research..... Remember Thalidomide babies???? Yikes.........
Motion Sickness	Susan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/4/2009 12:45:08 AM	I often get motion sickness, but taking this tablet helps relives. It also good to take when need to for vomit and nausea. If your doctor told you that you have acid reflux, it is also a sign of other illness like your gallbladder. It is best to see 2 different doctors and ask for ultrasound scan on your body to come to the point where doctor will find something wrong. First doctor is not perfect!! So go see the second doctor. Now that I was aware of second doctor finding something, I could not believe the first doctor found nothing and I wound up in ER 2 years later. So, always go to different doctor if same problem persist.

I have since used it for nausea due to pregnancy, as well as for motion sickness. I should be the spokes model for this company! Yes, it will put you in a 'coma' but when your neauseated that's where you'd rather be anyway!

My friend and I had the same OB/GYN and he prescribed this drug to both of us for morning sickness. Both of our sons have mis-matched ears.. when I tried to pick it up for the next child the pharmacist handed me a piece of information that said &quot;may cause deformalities in the fetus especially during the first trimester&quot; so I just told him to throw it away. Thankfully it was thier ears and nothing more serious. So far as we know her son is only 5 mine only 7.

Nausea and Vomiting	rrqzing, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	8/9/2009 9:01:29 AM	This medication really helped to relieve me from the severe nausea and vomiting. It totally calmed my stomach releived my aching and cramping, and all but totally alleviated my vomiting.It would probably would have worked better if I didn't have such a bad case of vomiting. If I could have kept it down and in my system longer. 
Nausea and Vomiting	darlingnikki88, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/8/2009 7:32:07 PM	I am a former opiate addict (morphine, oxycontin, heroin, hydrocodone, etc) and this was my BEST friend when I was in withdrawal. There are NO OTC nausea meds that work, this is the best thing since sliced bread as far as nausea meds go. I have been clean for 5 years and counting, and I give Phenergan lots of credit for helping me get through the darkest hours of withdrawal. Anyone out there going through this terrible disease, u r in my prayers and just know that there is hope and life after addiction. Most treatment centers will help people with no job or insurance, which is something I wish I had known when I was out there using. Also consider methadone therapy if u can get the money, it saved my life! God bless and stay strong, you are not alone!  :)

I was suffereng from HELLP Syndrome, and was so nauseated and vomitous, that I was at the point where I was throwing up bile.  One of the Dr.'s put me on a Phenergan drip.  In less than 15 miutes of being administered the Phen.,I had a horrible allergic reaction and was had severe full body convulsions.  To help with the convulsions, nurses put body length padding by te railings of my bed   It did nothing for my nauseau.  It was soon removed fom my IV, and I was administered something different.  The new nauseau  medicine worked wonderfully and helped me to sleep very well.

Although I still felt the headache, I didn't care that I had it. I also used this medication to help with severe morning sickness when I was pregnant. It was a life-saver for me as I was sick all day everyday.

I must warn, however, that the drowsiness is pretty bad.  I couldn't drive or do anything important while taking this drug, but in my mind, it was a small price to pay considering the miracle it did for my mornign sickness.  
Nausea and Vomiting	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	6/9/2009 11:09:32 AM	I have taken phenergan for stomach problems and nausea for a long time - but much more often recently.  I am losing my hair at an alarming rate (I am female) and my hairdresser suggested yesterday it might be the phenergan.  She said her father took it and not only went bald but lost the hair on his arms and legs.  Has anyone else had this problem?  And if I quit taking it, will my hair come back?

Feel Like Throwing Up	lovelyday, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/21/2009 5:02:13 PM	I became very nauseous after a bad sunburn. Phenergan really calmed me and my stomach and I was able to eat again 6 hours after taking the drug. It also knocked me out for 4 hours. If you have time to lay at home all day, Phenergan is a very effective for nausea.
Nausea and Vomiting	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/21/2009 12:15:34 AM	I took phenergan as a last resort to try and treat my severe nausea and vomiting.  I am allergic to all of the other anti-nausea meds.  I took this med and had horrible horrible side effects.  I was having vision changes, dizziness, felt really out of it and loopy.  Will never take it again.  Did nothing to help my nausea.

I am on percocet 10mg for pain. If I take the percocet alone it makes me itch. If I take phenergan with the percocet it helps control my pain better and keeps the itching away.
Nausea and Vomiting	hkf, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	4/12/2009 11:25:55 PM	I had previously vomitted twice. Remembered I had Phenergan in the fridge and took 1/2 a pill with water. About 30 minutes later threw all that up and took another 1/2 pill. I was nauseous for a long time. On a scale of 1-5, I was about a 3. It made me sleepy so I stayed in bed the rest of the day and night. In the late evening I took another 1/2 pill still feeling nauseous but not bad enough to vomit. Woke up the next day feeling weak but the nausea had pretty much all subsided.

I take half a pill (12.5 mg) when I am nauseous, and that works perfect for me. I can still function normally with that dose.
Nausea and Vomiting	VogueIsMe, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	11/16/2008 1:40:21 AM	My Mom took this &amp; became CRAZY! She saw my deceased Dad &amp; her deceased parents standing in her room &amp; reaching out to pull her up, &amp; than was talking to them out loud. Than she thought she was still in the hospital &amp; had terrable nightmares. She refused to ever go back in her bedroom after that. Than she accused her lovely home nursing aide of threatening her to put her in an institution, than begged me to never do that to her. OMG no-one ever said that to her. (This went on for a week) She got all mixed up on her pills &amp; took Immodium constantly, thinking it was her daily meds. She was arrogant, nasty &amp; mad at everyone. Than she mixed up everything.She slept 22 out of 24 hours a day. It was a nightmare with her. I took her off of that medication &amp; almost everything else too. After about a week Mom was almost back to herself..thank God, although she was still very sick. Unfortunately, our beautiful Mother died 3 weeks ago. Her doctors never saw what was wrong with her until it was too late. It shouted at them in her CT scans &amp; MRI's. They missed it.How bad is that.  
Nausea and Vomiting	MaMa, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	11/14/2008 10:41:33 PM	With only two doses of this medication my mother became delirious, anxious and paranoid.  She saw children under the bed, on the ceiling and heard them talking.  She was hospitalized and knew that the hospital staff was trying to poison her.  She didnt want to talk but wanted to write everything.  Her writings looked like a three-year had written it.  She saw people at the bedroom window talking and smoking.  It took her almost two weeks before she was somewhat her self again.  I would defiantly not recommend this drug for the elderly.

Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy	prego, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	9/8/2008 4:00:35 PM	I am nine weeks pregnant and it didn't help at all with my nausea.  it made it worse actually.  Sure it made me tired but when I woke up I was still sick and my legs and arms felt really funny for about two days.  I have actually found a more natural way of dealing with nausea called Preggi Pops.  Whether it's the natural oils in it or just the basis of having something in my mouth to continually swallow I care not.  It works and thats what matters.  Everyone is different of course.

Now I take it nightly as a sleep aid, 3 tablets in the evening. Sleep is very important to me, and phenergan definitely helps with that, while still useful for nausea.

Nausea and Vomiting	GimpMan, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	3/20/2008 2:22:30 AM	I have taken numerous medications for severe bouts of nausea for over two years now, and Phenegran has been by far the best medication for me.  Initially, this medication will make you feel either drunk or sleepy, but as with most medications, the side-effects will diminish with continued use.  Lastly, given that Phenegran dramatically reduces your breathing, please do not use more than 50 mg unless your doctor has prescribed a higher dose.  Phenegran has been great for eliminating my nausea, and the side-effects will reduce significantly over time.  So, if you have chronic nausea, Phenegran might be a wise choice.
Nausea and Vomiting	Penelope, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	45-54	3/6/2008 12:11:10 PM	I have taken the pill form of medication for years. I take it for nausea and vomiting associated with migraines. It makes me vomit if I take it with food or migraine medication, on an empty stomach and makes me very tired. The trick is to get some into your system for initial relief which in my case can take 1-3 hours. I take 1/2 of the 25 mg. tablet and usually throw up. Once the nausea is under control take the second 1/2 total 25 mg. Never take more than what is prescribed of this drug is not one to play with. Even if you throw it up some has entered the blood stream!

I had bad morning sickness up until my sixth month of pregnancy. At first, it was very difficult for me to stay awake, but the more I took it the better I was. I was a bit loopy if I stayed awake, but I figure thats a lot better than not being able to keep meals down.
