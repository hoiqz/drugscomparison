One of my fellow scientist  recommended this supplement to maintain good blood vessel wall health and prevent plaque. BUT, did not listen (too busy);however, 10 years later, was dx: with MS, became fatigued, overweight plus developed type II diabetes. Was on  a lot of meds, three shots per week,  (at times) IV of steroids per month. Tested sugar twice daily. Started taking CP almost two years ago, lost 35 lbs. (size 18 to 10),  no more sugar diabetes type II, (genetic in my family), no more high priced  cholesterol drugs, it was 300 or less, now 142! I need to exercise to stay healthy and loss of weight has allowed the comfort of MOVING and making me feel good again.  I DO NOT SELL this product but I saw comments on web md and wanted to add my own 2 cents.  I take at least 400 mg day in the evening before meals.

I developed two raised (non-pus filled) bumps on my face. I immediately stopped using the supplement to allow the bumps to clear.  After waiting 2 months after bumps cleared, to make sure there was a correlation between supplement and bumps, I tried the supplement once more.  Two days later, I developed newly formed bumps on my face.  After stopping the supplement, my skin is normal and clear once again.

Both Metformin and then Glucotrol 5 mg made me feel weird. I heard somewhere about C.P. I added 400 mg to my morning regimen of a multivitamin, additional E, C, D and CoQ10.  Within 4 hours my insulin level dropped too much.  I thought it was a fluke, so I repeated the next day. Same thing. Today I only took 200mg my level went down to a normal reading.  No doubt in my mind this works

After being chromium for 1 yr, my bad cholesterol came down to 233. Unbelievable. My doctors were shocked and had me re-do the bloodwork. Again 233. I would recommend to anyone who doesn't want to taking stronger prescribed medication.

It was suggested by my chiropractor that i might be in insuline resistance (stage before diabetes)because of multiple symptoms I was having. I read everything I could about diabetes hoping i could cure myself, I read that chromium picolinate could help metabolize blood sugar (we all need more metabolism) I tried it and I started eating (A diabetic diet) every 2 1/2 to 3 hours, my metabolism went through the roof and I've lost over 20 pounds in about a month and a half.  My headachs have become non-existant as well. I only take 1-2 400mcg/day.  NEVER over do anything that works.

And a 82 year old lady in the bus told me that, Chromium Picolinate 200mcg was her secret in keeping the blood sugar regulated. We exchanged phone numbers and she explained her ritual for the past forty plus years with diabetes and how it saved her from many medications that would eventually mess one or several of her vital organs. I just started a month ago and so far its been working. Now I need to add physical activity to lose weight and keep complete control of my diabetes. I'll report again my findings in six months.
