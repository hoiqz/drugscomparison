Breast Cancer that has Spread to the Bones	austindeer08, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/4/2011 9:53:42 PM	Along with daily Femara since Dec. 2010, I have been given Aredia {via port infusion]every 4 weeks since Jan. 2011 after being diagnosed with breast cancer and bone mets 5 mos ago. I have experienced no addit'l pain, infections, or problems whatsoever with Aredia. Each month, I am gaining more and more strength, adding weight, which my onocologist attributes to the Femara, not the Aredia. And, since I have Stage IV cancer, the Aredia and Femara are basically slowing the cancer and making me feel better. My oncologist says invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is still life-threatening, and it's going to kill me in 2-3 years...

Lesions in the Bone of the Disease Multiple Myeloma	stavrogin road, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	45-54	9/1/2010 4:01:40 PM	Coming up on my 5th monthly treatment, 90 mg, by IV over 2 hours. I seem to be tolerating well, though I feel a bit run down and not as mentally sharp as I expect myself to be. Could be the treatment, the disease or even a bit of depression. It appears to be holding my bones together, at least as much as the myeloma seems to disolve them. 
Breast Cancer that has Spread to the Bones	Kohkum, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	55-64	1/25/2010 7:02:53 PM	I have been receiving Pamidronate by IV since Aug. '05 along with Femera to treat breast cancer bone metastases with wonderful results. It appears I've been cancer free for a year now! The only reason I didn't give full marks was because I now have poor veins making it difficult to give me an IV. Don't know if that is related to the Pamidronate or not.

Breast Cancer that has Spread to the Bones	Janet, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/11/2008 12:11:45 PM	I was originally diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000.  Earlier this year (2008)I found out it spread to my liver and my spine (small tumors).  I am currently taking Taxotere (chemo) and Pamidronate.  The last PET scan I had showed no signs of cancer! I had a port installed in my chest area to make it easier for me to get the treatments and since Pamidronate is a long term option for me at this time.  Side affects:  I do have some back aches and I do get light headed at times.

I decided to skip one month and was in quite a bit more pain than ever before. So, obviously, I am back to taking on 4-week intervals.
Other	Shriners Kid, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	2/5/2008 4:36:20 PM	I have been receiving PADRIMONATE IV infusions since 2003 for polyostotic fibrous dysplasia.  Initially I was on a quarterly schedule.  My bone density has improved tremendously over time and now I am on an annual dosage.  I have had only one fracture since starting Pamidronate and my femur healed perfectly.  I feel very fortunate and thank my medical team for everything.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	1/28/2008 12:42:37 PM	I found this medication to be a total waist of time and money.  I found that the side effects if you have Osteogenesis Imperfecta is very bad.  This medication/treatment prevents healing of the bones and while it does make you break less, when you do break it gets worse.  I would recommend that everyone with OI on this medication/treatment to stop NOW before its to late.
