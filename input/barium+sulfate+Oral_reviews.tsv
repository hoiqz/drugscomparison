I hope my tests come back better than my gas came out. I hope they can come up with a better formula that doesn't have such an explosive affect. I now need a hemoriodectomy!

I had Redi-Cat 2 liquid and was called a Berry Smoothie.  I took one 450 mil bottle the night bfore my test, them 1/2 bottle one hour before my test an then finished the rest of the second bottle just before I started my cat scan. No problem with loose stools or vomiting. I would take this liquid again if I had do do it over in the future.

The bottle did not indicate a flavor but it had a faint orange taste. Not really very bad but it made my throat burn somewhat. Take another bottle in the morning. I just made up my mind that no matter what the taste to just swig it down. Apparently I had a better experience than other people.

I was told to drink it in 20 min. from start time. It wasn't too bad getting it down,  I got through the scan all right, but then got a horrid headache, and the worst EXPLOSIVE diarhea you can imagine ... was miserable for the next 12 hours ... you would do well to wear Depends and take along an extra set of clothing!!!!  I will NEVER drink this stuff again.

I thought drinking the stuff would be the worst part. The cramps, gas and horrible headache that started 3 hours after drinking it proved me wrong. I'll never do this again unless it is life or death.

I used the straw and took like shots of it and did whatever I could to get it down. I had the redi brand and it was in citrus flavor...the after taste is what makes it the worst. I am not sure the best way to drink it is but it is horrible. I still have a whole bottle to drink...i am so not looking forward to it at all I am hoping I will be able to get it down.

I was expecting the barium to be disgusting but was actually pleasantly surprised. I mean it is not like it is the best drink in the world.  I started to drink it at 8am this morning and finished at 801am.  I suggest the straw method!  I am only ten minutes into it and have not experinced any side effects yet.  I recommend the Redi-Cat 2, berry smoothie.

The barium actually stopped up the toilet at work - so embarrassing!  Drink plenty of water and maybe a laxative and don't return to work for 24 hours!

Not like my first experience!!!

The tech's at the CT facility were telling me two different times of taking it, so I did my own thing and took it all the morning of the test.  One said night before take one bottle, no bfast, then the other said nothing after midnight, and no bfast, drink one hour before test???  Make up your minds!  It tastes like crap, no matter what you do.  It's thick and that makes it harder to swallow.  My stomach is cramping for diarrhea and I hope it doesn't start during the test! Nasty stuff.

Both times were gross.  The consistency of the liquid is okay, but the taste is terrible! I have read reviews about other brands that sound as if they would taste better, but I haven't been lucky enough to find out for myself.

(half 3 hours before and the other half 1 hour before).  Product was Readi-Cat 2 &quot;Creamy Vanilla Smoothie&quot;.  I chilled it overnight and drank it from a glass - tasted like melted low-fat soft-serve ice cream. I had no problems with vomiting, cramps or diarrhea.  I would take this brand/flavor again if I ever need another CAT scan.

This did work for the most part.  It was not bad tasting like I thought it would be.  I did refrigerate it, however I could not drink it without stopping as it was so cold that I'd get a brain freeze.  I did use the straw and it went down very easily.  I was all worked up for nothing.  Really, it didn't taste bad at all.  I wouldn't worry if I had to do it again.

Process of Making X-Rays of Stomach or Intestines		5	4	4			7/17/2008 12:44:37 PM	There is a trick to taking this medication that will make it much easier to swallow.  First, it needs to be cold.  Second, put a straw in it and place the straw towards the back of your tongue.  Third, clamp down on the straw as you suck the medication.  Finally, keep swallowing until it is gone.  I hardly tasted it until I opened my mouth after it was finished.  Remember....don't stop until it is gone.....the straw is the key!
