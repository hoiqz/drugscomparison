Acne	rkc, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	9/14/2012 1:35:04 PM	I have only been using Epiduo for 5 days now but have already noticed a huge improvement in my skin. The first day i maybe broke out with a few more pimples than usual but they were also smaller than usual and went away in a couple days. Now the Epiduo has almost completely cleared my cheeks where the pimples bother me the most and my forehead is coming along really well too. Its just my chin than still has quite a few but that is always my worst area. I was prescribed Epiduo when i had  sudden horrible breakout after going off birth control pill. My whole life i have only ever had mild acne until this breakout that I would classify as moderate. I did not suffer from the initial breakout really (fingers crossed it doesn't come up in a week or so). It is drying and has made my skin extremely red (but I am about the palest person alive so I think on most people it wouldnt be as bad) but if you apply moisturizer on top of it or in the morning it helps a lot. And make sure to use the smallest amount possible and avoid areas close to your eyes. 
Acne	clearskin, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	8/25/2012 8:30:27 PM	Went to my doctors for a yearly checkup. She noticed I was breaking out a little bit so she gave me some samples of epiduo gel. Used it the first night. In three days my pimples were noticeably smaller, less red, and dried out. I did get a burning sensation and flakiness around my eyes, nose, and mouth even while using moisturizer, but thats okay because its just a side effect. After about a week I had no flakiness/dryness and my skin was acne free!! The red marks from previous acne scars were still visible but I think only time and applying lemon juice and sunscreen will make those go away. Every morning I wash my face with Cetaphil and apply the Cetaphil moisturizer which has spf 30 and if I'm going somewhere outside, I will put on water babies noncomodegonic spf 50 sunscreen. In the evenings, I wash my face with cetaphil cleanser, wait for my face to dry, apply epiduo gel all over avoiding eye area, and apply the cetaphil moisturizer. you can use epiduo on your back too!!!
Acne	kyliek20, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	8/15/2012 10:27:48 AM	I am a sixteen year old girl who suffered from moderate acne. I would break out A LOT on my cheeks to a point where I wouldnt want to go out in public without any makeup on. It was embaressing especially during times where I wanted to go to the water park or pool, and my makeup would get washed off. I had tried a ton of DIY remedies and none of them worked, along with just about every drug store face wash or acne control system. I decided to go to the dermatologist to see if they could give me any advice. They perscribed me with epiduo and after the first week of using it i saw results. My acne had cleared up a ton. I still had some mild scarring, but that was easily covered with a small amount of concealer. After the fist week, I found myself going out without any foundation on and that was a great feeling (: It didnt dry out my skin too bad either. I still break out, but nothing close to the way I had before using epiduo. I am very happy with my results and encourage people to give epiduo a chance!

Just a word of advice that I wish I would have known, DO NOT APPLY TO A SUNBURNT FACE!!!

Acne	LaLaLa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	6/6/2012 10:09:26 PM	I'm 28 and have sensitive skin (allergic to sulfa) with (hormonal) acne on my forehead, and then developed perioral dermatitis. Have used Epiduo for 2-3 months and haven't really seen a difference. It might help prevent new acne from developing but doesn't really help resolve current acne. I used Differin in college and it worked very well, so I don't know why Epiduo doesn't work that well on me. I hope it works for you. I am know on oral Monodox and Finacea, and still use Epiduo just in case. We'll see how this combination works.
Acne	prettypink, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	6/1/2012 10:43:22 AM	I am 22 and I have had acne since I was 13, but it is very mild now. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and I am allergic to sulfa, so my skin can severe reactions to topical acne medications, ie. burning, inflamed, flaking, cracked skin. So far I have not seen any negative reactions to Epiduo. My skin is smoother and softer and it seems to be keeping my acne under control. Follow the directions - use ONLY a pea size amount each time you apply. That's really all you need!
Acne	rmd, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/17/2012 11:51:27 AM	it takes about 4 to 8wks to get my face almost 80 to 90 percent clear. pimples come out, but is easy to prick. be sure to wash hands and clean your pricking thing. im satisfied with the result. im just wondering and a little bit scared if i discontinue it, will it relapse? iv read some article that it should be at least used for 6mos to prevent relapse. my skin is getting clear and i love epiduo!
Acne	You are reading this, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	7-12	4/22/2012 2:50:30 PM	I LOVEEEEE Epiduo! I'm only 12, but i've had horrible acne since I turned 10, and I felt really self conscience around my friends because they all had perfect, beautiful skin. 2 months ago, I went to a dermatologist for the first time, and he recommended Epiduo along with the Cetaphil cleanser. Epiduo was really easy to use, just cleansing with Cetaphil, and putting on Epiduo every night. Now, My skin is beautiful, and I rarely ever get breakouts, and when I do, they're very small. I would highly recommend Epiduo to anyone.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	2/26/2012 12:44:30 PM	Epiduo has made my face very dry, but if you were prescribed it, the doctor should have gave you an amazing moisturizer. The only place it really bothered me was under my eyes, right above my check bones. I would recommend this product if you are patient and are dedicated to fixing your acne. There is not a product out there that will magically poof your acne away, so be patient.  
Acne	hannah :),  Female  (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female		1/13/2012 5:09:21 PM	im only 13 and i had some pretty bad acne. i tried multiple things but nothing worked. epiduo was my last hope and it works great! yes i had dry flaky skin about for about 1 month. but it really helped. i recommend it to anyone
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/9/2012 10:03:13 PM	After 10 years of trying everything from drugstore treatments to natural products for my moderate cystic acne, I finally decided to see a dermatologist about 3 weeks ago. He prescribed Doxicycline (oral antibiotic) and Epiduo. After the first couple days, my acne really started clearing up. However, after a week, my skin started getting red, irritated and breaking out. Having been warned that this would happen, I kept using the product. Now, my skin has really cleared and the sensitivity has decreased significantly. It's been 3 weeks now and, I feel this product is really working. The true test will be if it continues to work.Oh, one other thing I have noticed is that some of my more minor scarring has started to fade which is wonderful!
Acne		5	5	5			1/1/2012 4:59:17 PM	I could not go out of my house, even to the grocery store, without having to use concealer for all of my blemishes. After not being able to take it anymore, I went to a dermatologist, where she prescribed Epiduo gel. I was wary at first. It said it would possibly make my skin sting, and redden, because of the Benzoyl Peroxide in it. I have extremely sensitive skin, so I definitely was scared. From my first application on, not once did my skin redden or sting. I was impressed. After 6 weeks on the product, I didn't see too much improvement, and being impatient like I am, I got a little frustrated. I continued the use however, and I started seeing a change around the 8th week. After the twelve weeks were up, my skin was almost completely clear. It's been a few months now, and I am still using it every day, and I have never felt better in my skin. I don't have to put on make-up or feel like everyone is staring at my newest blemish. Epiduo changed my life. Just wait out the 12 weeks. You'll see improvement.
Acne	adamarie, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	12/4/2011 10:53:29 PM	When I started Epiduo I wanted to never use it again because the first 4-5 weeks I felt like crying. I had breakouts that I've never seen before, also my face was itchy, it burned and was peeling. But after that, I started to see some results. Few months later my skin was perfect! I was finally so satisfied to be going &quot;au naturale&quot; everywhere. This really does wonders.Just be patient, the first weeks your skin is adapting to the product, you'll see results soon. I'm really thankful for Epiduo.

Acne	epiduosucks!, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	6/17/2011 11:19:37 PM	Acne is a big problem in my life and I had been so excited to try epiduo because it worked well on my friend, however this drug burned my face making it red and peeling. I do not recommend this product because i think it put my face in a worse position then before I used it. If you are looking for a cheaper more effective way to treat acne I recommend Kate Somerville's Erad-i-Kate, I switched to this product after using epiduo and it works wonders!
Acne	dillydibley, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	13-18	5/28/2011 7:25:49 PM	this stuff does not get rid of ance, it drys out your skin, makes it red, itchy, and burn!  it did nothing to help zits it simply sits there, infact i think it made my skin look worse.  if you go to the store and buy a cheap store brand acne cream, it works better than this stuff, infact it works really well.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/13/2011 1:40:47 PM	i love this stuff. i've had acne since i was 12 or 13. at times it's been mild and others it's been severe. recently, it was moderate and sort of under control due to birth control. i still broke out almost every day though, and was desperate for something that would clear me up completely once and for all. this stuff did it and for the first time i can walk around without makeup and feel confident. i broke out pretty badly after a few weeks, which i thought was strange but most people experience an initial breakout (plus i was under a lot of stress). bottom line is this stuff works
Acne	alexandra , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	4/30/2011 2:43:41 PM	i've been on epiduo for 5 weeks, and the only difference i see in my skin is that it's red, and feels sun burnt. this goes away after moisturizing. I'm actually EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. i was excepting much more, and literally i dont see any visible results at all. OH EXCEPT... the break outs that i do get now are huge pimples, which i wouldn't get before. i have mild acne
Acne	kaitlin t., 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/22/2011 9:06:04 PM	When I was 16 my acne was horrible and I began to get scars. After trying dozens of acne treatments i went to the dermatologist and got epidou which changed my life! I have been acne free for almost 2 years. I looked like hell for the first 2 months but it was all worth it! Thank you epiduo!!
Acne	art4KPD, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	13-18	2/6/2011 4:01:31 PM	So far, IT is working pretty well! There is no irritation and my just looks cleaner. I have also been using moisturizer in the morning and Epiduo at night. I recommend it!
Acne	BioMedEgr, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	19-24	12/9/2010 2:35:32 PM	I am using Epiduo in combination with a oral medication. There was a period of time where I had not gotten a refill on my oral medication, and Epiduo was the only medication treating my acne. I tried Epiduo prior to taking Accutane, and, although Epi. helped, it could not control the rate of break outs. I took Accutane because my face eventually turned into a zit.Being a couple years older and beyond that embarrassing stage of puberty, I am back to using Epiduo and I wouldn't leave home with out using it.Epiduo definitely reduced the severity of my break outs. There is no question about that. It has dried out my skin for sure, and I have had mild peeling where my acne is located. But, this is the only side affect I have noticed, which is really not a big deal at all.My recommendation is to use the product as it tells you to. Remove the oils from your hands and face before applying the Epiduo. This way you have clear pores for the medication to get into. 
Acne	PatienceIsAVirtue, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	13-18	12/1/2010 7:50:41 AM	my first 3 weeks on this medication made my life a living hell. i broke out like never before (i have had acne since i was 10 yrs old). i'm on my 5th week now and i can see the difference on my skin. i still get a few breakouts, but nothing like before. my skin is calmer and clearer now. i can actually feel that if i keep on using it for a couple more weeks things would get better. so for those who are planning on using this product, get yourselves ready for the initial breakouts that it may cause you, but don't give up on it. it's worth the shot and wait. :)
Acne	Pancho, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	5	Male	13-18	11/11/2010 11:30:15 PM	Im a 15 yr old latin boy with severe acne, my dermatologist told me that if epiduo doesnt clear my acne in a period of 6 weeks, ill have to use accutane and i didnt want that so i agreed on epiduo. its been 3 weeks now. the acne on my face has been reduced greatly, altho the side effects have been hard for me to keep up with this medication cycle. this happens every other day i use the medication. i put it on, and the next day my face is red, irritated, and flaky. it feels more like a severe sunburn. i use the medication 2 days, then the next 5 days im suffering from irritation.

Acne	Walker439, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	10/5/2010 1:38:52 PM	My dermatologist gave me a bunch of Epiduo samples about a year ago and I didn't really give it enough time to do anything. I just went back to the doc a little over a week ago and she told me to use it again. I have used this gel every night for 8 nights and have had no major problems. After about a week, my skin did start to burn a little and it is a little dry, but not enough to really bother me. I just put on my moisturizer (Aveeno) and really try not to touch my face all day. I think this product will work well, but you must stick with it! 
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	13-18	9/14/2010 1:54:54 AM	well i started this 4 days ago and all it has done so far is make my face very red and extremely dry and peely and it stings like crazy now whenever i wash my face...   but idk because my dad used the same type of thing when he was younger and he said to give it time so thats what ill do
Acne	EpiduoPatient3000, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	9/7/2010 6:00:39 PM	Made me break out in the first couple of weeks. It's been about four to five weeks and my face isn't as clear as I'd hoped. I didn't know it would take this long for it to work. Hopefully, it wont take long to make my face completely clear. I'm dissapointed in this product. 
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	13-18	7/16/2010 10:09:56 PM	I had cystic acne along with many blackheads and whiteheads which would become very enflamed. After getting Epiduo, it took about three weeks for the results to really show. I would occasionally get small whiteheads and it did not help with the blackheads, but my skin was less bumpy. At the two month mark, my acne was almost completely gone, and I've had maybe one or two pimples since then! Epiduo is great, although it does nothing to remove blackheads/post-acne scarring. It's perfect in combination with microdermabrasions! I would definitely recommend using this product.
Acne	lisa, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/25/2010 9:31:29 AM	I am so astounded that my skin looks the way it does.  I am a 21 year old female and I really thought I had seen it all and tried it all.   Use every night and you should see results.  It is 6 weeks into the treatment and I don't have any visible pimples.   Trust me, the first few weeks can be a little disheartening.  A few things that happened to me (on &amp; off) during the first few weeks were that my skin dried, burning (preventable if you put on JUST the right amount to cover your skin), and my acne worsened.  There were a few weeks when I seemed to break out everywhere (the research says it's because it is purging your skin of all the dirt build up and bacteria and whatnot).  I am very happy with the results and I have even been complimented about my skin!  Ah!  That has never happened in my life.  I am so much more comfortable taking picture now that I know any light will make my skin look flawless :-)
Acne	 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female		6/13/2010 9:20:42 PM	I have been using Epiduo since January.  Basically, it goes in cycles--some weeks my face is clear, others it's not at all.  Not happy with it, and definitely wouldn't pay for it without the discount card.
Acne	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	5/28/2010 7:40:43 PM	Reduced my mild / cystic adult acne by atleast 90% in about 2 weeks.  It did leave my skin dry, a bit red, and a little painful for the first few days but I got used to i and it has worked great for months now.
Acne	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	5/13/2010 8:03:05 PM	Iam a 47 y.o. african american with oily skin and acne problems for 15 yrs. I recently tried epiduo paired with finacia and initially it burned ferociously and still do, but not as much. I also broke out a bit more and my skin became scaly. dry and irritated.  I am sticking to using it at night, because it heals new acne very quickly. Minimal sun exposure is a must, so please use a high spf sunscreen. It is vital if hyperpigmentation is a problem. I use cetaphil sunscreen, spf 50 as it is non-comedegenic, so not supposed to clog pores.  I felt like it caused some pore blockage but the two medications I'm using zapped it very quickly. the sunscreen serves as a moisturizer during the day as well. Most of all, be very gentle to your skin, because it is like royalty. Face it, we don't have normal skin like so many others, so we have to go the extra mile to pamper it more. What do you have to lose besides healthier and beautiful looking skin.
Acne	regina, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	4/30/2010 5:23:06 PM	I started using epiduo just 2 DAYS AGO! my dermatologist had said that this is what she uses, so how could i turn it down? she gave me the free samples, i went home that night, used it. woke up, used it again last night, and woke up this morning with LESS acne! the dermatologist said that it can take up to a month or so to see effects, but HA! try just 2 DAYS! so far i am VERY satisfied with this treatment, and i VOW that i will use epiduo every day as long as i live. GO TO YOUR DERMATOLOGIST, SAY I WANT TO TRY EPIDUO. TAKE IT HOME, AND LOVE THE FAST EFFECTS! i finally realize WHY they call it &quot;EPI-DUO&quot; 1, because its an EPIC treatment, and works VERY well, and 2, because it gets RID of old acne, PREVENTS NEW ACNE, and LEAVES YOUR SKIN SOFT! ha! it should be called epiTRIO!!! i highly recommend this, and i am only 16, so you KNOW this really works! 3 LIFE CHANGING TIPS FOR YOU-  1. GET IT, 2. TRY IT, and 3. LOVE YOUR NEW SKIN!!!!

Acne	Clazies, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	4/20/2010 1:03:26 AM	I have been using Epiduo for around three weeks now.  My skin becomes dry around my nose and chin areas after nightly use.  HOWEVER, I find that skipping a night of application and exfoliating then deep moisturizing, the dryness is gone by morning.  So if over-drying occurs, I stop use for one day, then continue the next night.  The results are great!  My whiteheads are almost completely gone and I've only had 2 blemishes within the past two weeks (and they were gone within 2 days!)  I would definitely recommend Epiduo for anyone with mild-moderate acne! 
Acne	Nikki02, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	13-18	4/19/2010 8:22:59 PM	I have been using this product for about a week now, and my face is red, i have a rash by my jawline, itchy, burning, and peeling. I have been using it once a day before I go to bed. But these side effects are killing me! I am embarassed of my face and I can't put any makeup on because my face is so dry and peeling. I don't know if i should keep using it or stop. None of the reviews I have read seem to have as bad of symptoms as I am experiencing. These symptoms have been going on for about 5 days. I am going to take a break from it tonight and see if that does anything. Should I stop using the product, or will these symptoms go away soon?
Acne	mdewchick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	4/11/2010 9:08:18 PM	I just started taking this medication in addition to Doxycycline orally.  So far, three days in and I have noticed more teeny white heads appearing than normal.  However, the hard deep pustle type zits I had have started to dry out and heal up.  I am very optimistic that between these two medications my acne will clear up.  I haev had acne since a teenager, but about 10 years ago I took accutane and it made a huge difference.  In the last two years I went off birth control because we are trying to have kids.  That has caused my hormones to go wild and I have been experiencing large, cystic acne on my neck, chest, and occasionally on my face.  My derm says that all of this is hormonal and not related to any type of face wash or activity that I am doing - that was refreshing!  I promise to update after a few weeks of taking both drugs.
Acne	7-12 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	7-12	2/10/2010 3:34:54 PM	With this product it's very important you read the instructions. Only apply once a day. Only use about a pea sized amount on each area of your face (cheeks, forehead, chin) most importantly, do not expose yourself to sunlight when it's on your face. I found that if you just follow the directions the product works quite well. I still get an occassional pimple but for the most part it has worked well.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	1/31/2010 12:10:03 AM	I have been using this gel for 6 weeks and have yet to see results and now I am figuring that if it hasn't worked yet, it's not going to. The acne on my face has gotten worse with using this product, if anything.

My pediatrician recommended this as an experimental treatment. Within a month, I had gone from having thirty or more pimples on my face, to having maybe fifteen, then gradually they stopped appearing. Today, I have beautifully clear skin that glows, but occasionally has a blemish, but we're all human, right?
Acne	KurlyChild, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	12/28/2009 3:05:46 PM	Worst medication ever for sensitive, combination skin.  Made me break out like I have never before, with large red cystic acne all over my face.  Do not recommend for sensitive skin.

I recently visited the philippines and started to break out ridiculously! When I got back I was prescribed epiduo I was a little sceptical because for the 1st week and a half it made me break out more. I cld my dr and he reassured me that like with everything else that works it gets worse b4 it gets better.

Acne	jyoungblood, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	13-18	11/30/2009 11:38:52 PM	I have been taking Minocycline for the past few months with NO change whatsoever in my acne.  I went to the dermatologist and he decided to pair the antibiotics with Epiduo. Within, the first few days i encountered redness, itching, peeling, and dryness.  These side effects were the trade off for having the extremely clear skin that I now have.  My face immediately started to clear up and the pimples, blakcheads, and cysts immediately started decreasing in size or just going away completely.  A great product!!!
Acne	brendacs, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/23/2009 6:16:15 AM	Epiduo has changed my life. I started having acne problems during my pregnancy 10 years ago. before that it was rare if i had any acne. for the past 10 years ive tried everything from drugstore to infomercial products,natural products etc. NOTHING has helped in the long run. With this product my face cleared up in a matter of days. Ive been using this for 2 months every night and sulfacetamide during the day. i have not had one single break out!! i used to get a new one daily, not only that but it was always large cystic acne. i love this product

Acne	dhunttt, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	13-18	10/15/2009 9:55:45 PM	i started using this about two weeks ago, and the night before last i used it and it burned horribly, and itched, and i woke up yesterday morning, with a red itchy, bumpy face, not acne, but micro scaly bumps everywhere, and it looked liek i'd been in the sun a week.
Acne	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/15/2009 12:53:50 PM	I am a 45 yr old woman who has suffered from acne for the last 10 years. This so far is the only thing that has worked.  My face is clearing up pretty fast!  Thanks to the makers of Epiduo!  LOVE IT!
Acne	rina, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/5/2009 11:40:40 PM	This is the BEST acne medication I have ever tried. For background info, I will consider my face is relatively oily and always breakout. I have been having acne for 9 years now. I have tried everything from proactive, aczone, acnefree, murad, clearasil, exposed, ddf, etc and etc... nothing really works. They will either works well in first few weeks and then doesn't work anymore. But i have been using epiduo for few months now and my skin has been acne free ever since. My recommendation to keep acne free is that first to drink lots of water, don't wash your face in the morning just splash of water is enough and don't put too much stuffs on your face keep it clean, only wash your face at night and apply oil-free moisturizer and last step apply thin layer epiduo and you are good to go. 
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	10/4/2009 5:25:41 PM	I have been using Epiduo for at least 4 months now and its the best medication i have ever used in my entire life. My skin is very sensitive and this product is the only one that doesn't irritate my skin,for me it really works. It started working since the first day and everyone can see the difference they tell me my skin is beautiful I'm really glad I found Epiduo, even in those days of the months my skin stays clean.
Acne	kbeck13, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	13-18	9/22/2009 2:13:42 AM	I was prescribed this topical plus some minocycline. Nothing happened. Then the minocycline was replaced with some sulpher thing. not any better. then i decided my doctor didn't know what he was talking about and stopped the pills alltogether and started applying epiduo morning AND night. face is almost completely clear its amazing. i have had severe acne for two years and its finally gone!
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/18/2009 7:39:21 AM	I been using this now for four months. But the first couple weeks I already started seeing results. I was told to only use a thin coat...went home and did otherwise and had the worst experience ever! felt like i dipped my face in CLOROX! but other than that my sever acne was going away with the help of minoclyclin and OF COURSE CETAPHIL FACE WASH!! 
Acne	shelsea_722, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	9/8/2009 2:43:45 PM	have been using this with aczone at night for 9 days.. has been a little stinging when applying but overall my acne is drying up.i have made sure only using a pea sized amount.. not much more. there is some new acne.. but it goes away more quickly. and i know i havent been on this product to long so there will the worse before it gets better ordeal so.. i'm just waiting patiently
Acne	sorrellb, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/10/2009 11:21:42 PM	i havent expierenced any pain, but my face looks worse then ever and now my neck, I'm hoping it till start have been taking a month so i figure if it hasnt worked by now it probably wont.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/24/2009 5:11:35 PM	After 2 days I broke out in a rash. It has been 3 days now and I am still having problems.Be careful with this one. 
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	8/14/2009 11:12:21 PM	I went to the doctor for my acne and she gave me a sample of epiduo...it burned pretty bad so i stopped using it...but jus recently i bout a full tube and havent experienced any problems since i use it at night....as far as how good it works well i havent used it long enough to see some results...but this product does take a couple weeks to kick in...if it does at all...but beware im not the only person who has experienced burning from this product
Acne	ez101, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	8/11/2009 7:22:47 PM	i have only been using the product for one week now, and i had somewhat of an initial break out, but overall i am seeing a great improvement! the first couple nights i applied, it didn't hurt; more recently it has begun to burn a little and i am peeling. but it has improved my complexion already. HOPE THIS HELPED
Acne	elohel9dalton, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	13-18	8/11/2009 3:40:07 AM	the product works good, it is really the only thing that has worked this well for me! haha, the only probleme was it makes me EXTREMELY sensitive to alchohol rub, and the sun.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	8/8/2009 3:11:58 AM	I have always been told I have great skin. Monthly I would only get ONE whitehead on my chin before my period. My old derm had me using benzaclin as a spot treatment and it worked WONDERS. I moved so I got a new derm and went to get another perscription of benzaclin. She basically told me she wouldn't write me the perscription for it and told me she saw me as someone with &quot;mild acne&quot; (i don't consider one zit mild acne, but she's the professional right?) so she tells me about epiduo and i give it a try. WORST DECISION OF MY LIFE. after one week of using this stuff i was breaking out in areas where i have never broken out before! my face was RED, sensitive, oh and PEELING like crazy. There is no way I would ever endure horrible skin for &quot;6-8 weeks&quot; for this to start &quot;working effectively&quot;. Once I stopped using it my skin went back to normal. I highly recommend NOT using this product. Do yourself a favor--if you have &quot;mild acne&quot; get yourself some benzaclin! 
Acne	abcg, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	13-18	8/7/2009 1:21:28 AM	when i first used it burning.. started pealing my skin which pealed off acne scars. pushed out the bacteria, also use it with doxycycline cleared mostly all my acne, works great
Acne	HannsG, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	13-18	8/6/2009 1:36:14 PM	Before I hit freshman year, I had great skin, and a few months ago it started getting worse than I ever imagined. My dermatologist gave me samples of this a week ago and she said it would take a while to kick in plus it would get worse before it got better. I've been taking it for the past week and it's already getting better! On the third day, my face burned a little, but I used cetaphil spf 50 moisturizer and it helped a ton. I'm going to continue using it and I can only see it going up from here! :)
Acne	charlieandstars, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	13-18	8/2/2009 6:10:48 PM	Epiduo works, but only in repetition. At first I only applied the gel to my nose and ares where I had a zit. I'm also on Bactrim DS, which kept my skin very clear, but I was getting a lot of those small little bumps that take a lot of squeezing to get rid of. I went back to my derm and talked to him, he said that every night I need to spread a layer of the gel all over my face or the the ares that I break out in. After about 3 weeks of doing this, my skin is completely clear, the gel evened out my skin tone and actually got rid of red blemishes. The only thing I don't like is that it does make my skin itchy when I apply it, but it's only in sensitive ares like around my nose and mouth, so I'm now avoiding those areas.
Acne	peacefulcounselor, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/30/2009 11:38:40 AM	This stuff is great but I wish it wasn't so expensive. I've used Retin-A liquid or cream and  glycolic acid 7% every night for over 30 years, so when I started breaking out again,my derm said I just needed a change of meds. Epiduo burns, stings &amp; causes dryness at first but wow, even my deep wrinkles are smoothing out after only a few weeks. I also take tetracycline 500mg once a day. 
Acne	jojo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	7/9/2009 3:05:30 PM	I got a free tube with a coupon from my derm, cuz i would def not pay $200 for this on the normal, unless it really worked well. and so far it hasnt made that much of an improvement. Ive been using it for 8 weeks now, and at first it made me break out far worse but they said it gets worse b4 it get better. No burning or or redness though. My face will clear up after my period but then come right back to about the same amount of acne maybe SLIGHTLY less then b4 i started using it. My doctor also paired it with clandymicin acne pads. 
Acne	justmeo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/11/2009 12:46:56 AM	I went to a new  derm who prescribed Epiduo for me after  my last derm had given me Differn which had cause my occasional breakout to become a war zone of acne like never before. I've been using the product for about a month and a half-once at night just before bed and all I can say is that it works great. I have never had any irritations or discomfort. My derm paired this medicine along with Lociod which give me a lot of moisture. Overall its a great product and it works for me. 
Acne	akkricket, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	6/10/2009 12:20:15 AM	I have been using this for about 3 weeks. In the first week it made my forehead really bumpy, I think it was because it causes the skin cells to turnover faster and brought all the yucky stuff to the surface. No side effects for me. No red,dry, or itchy skin. My skin is clearing nicely. You should try it. =)
Acne	black lotus, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	5/30/2009 9:43:33 PM	my dermatologist put me on epiduo about a month ago and I swear my face is the worst it has ever looked!I have broken out more with it than when I started.I never had the burning or irritation,maybe a little dryness but I could handle that.I am soo embarassed by my skin now and I work with the public which makes it even worse.I have huge cysts on my neck which I NEVER had before and the amount of them have tripled since I started using this.I sure hope this is as bad as it's going to get because any worse, you might as well call me 'the elephant man!'Good luck with this stuff.I obviously was'nt one of the lucky ones!
Acne	ledulce, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	5/26/2009 10:35:45 AM	My doctor recently prescribed this medication to me. first she gave me samples and it was great within the first week my skin was so clear of pimples and scars look lighter. I couldnt believe that it was the cream. i kept thinking it was something else but I wasnt on anything else. I have had acne all my life. Now that my samples are finished i filled the prescription, now my skin is still clear but very dry, please note I have oily skin. The only side effect is severe dry skin. So i recommend using a good moisterizer on top of it for comfort, but it does work.
Acne	gigi28, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/17/2009 9:37:03 AM	The key to using this effectively is to stick with it!  In the first few weeks it was extremely irritating, but now I barely feel it going on.  You must use a good moisturizer for sensitive skin. I hardly break out now and have no more cysts. As a bonus, lines on my forehead are smoother.
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	13-18	5/10/2009 1:56:55 PM	My dermotologist prescribed Epiduo to me a month ago.  I have only used it twice (at night) and I woke up to my skin feeling like sandpaper and burning, but was not red.  That was a week ago - my skin texture hasn't gone back to normal.  But it did clear up some troubling acne spots.  This medication is too harsh for me to use daily.  I am keeping it for spot treatment only.  
Acne	ark88, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	5/2/2009 6:01:14 PM	i have excema along with acne so its difficult to find a product that works on the acne but doesn't dry out my skin too badly. this did dry out my face for the first few weeks but if you keep it strictly to the oily areas it works beautifully. i put moisturizer on top of it, and it keeps the dryness under control. very effective on acne.
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	4/27/2009 10:32:35 AM	I just finished week 7 of the product. The first couple weeks of results included an initial clearing, followed by dryness and sensitivity (hot feeling). Now the break out period has begun. I have heard it gets worse before it gets better, so hopefully I am almost through the worst of it. I started out with what my derm called Mild, but it felt Moderate to me. 
Acne	xx94, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	4/13/2009 3:26:04 PM	It has cleared some of my pimples, but it stingys like crazy and makes your skin really dry. I wear makeup for my modeling job and putting that on hurts very badly
Acne	worried, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	4/4/2009 11:46:50 PM	the first day it cleared some of my pimples on my forehead but the following days it gave me more breakouts and pimple cyst specially on my cheeks
Acne	crunk, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/26/2009 4:27:33 PM	Ive had acne for the past 19 years (since age 11) and its progressed from severe to mild. Ive tried almost every oral or facial medication that one can think of and I have not seen a drastic improvement except for the time when I took accutane, which has severe side effects. I started using epiduo a month ago and I have slowly seen much improvement in my acne. So far, Ive not had any of the side effects listed for this drug yet..I love it and I will continue to use it, and patiently wait for it to clear my acne. I sometimes get one or two infected acnes-especially during my period- but it goes away in a couple of days.
Acne	MARTHA05, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	3/24/2009 12:56:52 AM	IVE ONLY BEEN ON EPIDUO FOR LESS THAN A MONTH. I HAVE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE SKIN!! I WAS VERY VERY SCARED ABOUT TRYING SOMETHING NEW. MY ACNE IS NOT TOO TOO BAD, BUT I REFUSE NOT TO WEAR MAKEUP. I HAVE RANDOM RED SPOTS AND WHEN I DO BREAK OUT, THEYRE BIG AND PAINFUL. SO FAR I TAKE IT AT NIGHT WITH A CLEAN FACE, AND I USE A TEENY AMOUNT, SO AFTER A MONTH LOOKS LIKE I HAVENT TOUCHED THE TUBE ALMOST. RETAIL ITS LIKE IN THE $200'S BUT I GOT A DISCOUNT CARD THAT MY 1ST ONE IS FREE, AND THEN $35 OFF THE NEXT 2 OR 3.  HONESTYL, SO FAR SO GOOD, AND EVEN DURING MY PERIOD I GOT A LITTLE ONE FOR 2 DAYS, WHICH HAS NEVER EVER HAPPENED. IM ONLY 20 AND I HOPE I GROW OUT OF THIS. AND IF BY THE END OF THE TUBE I LIKE THE EFFECTS(SO FAR SO GOOD) I WILL BUY THE 2ND AND 3RD TUBE. IT WILL BE $ WELL SPENT. I JUST WANT TO IMPLICATE AGAIN THAT U CAN HAVE THE 45G TUBE FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS, MEANING THE STUFF IS WORKING AND YOUR NOT OVER DOING IT THEREFORE CAUSING YOUR SKIN TO BREAK OUT AND HURT.GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE!!REMEMBER. . .  LESS IS MORE!!!!!

Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	3/17/2009 5:30:12 AM	I started using Differin (the adapalene in this product) over a year ago, and it didn't do much for me. My doctor prescribed Epiduo for me almost a month ago, but because of the cost, I was unable to purchase it. Well, thankfully, I looked up the ingredients in Epiduo, and luckily enough, I still had some Differin left from before. The Benzoyl Peroxide in Epiduo can be picked up at any drug store, although, I've found that the only low strength Benzoyl Peroxide is the &quot;Neutrogena On the Go Spot Treatment.&quot; That combination has done WONDERS for me. My face was VERY dry after the first 2 or 3 nights, but I used some Cetaphil Moisturizer, and it cleared it right up. Right now, I wash my face in the morning and night. I apply the Cetaphil in the morning and the Differin/Benzoyl Peroxide combination in the night.
