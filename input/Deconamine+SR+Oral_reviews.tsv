Deconamine SR oral should be available for users - please consider making it again.  Is there a similar drug otc?  If so, what is it?

I have started my search for something else that will work for me.  So far I haven't found anything and I'm down to my last 2 weeks of pills.  I dread the headaches that will be coming.  If anyone finds a good replacement please post.  Thanks.

It's the ONLY allergy medicine that has worked for me.  I can't believe they have removed it from the market.  I have been suffering A LOT  without it, even though I'm on a new medication.

Stuffy Nose	AmyBerry, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/3/2008 11:51:27 AM	I have chronic sinusitis complete with the most horrible pressure in my head, eyes, face, and cheeks.  If I don't take something as soon as I notice it's starting, it turns into a migraine.Deconamine SR has been the only medication that has worked for me to take the awful pressure &amp; stuffiness away and I don't have to take a migraine pill as often as I used to.I also use it in conjunction with Flonase nasal spray which works very well together.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	Peter, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	8/4/2008 1:07:44 AM	I have used deconamine SR for alomst 30 years and it those blue and yellow capsules always worked wonderfully. I took it generally twice a day, but the directiions said I could take it every eight to 12 hours. In the spring and fall, I boosted it to three times a day and it always worked. Not so the sustitutes they have been throwing at me. Stupid Democrats have to stick their nose into everything, punish the good peole and the bad. I wrote and I wrote and I told them not to pull it from the shelf. Now I have to give my license and ID and sign for each box of generic psuedophed I get every week... and it doesn't work. As a reult, I am suffering severe obstructive sleep apnea because the med don't control my post nasal drip, particularly when I'm sleeping and I'm sleeping so badly now, I have to take provigil just to stay awake on the way home from work. If I still had access to deconamine, I wouldn't have this problem and I'd be sleeping well and I wouldn't be afraid of killing someone including myself, on the way home from work because I've fallen asleep. Fortunately, I have narrowly missed about 10 times now and it's just a matter of time before it happens. They tell me &quot;don't drive when I'm sleepy&quot; but I work nights and it's an hour drive home and I can't afford to move or rent a hotel.
Allergic Conjunctivitis	INGRID, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/2/2008 9:43:55 PM	I have sever allergies. I get weekly allergy injections. One injection in both of my legs. The Deconamine SR has been a blessing to me, its the only allergy medication that has EVER fully worked for me. However i was very upset when I found out at the pharmacy that this would be the last time i would be able to get Deconamine SR. They are removing any and all medications off the shelves that contain the drug phedreine (?). I am upset because all of this is about people and drug habits.People like my self and MANY others shouldn't have to be treated like were the ones doing something bad...... most people that have the medication use it right and use it because they need it, now if we really need it how are we going to the medication we have to have. There are some days that my allergies get so bad that if it weren't for the Deconamine SR i wouldnt make it out of the house, constant sneezing, runny nose,blurred eyes and worse of all the swelling in my face, my eyes.I LOVE THE DECONAMINE SR ORAL BUT I HATE THAT IT WONT BE AROUND MUCH LONGER...... I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD WAKE UP AND REALIZE THAT THIS ISN'T A GOOD OR RESPECTFUL DECISION FOR THE PATIENTS . ITS FOR US SO LET IT B 4 US, HELP KEEP US IN THE DECISION MAKING FROM NOW ON , I THINK IT MAY HELP THIS TO WORK OUT A BIT EASIER!!!!
