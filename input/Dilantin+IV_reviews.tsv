I ran out of the Keppra the other day and ended up having a seizure where I work although I wasnt on the clock, i just stopped in to get something.  and ended up busting 3 of my three and having to have my top lip stitched back on :( not fun but the keppra really helps and since ive been taking it I havent even blacked out like I do with the dilantin.

They can to pound on my chest to get me back. Is this a cause of negligence or possible side affect?

I feel at work, broke 3 vertebrae, blew out a disc, and hit my head.   At first I was on 4 pills each day. I have dropped down to 1 pill each  day at this time. Had trouble with Dilantin on my stomach at first. Take the medication at night and this solved that problem.  Works well and do not seem to have any of the side effects except for facial hair growth, almost need to shave twice a day. Great Medication...

I also had surgury last year to remove a brain tumor. Recently I have felt and shown approximately 6-9 symtoms for the effect of the medication. I was precribe to to take four pills a day due to I am a big guy (245 lbs). I had recent blood work and my blood rangs results should have been between 10-20. It was 39, twice the limit. This is when I found out thru my doctor and reading about if on your website that I probably have toxicity (probably spelt is wrong). I haven't fealt like I have had any energy in a long time since taking this medication. I am a outgoing person. Sharp as a tact. I am a security director. Now I walk slow, nerves acts up, can't concentrate, unbalanced and list the list goes on from what I read about the side effects. I am in the process of taking more lab work and the level in my system is reducing. Hopefully in a couple days it will be normal and my doctor will see if I need to take 3 pills a day or less. I can not pass judgments on the medication due to it is helping to say my life but at this point I am not sure if its the medication, myself or a counteraction from my brain sugury. My surgury was almost a year ago, It was not cancersous and for the most part no complications on a daily baisis except a little short term memory loss.
