Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/10/2012 12:23:05 AM	I had a migraine for three days and went to the er. They gave me toradol with phenergan because my headache was soo bad it was making me sick. Shortly after having the iv, I felt better and took a nap. The only bad thing which i wouldn't really consider a bad thing was it felt like i had a bruise at the injection site.

Acute Pain Following an Operation	frankiesgirl,  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1			6/7/2012 6:32:12 AM	I had an injection of Toradol about 15 years ago for ureter spasms and it worked wonderfully.  I had abdominal/pelvic surgery on May 25, 2012 and I was given Toradol IV every 6 hours post-operatively.  In this instance it did not seem to have any effect as far as pain relief.  When I was discharged I was given a prescription for oral Toradol.  I don't know if the oral Toradol disagreed with me or if it was just an accumulation of dosages but I experienced some disturbing side effects once I started the po medication.  I had a persistent sore throat, a very sore tongue and a huge amount of edema from my thighs to my sternum.  When I weighed myself I was astonished to find that I had gained 17 pounds in the 3 days since my surgery!  I discontinued the Toradol per the advice of an Emergency Room physician.  It took about 4 days for the edema to dissipate and then I returned to my pre-operative weight.  I was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer in Sept. of 2011.  That ulcer has returned and it is more painful than it was when it was originally diagnosed.  I was very disappointed with the ineffective pain relief because I had had such good relief when I had that injection for ureter spasms.  The side effects of this drug certainly out weighed the usefulness of it.      
Severe Pain	OrganicMom, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	11/20/2011 10:50:34 PM	I got this injected for a VERY painful ovarian cyst. It helped for about an hour during which i was able to somewhat rest. After 2 hours I started have very SEVER abdominal pain, cramps, and vomiting. Thankfully the vomiting did not last long, but the abdominal pain and gas, (which is a direct side effect) lasted for over three days! For almost 3 days after receiving Toradol, I had to walk bent over from the pain. It would have been better for me to sit in a hot tub to relieve  the cyst pain, then taking this medication.

I would tell everyone I know to refuse this drug if it is offered! I classify it as a joke drug!!!

In both situations I was still in pain after being given the maximum dose of morphine.  My pain was still a 7 and then an injection of toradol and my pain went down so quickly (to a 3).  The first time this happened I was like, &quot;why didn't you give that to me sooner&quot;!  I was just in the hospital recovering from a hysterectomy and I actually requested it, it is a powerful anti-inflammatory when inflammation is part of the pain!
Acute Pain Following an Operation	VintageButterfly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/19/2010 11:37:48 PM	I had emergency surgery for a ruptured ovarian cysts that was causing me to bleed internally...After recovery when the transferred me to a room, they gave me Toradol an another pain reliever (narcotic) in my I.V... I had decent pain relief...but I am not sure if it was the Toradol or the other narcotic pain reliever (was not morphine) that was helping... or maybe it was the combo of the two...  so my review would be positive, and would recommend it.  My mother swears Toradol is the best (She has migraines and was given Toradol injections)

Acute Pain Following an Operation	Mickey, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	4/13/2010 1:09:58 PM	I went in for gall bladder surgery in 2005, plan was 4 holes, 4 hours, 4 days off of work.  They ended up having to cut me open and in doing so I got pancreatitus.  This is the most painful infection a person can get - they couldn't even touch my bed let alone me.  They gave me the Toradal and I was relieved, however, come to find out I'm allergic to Toradal (concentration for Ibuprofin) my kidneys shut down within 24 hours, my liver then started shutting down, and I had to go on dialysis for over two months.  The medicine itself was great, but my experience was a nightmare!

I have very tiny veins so the ease of use was not fun. After about 10 minutes my migraine pain was under control. It's good to know what works when my regular Rx just doesn't do it.

Acute Pain Following an Operation	shadylady, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	9/8/2009 11:33:14 AM	I was given Toradol to control pain during an office cryoablation procedure, it did nothing! It was as if they had injected me with simple saline. Due to the extreme pain I was in, the procedure was not able to be completed. A few weeks later I went in to the hospital for a hysterectomy. Even though I specifically requested that I not be given Toradol, I was given it several times immediately after surgery. As I writhed in pain they just kept trying to give me more. It did nothing. After awhile my husband demanded that I be given something else and I was given Demerol...finally relief!! Thank goodness for a husband who was willing to stand up for me.

Severe Pain	stick2u2, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/6/2009 9:43:07 AM	Toradol was very effective in removing at least 95% - 99% of the pain I was experiencing from appendicitis. Even more impressive was I did not have the typical narcotic like effects we get from morphine. I maintain a clear head which was important and useful to the ER staff. Additionally, on exit from the hospital, instead of Percocet or some other narcotic I ask for another IV of Toradol. It lasted for up to six or seven hours where I simply used over the counter Motrin ever since.

Once I was given Toradol IV, the pain relief was almost immediate and I had no side effects. GREAT STUFF.

Severe Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	12/28/2008 8:54:34 PM	I was 3 weeks post op and developed a severe infection with temps as high as 104.7.  My incision dehisced and the surgeon opened it further to allow drainage.  I needed meds for the high temps, pain and break through pain.  They all were successful at controlling the pain; the temps needed some heavy abx.

I was given morphine and was able to dose myselt. It didn't work no matter how much they gave me. They thought I was a drug addict trying to get high. I was in the most intense pain of my life. I could hear my pain management team talking outside my door. I heard someone rattling off a list of drugs to try. I don't know why, but when they said a certain drug, I yelled NO. Someone said Toradol, and I, for some reason screamed YES, try that. They listened and within a half hour my pain was under control. Apparently the Toradol works on a different part of the brain. It worked. My use of morphine immediately dropped to below the normal need of someone recovering from such invasive surgery.My Husband knows, if I am ever in pain and morphine or opiate doesn't work to ask for it to be combined with Toradol.Thank you,

Acute Pain Following an Operation	Katy T., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/17/2008 3:53:27 PM	I dislocated me knee, tore three out of four ligaments in my knee, and had a blood clot in my papatial artery requiring a arterial bypass. Yesterday, the surgeon repaired two out of the three ligaments in my knee. The pain following surgery was worse than when the injury occured and worse than the very long arterial bypass surgery. I was given morphine and toradol through the IV following surgery. Whenever the toradol wore off, it was quite painful even with the morphine. With the toradol, my pain is managable. So far, no side effects except less pain. 
Pain	mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/12/2008 12:22:55 AM	My 18 yr old daughter received IV Toradol and Reglan? at ER for severe migraine. Instantly it caused extreme leg pain, they gave her IV Benedryl and Morphine. Tense and painful neck and back the next day with fever. CT and Spinal Tap OK. Dr said prev. reaction PROBABLY Reglan and he gave IV  Toradol again. Same extreme leg pain, then more IV Benedryl and dilaudid?. Next day, 24 hours later,extrapyramidal symptoms...drawing of muscles in face, jaws clenching closed, eyes rolling up, neck drawing to one side stiff. She couldnt speak, or keep her eyes from rolling upward. Needless to say, we were scared. Ambulance ride to ER for different med to stop this reaction to Toradol. Ok in 30-45 min. sore from muscle strain. I dont think they took 1st reaction serious enough! All this and she still has migraine!! We have appt with Neurolgist.

Pain	Migraines in Indiana, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	5/14/2008 9:41:19 PM	I use it for helping out with migraine headaches and it seems to do an amazing job - I also have a few other things it helps out, bad shoulder, knee problems &amp; hip problems. I would recommend this medicine to others. Doing the injections yourself takes so getting used to but once you get the hang of it, it works well. Only side effect that Ive had that bothered me was made my legs sore (injection site)

Acute Pain Following an Operation	dlglossop, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	65-74	1/7/2008 11:27:49 PM	My wife had a major relocation of heel bone and relocation of a tendon.  The first IV treatment with Codiene was causing her itching.  This was changed to Toradol.  At first it put her to sleep apparently reducing the pain -- but a few hours later she awoke with a racing heart, sweating and nauseated.  Potassium was measured to be extremely low and the hospital crew gave her many potassium pills (which were later determined to be excessive).  She was eventually calmed with Hydrocodone.  She considers herself allergic to Toradol. 
Acute Pain Following an Operation	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/13/2007 5:26:25 PM	I was given Toradol through IV after I had an emergency surgery. The doctors tried many different meds to help with the post-op pain (Morphine, Vicodin, Ibuprophen 800), but Toradol was the only thing that worked.

Acute Pain Following an Operation		5	5	5			9/19/2007 9:47:30 AM	I was given this post-operatively after a C-section and it was a lifesaver!  The epidural didn't really do much for me, but this killed my pain almost instantly.  I'm requesting this with child
