Check it out for yourself.  Clonidine or catapress is also hard to get off of. Rebound high bp, n/v.severe headache could result in death or stroke if stoppped to abruptly. Know what meds ur taking.KNOWLEDGE IS POWER ! BLESSINGS BE

High Blood Pressure	Sterling, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	6/4/2011 8:48:25 AM	I was prescribed to supplement other med for high blood pressure. I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I was put on oral Meds and began using meter to check my levels. Was already restricting carbs and exercising. Discovered my levels were consistently normal 2 hrs after lunch, dinner and at bedtime, but upon rising and 2 hours after breakfast were extremely high. I only took Clonidine at bed time. Googled and found several articles suggesting this adverse result. Did not find it in most posts. Eliminated dose one night and following morning blood sugar normal. As Clonidine was not controlling bp well I will seek other solutions. I'll continue testing blood sugar for a while but looks like I wasted $$$ on dietitians, Meds and testing supplies. 
High Blood Pressure	bbgirl, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	65-74	5/21/2011 8:08:13 PM	Have been on the drug for several yrs,  ( .1  at 2 times a day).   Within an hr. after taking I am either asleep or fighting to stay awake!  Voice hoarse, constantly clearing throat, dry mouth, weakness, lethargic, nightmares.  BP sometimes drops too low.  Was in hospital for arrythmia, DR. stopped my Catapres suddenly and after two days my BP spiked dangerously high...had to go back on it immediately.   Am sensitive to meds &amp; this does control my BP but side affects are troublesome.   Effectiveness appears to be wearing off the last few months for BP control. Muscle cramps and nightmares are increasing. I also take Norvasc and took Cordorone for about 6 years (have been taken off this one for arrythmia but is taking months to get it out of my system....been off 8 months).  Cordorone affected my thyroid, teeth &amp; gums, hair, muscle tone, stomach, reflux..... bad drug over time..wish I had known. I ask more questions now and am more persistent with DR. concerning my own observations concerning meds and side effects.  I keep a brief diary and it has been SO helpful to recognize  a pattern developing while taking meds and/or symptoms.
High Blood Pressure	diamondgirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	5/11/2011 9:01:34 PM	started conidine for emergency HBP after reaction to steriod and discovered that a very low dose 1/2 of.1 mg. pill twice a day controlled my fluctuating BP (from underlying anxiety)and rapid pulse. after 5 mo. I am very tired of putting up with side effects, mainly tiredness and drowsiness(I take other meds that cause sleepiness). Being menopausal, I actually get MORE hot flashes and a stinging feeling around my head. I also think it makes my fibromyalgia worse or at least adds joint pain to it. and then there is the itching (which is a transient symptom of FMS but seems more often especially if I throw a new or different drug in the equation.) It just has many side effects. I intend to try to ween off it but all antihypertensives have their side effects and often don't work. just bang my head against a wall! I am hypersensitive to drugs and very discouraged as I sit here itching!   
High Blood Pressure	zemia, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/10/2011 3:07:31 PM	I was diagnosed with high blood pressure some 20 yrd ago and started on Catapres. Since then I've changed PCP's and they have tried to change me from Catapres to the &quot;new&quot; drugs only to have my BP get out of control. The generic seems to work, though not as well as the original name brand. If anyone is having with feeling tired, I suggest talking with your dr about adjusting your dosage to maybe twice a day instead of once as Catapres lowers your BP quickly. Since I've taken it for such a long time, I monitor my BP and adjust the dosage when necessary.

My biggest issue now is that I live in Singapore and they do not have this drug and cannot recommend an alternative.

And it also caused EXTREME dryness of the mouth. It only brought my Diastolic (the bottom number) down to about 100. I see my MD again tomorrow and I hope he will prescrive another pill. I can't keep taking 2 hour naps while at work and the dry mouth was unbearable. Oh yeah, I forgot, people kept asking me if I was losing my voice cuz it makes you sound like you're hoarse.

Like what's been said, it puts ya to sleep with the greatest of ease. Stops spasms, tics, trembling, and high blood pressure extremely well. It also gives merciless dry mouth, but nothing lots of water won't fix. Other than that, the only noticeable side effect for me was, about 5 minutes after my dose, I can't stand up too fast or I get light-headed. This wears off in a few minutes, though. Great drug!!! Tenex is also very good for Tourette's, but Clonidine is better for me personally.

I take 40 mg.  Lisinopril and a diuretic daily. I am tired of having emergencies and was finally given the patch. I thought this would be the end of these daily episodes but my blood pressure is as high as ever. I have the patch 0.2 mg., I had to take two more 0.2 tablets throughout the day, plus a Lisinopril and a diuretic and my BP is now 240/110. I am at the end of my rope.

High Blood Pressure	efittery, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1		55-64	9/3/2009 12:20:37 PM	On and off over the years I have taken this drug.  I have taken it in its patch form and as a pill.My results were:When I first use the patch or take the pill it effectively drops my blood pressure.  The side effects are so bad that I can't do my work.  Falling asleep while trying to write computer code doesn't exactly make my boss happy.After I have been taking the medication a few weeks, it has less of an effect on my blood pressure.  I remember one instance when at the doctors they took my blood pressure.  They said 175/110 was too high, put me in a dark room and started feeding me 0.1 mg clonadine tablets.  They did this on the hour for 4 hours.  At the end of that time, they let me go and my BP was 165/115.  I guess I just built up a resistance to it.By the way, there is a machine by the name of BioZ that can and is used to diagnose WHY you have high blood pressure.  Just do a internet search for &quot;BioZ hypertension&quot; and you will find it.  I like wikipedia myself.
Extremely High Blood Pressure	dcook, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	8/25/2009 5:32:20 PM	I have very high blood pressure and my dr. started me on this of 0.1mg 2x day. I could barley function so I cut the dosage in half. It has been 4 days and today I had to leave work because I could not even carry on a conversation with people. Very lethargic, I feel like I have no control of my body. after I left work I came home and took a nap and I have woke up feeling like i have the flu.This may be fine for people who lay around all day but I work in a corporate office and can not go to work like a zomby. I would never give this to children. I honestly have never felt so bad in my life. It does lower the blood pressure, but it is not worth it.
