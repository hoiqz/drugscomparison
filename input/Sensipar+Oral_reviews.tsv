If you have private insurance drug coverage ask your dietician or nephrologist for the manufacturers co-pay card from AMGEN pharma. This discount card will reduce your co-pay to just $5 and is good for 12 refills!

Yaking Pgospgate Binders are the most important effective treatment to lower PTH. I was on Dialysis 10 years prior to Densipar and managed fine. The Hype the doctors take on Bone loss is Baloney. Removing Parathyroid is a big mistake especially of you later get a transplant. Dr;s  are making a fortunee prescribing this frig it is all a scam. Take your Pgosphate Biners  vut out high Phos Foods Don't be a jerk You dont need Sensipar!!!!!

If unable to help can you refer someone?    Appreciate any info.

Other	Frightened, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	45-54	9/17/2010 11:56:36 PM	I have been diagnosed with MEN1 and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.  I do not have kidney or adrenal failure.  I have had partial removal of my parathyroid glands twice and still my PTH level remains high.  After my second surgery was unsuccessful in bringing my PTH levels, my doctors refused to perform a third surgery because my health insurance was insufficient and I could not afford to pay the difference between what was charged and what was covered.  My endocrinologist then put me on Sensipar and I have remained on it for four years.  In that time I develpoed a malignant brain tumor.  I am very concerned this medication caused the tumor but I have no way to find out because there has never been anyone who has either taken the medication for that long a period of time or for my condition.  Yet my doctors will not check to see what long term complications arise from sensipar nor will they perform another surgery or take me off the medication.  I sometimes feel as though I am a human gunea pig for their private test to see the long term affects of sensipar on a human being with MEN1 and ZES.

Other	55-64 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1		55-64	8/19/2010 8:38:56 AM	Sensipar was prescribed by my doctor.  I found that at 1st I felt ok but nausea increased and over time it got worse.  I have primary parathyroidism and am on dialysis due to an inefficient, overzealous surgeon who didn't know when to quit. I cannot personally say I'm happy with the results of it.  I'm no longer using it and will NEVER go back on it.

I started at the beginning of this week.  I am unsure if this means anything but my BP is elevated and my hands and feet become numb periodically,  I am hoping this is only temporary because my nephrologist is telling me that surgery is my next option.

I sympathize with those of you who are taking yet another drug, but my real question now is that I started the medication and expected a little naseau or tummy upset, not a full blown rush to ememergency for severe stomach pain the next day! Although they said it might have been a paratoneal infection I find that really convenient when I had no usual symptoms. I've had this before but not the the degree where I was flat on back in emergency screaming due to severe pain. Okay so I'm on the antibiotics now, but we still don't know what happened.  De. I don't want to take the medicine if it isn't going to control the intial problems. Try as I might to convince medical experts that I am not the usual dialysis patient, they are always on a wait and see experience and then when it all comes true they are flabbergasted.  This isn't a condition that is supposed to leave a person stumped.  The medication is $420 a bottle for 30 pills and to me there has got to be something else I can take that works better at a lessor rate.  Sure I have insurance, but gees.

The decrease in Calcium made it easier for me to take Phos Lo for my binder, which is much cheaper than the others. My bone pain has also went away. I am now on a transplant list.

My insurance company will not pay for these medications.  They said that they are not covered by our plan.  What is so different about these medications that insurance will not cover them?

It has not done anything for my phos. level and I am getting discouraged with the medication.  It doesn't seem to be helping in the specific areas that I was encouraged to take the medicine for.

So much so I had to stop taking the medcine. My doseage was doubled and I appears to not be working now. I have been taking the medication for over a year with little improvement.
