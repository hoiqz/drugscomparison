Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	bcall, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1		55-64	9/29/2012 1:26:44 PM	I just started taking Trajenta a month ago.  I have experienced fast heart rate and I have become very jittery.  It scares me sometimes.  I was on Metformin before but that did not agree with my stomach. I become very weak and nervous.  I am going to check with my doctor once again to see if there is another drug I can try.  I'm thinking since I was diagnosed with border line diabetes maybe these drugs are a little too strong for me.  I have had diabetes since 2010 and my reading is and has always been between 6.2 and 6.5.

Was always below 100 on Metformin.  Unfortunatley, my digestive system couldn't handle it.  That part is doing much better on Tradjenta, but now I'm experiencing swollen feet and ankles.  Am seeing the doctor to get his opinion, but I'm not happy the sugar isn't controlled better.  Probably need to find another.
