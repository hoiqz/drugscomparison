Muscle Spasm	P Andrews, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	3/16/2012 2:18:00 PM	I have used this medication in the past and it relieved my pain in no time.  I have recently had muscle spasms in my neck twice and the doctor prescribed another medication that took over a week to relieve my pain.  Have they stopped making Norgesic Forte?  If they have, I really wish they would put it back on the market.  Nothing works like Norgesic Forte.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	4/9/2010 1:44:38 PM	I was prescribed this for migraines. While it got rid of my headache asap, it left me extremely drowsy, which sort of defeated the point since I was still unable to focus at work.

Other	Mac, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/26/2009 3:29:24 PM	I was prescibed this to take whenever I got a cluster headache. My cluster headaches (when left untreated) were causing severe migraines. Norgesic Forte helped me get the cluster headaches under control and eliminated my migraines. Walgreens told me that this was taken off the market, my dr. switched me to something else and it is not effective in eliminating my migraines. I can find no information on Norgesic Forte being taken off the market. Hopefully I can get put back on it because it is the only thing that works for my headaches!
Muscle Spasm	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/17/2009 11:54:42 AM	I have had back problems for 25+ years. This seems to work overnight. Have been using now and then for the same number of years with ibuprofen. BUT TALK TO YOUR DR. FIRST... I have been told by Dr. that if you alternate Aceaminophen and Ibuprofen it intensifies the effects. BUT TALK TO YOUR DR. FIRST....

Other	tinawat71, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	10/1/2007 7:17:35 PM	I was put on this medicine for knee pain. It gave me severe diarrhea.I have only been on it 4 days and 3 of them, I had to stay close to the restroom.Sometimes too late! So, I suggest if you take this and have diarrhes the next day, go ahead and call your doctor back and let him know.....I'm calling first thing in the morning!!
