Enlarged Prostate	Charles A, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	55-64	9/25/2012 1:17:30 PM	I am 60 and have been taking the drug for 6 months. I still urinate at night frequently but the stinging and small pains related to enlarged prostate urination have disappeared. Sex is not good and the growth of my beard and hair has slowed way down. My DR said this is also a side effect. No one told me about the hair and beard thing!

Other	lowflow, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	8/22/2012 6:59:51 AM	62 years old, has reduced night visits from 3to4 to 1 or none. Has reduced ability to obtain erection &amp; lowered sex drive. Have been on for 3 months, started to have problems with joints (especially burning knees and back pain, and some breathing). Have concerns with interactions with other meds. Medication is priced to high and not covered undered Medicare. Overall I don't know if I will Continue due to side effects. You should in my opinion stay it close contact with your doctor at least every 90 days. Remember there is a chance however slight that this drug can cause a more severe form of cancer. ALWAYS Read the information no matter how long and always wright down other meds you are taking with times and amounts when going for followups! I'm having bloodwork done every 6 months due to the cancer issue.

From 5-6 times a night to 2 or 3.  No problem with erections but have little or no seman, decreasing pleasure of ejaculations.  Have had severe backache but not sure that is related to the jalyn.  Will continue for a while and see if symptoms improve and backache subsides.

Enlarged Prostate	55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2		55-64	11/7/2010 7:21:15 PM	After a couple of weeks the product started working but the sexual side affects were terrible.  I am now on a different product and it is working better.
Enlarged Prostate	75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male		11/6/2010 8:56:43 PM	Helps control urination at night,  but causes loss of ability to obtain and keep an erection.   Must take after food or will cause a burning pain in the pit of the stomach.Causes lack of Seman...  But it does the job in place of FLOMAX and AVODART.
