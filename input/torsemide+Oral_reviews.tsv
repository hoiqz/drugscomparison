I have noticed an increase in the neck waddle effect (in 2 months of use)and increased crackle effect in my arm skin. I have always been pleased with my texture.

The gout episodes have lasted for up to a month.  Quit taking and now the edema is back, but the gout is slowly going away.  Dr. is going to prescribe 20 mgs. a day, so we'll hopefully see an improvement for both the edema and gout.

Visible Water Retention	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	65-74	1/11/2009 2:34:02 PM	Been on this medication off and on for 2 years due to fluid retention caused from other meds taken. Dosage 20 mg's 1 x daily.I enjoy being busy and torsemide taken with other meds causes a severe loss of potassium and salt. It createes cramps sometimes so severe that I can not sleep nights, worst in the evenings. When taken with large doses of potassium and high salt intake it works well. For those concerned about the number of trips to the bathroom it only proves that it's doing its job. Hope this helps. Watch your potassium and salt levels it will need some adjusting to get it correct for your lifestyle and needs.

Sometimes good, sometimes not.  Fluid always returns, short acting.

Visible Water Retention	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	9/30/2008 6:00:04 PM	This medication is easy to use and works very well BUT I have to stay home for about four hours after taking it as I am in the restroom every 10-15 minutes.  It is a bother and restrictive that way.  The fluid comes back on the next day though so I have to take it everyday.  It is quick acting and short lived. My other diuretic is slower and last several days, but is not as effective.  Everytime I take torsemide oral I get flu like symptoms though and heart palpations but no leg cramps.

Not always effective, need to take an extra dose infrequently, really causes leg muscle cramps with extra dose.
