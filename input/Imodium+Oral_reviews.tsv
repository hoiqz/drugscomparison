Diarrhea	Argeebee, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	8/31/2011 7:49:10 AM	I have been taking one Immodium 2mg tablet daily for over four years for chronic mild diarrhea caused by radiation therapy for prostate cancer. I have only one question: I am also a diabetic, does Immodium cause a rise in blood sugar?  Recently, I was hospitalized and could not take the Immodium.  My blood sugar was much higher when I was taking the drug.

Diarrhea	My experience , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	8/6/2011 6:56:01 PM	I have been lactose intolerant for many years. I started taking Anti-Diarrheal (Loperamide HCI 2mg) and my uncontrollable,loose stools have hardened to a more manageable type.  I use to have to get to the bathroom with great urgency and had only seconds to spare.  Now I can actually wait in line like anyone else.  I no longer stress about it when I go out.  What a relief.  If I am going somewhere I take 2 tablets in the morning then one with each meal.  On days that I stay home I don't take any and I have my usual &quot;explosions.&quot;  I take a break from the drug when I can so I don't build up immunities.  No side effects after one month.

A few years a go I'd been using presciption imodium before church without any success &amp; I'd gotten to the point that I wouldn't go to church but now I take 1 or 2 of Quick Dissolve before service &amp; no problem whatsoever.

Regular Imodium doesn't help much. Now I am unable to find it anywhere in stores. I even wrote the manufacturer, McNeill, and asked why I can't find it. They replied to my email with a phone number to call. I spoke to them directly and made it clear I just wanted to know where to buy it.  They only would say it was temporarily out of production but could't say WHY or when it would return. Then I get in the mail a form to fill out to give them permission to access my health records!  They assumed I was complaining, even though when I spoke to them directly I stated I was certainly NOT complaining about the product! Needless to say, I'm not responding to that ridiculous letter.  In the meantime, I'm back to scouting bathroom locations before I can leave the house!

Diarrhea	Abcde, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	35-44	7/19/2009 11:50:24 AM	This drug works great for shutting down IBS symptoms, but it always had a backlash. Took me a while to figure out why: Part of my problem was Lactose intolerance. Lactose is a filler in this drug -- a terrible idea! An alternative doc said to stop milk, milk products, coffee, chocolate, cheese, many oils etc. Finally got off the drug too. IBS is history. It's what you eat!

Diarrhea due to Inflammatory Bowel Disease	Boo, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	65-74	6/7/2009 11:34:14 AM	Treating my IBS with imoduim is not chemically hard on me as other stronger ant-diahhreal medications. It doesnt cure it but helps about half the time I have problems. I am very anxious because it  still effects my social life and anxiety and depression sets in.  I am taking a small dose of Xanax each day I may need to increase the dosage (.25mg) 3 x a day. plus I take lexapro a small dose of 1/2 everyother day because it effects my sex life. this is about mostly all I know to share with you. Also I had 3 fistulas surgeries and they cause me to not able to hold my BM when I have freguent bouel movement. I have a very extreme weak spinster around my anus.

I am able to feel comfortable about sitting around the table to eat or walking around looking in shops and it has a easy to use tablet that you chew and does not gag me.  I am glad that I have found this product.  It is a relief and I never leave home without it.

Start taking 2 tablets about 1 hour before leaving home and every 3 1/2 hours thereafter.  Eat very lightly or not at all and this seems to do the trick. Rarely do I have an &quot;episode&quot; while traveling.
