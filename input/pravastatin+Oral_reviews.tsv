High Cholesterol	No trust, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male		9/5/2012 2:09:40 AM	For past 20 years I never had a good medications that helped me without side-affects.I have to see eye doctors,bone drs,urologist,Why the manufactures here do not make good medications like the Europeans?
High Cholesterol	gambles, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	8/26/2012 12:32:23 AM	I'm never sure what &quot;ease of use&quot; means. Assuming it means that I can take a pill, no problem. If it refers to side effects, I should have given it zero stars if possible! I was on Crestor with no problems for about a year and a half. The coopay went to $200 so my pharmacist said this was the same. It took me about six weeks of MASSIVE pain to realize it was from this drug!! I could BARELY walk to the toilet. I happen to have enough health/pain issues that I didn't need another one. The pain started across my lower back and spread to my hips. It then worked its way up my spine into my shoulder blades and neck. I could barely move and that was only with a lot of moaning and pain. When I realized it could be the medication, I was actually thrilled and hopeful that it would go away. I had heard of some people with that side effect that it never left completely. I stopped it cold turkey about 4 weeks ago. It took about a week to even start to subside, but the pain did lessen. I still have occassional pain which I hope will go completely away, but so far it hasn't.My recommendation: If you need the med, then try it. Don't expect pain, but should you be one of the unlucky ones, stop asap so you have a good chance of the pain going away completely. DON'T LET FEAR OF A SIDE EFFECT STOP YOU FROM AT LEAST TRYING IT AS YOU MIGHT BE ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL!! Just my opinion, of course.

My cholesterol has stayed within acceptable levels.I have had calf pain all along however my muscle tone is excellent and overall health has been great. I have gone 6 months at a time on a half dose (I did it on my own) and find little difference. I would say it has been positive for me.

Hardly notice any sideffects. Was a little weak but I lift heavy weights 5 times a week and ride bike outside up big hills. On 40mg my numbers came down just a little. One thing it did was stop libeto, I'm 54 and doc said it's because of age. I stopped the drug twice for a few days and my mind was less groggy. But with history of heart trouble in family I better stay on it, watch diet, exercise. It's not good to do changes without asking the doctor first.

Have described pains to all and by July I couldn't get up from a chair without my hips and legs in great pain.  I took myself off pravastatin 6 days ago and just about all of the pain is gone.  I feel like living again.  I cannot believe none of the 5 doctors even thought about statin pain or even ordered a Crp test.  I saw dr 5 days ago and she said well maybe you just were sick...so she prescribed 10mg of lipitor to replace 40mg of pravastatin- it's the same amount!!  After all those months of pain do you really think I'm going to take it?  Again, considering all of the drs involved and there was no drug oversight I am reluctant to take any statin- I knew it was time to get off of the statin when I felt a quick strange pain under the breastplate - still don't know if there is any muscle damAge.

High Cholesterol	Toni R, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	5/10/2012 2:23:20 AM	I was put on Crestar about 4 years ago and after 3 days I was having leg pain. A week later I was trying to get up and my legs wouldn't hold me up. I went to the hospital for a week, they didn't give me the Crestar, but did run all kinds of test. I got better and they released me without knowing what had happened to me or why I got better. I didn't know why either. When I got home I went back on the Crestar, and two days later  I could feel the leg pain coming back. Of course it dawned on me then. I can't believe  my Doctor didn't have a clue. Hospital bill was over $5,000 my insurance paid it all. Well here I am 4 years later, new Doctor, of course, but he kept bugging me. Yeah, I got talked into trying Pravastatin. I took one pill waited a day took another one waited 2 days, and sure enough, I started having leg pain. I'm not waiting for my legs to give out this time. I will NEVER take another cholesterol pill EVER again. I have always been more active then most people my age, and I want to keep it that way. What the heck is wrong with these Doctors? And the Drug Companies that make this crap and getting rich---I think everyone working there should have to take they own medicine. I can't say in strong enough language &quot;BUYER  BE WARNED&quot;.
High Cholesterol	Steve A., 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	5/8/2012 8:05:07 AM	I was hammered by 10mg of Pravastatin. Muscle aches all over, it hurt to even walk. Severe abdominal pain on the upper right side at ribcage. Flu like symptoms and made me very tired and irritable. Gave me nasty gas too. Went off two weeks ago and only now starting to feel better. Doctor pressured me into taking it. This stuff is poison to me and I threw it in the trash. Anything that makes you feel so bad can NOT be good for you. Prefer to put faith in the PAULING THERAPY because it makes more sense and I feel much better. I will never take statins again. They are poison that hurt your body and prevent your body from working as nature intended. Also, the tests for cholesterol most doctors are using are obsolete. Ask for VAP test, it is more accurate.

Also been walking/ jogging 6 times per day and back in the weightroom 2 times a day.  Eating alot of fish, lean chicken, oatmeal, flax-seeds, greek yogurt, cheerios.  Just want to tell young guys like me who may be freaked out by their cholesterol levels and statins that some drugs do work!! (with diet and exercise too:) which I will continue)

High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	3	1	Female	55-64	3/9/2012 12:48:12 PM	Started 4 months ago. High LDL, good HDL, good triglycerides - total 268. Dropped to 210 after 3 months BUT pain in right calf causes walking difficulty and have developed a post-nasal drip - sort of sweet tasting. Going to the doctor next week but for now, stopped taking 20mg dose. I'm thin, low-risk, ex-smoker (20 yrs ago),both parents had high chol but lived to be 88 &amp; 84. Thinking I'm done with statins!
High Cholesterol	Aikenite, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	3/2/2012 11:57:53 AM	After trying 5-7 other statin drugs, etc. for high choloesterol(low HDL and high LDL) my VA PCC decided to try this one. It has been great for me and I needed one badly due to congestive heart failure in 98. In 2 months time my overal cholerterol went from 220 to 165. Just got my lab report last week and it covered the period 12/12/11 to 2/21/12. My bad went from 151 to 103(needs to be under 100) and my good stayed the same at 34(need to get it up to 40). Don't know why it stayed the same. Just need to exercise more, he says. I was on 20mg per day until he saw whether or not I could tolerate it. Had severe leg pain with all the other statin drugs. I had very little (tolerable) muscle ache with pravastatin, compared with the others. The only major side effect I had was constipation initially. I was able to compensate for that by doubling my dosage of Aloe Vera, which I take daily for regularity. That worked for me after 3-4 days. I am a strong believer in Pravastatin now, and my sister takes it also. She has had no problems with it. If you have had problems with statin drugs, make sure your doctor tries this one on you.

Had to pull myself up the stairs at night. I took myself off it and now the Dr. wants me to try something else which is super expensive. I don't think so not with the prices of everything now-a-days. I'll try a low cholesterol diet.

Hair thinning and morning muscle pain and back aches are part of the cure I guess.  Will have test in 3 months to see if a lower dose will provide same results.

I have also had severe muscle spasms in my legs and much pain in my neck, back, and shoulders. I stopped taking the medication yesterday. I have to call my dr. and tell her I couldn't tolerate the side effects anymore.

I took pravasatin from December 2009 to March 2011 after developing  Uti's and severe muscular inflammation. My hair was falling out rapidly leaving me with half the amoount of hair before taking this dangerous drug. Loss of appetite and taste which caused me to lose weight. I also had such involuntary quivering of my hands that I could barely sign my name legibly. There are numerous other symptoms as well, that became evident to me after reading WebMD's web site.Some of these have subsided but others remain since I stopped taking Pravasatin.  After changing doctors in June it was discovered that I have pancreatitis.

It takes me 2-3 minutes to even stand up from sitting, and once I stand it's hard to step forward my muscles ache and burn in my legs so badly.  I called the Dr since they were not supposed to do that, I've taken myself off of them. These meds are extremely bad for someone like me

After several days I noticed I was achy all over, esp my neck,awful headaches, couldn't sleep,constant hip pain, tossed &amp; turned all night. I began to research this ''drug'' online. These statins are lethal!! They should be taken off the market yesterday! My dr. switched me to Crestor, gave me samples. I researched Crestor, same side effects...Lipitor...same side effects. I'm opting for a ''natural'' way to lower my cholestrol. These cholestrol lowering drugs can act like a death sentence for some. I'm very active at 59, have gone thru rectal cancer and do not want to waste my time in pain from these drugs. WAKE UP DOCTORS --LOOK INTO WHAT THESE DRUGS ARE DOING TO YOUR PATIENTS! I know it's guaranteed ''repeat'' business, but have a little bit of humanity! For me, it was like taking a pill to GET Fibromyalgia! BAN statins!!!

Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	9/20/2011 1:12:25 PM	After being on this drug for 12 days, I experienced upper leg pain, upper arm pain,pain across the upper back and shoulder areas. I had stomach pain and severe abdominals cramps and a severely dry throat that I has a hard time swallowing my own saliva even after sipping water to help alleviate the problem.I started coughing and had flu like symptoms.I took myself off the drug and called to tell my doctor I was off this drug. Within 5 days,I was experiencing extreme coughing and what I thought was flu like symptoms. It ended up triggering my asthma. It triggered the worst bronchial attack I have ever had. Ended up in the ER for Severe Reactive Asthma.I'm now on Prednosome and Albuterol to clear up the asthma. All this I believe due to the side effects of this drug.I'm having a follow up with my doctor in two days after all this.

I have only read one review re memory loss but I defintely have that, increasingly bad joint pain, neck pain and spasms, tingling in hands and feet. I never thought of it being the drug but I am going to see the Dr. and taper off. Thanks you.  Does anyone else have the memory/concentration issues?

Lost sleep, bad dreams and a tough start to the day is enough for me. They can fix heart problems but all this and then maybe hurt liver which can't be fixed just not worth the effects. I would like to know just how many doctors take this bet they want tell us.

My weight went from 244 to 305, i'm 53 yrs old , don't want to have sex any more,been like that for about 1 yr, can't sleep at night, have depression, can't get in the sun for no longer than 10-15 min without feeling i'm in an oven, am extremly disinterested in life in general, can't concentrate, have allergies worse than i've ever had in my life! To the point , i'm ready to sell my home and property and move out west to try-n- get relief. The severe nose, throat, sinus and lung problem's i'm experiancing are very chronic, i take 4 zertecpill's a day plus use 12 hr. nose spray about 8 times EVERY 24 hrs and still don't get but minimal relief.I'm a heart patient and have to take sotalol so i can't take allergie shots without the risk of dying, which i told my allergy dr. i would sign a release to go ahead and get a shot any way, to no avail. My experiance is awful with this drug and starting today i'll not take it again. I'd rather die from cholesterol complications but hopefuly live being unstopped in my breathing and congested ALL THE TIME thn live like i've been living !

After 2 months on it I have dry skin and itching with bumps on my arms and a huge red patch of what looks like hives on my right leg.  I itch terribly and have tried everything topical.  I scratch until I bleed and am planning to stop the medicine and talk to the doctor after being off of it.

The past few weeks having lots of muscle pain all over, feel swollen in fingers, toes even eyes. Leg hurts so bad it's hard to drive. Never thought it could be drug since I've been on it all this time but a co worker suggested it could be so called the dr. He took me off of it a week ago , now waiting to see if I feel better after a couple weeks. Saw on abc news that statins can damage muscles---I won't be taking any more that's for sure.

Pravastatin works for me with no side effects that I can tell.  I also have MS though, and I had MS fatigue well before I started the Pravastatin.All in all, I'm pretty sure this rx is working for me and I'll continue to take it every evening like prescribed.

This medication combined with a closer watch on diet has brought my level down to 142 and my triglycerides down to 262.My LDL is 62 but my HDL still needs a bit of work being 22. Not only did the Pravastatin give me excellent results in bringing my levels down, it is a Wal-Mart $4 generic drug, which most pharmacies will match. I am very happy with it.

Found out I had high cholesterol in November of 2010 and tried to exercise and eat right but only lost weight and my score only went down 11 points. I have gained some weight back, and it has been harder to keep the weight off since I have been on the medication. In the first couple of weeks I was sick to my stomach constantly. Will be getting my levels checked again in August.

When I started taking it I was in the best shape of my life, 6'2&quot; and 190lbs.  I am an avid runner (25-35 miles a week) and run a sub 7:00 mile.  I am also currently training for a marathon.  Since starting this drug I have not changed my diet or exercise routine and have gained 20 lbs!  No it isn't muscle weight either.  My belly fat has increased with my waistline, weight loss is impossible with this drug.  I am quitting this drug immediately and will give an update.  This drug pummels your liver so bad that your metabolism is non-existent.  I will post an update to confirm but there is no reason why I can run 10 miles without losing an ounce while maintaing a healthy diet.

The doctor prescribed it because I quit my job and wouldn't have health insurance.  It cost less than the Simvastatin I was taking at the time. I hate this drug.  I had the same results as one of the other reviewers including extreme anxiety, agitation and depressed mood. It also raised my blood pressure and gave me gas. I noticed my hair was thinning, but didn't connect it with the drug.  Am taking the Simvastatin again and will advise my doctor of the problems with Pravastatin.  I do not like taking statins.  I think they are harmful and will look for natural alternatives.

These symptoms came on in the last 3 days.  I called the Doc, and will not take anymore of this drug. 
High Cholesterol	beingcarefulwithdrugs, 65-74 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1		65-74	2/23/2011 11:20:31 AM	My doctor prescribed this drug for my borderline high cholesterol and I am researching side effects on this web site, which is very very useful for me at this time.  My comment is that dozens of the comments concluding miserable side effects have effectiveness (this medication has worked for me) rated 5 stars.  This common reviewer mistake has overstated the average effectiveness score.

Terrible headache, nasal drip, ringing ears, nausea, and espically insomnia.  Dizzy.  Awake for 3 days and not sleepy.  MD says it must be the flu.  Tough it out was the advice.  I didn't take the third dose of 40 mg.  Next day I felt very well.  Flu doesn't begin on the first day of a med and end when the med stops.  But I am not an MD, so what do I know?  He says tough it out.  I am not physically able to do that.

Initially I noticed about a 30% decline in TC and LDL. After the second year the numbers climbed by 20%. I stopped taking it for 3 months and then started again for 10 days before before going in for a blood draw. The numbers were back down by 20% but after 3 more months of taking the medication daily the levels have climbed back up by 20%. I do not notice any side affects of the drug except that my penis has increased in length by several inches and for the 3 months that I was not taking the drug I was horney all the time. I think that I am going to discontinue use for three more months and then beging taking it again.

My shins down into my feet cramp so bad at nite it wakes me up from sleep. It seems like when I relax is when the terrible cramping in my shins start! I was on Crestor after having a heart stent in June by August my hands and feet were giving me so much pain I was totally disabled. Even went to a RA doctor thinking it was RA! And now after reading these post I believe it was The Crestor. I started taking pravastatin in Sept started having neck, shoulder and elbow pain so bad I couldn't function. Quit taking it for a few weeks and neck pain got better. After I have started back taking the pravastin I am having servere shin and foot cramps I have never known anyone to have cramps in their shins that runs down into my feet as bad. It literally brings me to tears! I am quiting taking these meds! Hopefully Doctor will give me something else or I may try herb treament...have heard that garlic capsules reduce cholestrol...Good Luck to everyone out there with the same problems!
High Cholesterol	Soooo Tired, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	65-74	12/14/2010 3:58:29 PM	I previosly took Zocor for 10 months--- had severe muscle pain and memory loss on 20 mg then 10 mg dose. Stopped taking any statin for about 9 months and the symptoms resolved over time, although not completely as far as regaining full muscle strength. My total cholesterol rose again to 255. By the way, I've always had very low triglycerides(less than 85)and high HDL(+75).My Dr. convinced me to try pravastatin 10 mg. and after 2 months my labs show a good result---Total cholest. down 50 points. The good news ends there.After the 1st. month on pravastatin, I have increasing fatigue, gas and bloating, heart palpitations,and balance problems that have contributed to stumbling and a painful fall. I'm seeing the Dr. tomorrow and I think I&quot;ll just take my chances with no more meds. QUALITY of life DOES matter!! Thanks to all of you for sharing--it helps to know that I'm not going crazy.

I've had all the side effects that everyone else described, especially the joint pain. I've had one other that I haven't seen here yet.I call it the &quot;yawning tremors&quot;. When ever I yawn, my whole body shakes uncontrolably. If I'm holding a cup of coffee and yawn....coffee's all over the floor, If I'm walking and yawn.....I stagger all the way to the other side of the hall. It's not worth it when my levels were only 210 to start with.

High Cholesterol	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	11/20/2010 12:41:19 PM	Severe pain in muscles and joints. Feels like a fracture. I've been using a cane to walk for a month now...it's either that or a wheelchair! I've also experienced headaches, sore throat, bloating, heart palpitations, constipation and insomnia.  Whether it's all due to the drug I'm not sure. After a month off the drug and taking muscle relaxers and pain meds I'm not seeing much improvement.  It's very discouraging. This med, in my opinion, should be used with extreme caution or not at all. I am a very active person - or used to be - being almost homebound now is not acceptable.

Lots of muscle pain on waking in the morning, it was consistance. Had to try something else. Pravastatin so far seems to be working without the sore muscle, However, it's a little early to really tell if it is really that effected. i'll know when i see my docter next month, after a blood test is done.  bennie prince

Have had increasing muscle aches, constipation, and my fingernails are getting dry and brittle.  My choesteral levels are much better but I don't feel well. My doctor says I have to realize I'm getting older. I don't like that answer to everything.  I've started eating a vegan diet and that's helping with weight loss. When I ate this way several years ago, my overall chol number went from 200 to 150 in one month.  I'll be going to the doctor in December and am anixous to see what my numbers are after eating a vegan diet for 3 months.  After reading all the reviews I'm getting off this medication.

Almost as though someone is &quot;twisting&quot; my lower back muscle on right side.  Pain comes and goes.  Cut back to 30mg dose and still experiencing same thing. Medicine has only slightly lowered BAD cholesterol.  I do watch my weight and eating habits.  However, this issue is due to &quot;male&quot; genes in my family I'm afraid.  Wife's doctor took her off Zetia.  Next for me might be Crestor but do not know what kind of issues I will experience with insurance on this issue.  Lipitor worked early on, but got real bad lower and upper leg cramps at night. Severe enough to drive me OUT of bed.  Back pain is suspect from medicine because I do exercise and walk about 4 miles 3x per week.  Good luck to all.

I have been taking various meds since age 19 and I am 26 now.  Crestor worked the best but it is expensive and insurance won't cover it.  I take 80mg daily of Pravastatin and wonder if this can be a reason that I can't get rid of my acne.
High Cholesterol	EchoOne, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	45-54	10/10/2010 9:56:15 PM	My doctor perscribed Pravastatin just 3 days ago to help lower my cholesterol levels...I'm borderline high.  After reading all of these negative reviews on Pravastatin's sided effects, I've decided to stop taking this drug and seek an alternative medication...this many people having the same side effects is certainly cause for concern.

Dr. has now increased it to 40mg/day., now I am very fatiqued, stomach crampy and gassy.I have lost a lot of strength in my arms. Just don't feel good!?!?!?!? If it hadn't lowered my #'s in a year, wouldn't you think the doctor would change me to something that DOES work?!?!?!

Friends helped me realize the muscle pain I was having resulted from the Crestor.  Reported this to the Dr. right away. He started me back on Statin. Within 2 wks, all muscle pain was gone. No other other complaints. I would rather take a medication than shorten my life.

Reviews like this is what matters. Doctors don't tell you this stuff. The nurse only told me about the muscle aches. Unbelievable!

When I told my doctor he put me on 40mg Pravastatin.  The first three months were fine.  I then started having extreme muscle and joint pain especially in my legs.  I felt like I was going to lose my ability to walk.  I decided to stop taking for one week.  Almost immediately my legs felt better.  However, my cholesterol is very good.  I have atrial fibrillation and my doctor wanted my cholesterol in control.  I honestly don't know what to do.

That is when I researched the internet for info and found this site and one other one where blurred vision was mentioned.  I stopped taking the medication, by the 7th day the blurred vision completely disappeared.  You make your own decision.

High Cholesterol	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/15/2010 11:27:04 PM	I took 10 mg every other day for several months. I didn't have any of the problems other people have listed. My cholesterol didn't go down enough so my doctor suggested taking it daily. I've been doing that for 2-3 months. My total cholesterol is 179 and LDL is 104. My doctor just switched me to Crestor 10 mg yesterday because he said it lowers LDL better and he wants mine under 70. I had decent results with no muscle problems on pravastatin. It seems there are only bad reviews on here, so I'm adding my two cents that these statins do help.

High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	7/7/2010 9:59:38 AM	I have been on this drug for about 7 weeks now; I can't really speak as to the effectiveness as I haven't had blood work done yet but I have experiences many of the side effects that others have and did not think about it being the medication until the other day.  I have had severe abdominal pains (thought I had a parasite), loose bowels, extreme joint pain in already arthritic knee (thought it was the rainy weather), leg pain ?), loss of strength in upper right leg, some swelling.  I am taking myself off the meds for a week to see if these side effects go away or at least lessen in that time.  I had thought in the beginning that I had hurt my one leg but now the symptoms have spread to the other leg and also the arthritic joints in my left hand have been hurting more.  I don't think it's just coincidence...no one knows your body like you do and so I will see what happens after going off of it for a while.

At first it lowerd my cholestrol 50 point with just 10mg a day, then my cholerstol began to climb again.  My doctor advised to increase the dose to 20 and I did and tolerated it well for a year, just recently she told me to go to 40mg because the numbers were climbing again.  Thats when the real problems started.  With the first dose of 40mg I woke from a sound sleep with difficulty breathing and feeling very anxious. After two doses I lowered the dose to 30mg but the diffiulty breathing persits, my urin was dark and my hair was falling out.  The least of the sympoms was muscle pain.  I have stopped taking it until I see the doc again.

The next day swelling behind left kneecap.  Stopped taking it but thinking the symptoms were due to a slight fall around that time I tried again 2 months later.In less than a week of being on it again at the same dosage I experienced rash on my arms and legs, diarrhea, and extreme itchiness.  No more statin drugs for me especially since reading the reviews which really helped me.  Thank you all.

I hope the 40mg works, I was very disappointed that after 6 months, the Physician felt I needed it doubled after he reviewed my recent blood test.

In that time I have experienced increasingly severe muscle and joint pain primarily in my back/hips, legs and knees. Last week it finally occurred to me that this pain had begun about the time I started taking the statin drug for moderately high cholesterol. I have now been off the drug for about 4 days and today I feel better than I have in weeks. I have a follow up appointment with the Dr. this week and will have to decide how to proceed.

I have been using this drug for over a year now. The only complaint I have is with the packaging. I do not like the blister pack and I empty it into a pill bottle I have saved. I take this medication as soon as I wake up, even though it is recommended that it be taken at night. I don't know why this is but I can remember to take the pills better first thing in the morning.

Increased Triglycerides and Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	5/1/2010 8:40:06 PM	I was on Pravastatin for a period of 4 months.  It decreased my total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL dramatically.  I did develop muscle soreness and just a sense of feeling unwell while on it.  I also developed a &quot;floater&quot; in one of my eyes, which I did not connect to the drug at the time.  I then stopped the drug for 4 months...numbers went back up. The floater pretty much went away.  I started it again two days ago...and the floater is back in the same eye that I had trouble with the entire four months I was first on this medication.  Has anyone else had this experience?

High Cholesterol	Vgaston, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	4/28/2010 11:06:04 PM	I was on Lipitor for a few years without incident. Brought down the high cholesterol. When I switched insurance companies they wouldn't cover Lipitor. My doctor prescribed Pravastatin Sodium instead. Took it for two weeks and the pain started after three days of taking. On the third day the pain was so great that I called my doctor. He directed to me to the ER. Sounded like a heart attack. The 24 hour emergency clinics also direct me to the ER. I was trying to avoid the expense. But ultimately I did go to the ER and they did an EKG to rule out heart attack. Everything checked out okay $1000.00 later. Back to the doctor and he thought it was a strained muscle. When I asked the doctor could it be the Pravastatin he said no because it was unilateral. He prescribed muscle relaxers, pain pills, weeks worth of steroids.  A lot of crap to dump into my body. Nothing helped. I stopped taking the Pravastatin after two weeks and started to feel better. So, two weeks off of the Pravastatin I felt like I was getting better. So, again I started back on the Pravastatin regime. Within two days the pain became unbearable. So, now I am definitely off of Pravastatin. Especially after reading all of these very useful comments. Thank you. I thought I was losing my mind. We all deserve a giant refund plus my ER visit paid for by this company that makes this poison.

High Cholesterol	haggy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	3/11/2010 2:56:35 PM	Took it for one month. Eventually I began to connect my symptoms to the medication...built up slowly: sick flu like headache, nausea on awakening, and stomach tender, eyes sensitive to light, body aches and pains, and increasing pain to already arthritic joints. All I wanted to do was go home and sit in the recliner. Forget it. Took eight full days for symptoms to stop after I quit taking it. Restarted to determine if symptoms would come again...and after ONE dose I awoke with that same old sick headache and stomach ache. No more.
High Cholesterol	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	3/8/2010 11:55:27 PM	I HATE the packaging.  The wasteful plastic casing and blister pack is a major inconvenience and horribly bulky and unnecessary.  I need to take 60 mg/day so I need 1-1/2 tabs, so the blister pack is a pain.  I've requested to have the pills loose in a bottle, and have been unable to get it this way.  Who thought this up?  Very unnecessary, wasteful, and difficult to use.

The only thing lately is I seems to be getting more blemishes on my chin, which would be ok if I was 14 or 15, but not at age 59.  Going to check with dermotologist.

I mentioned this to the Doc but he said he had never heard of this effect. Told him &quot;one size doesn't fit all&quot;. I would be interested to know if anyone else has had this problem?

The pain causes me to not be able to function - might as well be dead from a heart attack.I am a firm believer that the pharmacy companies pay the doctors to push drugs and doubt the doctors do anything except push for more to be taken.

I was on the meds for over a year and have been having foot problems, even had surgery on one foot.  Had difficulty putting on dress shoes or boots of any kind had to resort to wearing tennis shoes almost constantly.  Stopped taking it and within 3 days, I was able to wear my dress shoes comfortably and no more foot pain.  The only pain is on the foot that had the operation.   Would have never associated foot pain had my brother not be given the same pill.

I was put on this med about 2-3 yrs. ago. At first for several months I never noticed any side effects that I attributed to this med. I have had fatigue, muscle pain, severe in my wrist and elbows and lower legs, severe gas and bloating,for at least two years now but attributed it to my ostioarthritis. Then in the past 6 mos. I started to have severe stomach pain. I had the upper and lower GI exams twice, Abdominal ultrascan, MRI, etc. and they found nothing but gas. Still, not a single DR. said anything about the Prevastatin could be the cause of the pain. I got tired of the pain and was going to switch the meds around from taking the prevastatin in the evening to take it in the morning. I went off of it for two days and &quot;Wa-La&quot; all of the abd. pain quit and the other pain seemed to be a lot less. I decide to quit it for a while. I been off of it for 4 days now and all of the pain, fatigue, abd. pain etc. has gone. I will never take it again. I feel good now.

My Doctor had me on an oil based statin and I had all the negative side effects from the previous Medication, I told my Doctor, I refused to continue the Medication... With Pravastatin, I have experienced no bad side effects with this Medication, NONE. I am very satified with the use of this product, and after 2 blood tests the Doctor seems satified with the effectiveness of the treatment. If your on another Medication and are experiencing negative side effects, Deppression, Forgetfullness, Diarea, Severe Muscle Cramps, Chest Pains, etc. Try this one.

But I am worried that aching legs/circulation? may be attributable to taking pravastatin.

They did NOT prevent me from having two stents put in in 2005. Have been in constant pain (joints &amp; muscle) for several years and had no energy whatsoever.. Thought pain was caused by arthritis. I've been &quot;eating&quot; ibuprofen to manage the pain. Finally threw all the statins away and have been statin free for 10 days now. Enjoy life again, no pain and have not taken an ibuprofen in 10 days! Still have little twinges of arthritis in the knees and shoulders once in a while but absolutely no more constant pain every time I move or sit still for any period of time. Regardless of what the doctors say, NO MORE statins for me! Quality of life in important too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

High Cholesterol	Sharon, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	4/13/2009 11:58:15 AM	Started taking this med Oct08 &amp; it worked great at lowering my LDL/TriG levels. But in Jan09 I suddenly developed a severe migraine headache that lasted 10 WEEKS non-stop! Nothing would relieve the pain but the strongest migraine meds and they would only work for a few hours.  After numerous tests and treatments(xray, MRI, therapy, pain meds) I asked my MD if it could be the Pavastatin since that was the only thing that had changed in recent months. I stopped taking it and by the 3rd day the pain had significantly decreased. Now a month out the headache is completely gone and so is the muscle pain that I didn't realize had also developed. I had previously been on Vytorin but developed muscle pain and stiffness all over, (but no headache that I remember). Thus the change to Pravastatin. I've found that it's easy NOT to relate this muscle pain, headache, etc. to these statins because they develope so slowly over months. I &quot;put up&quot; with it not knowing something was wrong until it became too severe. Don't let that happen to you.

High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/15/2009 9:10:03 PM	Started on this drug two weeks ago.

I was tired all the time, had a dull headache and generally felt awful. I stopped taking it the next day and a week later I am starting to feel normal again. Called Dr. to report side effects and the nurse acted like I was crazy. He wants me to take Lipitor now. Don't know what to do. I guess I'll have to change doctors if I don't do what he says. Thank God for this website or I might think I am crazy. I had just as soon die of a heart attack as live like this.

I'm only 48 and in good shape, not overweight, feel fine but I was diagnosed with high triglycerides 2 weeks ago and got the $4 40mg scrip.  I've been taking it just before bed.  I've noticed bowels gassing up and gurgling alarmingly most of the night and restless sleep.  Last night the blood concentration must have kicked in, bad night.  Back broke out into an itchy rash, had bad nightmares all night and had a horrible calf cramp it took me 20 minutes to get loosened, I thought my shin was going to snap off and throw my foot across the room, boy it hurt, I'm still sore.  I play golf and carry my bag walking and have never had leg problems.  It's too early to see if it does anything for my tri levels but that's the only thing I've done different.  I'm going to stop using it for a few days as an experiment to see if the symptoms go away.  Until I read this review I didn't know statins much, never took them.  Sounds like they work for some people and are a train wreck for others.  Sometimes the cure can be worse than the problem I guess, we'll see.

However the beating heart rate like a rat's very fast and scary along with the overall discomfort and not being able to think start. I am beginning to feel better, but feel this drug was not helpful to me at all only very very hurtful.

Side effects slipped up on me, at first I just thought I was getting mild arthritis, but the pain just kept getting worse until I hurt all day and all night.  Talked to my doctor and have stopped taking.  I Will Not Take This Medication Again!

High Cholesterol	Searcher99, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	12/19/2008 5:49:10 PM	I have experienced sleep disturbance, early waking, and nightmares, as well as dizziness and confusion, with doses of 80 mg, 40 mg, and 20 mg. I am inclined to discontinue and try a more aggressive diet. The side effects seem to affect only a percentage of the population, but for those of us affected, the drug does not seem to be worth these effects. I had switched from Simvastin, which produced the same side effects.

It runs in my family. I was found to have fatty liver in 2007. My body was producing the choles.  I was not eating the fat.  I had no coverage for drugs and dr switched me to this drug for $4.00 a 30 day suppy at walmart.  Tests still showed 250, after yrs on these meds, but my dr added this combined with baby asprin, and 4000 to 6000 MGs a day of fish oil. My newest tests, after a yr of the above useage has ever single one of my blood tests below range, at 135.  The fish oil gives you really bad breath, Dr suggested freezing the tabs first.  He told me to continue everything I was doing. This drug was the only one of 3 statins I used that actually worked, btw, I take 80 MGs a night, thats 2 40 MG tabs.  I have non of the reactions I have read in these reviews.  I can only say if your in that kind of body pain, get tested for all 5 of the deer tick des. (Lyme and 4 others)

Other	Dale, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	55-64	12/9/2008 8:01:04 PM	Leg Cramps I suffered sever leg cramps in my left leg so terrible that I had hemotomas behind my knee and had to get an Ultra sound to find out if I had a Blood clot. When you wake in the middle of the night suffering pain like this is scary. This drug effected me so bad that I will never take it again. I had no problems taking zocor but because of the price I switched to the $7.00 per month medication.I am reporting this to FDA med watch tonight.

So tired at the end of the day, I would slept at least 15 hours a day.  On the weekends, my children could not wake me for hours.  Doctor told me to get over and deal with it.  This is the second statin drug that I have been on and they worked for about six months and now side effects are severe.

Using 20 mg. per day, it has brought my cholesterol levels to well within normal range - with NO side effects whatsoever. At 4 dollars per month (Target &amp; Walmart) you just can't beat the price, either. 
High Cholesterol	sue, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	2	1	Female	45-54	12/2/2008 8:43:02 AM	I am sooo glad I found this review of the drug..thought I was crazy. I am 53 and was on this for s month, wondered why I feel like a buzz in my nead, and a feeling of sinus trouble, also sleep not good, but I am into the hot flash thing, stopped and all seems to be better..I guess I need to talk to Dr. i took Lipitor, but too expensive, but never had these side effects. I agree with others, we might not have a heart attack, but feel like crap..i don't think so...
Increased Triglycerides and Cholesterol	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	55-64	11/30/2008 9:05:15 AM	Started taking 2 months ago. Side effects snuck up on me to the point it was hard to walk and pain every where. Sleep was interupted with the pain in joints, back, neck, ankles even toe joints. Had no desire to participate in anything especially if it required physical movement. I'm 60 and felt like I was 100, maybe worse. I stopped taking this drug 3 days ago and much of the pain is gone already. My doctor advised me to go back to Vytorin. I'm staying off all statins for at least a month to see how I feel at that point. Then I may try the Vytorin and watch carefully if any symptoms return. I'd rather take my chances with high Chol. and Trig. than suffer again like I was. Hope this helps some one but to each their own.

My doctor pressed hard for me to take a statin and I eventually caved in, seeking eternal, good health. I have been on this drug about a month and I am quitting today and resorting to natural methods to reduce my cholesterol. Today, I have a rash on many parts of my body. Some mornings I wake up with my right hand severely cramped into a closed position. This wears off after 5-10 minutes. I have been experiencing flu-like symptoms and thought I had a sinus infection zapping my energy. I lowered my cholesterol before through exercise and diet and will do so again without this dangerous drug! While on it, I ate more beef/cheese and pork than I have ever eaten! It's better to be in charge of my own health and not rely on drugs!

Heterozygous High Cholesterol	45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1		45-54	11/15/2008 11:52:32 AM	I inherited high cholesterol from my mother and I was prescribed this drug.  I had the worst heartburn I ever had in my life.  It felt like it was burning a hole in my stomach and chest. Heart burn is the first side efffect listed for it. Switched to Simvastatin and it seems better, but does have more concerning rare side affects, but no heart burn.

It did lower my cholesterol from 245 to 170 but at what cost.how much more damage has it done to my body that i am not aware of.My family doc is oblivious to side effects.

I already deal with fatigue so couldn't tell if it was from this drug and was put on a drug to help me sleep. Reading all these reviews is ver scary, think I'll start eating better and call Curves and get working on their program. Also call my Dr. about how scared I am to take this.

I started a pilates class and thought I was sore from the exercise until I couldn't use my right hand and started limping.  Felt like I had a bad case of the flu.  I've been off this medication for 3 days and I think I'm getting back to normal.

Zocar least amount of muscle discomfort but doc switched after the recent news about it not treating heart disease.  10mg of Pravastatin has brought me to my knees.  Severe insomnia; ankle/joint pain; right hand nearly without function.  Stopped for two weeks; little relief.  Am now cutting 10mg. in half and will take till annual physical in May.  Must take something as it's genetically rampant in family.  What a mess.

It was so sever that I couldn't even walk. My Dr.thought I had RA and sent me to a specialist. After x-rays and blood work showed nothing, I figured out for myself that this was just a side effect of the drug. I've stopped taking it and feeling back to my old self!

Bad stomach aches, muscle aches, headaches, definitely not worth pain. Now wants me to take Wechel, 6 a day, $50 for a month for something that may have same results! Odd though is that total cholesterol is 155, hdl is 41, ldl is 95. I'm diabetic but I do have a good diet with lots of fiber, grains and vegetable. This also aggravated my fibromyalgia, a pain disorder, which he acts like doesn't exist. I have specialist. Feel like two different patients, not one. Right now, not taking this!

I hate it.  I'm exercising more, eating better, not losing weight.  The constipation is horrible.  Debating whether to quit cold turkey.  Seems ridiculous to make yourself feel terrible, yet you may get to live longer.  There is a big tradeoff.

No muscle problems or GI problems at all.  I am concerned using generic because each month the pill is different.  One month it is green and round, the next it is white and oval, the next it is yellow/tan and round.  I have to check it every month and that gets tiresome.

Had taken for years when the insurance made me to the the Generic. Extreme pain after walking any distance. Arms asleep and numb in morning. Chest and upper abdomen pain.Arms ache all day and finger ache at night. Generic I believe is life threatening. Quit for 10 days and felt a lot better.  Tried again 1 night and same thing all over again, maybe worse.  Scary.  Don't know if I can go back and pay the $138 plus for the non-generic and still have the side effects or not.  Remember, as my pharmacist says, what is the largest muscle in your body, your heart!  My theory also on generic is if you can get something for $10 that would would normally cost a lot more, what are you really getting?

High Amount of Triglyceride in the Blood	mustangmonty, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	35-44	2/9/2008 7:56:20 PM	I had no medical problems other than high triglceride and cholesterol prior to taking this mediaction. Within one week of starting this I was in the hospital having my stomach pumped and on an IV for three days. According to the diagnoses my bowl had stopped working. I stopped the medication when they admitted me and never started it back. The only change in my diet, life style, or medication before and after my hospital stay was this medication. My Doctor stopped short of saying this was the problem &quot;because he prescribed it&quot; but he insisted on me not starting back on it. I ended up paying out of my pocket $2000.00 in co-pays and lost two weeks of my life for this fiasco. I would like to point out that I am a 37 year old male with no medical history, in-fact I had a colenostcopy and a upper GI completed one year before and it all came back perfect. I PLAN TO AVOID THIS STUFF LIKE A PLAGUE!!!!!!!!

Increased Triglycerides and Cholesterol	Helen, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female		1/13/2008 5:21:11 PM	My prescription was 1 tab (40mg)per day in the evening.  Had to change to taking in morning because it interrupted my sleep tremdously.  Then, after a couple of weeks, I noticed the aches and pain worsening.  I also experienced unsteadyness.  After discontinuing the last three days, my symtoms have vanished and I feel great again.  It was poisoning me for sure.  No more statins for me!  More treadmill!

I'm 44 years old and with taking this drug daily I feel like I'm in my 80's.  Walking and standing are very painful.

Now I am experiencing moderate to severe muscle pain in my back , neck and shoulders.  I went to the doctor last month and I am now back on this med @ 40 mg per day.

My cholesterol and triglyceride level/s are now well within normal range. I've had no side effects (other than some slight stomach upset in the first month). Another added benefit: Target and Walmart offer Pravastatin for only 4 dollars per month.
