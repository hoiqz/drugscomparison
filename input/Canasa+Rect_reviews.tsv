Other	ktime, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/20/2012 8:12:34 AM	I have Ulcerative Colitis. I take this med. once at night before bedtime. It has helped my symptoms of diarrhea and bloody stools, but I do experience bloating and constipation for about 3 days in a row. When I stop this med. for a day just so I can have a bowl movement, the symptoms return, so I guess I will just suffer with the bloating for now.

It worked well just the first week, then I had a bad flair up. This medicine seems to work well for most people, but it didn't work for me. But I also didn't have any side effects.
Ulceration of the Rectum	martigras, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/4/2011 11:08:02 PM	I've only been on this for less than a month. This is a 'God Send' for me. Started having horrible stomach cramping, along with frequent mucous, and at times bloody stools starting in June. Had every test possible run. I lost a total of 35 lbs. during all this. My cramping and frequent stools slowed down on their own about a month ago, but a constant itching continued in my rectum, thinking perhaps I needed a fissure fixed or something. It was like I wasn't cleaning myself enough, needing to constantly use baby wipes over and over. Then having hydrocortisone suppositories prescribed for that feeling. Even that didn't help with the itchy, dirty feeling. But as soon as I started with the Canasa, that stopped and my daily lower back ache I had every time I needed to have a stool went away too. I thank my lucky stars for insurance co-pays because I know w/o it, it would cost us about $20 a piece. With our insurance, only pay $40 for a month's worth.

Ulceration of the Rectum	 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3			9/19/2011 10:31:17 PM	I got diagnosed with UC a few months back. At first it worked right away. I was absolutely amazed at not having any symptoms or sudden urges to go to the bathroom. I took a month's supply and ran out before I had my follow-up appointment. My symptoms came back and was put back on Canasa a couple of weeks later. It worked for about a week. I ran into a stressful situation and the symptoms came back the next week. I'm hoping the disease hasn't crept up more into the colon. Things have been a little better this week.

Discharge of mucous and feces has kept my activities limited, as I need to be near a bathroom.  I have taken canasa for 2 weeks and see a huge improvement.  I had no side effects until yesterday a gassy sore stomach, but it could have been from something else, and don't have it today.  I am very pleased, but it has not cured me so far.

I'm allergic to aspirin side effects being severe hives. Canasa is not recommended for me but it's difficult to leave the house so tonight I cut 1/4 and inserted it along with taking a benadryl. I'm hoping I do not have a reaction because I don't know what else to do.

Ulceration of the Rectum	person78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	3	1	Female	25-34	10/19/2010 10:55:06 AM	Was diagnosed with proctitis a couple of weeks ago after a really bad flare up. I took this straight for a week and found that it helped, then all of the sudden it began to give me really bad side effects. I stopped taking for one day and called my doctor, who instructed me to continue taking. Have been on the 1000mg supp. for over a week with no improvement. In fact I feel like it is worse--especially sudden urges and spasms. It's weird, this seems so effective for others and not for me. Take fiber, work out regularly, eat healthy, and still no relief.

I finally found a way to use them by using a vaginal applicator for yeast infections. I don't know why someone doesn't invent an applicator for rectal supp. All in all the medicine worked wonders.

I take lialda and fiber daily which has controlled my flare ups a lot more than Assacol but I do still get very mild flare ups and the canasa 1000mg clears it up right away. it does give me gas in the mornings and I'm bloated all day but ill take that any day over pain and living in the bathroom.

I had been suffering for over 6 months. I was afraid to be more than 10 feet from a bathroom. After a week of taking the medication I was feeling normal again and could resume my travel schedule. Life goes on ... I recommend this drug for anyone with Proctitis, or similar symptoms.

So far, not too bad.  Very easy to use and very mild side effects. Slight lower ab cramping, with very little gas. Its been 3 days now and I've seen a slight improvement.  So i'm keeping my fingers cross and hoping it will clear up my situation soon with very little side effects.

I have been using it off and on for a year. I wish I had been taking it regularly before I had a flare up, but within 1-2 weeks I was through it. My doctor recommended I start with 2 daily and then move to once a day. I think consistency is key. I haven't noticed any side effects because my symptoms previously were so bad (hard to tell what is UC related and what is drug related). I now feel confident enough to travel and live my normal life.

Doctor upped dose to 2gm but was still symptomatic.  Have also been taking 2.4g Asacol b.i.d.  Just got back from my  colonoscopy and although the proctitis looks better the inflammation has moved into the colon.  Onto mercaptopurine now since the Asacol has not completely worked but the Canasa has been quite effective.

My doctor that this method and drug would focus more on my symptons.  My condition was manable with the azulf. but I still experiened flare-ups.  So he wanted to try this.  IM going to give a while longer, right now its only be 2 weeks;   but the side effects of  cramps and stomach upset are killing me; and its all day.  I going to stick it out.  Maybe trying to take at night instead of in the morning.  I have no problem with leakage or odor., none at all., but its just the cramps.  I will check back for an update.  Maybe my body needs to ajdust.  I apprecited the GAS-X recommendtion , I will try that.  But it seems to work as far as reducing flare-up, but I can focus on whether its working or not because of the cramps.  I will let you know. and I appreciated any input from others with similar symptons.   Take care

I also have gas and have to wear a super maxi pad to make sure it doesn't get on my clothes or underwear (this to avoid others smelling me).  I'm trying to tough it out for the month prescribed, but it won't be easy.
Ulceration of the Rectum	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/4/2009 8:41:33 AM	Had intense urgency issues and excessive gas with anal leakage prior to taking this drug.  After 1 week of use, my symptoms drastically subsided.  After using it for 4 weeks, went back to my doctor, who said the manufacturer recommends an initial use of 6 weeks, so have continued to use canasa for another 2 weeks.  My symptoms have virtually disappeared with no side effects now, other than a little gas (not painful) approximately 3 hours after use with a small oily discharge only once, after the initial discharge of gas.  Much better than the alternative!

Other	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	65-74	6/27/2009 11:03:44 PM	Ihave had bouts of ulcerative colitis for about 30 years. Flair ups occur about once every 3 years and last for about 1 month. Generally, the prescription has been prednisone (20mg tapering off to 5 mg) and asacol. These didn't seem to help with my latest attack. Started Canasa after 1.5 months without relief from other drugs. After 2 doses, all symptoms went away. Not very pleasant using a suppository but drug worked wonderfully.

I realized that my symptoms for this condition have been brought on by stress and have only had several bad episodes over the past few years.  I take this medicine every Sunday and Wednesday night and have not had symptoms since.  The doctor wants to do a re-test but I have been trying to get pregnant.  I will continue to take this medicine through pregnancy per doctor suggestion.
Ulceration of the Rectum	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	8/27/2008 9:43:09 PM	I have been taking this medication on and off for about two years now. I was hoping when I was first diagnosed with proctitus that taking this medication would be temporary. But this has not been the case. I take the medication for about two or three months and then the problem comes back in another couple months. The side effects I have noticed are painful gas and also slight hair thinning (which does grow back when I'm off the medicine). Also I have noticed that if I start the medicine at the first sign of symptoms, it clears up the problem much faster.

It has stopped my symptoms completely but the abdominal discomfort isn't a very fair trade yet. I am hoping the cramping will stop and I get use to the the medication. My research indicates this is a very helpful and successful drug. I would never discourage anyone for trying it but it may take some getting use to. There are side effects! For me I had to weigh the pro's and con's. I didn't want to be stuck in my house all day because I had to use the restroom. Just be ready for cramping and a very tender abdominal area if it effect you that way.

It was either Canasa once a day or Asacol twice a day. So took the Canasa, works great however it seems when stop for about week or week in half everything comes back, just wish  could go little longer than week half without taking medicine.  
Other	Cij, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	65-74	4/19/2008 2:46:07 PM	Proctitis: One mesalamine 500mg suppository at bedtime stopped repeated daily bowel movements with blood and excess mucous in less than a week. Took it for 7 years with several remissions lasting months. Then tappered off over a period of 6 weeks and quit. Had a remission for 6 years.  Proctitis recently returned with frequent bowel movements, blood and excess mucous. Started one mesalamine suppository at bedtime again; blood and mucous stopped within 7 days and normal bowel movements returned.Rowasa no longer available. Canasa is now only available in 1000mg mesalamine suppositories in this area. They are too strong. 500mg worked for me just fine before without so much side affect.
Ulceration of the Rectum	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/14/2008 10:56:35 PM	After much resistance to using this medication my ulcerative colitis was so bad that it was either this medication or injections.  The medication was easy to use and no too hard to remember but I was not prepared for the very uncomfortable side effect of gas; the pressure would wake me from a sound sleep.  I have since incorporated gas-x into my nightly ritual and am much happier for it.  Overall happy with the medication and am hoping that it will postpone was seems to be the inevitable humira/remicaid injections.
