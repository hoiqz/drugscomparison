Pregnancy	vjones, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/2/2010 12:55:48 PM	I just started this prenatal vitamin. So far I love it. It's very small and easy to swallow.

Pregnancy	meme,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		7/3/2009 2:44:41 PM	Going through IVF and nurse presecribed this prenatal for me. I dont like it. It makes me hot all over with a headache. My stomach gets hot, my head gets hot when I rub them probably about 2 hours after taking them. I've only been taking them for a week and decided to stop and get over the counter prenatal because this one is rediculous. I dont want to poison my body. It should not be making me feel this way. I definitely dont like this one at all.

Pharmacist / obgyn switched me to this generic. I now have lots of lower stomach cramps and constipation. I wish I could find more PrimaCare.

Pregnancy	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	5/29/2009 3:12:47 PM	it's a blue/violet/purple color.  looks like artificial candy - hope they don't put too much artificial coloring in it!  it smells fishy, perhaps do to omega?  it doesn't make me consitpated; whereas, primacare (this was recalled, so my doc prescribed me ob natal one), and it's not hard like primacare - altho it's a big pill which is somewhat hard to swallow.  I've only taken this for ~2months, and so far no serious side effects, so that's good.

Seems to be very similar except OB-Natal does not include the stool softener. I have been very constipated since switching to this generic pnv. 
Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/25/2009 1:01:09 PM	I take it as night - my morning sickness has gotten A LOT better although I am still tired all the time &amp; wish the pills were not so big!

Pregnancy	amyd2005, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	2/10/2009 7:31:56 PM	As soon as I started taking this vitamin I began having the diarrhea nausea and uncomfortable feeling of gas.  I wasn' t sure if it was the medication or the pregnancy since this is my first child, but when I didn't take it one night I felt better the next day.  My doc switched me to Tandem DHA so I guess I'll have to wait and see if this makes a difference. I will write a review of Tandem in a few days to keep others informed.
