Possibly the worst shot I've ever had. It made me nauseous, tired, and gave me an overall slow feeling throughout my body. I am slightly anemic and I feel faint from the shot even hours after it.  From what I have read and researched, it isn't going to get better. 
Prevention of Anal Cancer due to Human Papilloma Virus	concerned, 35-44 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/20/2012 1:51:12 PM	my son got shot in august had a seizure immediately has had recurring episodes long story short HE HAS ALUMINUM POISONING there are 2000 ssx of aluminum toxicity look at symptoms more than likely you suffer from it not only is it immunizations but in baby formula and just about everything we eat or rub on our bodies  immunizations never caused this many problems in past when i was a child because i only got half of what kids are getting today.....so if you have a child that has asthma anemia,seizures,eczema,kawasaki disease,coksakie disease,sids,add,autism,headaches,acid reflux,chronic runny nose,skin rash,and there are hundreds more ..have your child tested for aluminum....and while your at it test them for mercury....then when it comes back high your doctor wont know how to treat it but at least you will have an answer and can limit any future exposure sometimes all people need is to just be pointed in the right direction i cant save the world and im not a doctor but everything in the world has been blamed for my childs health problems except the immunization that was injected into his arm....these symptoms appear so far down the line that every symptom is treated independantly with no obvious cause so get tested for aluminum and mercury and set the record straight it is not normal for so many children across the us to be chronically ill...if we do not start looking into this matter this generation of children will be more ill than the elderly that live along side them
Prevention of Cervical Cancer due to Human Papilloma Virus	moma didn't protect child, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	7-12	3/16/2012 6:19:19 PM	12 year old healthy child, 2 weeks after first shot abdominal pain over next several days became most worst and low grade fever. This all started in Nov. here it is March and still one visit after another from hospital to doctors.  Has had elevated liver enzeyms, high phosphate blood work and low lymphocyts, initally low grade fever with elevated heart rate, constant pain some days more than others.Hyda scan showed galbladder fuction 6%, scope showed multiple ulcers and sweollen intestinal track, since taking medication for ulcers todays scopes indicate ulcers have began to heal.  The doctor has taken several tissue samples and we should have biop results back in a few days.  He is thinking she has some form of IBS.  No day for her is pain free 63 days of missed school.  Today while at childrens hospital for more test they asked that I sign a release to place her medical records into a study for adverse reaction to gardasil.  And to set the record straight this vaccine is to prevent HPV virus and not even all forms just a few. A simple routine pap smear can detect these and they can be treated.  However the lasting adverse effect of the vaccine may very well be life long.  A 12 year old looking forward to life long pain.  Not worth it my book. By the way also now 3 other young girls with severe medical issues that develeopled after the vaccine.  Glad to hear that some have no issues but seriously how can you call what is happenning just a handful. This was reported to VARSES and we were told that most reports are coming in from individuals not doctors, I do know that my daughters doctor got on the phone and reported this as well as I called myself to be sure.  Please report any and all serious change in you medical condition
Prevention of Vaginal Cancer due to Human Papilloma Virus	13-18 Female  (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	13-18	12/15/2011 12:40:22 AM	I got the series of shots when I was fourteen. While getting my first shot, I had burning in my chest and later that night I had difficulty breathing. I called my doctor and she said it had nothing to do with the shot. I was afraid of getting the other two, but I didn't want to mess my body up by only getting one. The same exact thing happened with the next two shots. My doctor still insists that it had nothing to do with the shots, but I think it's a little too coincidental. I have had many health problems since then, including headaches and autoimmune disorders.

She never asked if there was a possibility that my daughter might be pregnant. she test negative for std. she never had her period. she was five days late just spotting. she has had pain in her lower abdominal. She has had symptoms of early pregnancy. So i took her back to the Dr for a blood test for pregnancy and another std test. this time the pregnancy test was neg. but she has chlamydia. Needless to say i have no clue what to do. with what i read here everything could be explain by the shot. Thing is if she is pregnant and the test are wrong the treatment for the std could do a lot of harm to her and if she is carrying the baby. so i would not get this shot and my daughter is not getting any more nor is my youngest. the bad thing is my daughter and i were trying to responsible. and all then pa can do is make my daughter and i feel bad about getting tested and push this shot.will not happen again

However, years later I've found out that I have high risk HPV (a strain that can lead to cervical cancer). I don't want to discourage anyone from using this, I think you need all the protection you can get. Nonetheless, contracting high-risk HPV even after this vaccine is very possible- it happened to me.

I wonder if that means anything. After my first two doses it was found that i tested positive for nuclear antibodies, or ANA with 1:160. I read other places that this vaccine can cause autoimmune problems. I'm going to the rheumatologist to get  a diagnosis. I will never know thou, if Gardasil had anything to do.

Doesn't hurt anymore than an tetanus shot. I woke up with a minor headache this morning but that was it. Get the shot if your doctor suggests it would benefit you.
Other	Raegrace, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/26/2010 2:36:45 PM	I was the first one in my community to receive this treatment when it first came out.  I work in a healthcare facility and have for 6 years, therefore I have had much chance to discuss this treatment with my physicians. My OB/GYN is one of the most respected in the area and she recommended Gardasil to me.  I had all three of the series of injections by the end of 2006 after I had my baby. I was 22 at the time.  I had absolutely no side effects whatsoever, and haven't to this day. There are 20 reviews here compared to the millions of girls who have received the treatment.  I urge you all to remember that people are 100 times more likely to complain about something they dont like than they are to spread the word about a good product.  Spend time researching the product and consider your own personal health before making a decision about gardasil.  There are side effects just like with every other medication. You just have to decide if you want to deal with them or not.  Personally, I figured a sore arm is better than cancer.

Since her second shot, 3 months ago, she has not had a period. She's gained 10+ pounds, has cramping, back pain and nausea. She is not getting the last shot. Her dr says a missed period would not be caused by this shot. Clearly, his is wrong!

After the third one I started becoming dizzy all the time and eventually began fainting every single day for over a month. I saw several doctors for this and they tried many different medications to help stop the fainting. I stopped fainting everyday when they prescribed me Metoprolol and Midodrine, but still fainted occasionally,maybe every few weeks. This effected me in college tremendously and I had to move home. I am still paying medical bills for doctor visits and prescriptions. 22 women in Austrailia have died from this vaccine. Yet in the United States they keep it on the market, why? Because our country is run by money and drugs.

I went and got my second shot in June and everyday since then I break out in severe hives. I have outbreaks in the morning and night and have seen an allergiest and the cause they say is due to the shots. Chronic hives is due to auto-immune disorders and the shots have weakened my immune system hince why I break out everyday. Tonight I had to go to the ER because my top lip was swollen like a ballon. Thankfully I do not have to take the third shot, but I wish my doctor wouldn't of pressured me into getting the shots. Sadly I have to take steriods and antihistamines everyday which also have bad long term effects when taken after a certain time. My life is so stressful thanks to the shots. I can't even get the dosage out of my system so I have to live with hives everyday...thanks Gardasil IM!

Used Aldara cream to clear the warts. My partners urologist suggested the gardasil vacination to prevent the re-occurence of the warts. I had the 3 shots and it was the best thing I ever did.  I guess that guardasil  has not been recommender for the older generation,(who knew) but the dr allowed for me to have the shots. Never had any adverse affect from them.

However, after i got the shot I had two abnormal paps, 2 colposcopies, and then now for the past 2 years later everything is great and normal and I have had two normal paps and it has helped tremendously with other HPV conditions. I reccomend it to all young girls who are sexually active.
Other	worried mom, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	5/19/2010 2:52:55 PM	My daughter has received her first injection back in Mar10, after the injection she experienced dizziness, nausea, and felt faint.  I believe she did get her period a couple weeks after her first injection but now she is late for her May period.  I'm freaking out because she is 14 and god help me if she is PG, keep in mind she is only late about 3 days but she usually is regular. She swears to me up &amp; down that there is no way she is PG &amp; I even taken her for a PG test and it came out negative.  I've been trying to figure out what she has done differently that may have caused a missed period.  So I remembered she just recently got the HPV vaccination, that was highly recommended by her doctor.  I did notice she got a few small red dots on her back and neck that looked like chicken pox..and so I started to research and found all these reviews, I hope that the missed period is a result from HPV vaccine.

For several months, I have had mystery stomach/abdominal and chest pain for which I had separate (inconclusive) ER visits. I had a CT scan that came back normal (other than an ovarian cyst, which was not the cause of the pain - different area). Normal EKG. Normal blood tests. I am appalled that these negative effects are not given attention and I was told there were no side effects when my doctor pushed this vaccine on me. I wish I had never gotten the first two shots, since I am engaged and therefore extremely unlikely to ever contract HPV anyway. I urge you, reader: Do not get this vaccine!

A month after the first shot my period became irregular and I started having really bad cramps and heavy flow. I have always had my period on time unless impregnate.(I have three kids.). That went on for 3 months and the doctor told me that it must be stress and gave me samples of cymbolta. Which idid not take. Then I tested + hpv and had precancerous cells.I was treated for that. My period were still irregular and cramping bad. I went in to have a nerve block done on my stomach area and they had to check and make sure that it was not a hurnea. In the sanograhm they found out I have PCOS. This has all happen in the time of 8 months after taking the first shot of gardasil. I did not take the 2 or 3. I have three kids and now I am on hormones to try and help me be fertile.I think the Gardasil is a contribute to this. I now do my home work on meds and shots that the doctors give. You can always go back to the doctors office and get it. I think the FDA need to do more study on this. I think the long term effect is dangerous. Rememeber the FDA approved Cigs. &quot;Doctor&quot; is a job and if they don't push the meds they buy the loose money. Have to keep in mind medical field is a bussiness too! There are a very few docs out there for the right reason.

Although I feel a little drowsy today (and did after my first shot as well) that is the only side effect I have experienced.  There are a lot of horror stories on here from people with bad side effects but don't let them scare you.  Do some research before you decide to get the shots, and weigh the benefits with the side effects.  And make your own choice.  Most of the people on here having terrible &quot;side effects&quot; probably have other conditions or medications that caused them.

She has had a headache for a week and nothing works to take away the pain.We have had a cat scan, bloodwork, heart scan, EEG amd brain MRI. So far all the test come back clear. I am so upset I let her get this vaccine and am sure she is suffering all of this due to it! DO NOT let anyone you know get this shot and do not take any more shots if you have started! This drug needs to be taken off the market and this company needs to reimburse all of these patients for all the tests they have had to take.This is terrible all our girl's are suffering so much!!

I went to urgent care two days later, but the meds they gave me didn't help. It has been 2 years now - I have had daily headaches and migraines ever since. I have seen 4 doctors, tried several medications (&amp; Im not one to take medication) and made many lifestyle changes to cure the headaches - nothing seems to work. All the doctors say it has nothing to do with this shot, but I never had a problem with headaches before. I think they need to do more research &amp; test cases before continue giving out this shot.

I got my second shot  3 months later and did fine with it. I then went back to my gyno who then redid my pap smear and it still came back abnormal. I'm on my way to get cervical cancer. Needless to say but I did not get the last shot. I believe this shot makes your chances of getting cancer higher not lower. I would not recomended this shot to ANYONE!!!

There are girls experiencing way too many problems after being vaccinated; my daughter is one of them.  She was perfectly healthy before she was vaccinated.  After her second shot, her immune system went haywire.  She is now allergic to everything, has Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, and hasn't had her period in a year.  Regular MD's seem too busy to realize what's happening to too many girls.  The reporting system, VAERS, is terrible, and too difficult for people to access.  It is my opinion there are many girls wonering what happened to their health after this shot.

At age 26 I had the Gardasil vaccine.  A few days after the first shot, I became nauseous and weak to the point I could not even pick up a magazine or hair-dryer.  My vision became blurry and I started experiencing a skip in my heartbeat.  My doctor said I had a heart condition and it was not related to Gardasil.  So I had the second vaccination.  My conditions persisted so I refused the third vaccine (even though my doctor insisted that it was not the cause).  I did not have a heart condition (as confirmed by a heart surgeon).  Therefore, the doctor put my symptoms down to a disease of the heart..but he never really knew what it was.Shortly afterwards a cyst grew on my ovary.  Within a year after the two Gardasil vaccinations, I got a condition called ovarian fibromatosis (basically a very big ovarian cyst).  My doctor thought it was ovarian cancer so I had an emergency operation to remove it.  It was not cancer thank goodness and thankfully I did not lose any ovaries (they originally told me I may need a hysterectomy if it was cancer).My doctor doesn't know what caused the cyst, he doesn't know what it was exactly and he doesn't know how to prevent it (I had the best gynecologist surgeon in Australia).It's now 2010.  I still feel very tired and I still get very dizzy and experience blurred vision.  I'm going back to the doctor shortly to see if the cyst has returned.I don't know if my symptoms were a result of having the Garisal vaccine, but I was a very fit, happy, healthy, and switched on woman before the vaccine.  A week after the vaccine, it all changed... Belinda (Jan 2010)

With this last shot, I was fine until 3 days after the shot and i began to notice that my glands were swelling mainly in my neck and i just didnt feel good at all but within 48 hours i was back to normal. My doctor said it could be just the side effects or i could have had a virus that was going around but it was nothing to worry about. Personally, I fee that the benefits out weigh the side effects that i experienced.

I am not allergic to anything other than the active ingredient in acne medication. I had absolutely no reaction whatsoever to my first dose. I got my second dose yesterday and the only difference is that my arm hurt worse this time. My arm still hurts now, two days after the dose, but I consider that to be normal. I also feel pain in my hand (on the arm that I received the injection in) in my palm and fingers, but it is minor, bearable pain. I consider this to be a very minor reaction. I am surprised to see how many people suffer extreme reactions as I have not had anything remotely like that.

It was injected into my right arm. I was fine for the first few minutes, then all heck broke loose. My head felt like it was spinning,  and my vision when blurry sort of. Then I broke out in a cold sweat. I asked my mom if I could lay down, which I did. Then as I laied there, I felt this fuzziness start in my feet and move up my body and in to my head. This fuzzing noise entered my ears and sounded like acid was head burning things. I was realy freaked out at this point but could not say anything because it was painful and naeusiating. This stayed like this for about ten minutes. Then I fuzzing left the way it came and I felt very warm afterward. I finally sat up and was really weak. I could barly lift my purse and walk out the door. This weakness also lasted a good two weeks It also did not help that I had two other shots in my other arm right before I got this shot. After this experience I never want to get a shot again. I am fighting my mother tooth and nail not to get the second dose. I am now four months over due for this shot. I recommend not getting this shot.

They don't scare me at all, I don't get nervous and they never hurt. I received all my shots in my arm and the last one hurt like a b****. But the other two didn't hurt at all. After my last shot I didn't have my period for three months, which was scary. Now I am doing fine and don't have any problems. The only reason I am &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot; with my experience is because of missing my period and the pain of the last one.

For the next two days I had the runs, and nausea, then it passed. Now, tonight, I am broken out in hives all over my body that are itching me to death and my head is pounding. My ijection site is hot and itchy. Very scarey! I am positive that it's the vaccine, never broke out like this before. I've had nothing but trouble since I've gotten it. Thanks to this I may have to make a trip to the ER tonight. Do NOT get this shot! I got it free because I did a survey at the hospital about cervical cancer and thought I was getting lucky due to not having any insurance. Lucky INDEED! The day I got the shot I felt, I don't know, high and disoriented for the entire day as well. I didn't suspect this shot until the hives, though, then I read some more reviews of others who are going through this too. I wish they had explained the risks to me better. I have a habit of trusting doctors too easily. Someone pray for me! This is my first vaccine and I'm definately not getting the other 2!
Other	study participant,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		8/20/2009 12:45:10 AM	I was involved in the research study for the Gardasil vaccine.  Because of my mother's medical history, and other reasons my GYN discussed the study with me and I decided it was in my best interest to take part in it.  Having no doubt that I was doing the right thing.  It's been over 4 years now, and I am doing perfectly fine.  My PAP's are all normal!  I really had no side effects from the vaccine, other than a little soreness in my arm after the injections.  I am on YAZ birth control, which is not a strong estrogen b/c, I am not obese and I don't fit in any of the other criteria that would make me not a candidate for the vaccine.  I am 19 &amp; 1/2 years old.  I am proud to say I helped many young women by doing the research study.  I was actually thrilled that the vaccine got approved before my final follow up visit.  Very rewarding!

I did a little research before starting this treatment, and went ahead and recieved the drug because it prevents cervical cancer. I've had a few headaches here and there, but i've had them alot growing up, so I can't blame the drug! The shots hurt for like 10 minutes after getting them done, and i haven't had any discomfort or anything after receiving them!!!! I recommend this drug because it does prevent 4 forms of HPV and cervical cancer.  If you wanna ask anymore questions about it from me, you can email me at mightymikki21@aol.com!!!

The worst part was that I was allergic to this shot and got the worst hives after wards. My whole body was stiff and sore, even with being on allergy medicine I couldn't sleep. I really hope that the outcome is worth it in the end.

That same day around 8pm I began to develop flu like symptoms. The next morning my muscles ached so bad that even if someone touched my skin it would hurt so BAD! I had a low grade fever as well. That night my fever went up to 100.5 and symptoms became worse. My glands in my throat are swollen, my body aches sooooo bad, i feel SICK, and my fever is still present. I WILL NOT GET THE LAST 2 SHOTS AND WISH I WOULD HAVE RESEARCHED THIS BEFORE I LET MY DR. TALK ME INTO IT! Before I let them inject me I specifically asked if there were a ny side effects and they told me no. I feel lied to and betrayed by my dr. I do not recommend getting this vaccine! I just pray I will get better soon, I can't deal with this much longer!

The injection itself was quite painful, but most vaccines are. Please don't let all of these reviews discourage you from getting this vaccination. I actually work in the pharmaceutical industry and I know for a fact that if any of the subjects that were involved the clinical trials for this drug (about 1500) were having those symptoms, the FDA would not allow the use of the drug. It is unfortunate that so many women have experienced these problems, but I really think that they are not associated with the drug.

Prevention of Cervical Cancer due to Human Papilloma Virus	Jessica,  Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		3/3/2009 12:29:36 PM	My daughter has taken the second shot of Gardasil im. She is currently in the hospital with major side effects. First day after the shot she experienced numbness in her hands and arms. Third day her stomach area went numb. Forth day she has numbness from her neck down. The doctors have taken all of the normal tests for paralzysis including MRI, x-rays etc, and have found nothing. Currently they are taking a spinal tap and feel that Gardasil IM is the cause of this side effect. PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR DAUGHTERS get this shot.

Within a week after the 3rd one, she started experiencing chest pains on her left side, sometimes radiating to the right or down the left side of her back.  Every day for the last 100 days, she has had 4-6 chest pains (some that are sharp enough to take her breath away) and exhibits anxiety that she did not have before the last vaccination.  The pain is not prompted by physical activity and can not be reproduced by pressing on her chest or breathing deeply.  She's had an EKG, MRI, blood tests (all normal) and was prescribed prednisone.  Now the dr. wants to do some more extensive blood tests and run a CT scan.  I am convinced Gardasil is the culprit and am praying that the pains will dissipate soon and that there are no long-term repercussions.  I so regret that my daughter was vaccinated with Gardasil and in my opinion, under NO circumstances should anyone put their young daughters at risk with this vaccine.

Her life changed suddenly after the 2nd shot.  She has fainted while in school and blacked out, suffered from migranes, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, pain &amp; body aches, shaking, stroke like symptoms, shaking uncontrolably.  Numerous visits to doctors, neurologist, hospitals.  Almost a year after she has now developed a reaction to any sulfur or products containing sulfites.  Whe have gone to the hospital 3 times, doctors and we have to set up an appointment to see an allergist. Certainly the drug maker and doctors should do someting about this.  Too many problems and a young person going through all of these changes makes you think if it was all worth it?

I read an article listing all the side effects including death, and have decided not to get the other 2. I highly recommend not getting this shot!!

I have had 2 doses of this vaccine and did not experience many side effects.  I did have soreness around the injection location and my whole arm felt very tired and limp but other than that I was fine.  My second shot was in Sept 08 and I am scheduled to get my third dose on Jan 2nd.  I am now a little worried as I am typically very regular in my monthly cycle but I have yet to start since the end of October/beginning of November.  I am not currently on birth control nor have I been sexually active in the recent past.  I'm not sure if this is a result of the shot or not.  I have felt like I was going to start and instead of have heavy clear discharge which has happened several times in the last month and a half almost two months.  Please let me know if anyone else has experienced this.

I was advised by my Dr to discontinue and hence I am not taking my 3rd shot......I wanted to know if anyone else had experienced these type of problems?? I would not recommend this shot as we do not know how effective it is and It has so many complicated problems. I have visited a cardiologist since then and he has assured me that my heart seems fine. I am still missing my periods and that is not a good sign.

I have had real messed up periods, missing on the months that I had the shots. The third shot was the worse pain out of all of them, some bruising but no swelling or serious pain. I had posted this a few months ago... I since have gone back to my doctor and it was not from gardisil they have re-assured me that theres no way that can be from that. I have found the real reason and feel much better.Since getting the shot however sex is very painful, and very uncomfortable. It really burns and I have been looking into cause its so bad I hate to have sex anymore. I dont know if this is from the shot or if I am just looking too into it cause it began aroudn the same time. The dr told me it was jut a phase at first but it shouldnt be goin on this long so I am due to go back again. I am just wondering if anyone else has had or heard of this problem before?

The nurse injected me and I didnt experience any side effects what so ever. I even drove home and went on about my day. It's been almost a week after and still not experiencing any flu like symptoms or severe headaches. However, What I've read recently makes me question whether or not I want to continue getting these shots. It's a little disconcerning. Why would so many DRs push this vaccine if theres reports of really bad side effects?

I was hesitent on getting it but I am glad I did. I have had no side effects. I have had all 3 shots. I do have a tip for all of you who are thinking about getting it. My tip is rub the cite of injection after the nurse does it for at least 5 mins. My arm was so sore for 3 weeks after i got the 1st one. I didnt want to move it. If you rub it and lift weights with the arm you got it in the pain will be gone in a day or two. My dr. said it was probably because I would the medication into the muscle. I got the 1st shot only 3 month after it being out on the market. I was hesitent because of it and felt a bit talked into it but i would do it all over again. As bad as it may hurt MOVE YOUR ARM!

Then my groin started itching uncontrollable along with my back (almost like the worse sunburn ever). Lastly I got a bad cough later and sternum pain. I reacted pretty bad to this shot.

I had bad side effects from both shots.. A few minutes after the injection, I became dizzy, extremely lightheaded, weak and off balance.  Fatigued is a mild term.. I felt unwell all together, and had difficulty driving after.  My Dr. insisted I get these shots, although I have already been diagnosed with HPV, as a way to prevent other strands of the virus.  I would not recommend this..Long term effects are unknown, and who knows if it really works.  Not worth the 24 hours of discomfort.

I originally just went in for a pap smear and my doctor asked if I was &quot;interested&quot; in Gardasil...I replied yes (I was vaguely thinking about it but didn't really want it), not knowing she meant interested in getting it right then. I had thought about it but wanted to do more research first, but next thing you know she says &quot;ok ready for your shot?&quot; I was already bewildered after my first pap smear and so did not refuse. Now I wish I had said no because I've done research now and it just doesn't seem like there is enough info out there to establish that this drug is safe or has any long-term effectiveness, and I'm reading about all of these horrible side-effects...I am concerned about people saying they've missed periods, could this drug make women sterile?

She said the first one hurt, but all shots hurt.  She actually was mature enough to make sure she finished the series on time.  I have also received the series at my own choosing and cost (over 26) and I had no problems.  Perhaps it is the one who administers the vaccine that makes it less painful.  There are only 21 reports here all with some side effects.  Over 8 million or so have had the vaccine now and the RX info has not really changed.  Your daughters would probably pass out if they had to have a colposcopy.  They may avoid that now by having received Gardasil.

Prevention of Cervical Cancer due to Human Papilloma Virus		3	3	2			5/29/2008 9:11:03 PM	My 19 year old daughter had the first 2 injections with no reaction other than soreness at the injection site.  Yesterday she had the third injection.  She developed extreme headache, fatigue, dizziness, fever to 101, and this morning passed out.  The headache is persistent despite ES Tylenol q4h and Aleve q8h.  Had I researched this immunization and read these reviews prior to the injections we probably would have opted not to get it.  I urge everyone contemplating this immunization to please research it thoroughly.  I'm not sure how you can rate the effectiveness of this medication...

There have been 11 deaths already associated with this vaccine.  And reading all the adverse reactions on this board really makes me wonder why the drug companies &amp; the FDA is hiding this?

She has fainted several times, VERY fatigued (sleeps 12-16 hrs/day), dehydrated, headaches, vomiting, numbness in hands, joint pain, hair loss, and low Corisol Level.  She has been to the Doctor several times and hospitalized once.  We have chosen not to continue this vaccination for either of our daughters.  It is not worth risking their lives.  We keep wondering what the long term affects are.  Some of these symptoms follow other diseases such as MS.

Kind of feels like a Tetanus shot.  Other than mild soreness, no side effects.  Worth the pain if it prevents cancer.

Prevention of Cervical Cancer due to Human Papilloma Virus	jb, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	4/19/2008 11:05:06 AM	I had the first two shots and did fine.  The pain at the injection site was minimal.  I had the third shot on thursday, and a few minutes later my arms started to go numb.  I was already driving on my way home.  My hands became so numb that I couldn't even hold the steering wheel, and my whole body was shaking so badly. Then severe dizziness set in, and increasing difficulty swallowing and breathing.  I barely made it to the emergency room fast enough.  When I got there it took me three attempts to grab my cell phone to call my mom.  The doctors at the ER gave me steroids to keep my throat open, and lots of antihistamines in an IV.  Yesterday I was still dizzy, and got another numb sensation in my hands, and my muscles in my legs were really sore and I had a fever.  Still had some difficulty swallowing.  I have never had a bad reaction to any medication ever in my entire life.

Prevention of Cervical Cancer due to Human Papilloma Virus		3	3	2			4/2/2008 7:35:41 PM	A few weeks after recieving the second shot, I came down with severe, Flu like symptoms with a 102 degree fever, to the point I had to go to the emergency room. I'm not sure if this is related to the shot, however I do know that after recieving the first shot, I missed my period. I thought it was due to missing a birth control dose, and my doctor and nurse both agreed. However, after recieving the second shot, I missed my period again- this time with no miss birth control doses. Has anyone missed their periods?
Prevention of Cervical Cancer due to Human Papilloma Virus		1	1	1			3/31/2008 12:02:52 AM	After my third shot I got incredibly sick. I got headaches so bad I couldn't think or open my eyes, extreme fatigue, sharp belly pains, inability to keep down food, diarrhea, and fever chills. I ended up losing 6 lbs in a week because I couldn't keep anything down. I went to my doctor who was concerned with my headaches, so I had a CT scan done. The CT was normal so it was ruled a vaccine injury. I advise anyone who has problems to report it to VAERS! You're not alone!

I had originally taken her to the drs. due to a cold/sore throat.  They took her temp, 100, and decided it was safe for her to have the shot.  She hit her head very hard on the tile floor in the drs.office, because incontinent, and suffered a severe headache last night and most of today. I don't know if she suffered this effect due to the fact that she was under the weather to begin with.  I found the experience very frightening and would be interested in knowing if anyone else has suffered this kind of side effect.

She is complaining of extreme fatigue, she can't keep her eyes open even though she slept 9-10 hrs. last night. She is shaking all over and says her head hurts and she is nauseated. No vomiting. She is very pale and has had crying spells. She has a low grade temp. of 100.0She is very healthy and is never sick. She never complains, in fact she should have called me to come and get her from school but waited till I picked her up from school to tell me and she was lying on the ground and crying. I think I may take her to the ER.
