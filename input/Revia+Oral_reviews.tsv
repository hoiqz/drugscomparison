Had a lot of side effects, throwing up, jaw clenching, tiredness, headache,chest pain, don't want to eat or drink, feeling as if i am going thru withdrawals all over again. Just a general feeling of being sick. I don't think i will continue taking this.

Did not eat dinner and threw up before bed finally. This pill is great-it made not want to eat or drink. I guess its a diet pill too. I told my husband it's great-just as if I was drinking and got sick. Yea! I'm going to try and take it tonight before bed or maybe I will only take a half. I really want this to work but the nausea sucks.

I am was a IV Diladid user, using anywhere from 200mg to 300mg a day. I went to inpatient pack in Feb for 30 days but relaped in treatment and immediatly after. This drug caused us to loose our home and even our son we still could not stop. Since taking Naltrexone I have been clean with no cravings for over 4 months. We are close to having our son back.  Life is getting back on track again. I highly recommend this to anyone struggling with addiction.  It works!

I am considering myself for opiate dependence.  I relapse once in a while and I do not like the idea.  I am just hoping that the medication will be perfect for me.  I have been on Suboxen and that worked good, but I had to cut down the Suboxen in 1/8 so that I could get off it on 1 mgs.  It worked great for me.  But one can still get sick when one tries to kick although on 1mg. I did not feel any withdrawls.  I am considering Naltexon I just wonder about the side effect and the cost of the medication.
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	activemom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/4/2010 12:27:43 PM	I have taken this med. for 2 days and want to stop.  I've experienced extreme anger, sadness and lethargy.  In additional to being an alcoholic, I am also bipolar. Most disturbing for me was the constant sensation of NEEDING TO STRETCH - like when you first wake up.  My muscles would tighten and I would have to outstretch both arms &amp; legs up to 30 times in an hour. Very strange.  Looked like I had turrets syndrome. I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else.  After two days I've discountinued due to these side effects.

It wasn't until naltrexone that I got sober and like it.  I was on it for 4 years and sober for 6 years.  Then a 3 year relaspe.  I have been back on naltrexone about a year and glad to be alive.  The first two or three doses are like a bad acid trip, I would recommend a tranquilizer at night for the first few days.  But after that you don't even know you have taken anything.  Its just that the never-ending cravings are GONE!  Its such a blessing. You don't even think about alochol and it doesen't bother you to be around it.  Its a miracle!  I thank God for people who found this drug.  I have alot of arithis and a lot of pain.  I have hydrocodone,  but asprin works just about as good.  I can deal with the pain alot better than being so sick from drinking a fifth of tequilla, or a gallon of wine.  Plus I have lost a pile of weight.  A case of beer has alot of calories.

It has worked great for the cravings. The side effects have mostly subsided. In the beginning stomach cramps, nausea, hard to eat (appetite is still not great), but overall it has prevented me from any relapses in a yr.

It is not good for someone trying to gradually wean themselves off of alcohol. It is a huge shock to your body, not good. You need to be sober first if you take this medicine.

I was prescribed it as a side effect reducer to wellbuterin xl (increased eating habits). I am no longer on wellbuterin xl, and have stopped  taking it....... I am bipolar
