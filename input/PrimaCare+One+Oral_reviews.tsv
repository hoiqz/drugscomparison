Prevention of Fetal Neural Tube Defects when Pregnant	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/31/2010 10:06:30 AM	I would not reccommend or take this supplement even though my doctor prescribed it. When reading the list of ingredients I saw that it contains hydrogenated oil, parabens, and dyes! You should not expose your fetus so such unnecessary harmful toxins. I cant believe they actually put these things in a prenatal!!
Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/9/2009 12:26:57 PM	I loved this prenatal vitamin! Easy to swallow, and NO side effects. However, it was recalled by the manufacturer in early 2009. I am going to try Prenexa now, with plant-derived DHA  (instead of from fish, like in PrimaCare).  www.prenexa.com

There is a version of this vitamin that contains a stool softener and that helped with constipation, BUT I am wondering why it is so COSTLY!  I am now searching for similar ingredients in other vitamins for less money!

Pregnancy	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/4/2009 11:24:25 AM	I started taking this vitamin in my 3rd month of pregnancy.  In the first 2 months I had tried over-the-counter prenatal vitamins.  The over-the-counter brands had made me very nauseous.  With PrimaCare One the nausea was instantly relieved and I have had no other side effects.

I took a different vitamin during pregnancy &amp; switched after delivery. Ever since, I have had the worst problems ever.

Pregnancy	ttlibra, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	4	2	Female	25-34	8/18/2008 11:47:55 AM	I have been taking this pill for several weeks now while trying to get preg.  While I agree that it is so easy to use and great I have had a odd side effect that I reasearch and found that nobody else (so far) has had.  My lips are so dry and irritated that I cant even describe it!  I am constantly putting chap stick on and have even resorted to practically soaking my lips in vitamim-E oil every night!! Very strange side effect I know...but it is bothering me so much that I can't function and am switing vitamins for awhile.Anyone else have this odd reaction...??

I love it.  I feel more energized.  My hair feels thicker.  I can definitely tell the difference when I'm late taking a dose.

The pill is easy to go down, I've had no side effects, and it makes my hair and nails grow very quickly. I haven't had any problems with this drug.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/28/2008 9:53:49 AM	I started taking this vitamin because my husband and I are planning on starting a family. This pill made my skin itch so bad I broke out in welts. I was not sure if it was from a product I was using or from this pill. But after I stopped taking this I started to clear up. I am now taking a different vitamin. We'll see how this one works.

It goes down easy and I feel so energized. I have no side effects from this pill at all. When i'm ready for my fourth child I will definately ask for this vitamin.
A Mother who is Producing Milk and Breastfeeding	meier, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	4/15/2008 11:51:48 AM	i did not know that the fish oils in this prescription were from natural sources.  That means that mercury could be in them since all fish have mercury build up.  On their website it says it is between .001 and .025 and that is less than the EPA's 1 ppm.  However, you take this pill every day.  Is the mercury leaving your body or building up?  There are alternate ways to get fish oil that does not have any mercury.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/11/2008 12:22:35 AM	I'm hoping to get pregnant in the next year and my doctor recommended that I start taking Primacare One.  I feel great!  I am regular and haven't struggled with stomach bloating, diarrhea or nausea.  These prenatal vitamins are better than the multivitamins I was taking before.  Plus my hair is extra healthy and shiny.  I recommend following the directions and waiting 1 hour before eating or 2 hours after eating and definintely avoiding dairy.  Try taking it an hour before bed with a full glass of water for the best results.  All I know is that I'm taking care of my body for my future baby!  
Pregnancy	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		4/9/2008 1:52:43 PM	I like this pill - it's easy to swallow and you don't taste anything going down. I was wondering how other posters knew if the vitamin was causing sickness and/or constipation when these are very common first trimester symptoms in general. Not doubting anyone, but some women are sick with or without vitamins, or no matter what brand they are taking.

I took it at night and no side effects. This pill actually made me feel better than I did before pregnancy... and I now (one year later) can not find a comperable multi vitamin. My Daughter is Very Healthy and her Eye and Brain development is extrordinary.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/14/2008 11:04:28 AM	I started taking these prenatal vitamins at 6 weeks. I have had no nausea at all. The pill has worked like a charm. I was given samples from my OB/GYN, and loved them so much that I will pay the tier 3 price through my insurance.
Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	2/25/2008 4:45:12 PM	I am 10 weeks pregnant and have been taking this for most of the pregnancy. I recently broke out with a really itchy rash all over my body. My OB says it was an allergic reaction to something in this pill. The rash is very persistant and also very uncomfortable. I just wanted to post this incase anyone else is experiencing the same thing.

Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	1/16/2008 2:56:58 PM	This prenatal vitamin did worsen my nausea. My obstetrician suggested I take it at night instead of in the morning, and it worked like a charm. My nausea disappeared (I've been lucky in that regard), and I felt great.
Pregnancy	lbe03e, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	12/20/2007 1:56:05 AM	At first, PrimaCare was great.  It was much easier to swallow than others I'd tried without any aftertaste.  It also cleared my constipation.  However, it made my morning sickness worse and I soon began having horrible, painful diarrhea and gas.  I would be up all night with stomach pains, in and out of the bathroom.  The diarrhea was also bad during the day (I'm a teacher and this didn't work well for me)  Take with caution
