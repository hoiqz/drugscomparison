High Cholesterol	concerned, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	8/21/2012 2:51:50 PM	My husband took this for one month and one morning he was so constipated and backed up he though he was going to have to go to the ER to get the impaction removed.  He was so scared he was going to have a stroke or heart attack b/c he was sweating and his heart was racing.  He has been off of this for three weeks and is back to normal on his daily movements.  Be very careful when taking this drug.

Got off for a month an have seen a great improvement in all areas,started back for a week and guess what?   it all started up again.

Well I am 34-5'8 and weight 145. Not fat or old and have had horrible stomach pain and muscle pain since starting this. Also nausea and fatigue. Will be talking to my doctor to let him know we need to try something else because this medication has been terrible.

High Cholesterol	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	65-74	6/7/2012 1:42:20 PM	After major reactions to Lipitor and other statins, my MD suggested Welchol.  I take 6 tabs a day and really don't have any stomach or bowel issues as indicated by some. I do have some tingling in the finger tips as reported by one.  Disappointing results after 9 months of only a 10% reduction in cholesterol.  Never, ever would I put another statin in my body though, I was nearly an invalid due to muscle loss.  Just last week I learned from a cardiologist that some patients taking statins have had muscle detach from ligaments with severe reactions, I definately was headed in that direction.  I believe it's a failure of the medical profession not to emphasize the risks with this so often described class of drugs called statins.  A friend of mine lost the use of his right arm.  After a few months off the drug he was able to regain full use again.

High Cholesterol	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	45-54	5/13/2012 6:00:45 PM	Been on this med for a little over 4 months. Started with the powder. Worst stuff I have ever taken! It never dissolved, now matter how I treated it, it burned my throat, made me throw up and gave me terrible heartburn. I asked for the pill form after 6 weeks of trying to tolerate the powder. My latest blood work shows that my cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL have all gone up! Plus, my A1C has increased by 0.5%! But my glucose measurements are in normal range.  I thought this drug was supposed to help all of this and it has proven to do the opposite. I feel tired all the time, have terrible constipation and despite taking it 8 hours after levothyroxine, my TSH is also increasing. Has anyone else had their A1C increase rather than decrease, despite their glucose measurements being in the normal range? Not sure whether I want to stay on this medicine, but I had terrible heartburn that nothing would ease for the two days I took Previstatin and Zetia did not do too much (but at least I did not have side effects). Doctor has now tried to get me to take omega3 fish oil capsules to help with the cholesterol, but I have to keep explaining that I am deathly allergic to fish of any kind and will not willingly take anything that might have any fish protein in it. Something like that could kill me!!! My frustration level is rising exponentially. My new cardiologist is convinced I can add a different statin to my regimen, but I fear the same heartburn results from any of the statins.

High Cholesterol	sandy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	2	Female	45-54	4/28/2012 7:59:54 AM	I only have taking this in the powder form twice.  Both times after taking it, I would start feeling sick in about an hour after and the feeling progressed as the day went on. For several hours afterwards I felt like doing nothing except laying down. It just is an overall not great feeling and it last for hours. I thought maybe it could have been something else the first time.  But when I took it again this time I put more food on my stomache thinking maybe you really need to coat your stomache and the same lousy lingering illness came back. My doctor prescribed it for my cholesterol and type 2 diabetes.  My diabetes numbers were down those two days. Not enough time for the cholestorol. 
High Cholesterol	Nelsonmd2, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	65-74	4/24/2012 3:01:11 PM	I had been on statins for a long time. Zocor, Lipitor, Creastor and had leg pain. Creastor gave me a swollen tongue so quit taking it. Started Wechol last fall, 6 pills a day. Hard to take around thyroid meds, have to wait 4 hours so switched to the oral, not great but easier to handle. Just had my choestrol checked, went from 212 on Creastor to 307 on Wechol. Not working for me, waiting for a call from my Dr. to see what to do next.
High Cholesterol	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	4/23/2012 12:08:37 PM	Increase in LDL to 201 from 158 with 6 tablet per day regimine; total Cholesterol 258.  Increase in CPK to 389; muscle ache in thighs...difficulty sleeping..ibuprofen is becoming less effective at pain management.  Tingle sensation on tip of smallest finger of left hand.  Previous response to cholestramine powder with zetia resulted in high CPKs. Was on cholestramine for ten years with decreasing effectiveness over time.  Initially, started cholesterol lowering medications with Provocol (Statin) and quickly developed high CPKs and intense muscle pain in thighs ....could not walk in the final example.

High Cholesterol	NMP, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	4/12/2012 8:46:28 PM	I just started taking the pill form today.  I cannot take statins.  I tried Crestor, Zetia, Simvastin.  I have procrastinated taking the Welchol because of all these terrible comments.  I am literally scared to death. Working full-time and going to school full time I can't afford to be nauseated or in any pain. My HDL is good (63), my Tri's are good (118), but my LDL keeps creeping up for a total cholesterol level of 300 today at the docs.  She and I both believe it is genetic as I really watch what I eat and I am always on the move on the job (I'm a teacher so never sit down), but I do smoke.  The doctor says that quitting will cut my cholesterol LDL by 40 or 50 points.  Has anyone else quit smoking and saw such a dramatic drop?  I will let you know how I do on this Welchol  I have 18 days to sample it.  The first negative pain I get I'm stopping it.
High Cholesterol	Kit, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	4/5/2012 9:28:02 PM	This drug was terrible, I had so many side effects.  Nausea, fatigue, insomnia and the most disturbing was short term memory issues.  My job was being impacted.  I stopped taking the drug and in 2 days I noticed a dramatic improvement in my thought process, sleep patterns and energy level.  I have now been Welchol free for several weeks and I have felt wonderful.   And to top it all off, my cholesterol went up 20 points while taking it.

High Cholesterol	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	2/12/2012 10:37:55 PM	I cannot take statins due to severe heartburn from the first dose. Zetia did not do enough so my doctor started me on Welchol almost a month ago. Started with the powder that is mixed in liquid. It was absolutely the worst medicine I have ever had to take. It gave me a sore throat every time I took it, I felt sick to my stomach and I had a daily headache from the aspartame. Last week I asked for the tablet form and have taken 2 doses of the tablets so far....6 at a time. They go down easy for me even though they are large pills. No sore throat, no headache and I find them to be so much easier to tolerate. Time will tell if I can tolerate the med for the long term, but for now I find the tablets to be the way to go for me. Hopefully this med will make a difference. 
High Cholesterol	unhappy patient, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	2/7/2012 4:16:05 AM	I cannot take statins due to severe GERD. The statins caused unbearable heartburn for 2 days that made me cry. Doctor prescribed Welchol Oral suspension about a month ago without asking whether I would prefer pills or the powder. the powder does NOT mix well with ANY liquid. It irritates my throat each time I take it and causes gas and some heartburn for several hours afterward for me. It also causes a dull headache, which I now attribute to the aspartame in the powder. Already had severe constipation from other meds I take and this made it even worse! Stool softener has done nothing to help. I would rather take a dozen huge pills a day than this powder mixed in liquid. My numbers have come down slightly, but my triglyceride has gone up. Despite at least 8 hours between my levothyroxine and the welchol, my TSH is increasing. I will be asking for the pill form tomorrow. Hopefully I will tolerate that because this powder stuff is disgusting. 
High Cholesterol	thisisme, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	2/5/2012 3:07:26 AM	Been on Welchol Oral for 3 weeks. I was given it without any consultation as to whether I would like it or the pills. I had bad times with statins (terrible heartburn and muscle aches. Tried Zeita without much change in numbers, but tolerated Zetia well. This is the worst medicine I have ever had to take. It does not mix well with any liquid, whether hot or cold, gives me a sore throat for hours after drinking the liquid and I get a headache every time I take it, which I now know is from the aspartame in it. I cannot stomach eating of drinking for at least an hour after taking it, despite being told to drink a big glass of water and immediately eat a full meal right after I take the med. Tried that early on and became sick to my stomach. For hours after taking it and even after eating, I feel queasy. I would much rather take 6 huge pills a day than this junk and plan to tell my doctor to either switch my prescription or take me off of it completely. I work in a lab, so I have tested my blood twice since starting it with no changes except my triglyceride has gone way up! It has also increased my TSH levels and yes, I take this med 8 or more hours AFTER taking my levothyroxine; way more than the recommended 4 hours between them (or the 2 hours the pharmacist told me. And I do not even want to talk about the constipation. Whoever thought that making something like this was a good idea was VERY wrong!I know I will be staying on this medication...at least not in this form. Whether the pills will work for me is another question.

It has lowered my cholesterol, eliminated my long standing bowel problems and dramatically lowered my A1C. If you use a fork to vigorously dissolve it, there is no clumping or difficulty drinking. This has been an unexpected miracle drug for me. I hit the donut hold and it is expensive but it has improved my quality of life with only occasional, mild, brief nausea. Statins are poison to me.

High Cholesterol	ohiogirl, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		10/31/2011 10:42:09 PM	Did not significantly lower cholesterol but DID increase TSH which, interestingly is an EFFECT of the med, as is INCREASE in tryglycerides. Further the med caused muscle weakness, general malaise, headache, decrease in mental acuity: these effects stopped after d/c ing the med. In my opinion this drug needs further study and should be scrutinized.

High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	6/9/2011 8:37:23 PM	I would never recommend Welchol to anyone.  It caused severe bloating; even to the point of having trouble breathing. I took three of those huge pills twice a day for 3 and a half weeks before I decided to quit. I decided to try the Red Yeast Rice (Time Release capsules 600mg a day).  It brought my total numbers to 183 which is GREAT!!!! These doctors get bonus points and money for getting people on these drugs.  BEWARE!!!

That seems like it's an extremely high dosage.  When I questioned the dosage amount he said that it was the correct dosage.  Question-does anyone else take that high of a dosage?
High Cholesterol	Texas35, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	45-54	5/17/2011 3:36:14 PM	Been on it for 6 months and it has help to lower my overall cholesterol. I had such pain while taking statins, this has been a relief. Little pain, compared to the statins. I am really amazed at many of the reviews that down this med for pains when they are diagnosed with fibromyalga or just getting old. Typically not a complainer but those post dont help anyone come to a realistic conclusion. So, my 2 cents coming from a person confirmed with 'statin' pain, is this worked for me, with no pain and lowered my chol. Hope it helps you.
High Cholesterol	mzzdc, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/16/2011 3:34:58 PM	I have been on Welchol for 5 mos and have every intention of staying with this treatment.  My Cholesterol was LDL 210 and HDL was 69.  After 45 days of treatment my total cholestreol total is 95 for both LDL and HDL.  I have also lost 65 lbs with is med in conjunction with victoza as my endo advised me that this combination of drugs not only got my diabeties under control but also a great combination for weight loss.  I too suffer from fibro and rhemo artho and was on massived muscle, pain pills and steroids for over 5 years.  all meds are now discontinued.  and will continue to stay on this combo as this has been a life saver for me.

High Cholesterol	bar1, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	65-74	5/7/2011 10:18:12 PM	Begsn taking one Welchol 625 mg tablet each day for cholestrol one year ago.  Had been unable to take any of the statin drugs as they caused leg and arm pain to the point I had trouble walking up and down stairs or getting up from a chair.    My job at the time required me to walk 5 miles a day and with one tablet, my cholestrol began to come down.  The doctor said to start taking 2 tablets so it would drop faster.  After a week of taking 2 pills, I'm now having the pains I experienced with the statins.  I'm going back to one pill a day as I had no serious side effects but with 2, now I have pain and constipation despite the high fiber diet and water.  Reducing the dosage may take longer to lower cholestrol, but at least I can take the medicine.

Also have severs shoulder joint pain and neuropothy in legs.  Reading the comments here plus other research I am stopping taking WelcholChloresteral is 222 and ratios and good chl are excellent.  Welchole is just not woth the side effects.  Am now taking CoQ10, Fish Oil, and had already made a life style diet change to lower chlor, plus exercise  If that's not good enough it'll just have to do as I've had it with the meds.  The prescription shouldn't be worse than the ailment!!  Appreciate all of your comments folks.  Good to know that I'm not totally crazy after all and that others have experienced the similar effects.  My cardiologists is going to be pissed but at 67 I can deal with that and/or fire him.  My health has gone downhill since on this med and I'm getting it back..Good luck all
High Cholesterol	legasst, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	65-74	4/3/2011 5:01:19 PM	Been on Welchol about 1 yr.  Lots of leg weakness and lower back and abdominal pain.  Stopped it for about a month and the pain and weakness stopped.  I started on the pills (6/day) and about 6 months ago went to the powder.  Either way is bad.  I told the doctor that I had stopped because of the pain and weakness and he said the Welchol did not cause it but it is strange that after I stopped the med for a while the symptoms went away.  I have been back on it for about 2 weeks and the pain/weakness is back.  My doctor doesn't seem to want to discuss an alternative. 
High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	4/1/2011 7:03:58 PM	I was prescribed this medication 3 months ago and although it does have some side effects such as constipation and some stomach pain, the results I got back on my tests today were wonderful.  My overall cholesterol went from 236 to 180; My LDL went from 159 to 109!  Although it is sometimes a hassle to talk all the pills, in the end I will continue using it.  I have been unable to take statins so this is great for me.  I am also type II diabetic and take Metformin so I am hoping Welchol will help with that as well.

I came looking to see if there were any beneficial side effects noted, but I have not yet found any here. The GERD improvement may be coincidental with the start of this medication, but I'll keep looking. It seems counter intuitive that my improvement had nothing to do with this medication.

No side effects. I have not rated its effectiveness yet as I will not have labs done until May. I am also &quot;labeled&quot; pre diabetic so the benifits of lowering blood sugar hopefully will help as well. I guess my only complaint would be taking 4 pills a day, as well as the pills are quite large.

Welchol immediately made me feel weak, disconnected, lower back and strong abdominal pain, pancreatitis...and in 2 weeks while on this drug caused me to lose 15 lbs!!!!  I'm 6'1&quot; 200 lbs...and feel to 185lb in such a short span it lead to severe tiredness and nausea.  I'm angry the doctor put me on this drug....it literally had a toxic effect on me....I felt it was killing me.

Ive tried them all with terrible cramps, aches and pain, in my legs, and all through my body. Im also a diabetic type 2. My Dr. recently put me on Welchol and took me OFF Metformin, as I was having terrible and constant frequent bouts of very loose bowl movements. ( We found out it was the Metformin causing it ). I feel like a new person with a future now. Im taking 2 Welchol three times a day with meals. So far its agreeing with me fine with one brief time of constipation. It corrected itself. Its to early to tell if it will help my cholesterol, but Im betting its going to be alot better than it has been. It is also controlling my diabetes well. Now if I loose a few pounds, Good for me. !!!! Im a retired R.N. and after what Ive been through with some of these medications, Im willing to give Welchol a good chance.

I was on it for 7 weeks and dropped 16 pounds, became severely fatigued and could hardly make it through my work day.  I told my doctor how I was feeling and he ignored my symptons.  I told him the only new pill I'm on is Welchol. &quot;could this be causing this?'  he said I must be depressed that weight loss and fatigue are 2 symptoms.  I stopped taking welchol after leaving his office extremely upset that he just ignored my symptoms.  I have been off welchol for 8 days now.  I'm energetic and haven't lost another pound!!!!  HUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
High Cholesterol	Grtitalgal, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	2/18/2011 12:01:45 PM	About 3 weeks ago my doctor insisted that I try Welchol 3775 Oral Suspension.  I tried to tell him that I can not take any kinds of meds because of the side effects.  He said the only side effect would be constipation.  I stated it two weeks ago and the first 3 days I was totally fine.  I thought gee, this actually might work.  WRONG! On the 4th day I started with severe diarrhea.  I call my doctor and he told me that yes, it can go either way..either it treats people with severe diarrhea or makes it worse.  I am off this and I still have diarrhea.  I also didn't feel right.  Now watching the news the other night, it was said that more doctors should stop writting scrips and tell the public if you honestly want to watch your levels, eat right, diet and exercise which we all know we should do.  I feel these drugs cause more harm than good.  I started to really watch what I am eating, started to excersise more and hopefully it might come down.  If not, then I have no idea what to do.  Totally disgusted.

I got a headache that lasted into the next day.  I was sick to my stomach the second morning.  I had a major gallbladder attack at 1pm that lasted 2 hours. The pain felt like a sword stabbed through me and out my back. I called my physcian and he told me it was the welchol.  He told me if it didn't let up in the next hour or got too extreme for me to stand to go to the ER. I managed to stand the pain and it started to let up about an hour after I talked to the doctor.  I had an ultra sound the next day and I have NO gall stones. I was extremely constipated for 3 days from one tablet.

It has been tested about twenty times and has NOT HAD ANY SIDE EFFECTS OF ACHES AND PAINS.  Sometimes, statins' side effects last for a while and might make you still have pain, but it's NOT FROM WELCHOL!  Thank you!  GO WELCHOL and WELCHOL FOR ORAL SUSPENSION!

I took crestor for 3 days, same reason, same result.  I took Welchol for over 6 months and could count on half a dozen &quot;accidents&quot; a week.  I am now treating my cholesterol with diet and exercize.  I am really unhappy about all of my doctors who do not think daily diarrhea is a problem. &quot;Just learn to live with it.&quot; I looked up colesvalem because it was mentioned on a discovery health tv show as a treatment for Habba Syndrome.  It may get rid of diarrhea for some people, but not for me.  Oh yeah, it did lower my cholesterol, because with all that diarrhea I was not getting any nutrition out of my food.  Starvation lowers choloesterol.

High Cholesterol	amyrn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	8/22/2010 8:47:31 AM	I just wanted to respond after reading almostadoc's comment.  The liver and kidneys REMOVE medications/toxins from your bloodstream. They don't add medications to your blood stream so this medication is absorbed through your gut into your bloodstream like other medications.  I haven't had my cholesterol checked since being on this, only been on it two months.  Do NOT take this medication with other medications as it can prevent the absorption of those other ones.  I also cannot take statins and I am beginning to have pain in my feet and my memory is also being affected.  There is no real proof that these medications increase your life span.  Also, cholesterol is needed for brain function.  I am going to stay on this until my cholesterol is checked but then I am going to quit taking it and see what happens using fish oil and other more natural supplements.  To the person who asked about taking this for chronic diarrhea.  It does work and is used for Irritable Bowel Syndrome at times.I am a consumer of the medication as well as a nurse (not almost a nurse but a nurse).

Only way to dissolve powder is in a cup of water heated for 4 mins. Despite vigorous stirring, the liquid turns to a sludge in minutes.

I did not connect it to the Welchol, but when the insomnia continued night after night, I made the connection.  I was willing to continue taking the drug, however, because it immediately reduced my appetite and I was never hungry.  But after six days of almost no sleep, I experienced a visual migraine for the first time in my life.  It was a really scary experience, and I stopped taking the Welchol immediately.  That was months ago, and I have not had any reoccurrence of the visual migraine.  Although this drug supposedly is not absorbed by the body, the fact that there is no explanation for its effect on lowering blood sugar (one of its benefits) means that it has unknown physiological effects.  Apparently for me, the insomnia was such an effect, and six days of almost no sleep can result in migraines, visual or otherwise.  So be careful with this drug!
Other	IAgal, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	7/30/2010 4:05:48 AM	Put on this med for a totally different reason than most of reviews I've read. My cholestrol is 120 on  10mg of Simvastin. Dr. put me on this for my diverticulitis/possible Crohns? So with that in mind my favorite room is the bathroom - diarrhea. So this has been working so so . Only been on it for a week now. Dr gave me samples, didn't realize all the should and shouldn'ts with taking it. Been taking it at bedtime. I've noted that maybe I need to drink a bit more water. So we'll see...

I always make it a point not to look up a drug prescribed because I know if you read something negative it can make you look for it.  After ten days of taking it I had been feeling terible, muscle weakness, stomach cramping,bloating and abdominal pain off and on.

So he put me on Welchol, after one week, the shoulder pain is back! I am definately going to stop taking it and be satisfied with 180. Besides $50/month (with co-pay) is too much money! I rated effectiveness low because if I don't use it then it doesn't work...

It was diffcult to work out a schedule to take it.  You can not take it for four hours after taking other medications. I took three a day.  It was so bad that I would pass out or feel as if I were going to pass out.  My body ached.  It felt as if I would break if I tried to bend over. I discussed this with my Dr. Since, I have stopped taking Welchol, I feel so much better.  I have noted on my drug list I can not take Welchol.

Haven't used it for several days now and side effects are 75% better. Moreover, it had only a minimal effect on lowering cholesteral. Beware!!!!!!!

I am 31 and did not want to take a statin. I had an LDL of 165 (thanks mom and dad)and total cholesterol was 241. After 4 months on it my lipids were LDL = 74 and total Cholesterol = 185. I like to research meds too so, I know welchol could cause constipation but if you take it along with a meal and an 8oz drink it is not a problem. Also, it does not pass through my liver or kidneys because it does not enter the bloodstream so it CANNOT MEDICALLY cause muscle pain or cramps. Some people I talk with are side effect profile junkies. If it says it on the internet, they have that reaction from it. I am into safe medications and this by far is one of the safest medications you can take. Women can even take it during pregnancy. When my wife was pregnant she could hardly take any over the counter meds much less prescription meds. Oh well, sorry I went through all this but if you cannot tell I am in complete support of this medication and I have done my medical research. I hate to see all these negative comments about something that can really make a difference in your life medically. People are always more likely to voice complaints then compliments or satisfaction.
High Cholesterol	JJ, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	11/18/2009 12:05:52 PM	I have been on WelChol for 3mos and I'm happy with the result. The only side effect for me is large stool and constipation. I can deal with that, rather than having a high cholest. and could be having a stroke or heart attack. No muscle pain whatsoever. I have gone down 77 points, but still above the 200 mark. Granted I am watching my diet very closely now, I cut out all red meats, and most of high-cholest. foods. I stay mostly on veggie diets, and work out 3 times a week. I believe within another 3mos, I will bring my cholest. down to a normal range.My doc almost prescribed me statin meds which might have all sort of side effects and I am not too keen of doing that. So if WelChol doesn't give me constipation, I would rate it all 5 stars.

High Cholesterol	Travlin-easy, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	65-74	10/31/2009 8:09:46 PM	I've been on this drug for nearly a month, the side effects have been horrible at best. Bloating, large stools, discolored stools, muscle pain, muscle weakness and severe shortness of breath, just to name the most prevalent. My last cholesterol check put it at 227, which is much lower than it was when I had a heart attack in early August of 2009. I cannot take statins, and from my personal research and 15 years experience working in cardio-pulmonary medicine I'm thoroughly convinced cholesterol has little or nothing to do with coronary artery disease. Consequently, when I next visit my cardiologist and he tells me my cholesterol is too high, I'll tell him I don't give a damn. If he want to argue the point, I'll fire him! I'm 69 years old, 6 feet tall, male, weigh 204 and still working 4 to 6 days a week. I didn't have any problems until I started taking cholesterol lowering drugs. And, I sincerely believe that taking these drugs will not make me live one day longer. It took 69 years of hard living to plug two small areas of my left anterior descending coronary artery by 85 percent. A pair of stents now hold those areas open. Does anyone believe for one minute that any of these drugs will make them live longer?Sorry about the rant. Just tired of doctors who don't seem to have a lick of common sense and want to push pills.

After taking 2 pills a day, experienced low blood sugar symptoms that really scared me.  Stopped taking it for a couple of days because it scared me so bad.  Started taking 1 pill a day when my doctor's nurse assured me the low blood sugar symptoms wasn't from taking Welchol.  After only a couple of days of taking only 1 pill a day, experienced muscle and head pain, gas, feeling weak/sleepy, cough, blurry vision, and flu-like symptoms. Life's too short to be feeling bad from a medicine that's suppose to help me feel better.  It may help others for their health issues, but it isn't for me.

Don't know if it is just a coincidence or is a possible side effect of this drug since it started around the time I started Welchol.

My cholesterol has gone done, my bowel movements, which use to be loose and hard to control, have improved, and I've lost 16 pounds.  I've been using it for about 4-5 months.  My doctor said it is full of fiber so taking it 30 minutes before a meal helps fill me up and helps control my portions.  Also, due to the fiber filled pills, my bowel movements are now firm and I don't have to rush to the bathroom like a madwoman.  It's a triple benefit! Five stars all they way!

My Gastro doctor was ready to send me to Pittsburgh Hospital that could not figure out what to do, I went to my reg. doctor for my cholesterhol check-up and he wanted me to go off the statins and take the Welchol because he believed between the stomach problems and cholesterhol I solve them both.  I have been on Welchol for one month.  I finally feel like I have my life back.  A llittle constipation but not much can handle it.  I only take 2 in the morning, before this I would go to work and be sick all day and come home and have to lay down and not move just to keep the nausea at a comfortable level.   So I thank my reg. doctor for recommending this and I have no real problem with any side effects.

I started taking WelChol about 6 months ago because my Dr. told me that WelChol worked in the gut, and very rarely had muscle pain side effects. I started having muscle pain, but because I'm heavy I figured the pain in my legs, knees, etc. was from being overweight. I didn't put two and two together. Duh. Recently I decided to look on the net for the side effects of WelChol and saw that muscle pain is one of the side effects for a certain percentage of people. So, I stopped taking the WelChol and now after a week, the pain is nearly all gone!! It's like a miracle. Now I can take my dog on walks and get things done. I had started feeling like an old lady.  I am middle aged...but not old! It was depressing.  I don't think the medication is worth it.  If I can't exercise because of pain, how ridiculous is that?!

Took it for a month.  I had diarhea, aquired a bad sore behind upper front teeth, and had a severe outbreak of some sort of rash that started on front of legs below the knee and went all the way around the legs.  I feel the Welchol brought it all on, so I stopped it now for two weeks to see if they go away.  Sore is somewhat better and the rash is almost gone.  Bowels quite a bit better too.  I wish they would just quit messing with me!  Also would like to lower cholesterol some way.  I am not taking any more of those medicines.

I am unable to take statins so doc tried this.  Had neurologic problems including leg weakness and cramping and neck and eye movement difficulty.  (I have invisible MS.  The Welchol highly intensified my neurologic problems.)  As one with extremely rare SVT runs, I experienced this, as well.  (I had also had soy sauce which probably intensified the runs.)  The on call nurse told me to go into ER, however, I had recalled that I had started the Welchol and stuck it out until it subsided this morning.  I cannot believe there is such a shortage of easy-to-tolerate, effective drugs out there for elevated cholesterol!  I am a 57 y/o female and petite at 130 and am a stroke/heart attack waiting to happen.

Within 3 weeks my sole of my feet were killing me. It's a burning pain that won't go away. I have to wear Crocs all day. I have to wear slip on rubber soled shoes to walk. I no longer can wear sneakers. The medicine only brought my cholesterol( it was 434) down to 424. Hardly worth all the pains in my legs, back knees, the constipation and wakeful nights. Get real!! This medicine is no different than the statins. The drug companies are using us for experimentation. I stopped taking it to see if my symptoms will stop.

I just don't feel comfortable taking this med so I am going to tell the doctor I can't handle it anymore.  I was happy to have daily bm's but never constant.  I can't say I have experienced any muscle pain except for leg cramps at night on occasion.  I am 75.  There has to be a supplement in a health store that would work. I just don't like the heartburn because I feel it could cause other esophageal problems.  My tests are still high and I walk for exercise.

First it was 4 pills daily and then 6.  My cholesterol dropped a few points but the triglycerides (sp) were up 20 points... and this is after I gave up all alcohol. I have stopped taking both meds because of the side effects.  The constipation, muscle weakness, weight gain, joint pain. I have had to take cordisone shots in my knee because of stiffness and pain. Seriously, having lower cholesterol may help me live longer, but with all those side effects, I'm not sure I want to!

For that problem, I have had great results.  My FP wanted me to increase the dosage to get full advantage of the cholestorol reduction, but any increase resulted in constipation.  My greatest complaint is the muscle weakness.  Some days I can hardly walk, but I push myself.  It would be a hard decision to make, whether to have issues with IBS again, or to stop the muscle fatigue.  I would like them both to go away.

My primary care physician finally prescribed Welchol, one (1) each 625mg tablet twice daily, in hopes that this non-statin pharmaceutical would not cause the muscle/nerve distress experienced previously. Wrong -- the exact same statin-based symptons reappeared, with only a marginal cholesterol improvement. On 09/22/08, I reluctantly agreed with my physician's recommendation to increase my daily Welchol dosage to 2500mg (4 tablets). I followed this regimin for three days and was forced to give it up. I have decided to discontinue the usage of all prescription medications, minerals and supplements while I detoxify my body. P.S. I have chronic age-related degenerative disk disease of the lumbar spine with the associated pain. The additional abdominal, leg and shoulder pain attributable to the cholesterol-lowering medications became overwhelming. The pain was worsening over time with no apparent end in sight.

Not sure if it is because my back is causing neurological problems or the new medications??

I am getting terrible back leg pain.  I have Fibromyalgia and that pain is totally different from this pain.  Anyone who has Fibro knows, there is no pain like IT! No pain in shoulder blades, as I have read from others who take WELCHOL.  With Fibro, pain hits every muscle, thank goodness not usually all at the same time!!

Other		5	5	5			2/8/2008 11:32:25 PM	Welchol was prescribed for me not to lower cholesterol, but to treat the  constant diarrhea that plagued me for years after my gall bladder surgery. After a few month of regular use, I only take it as needed now for occasional flare-ups. It has helped me tremendously
