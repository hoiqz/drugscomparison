Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/23/2012 4:04:20 PM	I have been on OTL for about a year now. it has been extremely effective for me, but it does make me very tired. I am always sleepy, and i use caffiene to ease that away. For the first two months on OTL i experienced chest pains and bad abdomal cramps but that went away after being on the pill for about 3 months. It cleared up my skin, and also made my boob grow. I would reccomend this pill to anyone due to its effectiveness. 
Defective Internal Secretion of Ovaries	Khira, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	8/22/2012 11:44:51 PM	I started taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for hemorrhagic ovarian cysts and cyst ruptures. It's only been a month, and I know I need to switch to something else. The packaging makes use a bit difficult, but my main complaint is that since I started this medication I've been getting headaches on a daily basis and have been feeling depressed. I've lost interest in things I used to find enjoyable, feel too anxious to sleep well, and have been having flashbacks to a period in my life when I was physically abused. I am hoping that going back on Microgestin - which didn't cause headaches or mood disturbances for me before - will resolve these problems, because I would rather have the cysts than to continue feeling the way I do now.

Birth Control	seven years protected, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/16/2012 3:05:41 PM	I have used OTL for 7 years (still using) I have never had a pregnancy scare or any other problems. I am 120 lbs I am not a health nut and do not exercise. Despite my lifestyle this pill has done every thing from relive my period pain to preventing pregnancy.     
Birth Control	ana123, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	8/2/2012 3:51:27 PM	I was on this pill for six months. I honestly didn't think that I was experiencing any side effects but they were gradual so i never really noticed. I started getting bad headaches (which I attributed to other things). I was extremely moody/psychotic at times (my poor boyfriend) and the spotting was pretty bad. Since my side effects are getting worst 6months after starting, it is time for me to switch to something else.

Im usually the person bouncing around and happy to be alive every day. Im 24; I may try getting off of it for awhile.

Birth Control	sherlee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	7/29/2012 5:39:25 PM	I finally convinced my 20 yr old daughter to give this birth control pill a chance.  I wanted her to use it for birth control and to help with her mild to moderate acne so she could get off antibiotics she takes for the pimples.  Wow...she just finished the first month..she has been very grouchy, is extremely tired, has off and on headaches, (she never has headaches), complains of feeling bloated, told me she has had mild bleeding for over 2 wks and her pimples have gotten worse. Her breast size has increased, which may or may not be a plus.  The Dr said she has to give it 3 months for all this to straighten out.  She says she can't and is done with it.
Birth Control	smase11, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	6/23/2012 12:08:07 PM	I have been on this pill over a year now and I love it. At first I did have some side effects including headaches and stomach pains, but after the first month or so I was fine and have been since. I set an alarm on my cell phone to remind me to take it, and I have had no real problems with it. I also get this covered through my insurance so overall I would rate it as being a pretty good drug.
Painful Periods	Stac, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	6/22/2012 12:49:32 PM	Ive been on OTC lo for 4 mo now.  After switching from Yaz after years of taking it I developed severe headaches during the inert pills.  OTC lo has not been a good change for me.  I have terrible breakouts, chest palpitations,gained 10 lbs in a few months, and not to mention my periods last 7 days or better with heavy bleeding. I am about to start Apri in a week and hope for some relief of these terrible side effects.
Birth Control	yosanchez, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	6/10/2012 4:57:54 PM	I have been on birth control for almost 16 years.  I started taking OCL about five years ago.  I have never had side effects.  The hardest thing about the daily pill is remembering to take it daily.  Even after years and years on BC, it's still hasn't become a part of my schedule.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	6/1/2012 9:24:00 PM	I switched to this pill because others have given me just about every side effect possible and the last one I was on (microgestin fe 1.5/30) made me break out horribly. The first two months of the ortho tri-cyclen lo were brutal, which my doctor warned me about. Horrible crying, acne and overall depression. However, during the third month the acne started to clear up and all of a sudden I went back to my normal happy self. I'm not pregnant, so it obviously does its job and I think it was worth the two initial months of bad side effects to get to what I wanted. This is also the first birth control pill I've ever thought highly enough of to give it a rating online. Don't be freaked out by bad reviews - most of them are people that didn't wait longer than a month or two before deciding it wasn't going to work, which isn't enough time for your body to adjust to ANY pill.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/22/2012 10:48:31 AM	I am currently taking the generic brand of this bc. I have ovarian cysts and struggled with the intense pain for years. This medicine has literally changed my life. Instead of having to call out of work every month, I was actually able to work an entire day with no worries!! As well, my doctor recommended this medicine because I had terrible skin issues too. It cleared up my skin and for the first time since I was twelve I am getting compliments on my skin!!!! It has also reduced the crazy pms symptoms I used to get (lower back ache, sore breasts, bloating, EXTREME emotions, cramps of course, and a long heavy flow). I feel like I sound silly saying that this little pill has changed my life, but I feel phenomenal now. I wish I had found it sooner!
Birth Control	Lexie, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	13-18	5/10/2012 8:11:47 PM	I'm 15 and started taking birth control in september of 2011. For the last year birth control was my enemy. I hated everything my doctor gave me. He first put me on Depo provera for 3 months and it was terrible. I had my period for 2 weeks straight, my skin was horrible, I was always depressed, tired, and sore. Then I was put on Lo loestrin fe, and that was also terrible, my skin was bad, I gained weight, and MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT! So I decided to switch doctors, the woman gave me ortho tri cyclen lo and I love it&lt;3 I'm on my 5th month, it's done wonders. My skin went back to normal, my hair stopped falling out, I was able to lose weight, and I feel like a person again. Even though I'm not a fan of getting my period every month or the cost of it I LOVE ORTHO TRI CYCLEN LO! 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	anon, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	5/1/2012 12:12:31 AM	i'm on my 3rd pack of this. and i feel like a completely different person. i cry all the time, over nothing, and i was never like that before because it took a lot for me to actually cry. i feel depressed all the time, my sex drive is almost gone, like when i do have sex, i feel bad afterwards. also, because of the vaginal dryness it has caused and the smell i have (been tested for everything and nothing has come up different), i don't have any kind of motivation, i feel tired all the time, my insomnia has become worse, it take me forever to go to sleep, i've had a ton of sleepless night because of this. but, luckly i've had no weight gain, however my face  seems a bit bigger to me. but, the first month, i ate everything in sight. my 2nd month, i barely ate anything, now i'm hungry all the time. i hate this pill. i only wanted a pill to control my acne (which this helped, but now my face is breaking out) and to help my periods (it has). but i do NOT recommend this pill at all.
Painful Periods	atxyay, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/12/2012 12:20:24 PM	I have irregular periods for an unknown reason. Without birth control, I get painful periods every three months. So painful that I am nearly incapacitated and just exhausted. I was also experiencing acne, oily skin/scalp, some hair thinning. My hormone levels did not indicate a high level of testosterone, but my doc said I might just be sensitive to a small imbalance.I took this pill about 8 years ago and didn't remember having any bad side effects. So I decided to go back on this pill, rather than the other two I had tried in past years. Loestrin gave me anxiety/panic attacks, as well as odd sexual side effects (cramping after sex). Seasonique caused a massive weight gain, daily cramping, and recurrent spotting. Ugh.I was worried about blood clot issues, so I got two blood clot factor tests. Sure, they may be expensive, but if you are worried, you could always get these blood tests to make sure you're not setting yourself up for a lethal blood clot.I'm on month two of Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo now. My acne has cleared up, the oiliness is nearly gone. I've noticed my hair does not shed as much, which is nice. My periods are predictable and not nearly as painful as they are w/o the pill. They last about four days and don't require me to pound the Advil.My sex drive maybe decreased by about 10-15%. I would say that's not a disruptive change. I don't have problems with vaginal dryness or getting in the mood.The worse side effect I've experienced is some nausea on month two. I take my pill at 6 pm, and I noticed I was getting pretty nauseous a few hours later. But now that's going away. I gained about five pounds, and I feel my boobs are a full size bigger. My face is a little puffier, too. But I plan on exercising more to maybe counter the extra weight gain.I know everyone is different and reacts to different levels of hormones differently. But this pill works for me. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/19/2012 3:34:17 PM	I have been taking OTC lo for about 6 years now, and it's is only now that I am considering switching (recently low sex drive).  This pill has been great; I have shorter (4 days), regular periods. There was some initial weight gain and now I get backaches at my time of the month. I'll trade better periods for that! It may be that i've been taking it for so long that my sex drive has gone down but it wasn't an issue for the first 5 years. I would definitely reccommend it.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/17/2012 12:50:20 AM	I was on a birth control that wasn't strong enough for me and the doctor switched me to OTC. My life was literally given back to me. My periods were very long, lasting seven or more days and then the symptoms lasted even longer BEFORE the pill. That was a whole two weeks a month that I was losing. It was THAT bad. I'm so grateful for this pill. However, I'm a bit concerned because there is a large lump in my breast that was tested to be not cancerous, but I have a family history of these types of breast lumps so I don't think it was because of the birth control pill.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	2/29/2012 11:38:32 AM	BEWARE. I am 22 years old, first time taking birth control and have a very healthy lifestyle.  I experienced chest pains within the first TWO days of taking OTL. As a result I had to spend THREE days in and out of the hospital for all sorts of tests to ensure I had no blood clots. I found out this drug did increase my blood clotting factor but overall found no clots. All that for taking a pill for TWO days? No thanks
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	2/2/2012 12:57:33 AM	This was my first experience with BC. I had been on it about 3 months and took it daily and on time when I thought I missed my period. It came on my last inactive pill very light. About 2 weeks into my new pack I suddenly had a full on period and called the doc. He said the hormones probably weren't strong enough for me so switched me over to Mononessa. This pill did make me moody and emotional but overall it was ok.
Birth Control	lcmorgan1012, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/30/2012 8:57:36 PM	I first have to state this could be just a bad reaction from going to a progesterone only pill for 5 years to a estrogen/ progesterone. When I first starting taking the pill I had alot of side effects that I've never had, lightheadiness,anxiety, pimples(which I never have), and the scariest thing chest pains. I informed my doctor about the chest pains and she said it was all part of hormonal change.???okay?A year later after on and off chest pains I wake up and feel like I'm about to have a heart attack, 26yrs old. Go to the E/M room and they check for blood clots. None, thank goodness, but stopped the pill immediatly. I'd rather get pregnant then have a heart attack. After it was out of my system, NO chest pain. I wanted to share my experience becausse I want girls to do their research and remember there's a reason they put those labels, may cause stroke, blood clot, heart attacks for a reason. I'm a very healthy 26 yr old, and again this could be my body cant handle estrogen. So if your having the same experience I had, chest pain is not normal. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	1/14/2012 2:13:04 PM	I switched to OTCLO after having exremely long(two weeks on average) and irregular periods on Lutera. The first couple of days after I started taking OTCLO I experienced some minor lightheadness/dizziness, but it subsided after the first week. I just finished my first pack and already my period is regulating and it has become lighter and shorter; however I did have some light breakthrough bleeding and spotting but I expect this to go away within the next couple of months. I didn't seem to have any other side effects, maybe some minor mood swings, but nothing really serious. Overall I am really happy with OTCLO and it is well-worth the extra $15 a month I have to pay for it. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	1/11/2012 12:56:43 PM	I've only been on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo for about a month and half now and I hate it. It made me break out like Ive never broken out before. Not to mention I was throwing up the whole first three weeks on being on this pill. Every time i ate something i would get nauseous and throw up. I even had to take days off work, thats how bad my acne got. This pill is supposed to help with acne, but did the complete opposite for me. 
Birth Control	Xcsarah, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	19-24	12/27/2011 4:02:14 AM	I started taking this as a way to reduce my acne and then a year later for birth control. My acne became less severe, but breakouts became more frequent and much more closely tied to periods--where I used to have a couple of bad zits most of the time, I started getting a larger breakout of small pimples all over my face, shoulders and back for about a week and a half each month. It at least got rid of the cystic acne, which had been causing scarring which I still have to this day.  Periods became more severe but shorter (1-3 days of heavy bleeding on this pill, vs 3-5 days of medium bleeding off it). Fortunately mood swings were much less and I was actually able to lose some weight. Unfortunately, just one month after starting to use this as my sole contraceptive, I became pregnant, despite taking the pill religiously at the same time every day.  Though I love my daughter, I'll never again trust this med!
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/6/2011 5:18:14 AM	Works great for preventing pregnancy, if taken properly, and regulating (or even making) a menstrual cycle. Slight hair loss of facial hair, acne hasn't changed, cramps are lighter, periods are lighter. The first three months I had mood swings and nausea while my body was adapting to the pill. Lost weight each month since started!
Birth Control	rgregones, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	12/2/2011 3:58:14 PM	Due to hair loss from being on Mirena for 5yrs, I wanted a low dose of hormones to allow me to regrow my hair. I had been on Ortho Tri Cyclen 7yrs prior and thought this would be even better. Wrong! I have gained 5lbs in two months and the acne is unbearable. My skin hurts from the deep cystic acne and I even breakout on my shoulders and neck! I am switching back to Ortho Tri Cyclen. I'm hoping for the best. 
Birth Control	kimwhoa, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	11/29/2011 8:49:35 AM	I'va been taking this pill for almost one year because it is all that was offered at my health department and I hate it! I am super emotional (I've never been an emotional person before), and my sex drive is basically gone. Worst of all, many months I get not only break through bleeding, but a second full period! Supposably my period should be starting on the same day each month, but that doesn't happen. It also hasnt helped with acne. Bottom line, I would not reccomend this birth control.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Someone, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	13-18	11/28/2011 1:38:48 AM	I was pleased with what I had heard about this medication. Thought, &quot;Finally a birth control pill that will decrease my acne and won't make me gain weight.&quot; Although I haven't gained any weight - my acne has appeared to worsen along with nausea and frequent headaches. The more serious side affects also worry me. Contemplating switching or getting off of birth control completely.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/18/2011 10:55:08 AM	I LOVE this pill!  Unfortunately it costs me $100 with my new insurance so I have to switch to something more affordable.  Was given Tri Lo Sprintec 2 years ago and it was an AWFUL experience, so I recommend staying away from that.  Wish I could stay on this pill though, my body adjusted to it really well when I switched from another prescription a few years ago.
Other	Bek, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	11/2/2011 5:33:44 AM	I've only been on this birth control for a couple of weeks, and I really like this birth control so far. I haven't been a big emotional mess, which I have been on other birth controls. Also, it's clearing up my acne beautifully. The only downfall is that my stomach is bothersome in the morning. I think that may be because I take it so late at night though, at 9:40. Next month I will be taking it in the morning.

I was nauseous all the time and had no appetite before taking the pill. On the pill, I got my period on the first month, my nausea went away and my appetite came back! My breasts got larger and my face (acne) is starting to clear up (on week 4 of month 3 now). 
Birth Control	dnicole, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	9/25/2011 7:14:02 PM	This is the first birth control I have ever used.  At first, I absolutely loved it.  My cramps weren't as bad, my period was lighter, my skin was more clear and my breasts even got a little bit bigger.  The only downfall for this pill were my moodswings and lowered sex drive.  Suddenly I was becoming very anxious, crying at the drop of dime and just extremely emotional.  The fact that my sex drive was slowly diminishing, wasn't helpful either.  Because of my negative experiences, I am currently searching for a new birth control to try.  It does have me a little scared because I don't want to go through what I did with OTCL.  
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	9/24/2011 2:18:20 PM	This pill made me gain weight in the stomach area and my boobs got larger. It seemed to be helping with acne for the most part.
Birth Control	Emily G, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	8/31/2011 12:50:12 PM	I just finished my second month of ortho lo, and am not switching to beyaz. It does what it's supposed to do which was prevent me from getting pregnant but it made my acne worse! I heard reviews from people that it made theirs better thats why i choice ortho lo in the first place and when i realized how much worse my skin got, after 2 months i decided to switch. i also had an increased appetite and gained a few lbs. id also get really mad at my boyfriend for no reason. overall, i was not satisfied with the side effects at all.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Elly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	8/23/2011 9:17:44 PM	I started taking OTC-Lo for the first time about 3 weeks ago.  It's my first pill ever and I had high hopes.  My hopes were squashed.  One week into the pill and I started bleeding mid-cycle which was preceded by heavy mood swings and irrational thoughts.  My Ob/Gyn thinks the hormone levels of OTC-Lo are too low for me and has prescribed OTC.  I'd like to think positive about OTC but given the reviews, I'm more apprehensive than hopeful.

Birth Control	a.rod10, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	8/8/2011 2:01:53 PM	I started taking this exactly a year ago. When I first started I had a horrible migraine about maybe 2 or 3 weeks in. It was horrible and decided hey I am going to just finish the month. Then I decided 1 more month because I already had the pills and I have not gone off until this week. The past year was good on the birth control front (although I tend to use condoms anyway with the occasional exception) but I have gained weight maybe 15-20 lbs. My diet has not really changed other than the fact that I crave alot of snacks. But I do snack about the same amount that I did before and my diet has not changed so I have come down to the conclusion of it has to be my BC. I am thinking of going a month without it and seeing how I feel and if not I may just go back on. I have been on BC for almost 3 years and I do feel like I should give my body a break. Lets see how it goes. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/3/2011 7:00:35 PM	I love Ortho Tri-Cyclen LO. When I first started this I was 21 years old, now Im 26. I only had bleeding for about two weeks maybe alittle more when I first started and It worked great after that. It was my first BC. Im sad to say I lost my insurance and can not afford it at 80 something dollars a month. Im switching to a genaric brand of Ortho Tri-Cyclen and Sprintec 28 is the name. Im scared I read alot of bad reviews. I would recommend Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo to anyone Love it. :(
Other	Elizabeth, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female	13-18	7/14/2011 9:38:23 AM	My daughter was on this pill and for four months she experienced unbelievable pain only when she ovulated. She would end up in the hospital every time. 
Birth Control	InvertedCaneSugar, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	5/20/2011 1:25:47 AM	For the first few weeks I had trouble with mood swings and it was almost impossible not to cry when something emotional happened, but those effects went away. I've never had much of an issue with acne before. I always got compliments on my complexion but now I have some on my forehead. Which I am willing to deal with considering I grew a cup size. Which I am REALLY happy with because I'm 18 and was, until now, on the small side of an A cup. I am also not pregnant, which is always a plus, and my boobs are still growing after three months. Seems pretty awesome to me. I didn't think they would ever grow. My only major complaint about the pills, other than the acne, is that I now have some cramping and bloating on my period that I didn't have before. But I think I prefer that to the unpredictably random periods I used to have... All in all I'm really satisfied. Especially with the breast growth... I think it's time for new bras!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	5/2/2011 8:36:24 PM	Was on this for 2.5 weeks. I had an allergic reaction to something in it and had to stop. I broke out in an itchy rash. Started another brand today and hope it doesn't do the samething.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/25/2011 10:29:49 PM	 I could have died!! It gave me blood clots in my lungs! Im healthy, I dont smoke, Im not over weight and Im only 30 years old! THIS DRUG SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET!!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	4/5/2011 1:13:19 AM	I had been a little reluctant to start any hormonal types of birth control due to the fear of getting unwanted side effects that I have read/and heard about that would effect both myself and everyone around me. I knew the only way I would be able to know and be provided the extra protection given from hormonal options available would be to try it out. So I made an appointment to discuss which BC method would be right for me. Since going on OTC lo I feel as though I am the same person as before which had always been this happy,fun loving young woman who loves to enjoy life. I do sometimes have moments where I feel my mind is all over place with thoughts, but it isn't frequent enough to be bothersome nor are they ever harmful thoughts. I have more cravings, but my actual appetite has not increased at all and I am maintaining the same weight as before being on Ortho. It has made my period's more light, shorter, and instead of painful cramps(like before) I get slight cramps which I can tolerate. An increase of breast size with no soreness has occured as well as increase of sex drive. Taking this pill at night left me with nausea throughout the night and on through the next morning till maybe around noon time. To fix that problem I simply just started taking my pill in the morning which for me leaves no nausea feeling at all. Every body is different so if Ortho doesn't work for you its recommended to try something different till you found what works best with your body. As for me I have ended my search for the right BC method with ortho tricyclen lo. 
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	13-18	3/29/2011 1:15:55 PM	I was on this pill for about 2+ years. It's not a bad pill, I haven't gotten pregnant, my mood swings WAY leveled out, my acne got better for the first year and a half. After that, my acne started getting worse again, and I've had unbearable nausea for the last 7 months every time I'm on my period. After 1 and a half years, I lost almost all desire for sex- I'm 17, that's pretty unheard of. It helped my migraines for the first 1 and a half years, but since then, I get headaches at least 2 times a week. I'm switching at the end of this cycle to Loestren 24- I like OTC-L, but the nausea is too severe. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Elle, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	3/14/2011 6:41:20 PM	I was orignally on the regular Ortho Tri-Cyclen but my doctor switched me to 'Lo' without telling me and I noticed I was having cramps again. If you have heavy periods and bad cramping DO NOT take 'Lo'
Birth Control	Victoria, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	13-18	3/5/2011 12:56:02 PM	This is the worst birth control I've been on. I started taking this after turning 18 and after having acne free skin for years, I ended up having purple huge cystic acne all over my cheeks, which left scars. As soon as I stopped taking it, the acne cleared up and eventually disappeared (except the scarring). I don't think I had any more side effects other than that, but that alone was enough to make me stop taking it.
Painful Periods	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		2/20/2011 12:24:42 PM	I used to take this pill and loved it. My cramps were much more manageable and I could predict when my period would start within an 8-hour window. No pregnancy.
Birth Control	Melissa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/9/2011 3:41:10 PM	Pill has worked no pregnancy.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/12/2011 9:35:12 PM	In the past, I had been on EstroStep Fe and Yasmin. EstroStep was a wonder drug for me, with the exception of weight gain. Yasmin made me incredibly suicidal and after I stopped taking it, I was forced to use anti-depressants. I'm in the middle of my second round of white pills and so far, I only have one complaint. Around the second or third white pill, I get incredibly fatigued (probably due to reintroduction of the hormones after a week of inactivity). This pill, so far, has cleared up my skin (though I never had any severe acne to begin with--it's just a plus!), NOT caused me any weight gain (just temporary water gain during the light blue pills), ceased any and all facial hair growth (it was blonde and fine and hardly noticeable except up close, but it was quite dense), given me shorter, lighter periods and prevented cramping. So far, I love this pill and I was very skeptical about starting it. I was petrified that it would do to me what Yasmin did but I'm very glad I gave OTClo a chance!
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	1/6/2011 6:12:44 PM	I went on for acne, and I'm not really sure if it ultimately helped with that since I began accutane a few months later. However, positives: I didn't notice any changes in my mood, no weight gain, no cramping. I had irregular periods before, so it was nice to finally have them on a schedule. On ortho tri cyclen lo, my periods lasted for approximately 6 days but after the first 2-3 days it was light. I ultimately decided to stop because I think it may be affecting my sex life. I was a virgin when I started taking the pill, but 6 months in, I met my current boyfriend, we began having sex, and it was horrible for me. My vagina was very dry, I have yet to orgasm, and I don't fantasize about sex. I remember having such vivid daydreams before I started the pill. Birth control pills are definitely an effective way to prevent pregnancy, but just based on all the forums that I have read about different types, they almost all cause decreased sex drive/painful sex in at least some people. My boyfriend is very caring, but it's difficult to not enjoy sex with him and it's becoming a strain on our relationship. I have a prescription for Solia which my doctor thinks may help my problem but some reviewers of solia talk about decreased sex drive as well. For now, my boyfriend and I are going back to using condoms to see if I'll feel better without unnatural hormones running through my body. I'm starting to regret ever taking birth control and please seriously consider the effects on your sex life if you're currently sexually active before beginning any pill.

Birth Control	Michele, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	11/29/2010 5:27:38 PM	When i was younger this was the first pill I was on and it worked great. A couple of years ago when I switched doctors she put me on the generic (tri lo sprintec) that was as equally effective. Then this past March it was taken off the market and now I'm back on Ortho again, ever since I changed back every month I have been getting my regular period when I'm supposed to except now i get a light one two weeks later. I went to the doctor in August and she told me it would eventually go away well now it's November and no change. On my way to get a new script hopefully this one works.
Other	katy g, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	11/15/2010 4:11:16 PM	I've been taking OTC lo for 4 or 5 months now and I haven't had any problems. I originally started taking it to regulate my periods, but I haven't had any pregnancy scares. It controls my acne and I've never had any nausea or headaches. I had a little bit of spotting the first month but none after that.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/25/2010 2:34:06 AM	I began this medication for acne but now it's mostly for birth control.i love it!i'v never had a pregnancy scare and my acne has cleared.i recommend this medication.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/11/2010 3:19:25 PM	I started taking OTC lo a little over a week ago and had to stop taking it because I was having severe migraines, nausea, and dizziness. I was also very bloated. I thought I was pregnant because I was having all of these side effects! I quit taking them 2 days ago and already feel better. I started taking them in the morning, which I don't recommend, and then tried taking them at night which helped a little bit. It was easy to take because they are so small. I really wish this pill would've worked for me. If you have frequent headaches or a history of depression, make sure to tell your doctor.

I have been lightly bleeding since the 3rd day. Its kind freaking ME out. I have never bleed this long before. I have also noticed my breast are getting much bigger and my tummy is kind blouting. As far as my acne its milled down the past 2 weeks. I am going to finish this month and see how things go. 
Birth Control	faeriefire78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	8/25/2010 1:37:51 PM	It seems as though my problems may be unique. No one else has mentioned the constant fatigue, nausea and severe menstrual cramps I've experienced while on this pill. I also noticed a heavy, &quot;full&quot; feeling in my uterus and vaginal area that I've only ever experienced before while in my 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Very strange, ugly side effects for me. Never had harsher periods before in my life. It prevents pregnancy, sure. But the cost for me is high.
Birth Control	diamond, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/18/2010 11:06:31 PM	no side effects and no preganacy...not worried...best way to prevent side effects is to eat healthy... live active
Birth Control	strawberry, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	7/29/2010 12:49:48 AM	I have been on Tri-Cyclen for 9 years after trying Aless for a short time. I never thought Birth Control had any bad effects until recently when I stopped taking it for 2 months while having surgery for dysplasia (which has been linked to long term use of BC). While I stopped taking birth control I immediately lost tummy weight, I was happier and generally felt really normal happy and healthy. Recently  I went back on Tri-cyclen because I am in a relationship,  and all of a sudden I have my weird cravings for food again, tummy weight and times of feeling depressed. I'm thinking of trying Yaz or Yasmin.
Painful Periods	girlygirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/21/2010 12:04:09 AM	Ive had painful long periods since my first period. I was put on this to help. It HELPED and I also lost weight. I was on it for a total of 5 months and lost 23 pounds. I was since then put on reg dose instead of the lo.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	6/17/2010 5:16:24 PM	I've tried taking this BC twice; the first time I took it for a period of 2 months, but because I got two periods and was experiencing strange sensations in my right calf (later attributed to the type of exercise I was doing), I stopped. I decided to continue after receiving some medical advice and it has been a generally happy  experience. After beginning again, my periods have been normal, if not  more tolerable. I haven't had any major side effects, but my fingers will occasionally experience &quot;water retention&quot; but it usually goes away after a while. I have also actually been losing some weight, but my appetite has grown quite significantly. My breasts be be tender sometimes, but it goes away within minutes. My acne hasn't really been affected, but it has never been bad to begin with. Overall, my experience with the pill has been good and I definitely recommend it.
Birth Control	Spikedidi, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/29/2010 7:15:25 AM	I want someone to answer my question, the doc never told me that it was supposed to be taken during menstruation and told me to take it afterwards, I haven't got my period yet. Right now I'm on the green pills, when am I supposed to get my period back? Do I have to stop taking the pill? or do I keep on taking it and eventually it will appear? Please help me, because its been more than a month without my period.
Birth Control	Jay, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	25-34	5/5/2010 11:06:22 AM	Reading these reveiws made me feel much better, as I have had almost all of the side effects.  Acne, severe migraines and weight gain in the tummy region (I actually look pregnant!).  I also never know how long my period will last.  Sometimes it's a couple days, other times more than a week.  I've tried other bc methods and didn't like them either because of side effects.  
Birth Control	Ash, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/3/2010 11:15:07 AM	I have been on ortho tri cyclen lo for almost 3 years now. When I began I spotted for about a month, which is normal (says most gynecologists). I didn't gain any weight, in fact, I lost my HUGE appetite &amp; lost about 5 pounds in the first 3 months of me taking it. I still haven't fully regained my appetite. The pill makes me eat about 5 small meals every day which is apparently better for you than 3 big meals. It has shortened my period, I used to have 7 arduous(with strong cramps) days of bleeding. Now I have 4 days where I spot and it ends with no cramps. This pill is amazing. No pregnancies. Sometimes I would miss a pill and at times I wouldn't take it at the exact times &amp; still no pregnancies (not on purpose). I'm not saying do this, but I'm saying the pill has your back if these things accidentally happen. There is one instance that I didn't like, I spotted once after a period after 2 years of taking it, my dr. explained that it was just because ive been on it for so long that my uterus lining was thin for that cycle. But that only  happened once. Not since. The pills are super tiny &amp; sometimes I swallow it and don't feel it at all, wondering if it even went down! This was what I started with when I was 19, I am 21 now. I never tried anything else. I wouldn't try anything else. It's the perfect pill for me. You should try it if you're body is good at adapting. It's a low dosage so less side effects, those who have been on other bc, might not want to switch to a lower dose since their bodies may have been already exposed to big doses. 
Birth Control	lm6495, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	4/30/2010 8:25:39 PM	I switched from Yaz to Ortho because of my health insurance, and I have had absolutely nothing but problems. EXTREME mood swings, depression, 7 pound weight gain around my tummy, weird food cravings, decreased libido, and increased acne and headaches. I am switching back to Yaz for my next cycle, and I can't wait to be tiny and happy again :)
Birth Control	Satisfied, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	25-34	4/30/2010 11:38:27 AM	I just started using Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo, and I have been very pleased with my experience so far.  First, a little background.  I am 32, never used hormonal birth control methods before, and I have regular periods.  I was nervous about using the pill due to the horror stories you read online.  I am grateful that my experience has been mostly positive.  The first night I took it, I had some diarrhea, but then my stomach was fine.  I took it on the &quot;day one&quot; start, and my period was noticeably heavier.  Then, it stopped completely after 4 days.  Ever since, I have had one day of abdominal pain that felt like gas or extreme hunger pains.  My appetite has been actually lower, and I crave fruits and veggies!  Wasn't expecting that!  I have actually lost weight, and my face seems to be a little duller, but clearer.  Reviews are a great way to become informed about a product, but don't get too freaked out by negative reviews.  Everyone's body is different and you have to try the medication for yourself. It's easy to get caught up with the weight-gain myths with birth control pills, as well.  A nurse friend of mine who has worked in the OB/GYN business for a long time said that BC pills do not necessarily make you gain weight automatically.  Instead, they sometimes increase your appetite and subsequently, you choose to eat more.  If you choose to eat junk, you will gain weight.  It's not necessarily the pill's fault.  We have to take responsibility for our food choices.     
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/7/2010 10:36:24 AM	Started it in 2002, been on it ever since. My periods were BEYOND painful (throwing up, cramps, diarhea, headaches) and this has really helped. I still need midol my period day but that's it. It's way too expensive now though without my new, crappy insurance ($70) so I need to find a back up. No side effects for me. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/7/2010 7:50:58 PM	I do get headaches, and retain water, but it has worked well.
Birth Control	Txmommy1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	2/2/2010 2:52:20 PM	I have been taking this pill now 4 months and it has been a positive experience.  My period in Jan. was a couple days longer but I have no spotting or side effects.  My skin looks great, this pill works for me compared to the others I have tried.
Birth Control	Riansal88, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/18/2010 10:54:54 AM	I've tried all types of prescription BC... but this has to be my favorite. I've been on it for about a year now. No weight gain, No mood swings, lighter/shorter periods, and better skin. The best benefit for me..it doesn't affect my sex drive :) I have no complaints! 
Birth Control	HardworkingMom, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/6/2010 8:57:34 PM	2 years ago I was taking this pill and I loved it. On April 20th 2009 I got pregnant with my daughter Ashley. I am deciding on going back on  the pill. But I was thinking about the iud and my husband said no. So on January 26th 2010 I will be going to my ob and going back one the pill. When I was on the pill I had so munch Energy and I only had my periods for 2 days. I love this pill. I defiantly recommend it.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/3/2010 12:50:49 AM	Taking Ortho Tri-Clyclen Lo was just like taking candy for me. My skin was clear, my weight was controlled, and my menstrual was regular. Everyone's body react to medications differently. I was 18 when I first started taking it and stopped at 19 because I moved away to college and never got my refills updated. Yes my hormones were unbalanced and this medication helped out a lot, however after I stopped taking it I began to gain weight and have a little acne. Now I have a new doctor and she precribed something totally different. I'm nervous at how its going to work. I wish she would have put me on Ortho. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	12/14/2009 3:58:12 PM	I was only on this pill for 3 weeks and had to stop as it was giving me severe migranes. I would get spotty vision, then nueasea then the migrane which only stopped after sleep, with a dull headache the rest of the day. Two days after I stopped the pill I was perfectly fine

I loved it until I went to my doctor and they stopped carrying it. They put me on Levora and im scared to switch but I didnt really have much of a choice 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Taps, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	2	Female	19-24	10/8/2009 10:37:48 PM	When my daughter was born, I began using Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo about 3 months later. For 9 months now, I have had about 15 to 20 periods. Heavy periods lasting 2 weeks-- another period a week later!! For the first three months, I had a period that lasted for the ENTIRE THREE MONTHS!!! I had to stop this pill. Maybe it will work better for someone else.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	10/6/2009 10:22:51 PM	I've taken Ortho tri cyclen-Lo for 7 years now. I never had any acne or weight gain issues. It has been very good for me other than the nausea in the first couple doses, however, I think this is my own fault for taking them in the morning on an empty stomach. I have been very pleased with this medication other than the cost.
Birth Control	LCBalthis, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	9/6/2009 1:27:53 PM	I have been on this pill for 6 months, and I would have to say i DO NOT recommend this pill. The only positive thing besides the obvious not getting pregnant, was bigger boobs. My stomach and legs got bigger, but the rest stayed small. so my stomach looks HUGE. i have actually had people ask me if i am pregnant. I have been the same exact size and weight for 8 years. I shot up from 116 to 132 in my first 2 months. (AFTER i had already bought my wedding dress that now unzips when i take a deep breathe in) I am constantly having mood swings and depression. And gaining weight is already depressing enough, so it's a hundred times worse in your head when you're taking this pill! The 3rd week of hormone pills makes me extremely hungry. I stay tired with no motivation to even get out of bed in the morning. My sex drive is gone, i can't achieve orgasms...you name it, it's gone wrong. I DO not like this pill.
Birth Control	MD and patient, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	9/3/2009 5:05:21 PM	I have used this OCP for years. It controls my acne (as I've had throughout my 20s and 30s), does not alter my mood, keeps my periods mellow. I do get melasma sometimes when I'm tanned.  My biggest concern is that I think there is a striking difference between this drug and Ortho Tri Cyclen which I recently tried when my doctor prescribed it accidentally. I became bloated, was hungry all the time, sensitive, totally exhausted (sleeping sometimes 12 hours), and had daily headaches.  All these symptoms started within a week of starting the drug and have resolved within days of stopping. I definitely recommend being extremely mindful of drastic changes in yourself when starting a new OCP and switching it as soon as you can when you figure out it's the wrong one for you.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/31/2009 11:46:07 AM	I was prescribed this after giving birth in 2001 and was very happy on it, no weight gain (I even went off it for 2 months and I actually had a harder time maintaining my weight). However, a couple of months ago my insurance changed at work and I had to pay full price for my prescription $60 ouch! so I switched to the generic of the regular Ortho Tri-Cyclen (Tri-Nessa) which was only $10! Well in the 2 months I was on it I gained 4 pounds (I am a very healthy/strict eater and exercise 5 days a week) and my breast hurt to touch. I will say my emotions were more in check. I just switched last month to Yasim (but the generic) which was $35 on my insurance. I can't get rid of the 4 pounds and my breast are tender on these as well. So I have decided to just suck it up and pay the $60 for the Ortho Lo, because there is nothing worse than working hard every week at the gym and eating right and still gaining weight! I know they say to give them a couple of months for you body to get used to but, I am just too afraid of gaining more weight.
Birth Control	sandie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/19/2009 2:17:07 PM	I've been taking this for about one year.  I'm 32.  I made the decision to start a new pack and skip my period to avoid having it during an event in the future.  During week 2, I started bleeding.  It has been been 8 days now.  Sunday, I start the blank pills.  I usually have a four day period. Anyone try skipping a period with similar issue?
Birth Control	dw, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/11/2009 3:49:35 AM	I have been taking this pill for about 7 years. I think it is a effective BC. I have light periods,hardly any acne,slight bloating. But overall it's good. I thought about switching at one point, but why switch something that works well for you right?.. everyone is different. Just remember that.hope this helps (:
Painful Periods	Megan, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	8/9/2009 4:13:37 PM	This was the first pill I ever went on three years ago. The one thing it did was regulate my period's and that was it. My mood's were horrible due to the constant hormone changes every week. I only took this for a year from August 2006-2007. I will never go back to it.
Birth Control	rlg82, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	7/31/2009 8:59:04 AM	I have only been on this pill for 20 days now and will not take any more. I have experienced just about every possible side effect: weight gain (which prior to starting I had lost 30# so this really sucks), breast tenderness, mood swings, depression, headaches, cramping and I can not sleep! I have had issues with pills in the past but never like this. Plus did I mention I now have what my husband calls my 3 o'clock shadow!  Sure I'm not pregnant but w/ all these issues I think I would rather have another baby then deal w/ all this.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	chrissy314, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	7/16/2009 1:21:38 PM	The only problem I have had with this medicantion is hairloss. Almost instantly my hair started falling out. I am still taking it...second month...and I added B-12 to my daily regimen, and I don't notice as much hair in the shower or on my comb/brushes. Other than the hairloss, it is a great pill. Not other side effects. 
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus		1	4	1			7/7/2009 7:07:31 PM	I have been on Ortho for a little over two months now. I have had break thorugh bleeding everyday and cramps are no better. I am changing to Tri-Sprintec but I hear people hate that one also.
Birth Control	holga, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	7/1/2009 6:28:10 AM	I have tried about 8 different kinds of oral birth control, and this is the only one that has seemed to be the most comfortable. However I was previously on Yasmin which was causing some major physical and mental health problems, so when I switched to Tri-Cyclen Lo I couldn't notice any of the common side effects. My only complaint so far is a bit of weight gain, but I've found that taking a vitamin B-complex has helped with the water retaination. I'm currently trying to decide whether or not to go off birth control pills for good as I'm beginning to think about kidney health. There is still a lot of research to be done on the long term health risks of hormonal birth control.
Birth Control	emily, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	19-24	6/29/2009 12:27:09 PM	I have taken this birth control for 4 years now, and its the only one I have tried. I've never had any side effects and never been pregnant. I took it before I got married and since then no pregnancy scares at all. I sometime forget to take a pill. Only problem I ever had was about 2 years ago I had a period for 3 weeks, but then I was fine, so I still use it and no babies yet! 
Birth Control	25-34 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3		25-34	6/23/2009 1:23:20 PM	I began taking this drug at the age of 19 for acne and birth control. I'm 26 now, and I just stopped taking it in favor of Loestrin. It hadn't caused me many problems (weight gain, but that is likely my fault). I did Accutane to help with my acne; Ortho Tri-Lo never helped. However, I have never been pregnant, so I give it highest effectiveness points. I switched because about 2 months ago I started having two periods a month (the abnormal one was usually lighter). My gyno suggested Loestrin because my body might have simply changed from when I first started the Pill. I've not experienced any problems on Loestrin, but I certainly did have a good 7 year run with Ortho Tri Lo.
Birth Control	christichicc, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	6/17/2009 11:27:27 AM	This worked good as a birth control, but the side effects were not worth it! I had every side effect in the book...nausea, weight gain, breast tenderness, severe moodiness, severe migraines,...it was horrible for me. And it caused me to have extremely bad cramps during my period...so bad that I wasnt able to stand up straight or move from my spot for about 36 hours. And even though I'm off the pills now, I think it gave me a cyst because I am still having sharp, stabbing pains in my lower abdominal region. My reaction was so severe to this pill they had to take me off an estrogen pill and put me on a progesterone one, which has been working well for me. 
Birth Control	jms4god, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	6/15/2009 1:09:17 PM	I am 21 and began this method of othro when i was 20, a few months before i was married. within the first month i had a ovarian cyst that ruptured and was very painful. I have had SEVERE mood swings, weight gain and have become very emotional. Its a struggle to cope with esp. being newlywed. Ive become depressed and none of my acne has gone away. I do not recommend this to anyone unless you can deal with these side effects. Im looking into other forms. Any Suggestions?
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	melissa_wtx, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	4	Female	25-34	6/13/2009 1:35:58 PM	I just barely started taking Ortho Lo....on my third week and i have been going real heavy on my period for 2 weeks now. Is this normal. However, its working really good with my moods and no depression whatsoever! Last month, DR put me on Yaz. But I was having bad mood swings and very depressed so now I am taking Ortho Lo. My concern is that I'm still on my period with bad cramps. How long does it take to start working?
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/8/2009 11:58:03 PM	Was on the Lo for over a year. It was my very first experience with birth control, and I loved it!  A few side effects in the early months of use, then decreased with use.  I recently switched to a &quot;full dose&quot; brand because it was cheaper...and I've been gaining weight very easily.  Definatly SWITCHING BACK to my Lo, because I love it!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/6/2009 2:01:33 AM	LOVE IT! Would recomend it to anyone. Regular dose BC make me sick. I have been on like 4 different BC's and I like this one the best. NO side effects at all. I know everyone is different but for me this was the best!

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/3/2009 10:04:51 AM	I have been on Ortho for a little over two years now. I have never had a bad reaction to the drug. It has made my periods consistent and less painful. I tried Yaz about a year ago, and I personally did not like it. I became depressed, my period was very off and I got worse acne than I had before. Of course, all these medications will work differently for each person. But I have had a great experience with Ortho. I would definitely recommend it to others.
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	5/27/2009 6:02:43 PM	I started this BC to treat painful periods and mood swings.  It has helped with neither and I have experience bad side effects. I had brown discharge everyday starting the first week I started the pill. I have had headaches almost everyday, become very lethargic and have no sex drive or desire to do anything.  Has made me somewhat depressed and increased my appetite greatly. I gained 4pounds in just 2 weeks. It has not been effective at decreasing my cramps during my period.  Although I have only been on this BC for a month, I've had too many bad side effects to continue taking it.  I DON'T RECCOMEND THIS DRUG!!!
Other	pines82, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	5/20/2009 1:23:25 PM	Like other people I have very mixed feelings about the medication.I have been on it for 1 year and its great when it comes to regulating my cycle.It comes exact every 28 days,and the flow is light.The problems that I feel are pregnancy like symptoms such as having nausea,tender breast,highten sense of smell.It also gives me very heavy bloated feeling a week or two before getting my cycle. But other than that the pill has not failed on me.I was going to try something else but I think I will stick with this medication (:
Birth Control	delilah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/6/2009 7:21:36 AM	This pill had made me sick to my stomach everyday! On the other hand it has worked very well in maintaining my cycle and the lenghth i have it. 
Birth Control	Candygirl3681, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	5/3/2009 5:05:39 PM	I have been on Ortho Lo for about two weeks now and so far my period has been spotty and light.  The first week I was getting a brown, mucous discharge.  Then after that stopped my period started.  I have been having a little abdominal pain nothing severe. I was on Yaz before this which was working fine but my doctor no longer gives that one away for free.  Yaz and Ortho as you know is pretty expensive even with insurance.  The worst side effects that I have read here today have been from people who started it and stopped or switched from other birth control.  I hope I have good things to tell you at the end of this cycle.
Birth Control	eleveneleven, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	13-18	4/21/2009 2:12:11 PM	I started on this pill about four months ago. I was nauseous the first couple days of taking it and extremely moody for about two weeks. My period was regular the first month, but the second it lasted two weeks. The third month it was normal, but yesterday I got brown discharge (about a week before I should get my period). I don't know what else this could be caused by than the pill - my boyfriend and I are completely faithful to each other and have never had intercourse with anyone else, so I know it's not an STD. This pill also killed my sex drive. I'm considering switching but don't want to deal with the inconvenience of having to use condoms again during the switch.This pill didn't clear up my acne either.
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	4/21/2009 10:49:48 AM	I've noticed that I rarely ever get cramps like I used to. They would be so bad I would get physically sick and this pill has changed the length of my period to only about 2-3 of bleeding and I don't have to take rarely any pain killers for cramping. I don't use this pill for the actual birth control concept I just use it to treat my horrible periods. I have noticed though, my breasts are tender a lot more and I feel like I'm irritated through most of the month rather than the week before I get my period. It's nice to know when I'm supposed to get my period rather than guessing if it's going to come a week early or if it's going to be 2 weeks late. Overall though, I highly recommend this pill especially if you're a first time birth control pill user. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	4/7/2009 8:08:59 PM	This med worked for me a couple of years ago, then i switched to a generic version of ortho tri cyclen, switched back again (years later) and have had nothing but problems. I've had headaches, excessive cramping during my periods and swelling (mostly my feet). I've also experienced knee joint pain and numbness and tingly feelings in my fingertips and toes (less frequent). I do not recommend this medication. I've stopped taking it and its been about a week and I haven't seen a change in my feet yet. But I have heard that you should wait a few months for &quot;normalizing&quot;.
Birth Control	mlhagen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	3/17/2009 11:52:07 PM	I loved this drug before i had kids. but now i keep swelling, mu brests hurt, and i'm spotting Every month!I have been taking it since my daughtor was born in feb 07. It's very irritating and i hope to find a birth control that works like it's supposed to.
Birth Control	orthotricyclenlovsyasmin, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	2/18/2009 8:24:46 PM	No symptoms of PMS, did not really gain weight. But I experienced spotting on my third month of use and am considering switching to Yasmin because I heard it clears up your skin really well. 
Birth Control	mguven84, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/11/2009 8:59:34 PM	if you have headaches BE CAREFUL.  I had migraines where i would see &quot;light strobes&quot;, I went to a head/neck specialist and told me to immediately stop taking this pill, because it increases the risk of strokes, and it could have been impacting me.

Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	2/27/2009 1:40:20 AM	I've been taking this for 2 months now and it's worked wonders on my period, but recently I've experience numbness and cramping in my left arm and leg, and weird sensations on the elft side of my head. Has anyone else had this?? I'm worried about the possibility of stroke. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/26/2009 12:37:21 AM	I've been on this pill for over 2 1/2 years now and its wonderful. I experience shorter &amp; lighter periods, no acne, no changes in mood, and no weight gain. My doctor had suggested I take Loestrin at one point because she discovered a small cyst on one of my ovaries but that pill was the worst. I felt nauseous day &amp; night for 10 days straight. I stopped taking the pill and went back to Ortho Tricyclen Lo.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/25/2009 8:00:56 PM	I started taking Ortho Lo after trying 4 other low dose birth control pills that either gave me headaches, chronic UTIs, moodiness, etc.  Ortho Lo was the only pill that I have not noticed any unwanted side effects from.  I have been taking birth control for over 7 years now and the Ortho Lo specifically for about 3.  I would recommend trying this pill if others have not worked well for you.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	1/9/2009 1:47:04 PM	I have been using this BC for 2 years now. Everything is always consistant and I dont have to worry about a thing. I would recomend this to others. My friends saw my ease in using this and decided to start as well, and they have had no problem. :)**Note ouur age range is 15-18. I personally am 16.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	12/24/2008 12:27:59 AM	I was on this BC for three months, I'm a happy person and rarely cried, but weeks into starting this BC, I cried at the slightest thing my boyfriend said, and was so moody that I switched to a different BC.
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	12/23/2008 2:24:22 PM	I took OTC-Lo for about 4-5 years. July 2008 was my last month taking it, so I've been off of it since August. Now it's December, and I've been having back/side/abdominal pains in my left side since the end of October. I went to the doctor, gyno, and even had an ultrasound. My blood is fine, my urine sample was fine, I don't have a UTI, and my pap smear results were fine. The ultrasound revealed that I have poly-cystic ovarian condition which is little cysts within the ovaries. The pain comes and goes, and sometimes I don't even feel it. And it also moves around, and it's only a minor pain. Has anyone else experienced this after going off of OTC-Lo?
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	12/11/2008 9:07:54 PM	I was on this for 3 months and had 2 full periods each month.  I also had serious cramps in the AM which made my stomach hurt/uncomfortable.  I felt dried up sexually as well.  I have tried numerous BC's and still cannot find one that works for me :(
Birth Control	mylesj24, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	12/7/2008 11:31:09 AM	I have been taking it for 6 months now and I was scared to death to take it because of all the horrible things i kept reading about what people were saying but i am totally satisfied with it and i think all those people that had problems with it just have other problems to begin with. I am 27 and i would tell anyone that asked me that they should try it.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	19-24	11/20/2008 6:25:12 PM	I've been on OTC-Lo for nearly three years now. For the most part, everything went fine, but during the last two months, I don't think I've stopped bleeding or spotting for more than a couple of days at a time. It's true, I'm not great at remembering to take the pill at the right time each day (and occasionally I miss a day), but the constant bleeding is driving me nuts. I'm giving up the hormone birth controls because I can't get over the fear that all these medicines are ruining my reproductive system - and my husband and I would like to have a child one day. The old fashioned way is the least frightening. 
Birth Control	smj, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	11/11/2008 7:03:25 PM	The first year I used OTC Lo, I did not have any side effects and I found it very easy to remember to take the pills. I stopped using it for a while and now that I have resumed using Orth Lo I am noticing more side effects. More spotting and irregularity. My doctor has told me that my liver enzimes are high. Although I am not sure if this is related to the pill, I saw someone else post that their liver enzimes were high on the pill and returned to normal after going off the pill. Has anyone else had this experience?

Thanks for any input
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/7/2008 10:52:47 AM	About 6 days after starting this medication I had what felt like gallbladder attacks.  I had my blood tested and my liver enzymes were elevated...since stopping it has gone down.  Also had my period for about 2 weeks cause of the spotting, then it happened again when I went off it.  
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/31/2008 9:36:55 AM	I was given this pill by Planned Parenthood and I began them almost immediately, I had absolutely no emotional side effects. No depression, no anxiety, nothing. I took the pill and that was it. My body didn't need to get used to them apparently. My period was regulated from month one, no spotting, no abnormal bleeding, no loss of sex drive, absolutely nothing changed at all.... EXCEPT: I got what I would call a &quot;yeast infection?&quot; Except there was no weird discharge, my vag got really dry, red, swollen and itchy and it was really uncomfortable and I stopped taking the pill and it went away. If that didn't happen I'd still be on this pill because it was great with everything else.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/27/2008 6:40:40 PM	I have been on this pill for over 4 years. I am 20 and haven't had any problems. Maybe a little weight gain. It is easy to take. I usually take it around a certain time in the morning. My acne only flares up right before. 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	13-18	10/23/2008 10:14:41 PM	I have been taking OTC Lo for nearly two months. The first month I had slight spotting, but only for about a week or so. However, about two weeks into the first month I noticed that I was having terrible mood swings. I was either angry or depressed most days and had frequent crying spells (I've never had a problem with mood swings during PMS, and I did not cry very often in the past). My mood swings have been so severe that as soon as I finish this pack of pills, I am going to switch to a different bc.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/11/2008 10:21:31 PM	I've been on OTC lo for 5 years, and it has really worked for me. I still get bloated, and experience anxiety a week before my period, but it's much better than the heavy cramps, and flow I had before. My period is always on time, but I always try to take the small pill on time. It's not for everyone, but as long as it keeps working, I'll be sticking with this lo pill for a while longer.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	9/25/2008 9:50:11 PM	I had to stop taking this medication, due to severe migraines and depression.  I had tried it once before and experienced similar unpleasant side effects within the first month.  This one just isn't for me.  I had the worst headache of my life, it was so severe, I was sick to my stomach, and we nearly went to the emergency room.  I'm sure it is effective as a birth control, and it regulated my periods, but the side effects were affecting my work, and they just aren't worth it.  I'm going to talk to my doctor and try a different type of birth control. 
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	35-44	9/22/2008 4:34:00 PM	I stop and then went back on it Im having  my cycle before the placebo begins., and it last longer. and hae cramps still
Birth Control		5	5	5			8/28/2008 2:46:23 PM	I was on this pill for years and I loved it. I had VERY regular periods (every 4 Wednesdays) that were never very painful or heavy. Unfortunately, I had to switch to the regular since I lost my health insurance and the Lo does not have a generic. The regular made me very emotional but the Lo never effected my moods.
Birth Control		4	2	2			8/11/2008 3:17:55 PM	It worked okay for the first year. Then i started feeling extremely fatigued all the time, which made school work very difficult.  i wanted to sleep liek 9-hour nights with a three hour nap in the afternoon. This pill made me very nauseated and there were plenty nights where i was up vomitting for several hours.
Painful Periods	bettyb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	8/6/2008 11:30:45 AM	I was unaware that it would make other medicine I'm on less effective.  I guess this can be said for all birth control, so just be careful and aware out there.  Easy to use, Yes. But I'm still in pain, no interest in sex, leg pain,  break threw bleeding just not happy with product.
Birth Control		4	4	1			8/5/2008 1:06:05 AM	I took this pill for one month; when the period week came along I had severe cramping, so bad I couldn't walk. The following month was filled with all kinds pains in my abdomen and lower rib cage. Turned out I developed an ovarian cyst that burst and was leaking fluid into my body cavity that was causing the pains.I'm on Sprintec now with no problems.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	8/2/2008 6:54:47 PM	I love this pill.  I didn't feel any side effects and my period was extremely regular.  The only problem is that it's kind of expensive and my insurance doesn't cover it =-/ ...but if you need birth control pills i recommend this one! 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	19-24	7/29/2008 11:36:41 PM	I was on this pill for 3 months due to heavy periods. During that time I became extremely fatigued, I stopped working out,my breast became very large, I gained 10lbs and my appetite increased. I was also spotting every day for the last two months, which I thought was normal (since it says it in the packet), until I told my Gynocologist. He said the continuous spotting meant the pill was harming my body and he switched my birth control to Loestrin. Although my periods became lighter on OTC low, the negative side effects out weighed the positive results.

Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	lisabrat22, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	7/16/2008 11:28:43 PM	I took Ortho Tri cycline for 6 years and was fine. There was no irregular bleeding, or other problems. Last year I started taking Ortho Tri Cycline Low because i thought i would try the lower dosage due to the amount of hormone for length of years on the pill- NOT A GOOD IDEA- i have spotting now for weeks before my period. I am switching back to regular OTC and hope that the spotting stops. 
Birth Control	19-24	5	4	2		19-24	7/9/2008 10:43:01 PM	I have only been taking this birth control for 2 weeks, but I am so bloated!!  I do not have an increased appetite, but I feel like I'm retaining a lot of water and it is making my stomach look so much bigger.  I really do not like this side effect and I was wondering if anyone who has been on this pill could comment on this problem.  Does this go away after a few weeks, or will it continue to be like this?  Thanks!
Birth Control	Ipanema Gurl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/8/2008 10:57:37 AM	I was on this birth control for 6 months and it worked very well for me.  The only time I had break through bleeding was when I was on an antibiotic.  That month's cycle was all screwed up so I used alternative birth control.  Otherwise, it cleared up my acne.  I stopped breaking out completely.  I highly recommend it if you have had any adverse effects from higher dose birth control (which was the case for me).  I have just decided to try a new birth control that is very similar to this one but with less period.  I will let you know how it works out...so far so good!

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	6/21/2008 6:58:12 AM	I really have mixed feelings about this one. I took the OTC for 2 1/2 years. It made my periods very light and it even cleared up my acne. I am bad at taking the pill on time every day but it never failed me. On the other hand I did gain alot of weigt and just recently it has started causing me pregnancy like symptoms. My doctor just switched me to another birth coltrol to help me deal with this problem but I am considering going back on it.
Birth Control	dixievalkyrie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/2/2008 10:44:22 PM	Very easy to take, easy to pop out of the dialpak. Obviously works preventing pregnancy, but it makes me mega hungry and I have put on 20+ lbs on this drug. To be fair, I was starting an antidepressant around the same time, which is also rumored to cause weight gain. Did wonders for my acne, though. Also have noticeable issues achieving orgasm on this drug and NEVER had a problem before-later read that certain birth controls do cause this trouble. Am more concerned with avoiding pregnancy however, so the extra effort is worthwile to me.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	autumnskye6, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	6/2/2008 5:25:20 AM	I have been on this pill nearly 1 year now.  I followed my Dr's orders and to this day, I am still not flowing right.  It seems to have made my periods worse, and the pain untolerable.  I would HIGHLY suggest finding another pill, if anyone has any better ones please let me know.  Thanks :)

In December of 06, I got a little pink plus sign after I peed on the stick! lol  Clearly didn't work for me, but I was happy while it was, as I didn't experience any negative side effects.  I still feel blessed to have a beautiful girl, so I guess it worked out in my case.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	5/3/2008 1:12:28 PM	I had didn't experience weight gain, which I know is a concern for most. However, as others mentioned I also had a problem with low sex drive. I switched to regular ortho tri cyclen and had even lower (no) sex drive. My doctor thinks I need a low estrogen monophasic pill, so I'm trying Yaz tomorrow. Will update with a review on the Yaz board. Also it took about 6 months on ortho to make my sex drive go down. At first things were fine.

My periods got better but I had extreme discomfort with the boils that were occuring every month on my arms and legs and I got pregnant!Couldn't get enough of the sex.... But now I'm giving it another shot and eventhough I still crave sex all day-my fiance' isn't complaing and it hasn't failed me yet, it's been about 7 months...so we shall see!!!
Birth Control	Sarahabee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	4/30/2008 3:42:27 PM	I have experienced a lower sex drive, to the point where that I do not want to have it at all. Is anyone else having this problem? I have been using some form of Birth control (pill form) for years &amp; had to switch to this because I needed one with a lower dose of hormones &amp; the planned parenthood that I go to stopped carrying the one I had been taking for years. I am really concerned about the lower sex drive, I have never had a problem with that in the past. Anyone with suggestions on a lower dose BC that doesn't effect my libido? thanks

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/2/2008 10:54:42 PM	I was on Ortho-Tri Cyclen Lo for 5 years and just switched to the generic this month due to $. But I loved OTC Lo, it did the job for me and had no problems with breakthrough bleeding or spotting between periods, even when I didn't take it at exactly the same time every day. I loved the pill and will def. go back if I don't like the generic, I recommend it to anyone!

Iv never had any bad side effects and I always knew the exact day I was getting my period. And even when Id miss pills it always came through for me. I would recommend this pill to anyone thats looking for a good birth control.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	1/29/2008 10:50:54 PM	While on this medication I had frequent breakthrough bleeding.  I also had a horrible allergic reaction constituting hives ALL over my body due to what my doctors decided was a &quot;bad pack.&quot;  After having the allergic reaction because of some error in the production of the pills, I switched to a different form of HC.     
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	1/29/2008 4:23:47 PM	I have been taking OT Lo for about a year and a half now and decided it's not for me anymore. It has made my periods lighter and shorter, but i have still had very painful periods, i have ovarian cysts that keep returning. Right before my period i get extrmely tired, irritable, and moody.  I have also been bleeding between periods.
Birth Control		4	4	4			1/28/2008 11:01:45 PM	I have been taking OTC-lo for almost a year. The first month I took it, I experienced stabbing pains during my period as well as very heavy bleeding. The second month I saw a difference, and I believe that now my bleeding is probably the same or a little less than it was before I started taking the pill. My cramps have improved, but most months I start bleeding the week before my period is supposed to start. This makes me worried that the birth control isn't as effective as it should be, but I always use a backup. I like being on OTC-lo and I have no problem taking it on time everyday.I'm tempted to try Yaz or another form of birth control, but I fear that I will have to deal with irregular bleeding and pain the first few months after I switch.

I've been on it 5 months, noticed a little weight gain, but other than that no other side effects.  Effective birth control.  Acne control is alright, still get breakouts at that time of the month.

Took a 4 month break, got back on it, and got terrible acne, moodiness and weight gain on my butt, breats and hips. I am switching to a lower estrogen bc pill after being back on OTC lo for 4 months
Birth Control		5	5	5			12/19/2007 9:46:43 PM	The pills are so tiny that sometimes I wonder if I actually swallowed it or if it got back washed but when I look in my glass nothing is there, so it's really easy to take.  I can't even tell that I'm taking it because I have had no side effects

My acne was not helped in the least bit and I also dealt with spotting about 2 weeks into the pack every other month. I'm trying something new now, hopefully it works out better for me.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	19-24	11/14/2007 3:32:53 PM	I was originally switched to this pill because my OB/GYN was concerned about the side effects of the standard OTC.  Well, sure enough, after taking it religiously for several months, we are pregnant with our second child.  I never missed a pill, took antibiotics, anything.  And while we are very excited to be expecting again, we weren't really planning on it to be so soon.  Our children will be 20 1/2 months apart.  I do not recommend this pill.  I hope it works better for others than it did for me.  We will be trying Yaz next!!

I've been on the pill for four years now and have had no problems with my menstrual cycle and have found it to be a very effective birth control. I just hate when I forget to take it!

I was a basket case beyond all things, which is very different from my normal PMS or mood.  Switched to Yaz, already feel better.  Not moody, very happy.

In the beginning it made me very nauseous, but after a few weeks it got better. After a while i started to have no desire for sex. I thought it was normal. I thought I could go the rest of my life without having sex, it was horrible. After I stopped taking the pill, the sex got a lot better, and more enjoyable.
