This is the first Non- narcotic medicine that she says has brought her some relief. She has been dealing with back pain for over 10 years and was just prescribed Chlorzoxazone three months ago.

Muscle Spasm	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	45-54	4/6/2010 4:24:28 PM	I have been on Soma which is also a muscle relaxant for about 7 years.  New insurance had minimum on it and doctor substituted this med to go with it.  Does not help with muscle spasms near as well as Soma.

Does not make me totally loopy. I can think and function on it--everyone is different.It alows me to walk,sit,ect.. with relaxed muscles which is half the battle of the pain.45 min is accurate to start feeling the effects.Alcohol does MAJORLY INTENSIFY the sleepy effect. Had a glass of wine and could barely keep my eyes open and it made me feel alittle dizzy (yes I only had 1 glass). I take the pil then lay down on a heating pad. After about an hour or so I can finally get to sleep.Don't take it on an empty stomach. My suggestion...grab one peice of toast. Again, everyone's different.

Muscle Spasm	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/2/2008 6:14:15 PM	I have been on this med for muscle spasms due to injury and fibromalgia.  It works wonderful and will stop the spasms with little or no (for me) side effects.  You can function much better but have to be on guard that you don't do to much since you aren't feeling anything. Safe and works.
Muscle Spasm	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	1/4/2008 10:00:25 AM	My doctor switched me to this medication because the last muscle relaxer she prescribed made me feel drunk and disoriented. This medicine doesn't, so I'm pleased in that regard. However, the medicine doesn't really take the pain in my back away, like the other one did. I've been tempted to take two pills instead of one just to see if that relieves the pain, but I'm afraid of overdosing. Not very effective.

Other		4	4	4			11/16/2007 10:42:22 AM	I was having back pain after a long day at work and it made it hard to continue my day. With the medication I can work my day through without dragging.
Other	TTDun1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	9/19/2007 12:03:38 PM	This medicine is good for me because I have a weak stomach.  So far I have not had any problems like I have with other muscle relaxers.  Seems to be good in that manner.  Not very strong though.  Only takes the edge off a little.  Definately has made me tired.  Alcohol ABSOLUTELY INTENSIFIES this side effect.  I recommend not driving while on it, especially if you're already sleepy.  My doctor gave me a really good tip...he said the medicine takes about 45 minutes to get into your system (into the blood stream), so 30 minutes after you take your dose, apply a heating pad or hot compress to the area of pain to get the medicine flowing better to where the pain is.  I have not had a chance to try this yet, but it totally makes sense.
