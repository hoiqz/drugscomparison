Birth Control	StacyDaniel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	3/14/2011 9:19:37 AM	I took the Norplant almost 20 years ago.  I gained about 30 pounds literally in one month, and continued to gain bloating to 60 pounds overweight in the first year I had the Norplant.  I also had my period and became anemic for almost the whole year.  Finally more than a year later, despite my doctors reassurance that these were &quot;temporary&quot; side effects, I had it removed.  Although previously thin, after having the norplant and its subsequent weight gain, I have never been successful in losing the weight permanently.  Today, I am 37 years old and for the past 2 years, I have had my period, quite heavy, for all but about 3 months total.  I am not sure if there is a correlation, but it took them 20 years to figure out there were permanant phyisical side effects to this contraceptive; therefore, it will probably take another 20 years for them to determine lingering menstruation problems as well.  DO NOT LET THEM TALK YOU INTO THE NORPLANT!!!!!!!  It alters permanent hormones, in my opinion.  I wish I could turn back time as this was so not worth it.  
Birth Control	Bliss, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	8/8/2010 10:08:42 PM	2nd post~  Update~  Now diagnosed with Endometriosis, Fibroids and PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome with tumors everywhere I'll be scheduled for a prophylactic total Hysterectomy.  This does not mean Endometriosis will remain gone nor does it elliviate my chance for level 10 pain throughout an average month.  The pain and suffering paired with removal of my organs and side effects don't have a price accept I continue to pay and pay monetarily and emotionaly.  Medication side effects and long term effects are really not known my the FDA when they approve a new drug.  Think long and hard about what your internal organs, time with your children &amp; family and loss of emotional trust and work are worth to you.   
Birth Control	DO NOT DO IT!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	25-34	7/7/2010 11:37:31 PM	I had the norplant put in after my son was born. I wanted to wait a few years before having more kids. I had it put in in 1999 and had it removed in 2004. After that I tried getting pregnant and was unable to. The dr. said it had nothing to do with the norplant. After 5 years of trying I finally gave up on getting pregnant. I wouldnt recommend this for anyone.
Birth Control	Bliss, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	6/10/2010 1:17:10 AM	Placed 1992 ~ removed 1994, Severe side effects, Weight gain (30 lbs in weeks), beard, moods, bleeding, painful cramps, chest pain, forgetfulness and so many others.  My Dr. spent 1 1/2 hours, instruments in hand, tring to remove it and had to cancel his day.  ~ It's 2010, I'm 38 now and I'm suffering still.  Complications I hadn't realized were hormonal and directly connected to Norplant.  Pregnenolone is 7~ that's lower than post menopausal.  Pregnenolone is the mother of the other hormones in a woman's body.  I suffer / suffered from:~infertility ~ depression ~ adnexal masses still 5 years after removal ~ over weight and eating right and working out never gets me under that original 30 lbs gain ~ cycsts ~ painful ovulation ~ extreamly painful mensus ~ extreme distention both during ovulation and mensus (10 inch waist increase happens very quickly) ~ still bearded even after laser treatment ~ - after all these years I can't believe what I've spent financially in treatment not to mention the pain and lost days of work and being a mother to a child that took me 3 years to concieve temping, OPK, charting etc.  I'm frustrated, embarassed, sad, angry, dissapointed and feel failed by the FDA and makers of Norplant.  How could you?This will never go away ~ I will suffer the rest of my life because of a product that never should have been released.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/3/2010 3:58:49 AM	I had norplant implanted after the birth of my child at 15.  I had many symptoms and had it removed within a year.  16 years later I am still having abdomen discomfort, headaches, visual disturbance, severe depression and anxiety, mood swings,and many other symptoms, I have just never felt the same and I feel norplant had everything to do with my present condition.
Birth Control	norplants are evil, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	10/9/2009 7:53:30 AM	Within a couple of months of having norplants I broke out in severe acne all over my chest and back, neck and face.  The doctor suggested that I leave the norplants in and take Dianette and antibiotics on top.  I said no and had them taken out.  I have been suffering with acne and thinning hair amongst other things ever since.  However the Doctors say that the symptoms cannot be related to Norplants 14 years later, I disagree, I know when this started and I know that there has bee something not right with my hormones ever since.  If anyone knows of any documented evidence on the long-term effect of Norplants please let me know.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	4/22/2009 12:37:29 PM	Implanted this when in college in Boston.  It came highly recommended, &quot;spotting&quot; while not on your period a &quot;rare and infrequent&quot; side effect was all that my doctor mentioned to me.  Worked great for six months, then the spotting turned to bleeding and didn't stop.  I have no insurance, Planned Parenthood has since stopped implanting or removing them.  I have bled every day for seven or eight months now.  Taking progesterone stopped it for a month, but it started again and pphd said it was too risky to keep me on the progesterone.  In the last two months the bleeding ramped up and I've been experiencing severe anxiety and depression.  I have panic attacks, I can't get out of bed, I want to kill myself.  This has never happened to me before.  I called everyone I can think of, very few people can take the implant out and those people want more than I can afford.  I called Implanon asking for suggestions or help and they said, &quot;infrequent spotting and depression are listed as side effects of the medication.&quot;  They said they were sorry but that I was aware of the risks.  I feel that I was misled and abandoned.  I am really angry about this and nobody can help me.Make sure you have an &quot;exit strategy&quot;, that someone can remove this if things go wrong.
