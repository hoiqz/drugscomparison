Chronic Heart Failure	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	65-74	2/11/2012 12:26:29 PM	I have a history of congestive heart failure.  After my second bypass surgery, I experienced severe neusea for 10 weeks, was very weak and lost 27 pounds.  My cardiologist first directed I see a gastrointerologist, then suggested a psychiatrist (which upset me greatly).  I stopped taking the Altace he had prescribed following my surgery and began feeling better within a couple of days and was fine after a week.  In subsequent conversations with other heart surgery patients, I found neusua was a common complaint of patients prescribed Altace.  I also changed cardiologists.

At that time EF was 25%. I began taking 2.5 mg generic Altace (ramipril)once a day at that time along with carvedilol/Coreg 2X a day, 3.125 mg each dose. After four months the ECHO showed an EF of 45%. I'm extremely happy with this progress. No noticeable side effects with the Altace. At first, some dizziness when standing up after sitting which is normal. I have no complaints about this medication.

I was a 58 yr old male and a Type II diabetic for over 25 years.  The drug did drop my BP about 10 points and there is no way to know whether it prevented any Kidney issues.  My kidneys have been OK for years and are still OK.  One side effect after taking the drug for 4 years was a chronic cough which stopped when I switched to a drug named COZAR

It got so bad that I had an MRI and went to PT before I found out accidently that my joint pain went away on the day I forgot to take my BP meds. I had to have my PMD change my meds.  Also, I had a decrease in energy and took a lot of naps on the weekends.  Low level of energy, didn't want to do much.  Seems these are common but not well known side effects.  I had to do some research to find this out. Interesting! I just thought it was menapause!  It was not!

During  the first 2 months on the medication, I experienced occasional dry cough that didn't bother me.  Then I got the flu last year (Nov 08) and since then, my cough after taking Altace daily, has worstened and occurs mostly at night.  My PMD advised me to stop the med for 4 days to see if the cough subsided. It did. I started back on the Altace and the cough returned.  I use lozenges at night which help only slightly.  During the day now I am frequently clearing my throat as if I have post nasal drip which I have never experienced before being on this med. I will ask my cardiologist to reduce my dose to 1.25mg, then see if the symptoms persist.  This medication has been a Godsend as far as my cardiomyopathy is concerned, along with Toprol XL, and my pacemaker, I now have more energy, and feel so much better than I have felt in a long time.  The cardiac problem was not diagnosed until my Primary physician recommended a consult because my symptoms were thought to be related to MS, which was diagnosed 6 years ago. Probably both conditions existed simultaneously for several years (I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse more than 20years ago). I feel blessed and am ever greatful to all of my physicians because they saved my life.  I want to reap the benefits of Ace Inhibitors but if the symptoms persist, I will have to change meds.  The cough frightens me because it is spasmotic, so much so that I'm afraid that this causes more problems for my heart. God Bless all of us who are trying to be patient with taking this medication.....Namaste

I was on another BP medication and I felt tired and gained weight. I switched to Altace in February and have lost the 14 pounds I gained, my energy is back and most important.  My blood pressure is 120/80.  I take 5 mg. once a day (before bed). I feel great!
High Blood Pressure	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	35-44	9/30/2008 2:58:23 PM	I have been using Altace for a few years. It worked on bringing my BP down to a safe level. I was at the low end of high. After reading the other reviews, I now believe that the itching I have on my lower legs may be a side effect. I take a Zyrtec once every 4-5 days and stops the itching. I also have the dry cough mostly at night. I also have decreased sexual desire(I'm 43) but I don't see this mentioned in any other reviews so I can't say gthat it has anything to do with Altace. I think I'm going to talk with my doctor and try something else to see if the side effects will go away.

I have been using this med for over 4 year's. I am very satisfied with it. At the age of 54 I went tru quadruple bypass surgery. The medicine does a very good job of controling my blood pressure, with few side effects. Some worse than other's, Since the bypass surgery and the damage done by a heart attack. I have a drowsiness problem and e.d. problems.One of the main problems I have is the expence of the med. Since I had to retire after the operation an heart damage I am on a limited income, who has to have this med and have to do without other thing's to stay on it. Since losing my job, I have no Insurance, I do hope the drug companies soon come out with a GENERIC.

High Blood Pressure	cae, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	45-54	6/9/2008 2:23:43 AM	I started with 5 mg taken daily for blood pressure in the 150/100 range.  I was one of the 10% that developed a chronic cough and chest tightness from the coughing.  As Altace was working on regulating my blood pressure, I tolerated the cough knowing I had a follow-up appointment with my doctor in about ten days.  I then developed intense joint pain primarily in my ankles and wrists but not limited to these areas.  I went to the doctor four days before my 3 week review after starting this medication.  The doctor was unaware of joint pain as a symptom but changed my medication.  After three days, my cough has lessened but my joint pain is still severe and is only made tolerable by frequent ibuprofen tablets.  I highly recommend contacting your doctor immediately if you start to cough as the prolonged joint pain isn't worth taking a chance on!

Vertigo while driving and coughing with gagging and some nausea have been experienced.  Another side effect is a feeling of well being...perhaps being more relaxed due to decreased BP does that.

However the treatment I receive for the itchiness has not eliminated this condition.  I will ask my doctor if this is a side-effect of this drug.  Thank You very much.
