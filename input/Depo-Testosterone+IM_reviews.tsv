Was not doing a thing for me after several months 1ml every other week.  I swtiched drs, who Rxd the bio-identical substitute from a compounding pharmacy, 250ml/mg once a week, and I had tremendous results within a couple of weeks. Also, I am confident, because the bio-identical is identical to what is in the body (non synthetic) I experience no harmful or long-term side effects.  I feel fantastic again!

I have tried the topical gel route (Androgel, Testim) with average results. I have also tried using those testosterone patches (Androderm) with poor results, as the patches will easily peel off of your skin if you sweat more than the average person does. The injection route is the most effective route to go. I was easily able to get over the fear of using needles by becoming educated by my physician on the correct way to inject the drug (He guided me on how to inject the drug into the buttock region, and into the lateral area of the thigh midway between the knee region and the pelvis region). Another word of advice is knowing what correct needle and syringe combination to use. Personally, I find that using a 22 guage, 1.5 inch needle with a 3cc case syringe is the best way to go.  The bottom line is to get as educated as possible from your prescribing physician about the drug in general, and also how to CORRECTLY administer the drug.

(which worked just OK imho) I then asked about injections and he was happy to switch me to that a little over a year ago. I get 300 ml every 16 days and its a snap. My Dr.s office is a two min drive from my house and I can just walk in anytime and the nurse gives it to me. Anyway it has made a WONDERFUL difference in my well being and overall happiness in life. My engergy level is superb and I sleep better than ever now. Granted I work-out HARD 6 days a week but if I say so myself my body is more like that of a 25 yr old with lean hard muscle and very low fat. I get regular blood test to make sure all is good and contrary to what others have said I've had zero negative side effects and my &quot;gonads&quot; are the same size as ever. I believe all men age 40 and over should get their T levels tested just like PSA and if it's &quot;low&quot; search out a Dr. that is willing to work with you. IT WORTH IT!

Got a new doc and the replacement. What a difference. Agile and hostile in the best way possible. Feel like a young man again. Guys, if you're low, get it.

It was discovered after my serum testosterone levels came back at 71. Since on the Depo-Testosterone 200mg/ml Brand I feel wonderful. The only inconvenience is the close monitoring of levels. However it is rather easy to self inject.

Use of testosterone cypionate injections has been the most cost effective treatment for me.

What an immediate improvement.  For years I suffered with low testosterone levels which effected almost all aspects of my life; especially sexual performance and satisfaction.  Now, all that has changed.  I am thrilled but more importantly, my wife now smiles all the time.  Life is good.  The only down sides are, minor acne, usually on my scalp and discomfort from the injections.  The actual shot isn't too bad, but I have found that a full dose leaves me sore for three to four days.  So, to solve that problem, my RN wife now sticks me twice weekly with much smaller doses.  These smaller but more frequent doses help control the soreness and also serve to smooth out the peaks of high blood levels and low level valleys.  All factors considered, I hope I never have to stop my injections.  Trust me guys, it really is worth it.  As an extra note, the tales about the Viagra/Testosterone cocktail are absolutely true. Prior to having sex, take the pill and have your lover inject you with a fractional dose of testosterone, wait for the pill to take full effect and look out.  The results can be so powerful as to blow the wax out of your ears....thus the term Wax Job.  Try it.  You just won't believe the results.

I am a 31yr old male, and for years had suffered from low sex drive, loss of muscle/strength, unusual pain in my joints. I finally last year found out it was due to testosterone levels being quite low. I at that time weighed about 145lbs, and after taking the drug for a month I had gained 25lbs, and the pain is gone. I now weigh 180lbs which is my normal weight, I have my strength back and no longer get injured from petty tasks like lifting objects. It is a lifesaver for me truly.
