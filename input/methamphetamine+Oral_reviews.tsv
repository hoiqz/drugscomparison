Methamphetamine has nothing to do with helping people. This drug is a legal form of the street drug known as crank. The sypmtoms and diseases that meth fixes are hoaxes I think. If you're overweight then diet. Adhd in my mind is in fact just a made up disease. I could be proven wrong sure, it's only a mere opinion considering I don't have adhd. However, I know that a person does not need meth (adderall, concerta, vyvanse) to function with add or adhd. These prescription drugs and along with other drugs mask the crazy fact that induces our minds in our society today: For every illegal drug, there is a legal prescribed drug to replace it.

I didn't realize there was such a disease as ADD until 10th grade when a teacher discovered that I had an issue and ADD wasn't recognized by the medical community till later in my life. I somehow managed to graduate high school despite this problem, but in 1987 I went to my family doctors and explained to him my symptoms. He started treating me with 15mg Desoxyn and it has since changed my life. I can now function normally in society, I am socially interactive and read books without comprehension problems . I was on the 15mg tablets until they discontinued them in 1999. I am now on the 5mg tablets but from experience they don't work nearly as well as the 15mg gradumet tablets. I see all the other ADD medications made in extended release forms but not Desoxyn. Why is this? I contacted Abbott the original manufacturer of Desoxyn and was told they were working on a new time release formula. This has been going on 11 years now, the medical community needs to concentrate on the good uses of the medication and not the negative ones. I've never had a bad side effect from Desoxyn in 23 years and I can trult say it has changed my life!

I have tried numerous antidepressants most recently Celexa and while I do admit that the Celexa has stopped the suicidal thoughts it has done little more. I get out of the bed only to go to the couch. I can not make simple decisions and I am rapidly gaining weight. I lost my job and have no desire to find another. I have taken Methamphetamine on several occasions however I can't see a Doctor prescribing it for me.  When I took Methamphetamine My life make a complete turn around. I have a mental desire to get off the couch and spend the day with my family, I am happy productive member of society. I able to focus and to complete one task before starting another. I feel Normal again. When I took zoloft I felt nothing. I didn't care about anything. I was emotionless. I wish someone could tell me why when you take a medication at what point to you become TO HAPPY,TO PRODUCTIVE for society. Really I guess I am Couch Bound with a new goal weight of 500 lbs.

Desoxyn has changed my life.  It also helps tremendously with my depression.  I remember things I need to do, I can focus on tasks until they are complete.  I can also remain calm during &quot;normal&quot; stressors throughout my day, whereas before taking Desoxyn I would &quot;flip out.&quot;  I owe my life to this drug.  The only drawback I can think of is the dosage structure.  Sometimes/somedays, I require less and sometimes more but this drug is seriously monitored for potential abuse.  Therefore, I have trouble asking the doctor for a higher dosage for those &quot;just in case&quot; days when I have to take an exam or fill out a ton of paperwork and do all the finances, etc...  I don't care that much, though.  I'm thrilled to get even one per day if that be the case.  Because any dosage of this drug is better than any other drug I have tried to ease the pain of AADD.  I can't say enough about the positive nature of Desoxyn.  I feel as though I must tell people this because they tend to &quot;freak out&quot; when I tell them that I take methamphetamine.  It seems that most people this I am &quot;on drugs&quot; or &quot;high&quot; or like some kind of &quot;crack head.&quot;  To them, I say, screw you and ask them to live one day is my shoes without any meds to help with my AADD.  I know without a doubt that  people who suffer with this debilitating disease are sick and tired of it.  Give this med a try.  I did, despite my family's scrutiny, and am SO glad.

This medication has been the most effective for my symptoms, no question about it.  I have tried every concievable med and combination of meds known to man kind  for my condition, even experimental stuff .  They stoped the desoxyn and replaced it with adderall which is somewhat effective in high dosages but the side effects suck.  It makes me feel bad and very irritable...hard to get along with.  I never had this problem with the desoxyn.  I was told that they stopped making the 15 mg (desoxyn) tabs for whatever reason and in order to get the same dosage thay prescribed 270 5 mg per mo which cost over $600.  My insurance co promply said NONONO so my MD went to adderall (after 2 yrs of trying all different kinds of stuff and combos of stuff)and compared to desoxyn.....it bites.  Straterra made me way worse, even suicidal
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity		3	5	1			11/29/2007 11:37:43 PM	I lost my boyfriend, my friends, and my family's respect taking this medicine.  It is completely addictive and only worked for my symptoms for the first couple years i took it.  I've been taking it for 7 years.  You can never get enough to accomplish your day...
