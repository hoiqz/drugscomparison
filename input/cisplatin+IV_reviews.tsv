VERY sick throughout!  Lost 60 pounds in 3 months. One month after last chemo started having symptoms of MS. 4 months after chemo now has lost use of hands and arms, muscle atrophy throught body, short term memory loss, and back on a feeding tube because his throat muscles are so weak he can't swallow without aspirating. Neurologists say it is systemic nerve damage from the cisplatin and he may never recover. And now the cancer is back and he isn't strong enough to go through another chemo treatment. I would tell anyone to try another drug before they subject themselves or their loved ones to this one.

The treatment was administered thru two ports, one in my left shoulder and one directly into my stomach cavity. After six months of chemo my cancer went into remission but I have been left with a severe case of neuropathy and lymphodema. This drug combination has given me almost five years and I have to be very grateful to my doctor and his team who took very good care of me. I was very weak during the treatments for about three out of four weeks and then back for more,however I only got sick once in the six months of treatment.

Cancer Involving the Head or Neck	Tom C, 65-74 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4		65-74	3/30/2010 12:54:05 PM	Had cancerous parotid salvia gland removed(10/08) followed by 6 sessions of chemo (Cisplatin and Taxotere). Never got sick, but used Emend &amp; Anzmet the day of treatment. Also took the Emend for two days following. The steriod taken was Decaron. The cancer had spread to the chest and lung and the chemo (11/08-3/09) was successful.Eight months later the cancer returned to the neck, which was removed. Radiation of head neck followed (33 sessions). Also during this time a nodule was found in the brain. Simultaneous to the radiation I had CyberKnife of the brain done. A double dose of radiation.The fatigue, and side effects, caused by the radiation was greater than chemo, but, one month since the last radiation, I am very hopeful about the future.

The cisplatin got rid of the cancer,but the side effects ruined the quality of his life. He now lives in a long term facility.

Cancer of the Ovary	ALTM, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	8/28/2009 2:11:03 PM	My 71-year-old mother received a six-month course of treatment with cisplatin by IV and IP (port into the lower abdominal cavity) and taxol by IV for her stage III-c ovarian cancer.  Her CA 125, which was 200 pre-surgery to remove cancerous masses, dropped to 50 before cisplatin/taxol treatment and got down to 3 at the end of treatment.  She was declared cancer-free in July '08 and was determined to have a recurrence this month (August '09).Her side effects from cisplatin were nausea/vomiting (mild) and neuropathy in her hands and feet (moderate to severe).  Her finger numbness largely disappeared within six months of completing treatment; when it was active, she could not button her blouse, open a letter or write normally.  The foot neuropathy remains - she has permanent numbness in her toes and on the soles of both feet, alternating with random shooting pains that make it difficult at times for her to wear shoes or stand up for more than a few minutes at a time.  The nausea/vomiting started by the second month of treatment; the neuropathy did not come on until four months in and got much worse between her fifth and sixth (last) months of treatment.

In the years since, I hae developed peripheral neuropathy, sepcially in the feet and I am wondering if it could be a side effect from that drug.  I also received cytoxin at the same time.  Any experiences or anectodotal information would be appreciated.
