I awoke with my insides absolutely burning up.  It lasted about 30 minutes after I awoke.  It was so severe I am seeing my doctor in the morning.  As good as my results have been (my triglycerides dropped from 250 to 91) I don't know if I can continue with this medication.

No flushing but twisted feeling at times. Took only at night before bed, with other meds for choloesterol. Different country now, My Doc here says experimental drug, very expensive and the hospitals don't stock it. We will watch the ldl and trigliceride numbers, I will take Vitamin B3 if I can find it, reorder it if need to.
High Cholesterol	Trevor, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/26/2012 3:25:56 PM	Just started taking Niaspan in April 2012, my total cholesterol was 270, my bad cholesterol was 160. After taking it for 8 weeks along with oat bran, in June my total cholesterol was 202 and my bad cholesterol was 131. There is a book called the &quot;8 Week Cholesterol Cure&quot; that I recommend to everyone, and all who have followed its seguestions have received the same results as me. I will continue to take Niaspan.

I am wondering if 1.anyone has found that injuries are more easily obtained and last longer. 2. after years of being on the med, do you aquire different side effects such as a spontaneous burning in the sides of heels just under ankles, nausea sometimes with vomiting, upset stomach, pain in the bottom of feet...i think it is a helpful med as far as the numbers go. I'm just concerned that it's in some way ruining me.
High Cholesterol	moreat, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	5/16/2012 10:12:52 AM	I was on this drug for about 4 months.  Did nothing for my Cholesterol level.  Never got over the burning from the inside out, extreme redness, and itching.  I did the aspirin and benadryl - the benadryl helped some.

It is effective in reducing cholesterol.   The price is the only downside.
High Amount of Triglyceride in the Blood	35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3		35-44	3/28/2012 10:07:49 AM	I take this medicine at bedtime.  I've been fortunate not to have any side effects.  If I am &quot;flushing&quot;, it's not enough to wake me up through the night.  From my doc, I received a coupon card to help with the cost of the medication. It cuts my co-pay to $15. The card is good for 1 year.
High Cholesterol	sue, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	3/9/2012 4:27:32 PM	I cannot take any statins so I really needed to find another way to bring my ldl in line.  I started with slo-niacin-  controlled release, 1000mg/day and although my good cholesterol was up to 83 and the tryglycerides went down to 75 it wasn't enough for the LDL which was 193--so- o I got real-- found out over the counter was not great for the liver though prescrip. extended isn't as bad - I switched  to the prescrip Niaspan, gradually going to 2000mg after 2 weeks and I went back to eating old-fashioned oatmeal at least 4-5 times a week, with 2 tablespoon ground flax seed, and 2 tb maple syrup.  I use olive oil,99 percentof the time so I cut out any butter, substituted Earth Balance which I can bake with and increase fruit, esp. apples, smoothies, and go to the gym 2-3 times a week using eliptical for 45-min - 1 hour- I dropped 100 points of LDL- down to 93 in 1 month.  Total cholesterol is now 194- I am so excited, my Dr.  is excited, and I did it with out statins.  Go on line to find what foods help eliminate LDL and drink green tea.  
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	Rebel, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	3/6/2012 11:53:22 AM	Took a 500 mg dose for 3 weeks.  I developed a rash on my face that I did not immediately associate with this medication.  This past weekend, I had a &quot;flushing&quot; episode.  Flushing is not a strong enough word to use.  I thought I was having a stroke.  Out of nowhere, I felt like I was burning from the inside out.  Severe redness and swelling on my entire upper body.  Dry heaves and nausea.  My skin was very hot to the touch. Now I realize that I was having other side effects that I did not attribute to the med.  Besides the rash on my face, my eyes have been tearing uncontrollably for two weeks.  I have had pain in the soles of my feet and my ankles.  I will not take this any more ... forget the aspirin or applesauce.  If this stuff is so toxic that I need to take another medication to take this medication ... what sense does that make?  My cholesterol is about 235, I have no heart problems and there are no serious heart problems in my family history.  My doctor wanted me on statins, which I refused to take because of the potential liver issues.  This was supposed to be an alternative with none of the bad side effects.  Beginning to doubt my doctor now.

All symptoms disappeared about a week after I stopped taking Niaspan.  Two weeks later I started up again and the itching immediately returned.  I have been off this medication for several months now and my arms are Fine.  I have not seen anything in the literature about such a reaction.

High Cholesterol	jrmack, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male	65-74	10/18/2011 10:37:13 AM	I am unable to take statin drugs due to the reactions experienced. After purching this drug, I started to check the contents of the medication and compare with over the counter niacin tablets due to the extreme cost of the drug. SURPRISE! 500mg of niaspan costs almost $5.00 per tablet where 500mg of niacin over the counter in the health section costs about 5 cents a capsule. There is no difference in the chemical content of the two. Both are slow release. So, if there is no difference why pay the extreme costs for the same benefit?

My doctor has not preformed any follow-up blood work to this day. My surgery was preformed July 2010. The pill is expensive, I always experience side effects of flushing (even hours after taking)I have a a problem with skin itching that I end up scratching constantly. I have a hive type rash two inches below my right Pec,That will not go away. Yes I take the Niaspan at the end of dinner.

Low HDL Cholesterol	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	65-74	6/16/2011 9:34:56 AM	Niaspan works fairly well for me.  However, in taking 2000 mg per day, the cost of the drug is $790 for 90 days.  In the past I have taken Endur-Acin with about the same results.  Cardioligist switched me to Niaspan.  Since Endur-Acin costs $65 for 6 months, I am going back to it next month.

Low HDL Cholesterol	dcourey, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	2	3	Male	45-54	6/8/2011 8:31:16 PM	Most nights I have no problems. Some nights I flush. However, then there are the few select nights...My whole body itches like crazy. This usually occurs 4 hours after taking the medication, so the aspirin has pretty much worn off by then. I keep cortisone cream on hand at all times, and benedryl. When I was on a higher dose (1000mg nightly), I would spend the night in the bathtub (use hot water, it releases histamines that decrease itching). But it's hard to go to work the following day when you spend the night in the tub. The good news? My HDL went from 38-63.
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	Jim S., 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male		6/1/2011 8:08:58 PM	While I have not experienced severe side effects as some have, I am very disappointed to hear that this very expensive drug is,like Zetia (that I have taken for some time proir) not as effective as claimed. If the cost was five or ten cents a dose it would be one thing but the stuff is $5.00 a dose!

Started taking Niaspan and increased dosage to 2000mg over three months. Over time my HDL rose and my LDL dropped. Blood work has been excellent. My HDL has been 67-70 and my LDL has dropped from 80 to 50. Have avoided significant flushing by taking 81mg asprin 30 minutes prior to taking Niaspan. This is done before bedtime. Flushing is rare. Dr. said, &quot;give your body time to acclimate to the properties of niasin. It may take a month or so...be patient.&quot; He was right. Early on I did flush. It is uncomfortable but a strong indicator that it is roto rooting my arteries. Be PATIENT. Give it a chance to work. It may be the best artery clearing product out there.

Took 1 1000mg pill.  Within 45 minutes felt like I was on FIRE,....turned red on neck, arms, back, abdomen, ankles and feet.  Felt like 10,000 bees stinging me at one time.  This is not &quot;flushing&quot;,.......this is TORTURE !!  Stood in shower 40 minutes, then got out and laid on bed and developed SEVERE chills and shuddered for nearly 45 minutes with major chills.  Got under cover and went to sleep 2 hours.  Woke up, very nauseated and unstable.....tried to get up and balance was off..........still red all over.  Made my way downstairs and ate crackers and cheese and then got OK.  WILL NEVER TAKE ANOTHER one of these POISION (my opinion) pills in my life !!!!!!!!!  HORRIBLE experience, and from what I read in other reviews, it doesn't raise the HDL that much anyway !!!  I do NOT recommend this drug for ANYONE !!  I threw my samples away and tore up the prescription the Dr game me.  He will get a DOSE of my wrath next time I talk to him !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Been taking 1000 mg for 2 weeks. Will get up to 2000 mg. Bad hot flashes with entire body red and on fire. Extreme itching. I found if I take 2 ibuprofin and 1 benedryl 45 mins before the niaspan then that solves it. But the last couple weeks I have been so sleepy during the day. Anyone else with the sleepiness? Haven't done the blood work yet so don't know if it's working or not.

Never have flushed or itched. The secret is eating 3 heaping tablespoons of applesauce and then setting alarm for 30 min.and taking my niaspan. I eat nothing else after this and do not take additional medications with it. I have NEVER had a problem with side effects. The applesauce coats the stomach (pectin). My doctor told me about this. Never had to take aspirin with it. I hope this helps many people.

High Cholesterol	kierrah, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/2/2011 7:57:34 AM	I have heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Without meds my cholesterol is between 350-600.Liptitor brought it down to around 180, and I'm a vegan. Diet alone does almost nothing for what I have. Niaspan dropped my cholesterol to 94 total. I was on 2000 mg at the time. My liver enzymes went up so I stopped it, then slowly started taking it again. My Cholesterol jumped over 200 when I stopped the Niaspan. it has since gone back down to 148 on 500 mg, and is trending down. I have increased to 1000 mg with no issues. TO STOP THE FLUSH:There is a natural antihistamine, called Quercetin that blocks the flush. Do a Google search for it. I take 1 500 mg capsule for every 500 mg of Niaspan, at the same time. If I flush a little still I take another 500 mg of Quercetin. Within 20 minutes it is over. Most of the time i get nothing at all. I found that solution by accident on a drug rep forum. Apparently drug manufacturers know about Quercetin and how it blocks the flush, and they are working on a combination pill with Niacin and Quercetin together. it has been shown to block the flushing by 96%. Before I discovered that i could not tolerate the horrible flushing. Now it's a piece of cake. TRY IT. You can get it at any health food store or at vitacost online, which is what I use because it is so much cheaper. Soloray is the brand I use because they make 500mg capsules and they are cheap. 
Low HDL Cholesterol	Mrs. Downhome America, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/30/2011 3:40:41 AM	Took my first dose half an hour after two Benadryl and 800 mg. Motrin.  Woke up two hours later with severe burning all over my body.  Beet red everywhere.  Severe itching and burning lasted for hours. Took a sudafed to see if vasoconstriction would ease the symptoms.  Still waiting for some relief.  Used ice water baths to keep my mind.  Tachycardia also.  My cholesterol wasn't bad enough to put up with this.  I'll have to try another statin and see if I can keep from throwing this one up.

Taking at night works best but after 6 months still itching almost all day.  My arms, neck, temples, cheeks, behind ears, and top of head have red blotches that itch. Right hip is painful when walking or getting up from sitting position.  Hair moving on my head makes my scalp itch. Had to take steroids to get rid of rash.  Three different times in 6 months. Called doctor today to try and get off it. The sun and sweating make the itch intensify.  Six months is long enough for this itching to stop. Enough already!!!

After 6 weeks (500 mg) 3/10/11 - TC 236, HDL 33, LDL 153, TRG 246.  I started to take before bed with an aspirin 30 minutes prior.  There were no side effects except I had a hard time sleeping.  The last 4 weeks or so of taking 500 mg I took in the morning and I did not feel the flushing.  I have taken the 1000 mg now for a few days and so far no side effects in the morning.  I get tested again in about 6 weeks. Will repost.

I had not had the lab work yet to see if it worked to lower my cholestrol but my problem is that on Day 29 I started with pains in my abdomen, feeling bloated and a tightness in my chest which is not a side effect but I read where ulcers caused by this medication is possible. Could this medication start giving me stomach ulcers? Has anyone had this problem? Everyone speaks about the itching and flushing but I have not read about this abdominal concer. Do you think if I took it with Yougart or Milk it would help?

It worked extremely well at lowering my triglycerides and LDL.  The drug is very expensive so recently my provider, Kaiser Northern California, made a decision to no longer prescribe this medication.  They replaced it with an over-the-counter niacin product called Slo-Niacin.  Which is also extended release niacin.  I am concerned that this replacement from Niaspan to Slo-Niacin won't be as effective.  Any other Kaiser patients experience this?  Also, has anyone had any experience with Slo-Niacin?

Applesauce works good at reducing the &quot;flush&quot; when you have it with the dose. WHAT REALLY HELPS &amp; ELIMINATES IT IS...LOTS &amp; LOTS Of water/iced tea/fluids during the day!!! ENOUGH FLUIDS...TOTALLY Eliminates the &quot;flush&quot;!!!!! However, now it's either I take a double dose of Niaspan 500 mg OR Trilipix. After reviewing the reviews for Tirlipix...I choose the double dose of Niaspan!!! I will also take the PA's advice to take a regular 325 mg. Aspirin 1/2 hour BEFORE I take it...as he says it will help any &quot;flush&quot; effects. My chol=193 &amp; trig=256 as of 1/27/2011. Will repost in 3 months to let you know if this works! I've also chosen to exercise more &amp; have really gone healthier on eating. I have NO other side effects! LOTS Of fluids IS the answer to reducing if not eliminating all/most of the side effects!!! Statins &amp; the Fibrulipic or whatever acids IS NOT the way to go! NIASPAN WORKS!!! I've been on it since August of 2010.

I had complications in the begining with the hot flashes it caused but once my body adjusted it was fine.  I have learned the heard way not to take it after drinking.  The hot flashes will come back if you do take it with alcohol in your system.  However besides this niaspan has truelly improved my life.  I have been a heart patient for as long as I can remember and am only 19 but with this drug my numbers are all back in the &quot;safe zone&quot; for the first time in my life.

I took Lipitor for many years without much success. I had to cut down on Lipitor because of muscle problems in my legs..thus my cholesterol climbed even higher. After a move to a different State, I was put on Crestor 5mgs in the AM with a &quot;baby&quot; aspirin, then before bed a regular aspirin then 30 mins later 2 Niaspan ER 1,000 mg. My cholesterol is the best it has ever been in my life. It ranges in the 150 to 160's. It lowered my triglycerides to a respectable level. Also,I found out Niaspan helps clean out plaque in the arteries. After several years of trying other drugs this is the one treatment that works for me. I am very grateful to my new Doctor for this. I wasn't told to eat anything before taking Niaspan. I will try this to protect my stomach. Thank you Web MD!!

I take an aspirin and then Niaspan and find this is the only way I can take this stuff, otherwise I really suffer with burning and itching, looks like sunburn for an hour.

TREETOP APPLESAUCE has NO colorings or high fructose corn syrup in it &amp; that's what I use. I eat the applesauce about 15 minutes BEFORE I TAKE THE NIASPAN! WORKS WONDERFULLY!!!

Consequently, I haven't had the energy to run to lose the abdominal fat to improve lipids (Catch-22).Coughed really hard one day, and experienced extreme &quot;needle&quot; pain from between shoulder blades to fingertips.Very, very weird!!

After 6 weeks, experiencing severe itching and burning on ankles, legs and inner forearms. Stopped taking drug. 36 hours and still itching with same upset stomach and loss of appetite. Hopefully, these awful symptoms will disappear. Waiting for call back from doctor for a replacement. Drug probably works great but price of taking it is too much!!

I do have flushing, at worse than others. My main concern is that i am losing a lot of hair since starting this medication.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I don't know if maybe it is caused from a combination of my meds or not, but would sure like to know.  I don't go back to my heart doctor until next June, so if anyone else is having this problem, I would sure like to know.

I have also experienced quite frequent flushing which I DID NOT PRIOR TO THIS CHANGE IN APPEARANCE. I contacted Abbott who said they now produce Niaspan ER themselves rather than have the previous lab do it for them, but they say the formula HAS NOT changed. I find this hard to believe since I am a long-time user and have switched back to the unused Previous RX tabs and the same situation has reoccurred-frequent flushing w. the newer Tabs. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I have had great results using this drug over the years and cannot use Statins since they effect my liver enzymes.

My triglycerides went down from 600 to 78!  But my cholesterol went UP from 252 to 254.  I've dieted strictly with hardly any fats, then went to eating fats again, and back to hardly any fats.  It's hard for me to stay faithful continually.  I can't take statin drugs due to effect they have on my liver.  Toe and feet cramps, and especially side knee pain and muscle pains in hip are my side effects besides hot extreme flushing which makes my face and arms appear sunburned, even after taking it over a year. I take all 4 pills at evening meal, but after reading these reviews, I will start taking before bed to see if that helps.  Someone told me Niacin causes ulcers.  I think I saw that as a side effect?  Still not feeling safe taking this drug...but what to do??? 
High Cholesterol	moe, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	9/20/2010 3:12:59 PM	The first five months or so I took this drug were fine, no side effects or anything. Cholesterol was lowered, and I felt good. About three months ago, 9 months from the start of taking it, I developed a severe skin reaction. It felt like I was on fire, literally I was laying in bed sleeping one second and the next I was sitting up in bed screaming. I felt like I was sitting in a furnace, on fire. I had taken it as instructed, at night with asprin to help with the flushing. The only way I could get it to stop was to take an allergy pill, (not recommended!) and a straight cold shower for 10 minutes. I called my dr. right away, and was told that this is a normal reaction. She encouraged me to keep taking it, I made an appt. the next day. She took my arm and ran her fingernail  down my arm, and said since it didn't leave a red mark where her nail was, I shouldn't be having these problems with flushing. The on fire sensation happened twice more after taking it, and again after ten minute straight cold showers and allergy medicine, the feeling lessened. That was it for me, I quit taking it, and have yet to go back to the dr for more blood work due to no insurance right now. I can't imagine the sickness being worse than the cure. I have been told it is a harmless side effect that would lessen in time, but my problem with that is that I was on this drug with no symptoms and then all of a sudden this happens. It has not happened again since I stopped taking it, and so I will not be going back on it.

However, got extremely nauseaus tonight. Not a normal symptom for me so I know it's the Niaspan. Read all the beautiful results from other reviews and it helps me decide if this negative reaction is worth taking this drug. My doctor suggested applesauce along with the aspirin before I take the niaspan. Think I may try the applesauce. That may help with the nausea. No itching or burning. Let me know if anyone has this neausea problem.

On med for 2 months.results of lab work today were great!  My Chol went from 230 to 185 and it lowered Trig. VLDL/LDL and raised my HDL! I do occasionally have the flushing. It feels and looks like a sunburn and itches and tingles.  It is uncomfortabe but tolerable and usually lasts about 30min to 1 hr. I can't take Aspirin/anti-inflammatory because I take Coumadin (have had two open heart surgeries). I may have the flushing two times a week now.  At the beginning of treatment it was everyday. Just have to be sure to take the med with low fat meals...I take 500mg in am with cereal and low fat milk and 500mg at bedtime about 2 hours after eating.Couldn't take Crestor due to very bad pain and weakness of legs. I would say STICK WITH IT.  It will get better but you do have to monitor what you eat around the time you take the med.  If the lab results show the improvement...then I can handle this sunburn! I have changed my diet also, I work in the ER so I SNACKED alot and was to TIRED to cook when I got home from work.  Those numbers got my attention!  Oh I do splurge occasionally, but with the support of my husband, my diet has definitely improved. If you can't tolerate this med, I encourage you to continue searching for one that works for you. I've given this advice to my patients...now I have to take it.  An added bonus:  I lost 13 pounds in two months!!  Good luck everyone!!

Itching started on thighs first 2 days now on mostly on back and rashy.  Also psorassis onscalp started about a week before also started thyroid medicine a month ago  had to stop taking for scanning so don't know what the heck is going on but did have hot chocolate to drink the other day and chocolate chip cookies so wondering if otherobservers about chocolate have something not listed had reaction with apple juicewith Lipitor naseua maybe this type of food stuff triggers cholesterol side effects frommeds.? I wish the nurses and doctors would tell you some of this stuff ahead of time.They keep saying not a reaction but what is going on? Tired of paying so much to be guinea pigs. This is the 4 medication for cholesterol that I have had problems with.Lost job so this is getting expensive and not really helping so far.

I called my DR.  He told me to get off it right away.  From the sounds of it, this may have caused something in me, all he said is if it doesnt go away or gets worse, get to the Hospital right away.  Its been 5 days and im still numb.  If it doesnt go away in the next 2 days ill be off the the Hospital.  Yay Niaspan :(

Started taking Niaspan quite a few years ago, then stopped because of Flushing.  Restarted a couple of years ago, taking it at first with coated baby aspirin then was cheap and switched to 1/2 a regular aspirin at bedtime.  Dosage gradually increased to 2000 mg, almost no problems with flushing, positive results in raising my HDL.  After a year of taking aspirin with Niaspan, started having stomach problems.  No pain, but diarrhea and vomiting followed by at least 12 hr of severe fatigue.  Symptoms repeated every 2 weeks.  After many tests, an endoscopy revealed ulcers, probably caused by aspirin.  Wish Id stayed with the coated baby aspirin. Stopped aspirin and Niaspan, and symptoms disappeared.  Restarted Niaspan without aspirin, at bedtime I now take 1000 mg Niaspan with 4000 mg fish oil and a tablespoon of Metamucil.  Occasional mild flushing in the middle of the night, but perhaps related to chocolate mid evening.  Plan to try avoiding chocolate after dinner.

Stopped Gemfibrozil in Jan.2009 after many yrs (trigs were still 2256, chol 390), and started on Lovaza and Tricor. Both came down to 463 and 287, respectively, one month later, but trigs back to 497 the next month. Started Niaspan 500mg in Nov. 2009, increased to 1000mg in Jan., have MD appt in May for first results. The secret w/Niaspan for me was starting at low (500) dosage till I knew I cd handle it, taking it ONLY AT NIGHT w/apsirin (I take only a baby aspirin) so I sleep through any side effects, and NOT EATING/DRINKING anything fatty/sugary after supper/within 2 hrs. of bedtime. First few nights were very rough (on fire, itchy, very sensitive to touch) and whenever I forget and eat a late dinner/snack. I figure those side effects only occur now when I go off track so they're keeping me honest! Anxious to see/discuss my first results with MD, as well as muscle problems in back of knee, which others here have mentioned.

Twice I ate a fat snack too close to taking this med and once I was asleep, within 2 hours was awakened by severe burning feeling of the skin much like sunburn over entire body for over an hour.  Taking today at breakfast with only non-fat foods- a little light headedness after 45 minutes w/ watering/burning of the eyes.

High Cholesterol	Morthan, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	5	Male	35-44	3/28/2010 11:59:50 PM	I've been on Niaspan for about 3 months now. The first month I took 500 mg per day and the 2nd and 3rd months I've been taking 1000 mg per day.The first several days of taking 500 mg. I had no side effects at all. I was ecstatic because I was genuinely scared of possible side effects. The flushing wasn't what I was afraid of. I feared an allergic reaction. A few months before starting Niaspan I took Simvastatin for only 4 days. I had a severe allergic reaction to it that scared me quite badly. So I was very scared to do Niaspan.On the 5th night of Niaspan I experienced the flushing and it was severe. My arms started getting red and then my chest and face. I felt like I was on fire and I went in the bathroom and saw that I looked burned. I woke my wife and told her to watch me as I was afraid I was having a deadly allergic reaction that might progress. But the severe flushing went away within 20 minutes. I continued on Niaspan and never again had such a flushing experience. In 90 days I have had maybe 5 flushes but all were mild where they wouldn't interfere with me and anything I was doing. They were trivial.I am now on the 1000 mg and will soon go for a blood test. Mt original cholesterol was 258. I'm 41 years old. I am hoping that my total cholesterol will drop at least 40 points, but we'll soon see. I also just started working out again on the treadmill - 3 or 4 days per week of walking at 3.6 to 3.8 mph for 30 - 50 minutes per session. I'm going to start on the weights too. I know that working out is important.Overall I am very happy with Niaspan, but I have yet to take the blood test. If it didn't drop my cholesterol at least 40 points then I might rethink my level of satisfaction.

I cannot tolerate the combined version of these two medications due to insomnia. Total cholesterol down atleast 40% although it does fluctuate with weight. Flushing is an occasional problem, sometimes even waking me with a full body flush that looks like a severe sunburn. When this happens it may also itch, a lot. Flushing has even happened as late as 10 a.m. although then only so mildly that others notice the redness and I don't. Even with these very rare occurances I am overall very happy with this treatment and will continue to take both Niaspan an Lovestatin unless the side effects become more frequent or severe.
High Cholesterol	Frustrated!!!!!!!!!, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	2/16/2010 11:26:49 PM	Have been on Niaspan 500 mgs 2xday with one 325mg aspirin 30 minutes before the morning dose for 3 months. Blood work showed some improvement in lowering LDL and Tryglicerides, while raising HDL. I did not want to raise the level of Niaspan as I was already itching. I had some tingling of the scalp also,not much flushing. Dr. added Crestor 10mgs 1xday and after two weeks,I had to stop due to severe pain in knuckle/joint of index finger on my left hand. I experienced some swelling,throbbing and stinging pain in the joint.  I suspect gout possibly after reading reviews about Niaspan and Aspirin causing this. Will see my Dr. for a med check soon and will probably have to try another statin. I think I will have to get off the Niaspan and Aspirin. Have already tried Simvistatin and Zetia and had to stop due to side effects.
Low HDL Cholesterol	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	2/6/2010 4:17:28 PM	Started at 500mg and worked my way up to three pills per day. Must take before bed. Flushing can be intense. Net benefit is unbelievable. Almost quadrupled my good cholesterol from 16 to 60. Lowered bad cholesterol to under 100. Worth it if you can stand the side effects. If I suffered from insomnia, insomnia plus flushing would be a deal killer. Must work your way up full dosage. Under no circumstances would I take this drug in the morning unless it was Halloween and I wanted to be a tomato.

Most nights are fine but about a half a dozen time have woken up with severe burning sensation, my whole body felt like it was on fire.  I get up and husbad says that my skin is not red but I feel like I am burning alive.  I have to use a Cold cloth on my skin to help relieve the pain. I didn't realize that this could be a symptom until I read other peoples reviews.  I have called my doctor and am awaiting his call back.  I thought I was crazy because it has only happened six times in about as many months.

After 6 weeks of 1000mg, lab results showed my cholesterol went up 15 points after 3 month treatment. During this period I followed strict diet and exercise routine (4 days per week). Side effects of this drug were very severe. Burning over my entire body like a sunburn. Could not stand anything touching my skin until it subsided ( About 20 minutes. I could not take this product at night due to severe burning sensations..had to take in the morning after breakfast. Side effects were face, neck, chest flushing. Is this product safe for people to take??

Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	PTRC,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female		11/18/2009 6:19:55 PM	Been taking Niaspan for about 6 months 1000Mg at night. I was taking a 1000 in am also but had trouble with my stomach and stopped that one. I have all the things people are saying flushing tingling and burning. This I will handle being I have tried all the Satins and can not take because of liver and muscle problems. My question is does any one have Big Toe pain like gout. I have not had this until after the Niaspan for a while. Not sure if this is from niaspan. Thank you

Could this be a new wonder drug? Here is something else interesting I read about Niaspan. http://ketiva.com/Health/niaspan_the_compositio n_and_its_side_effects.html

When I started I weighed 285 lbs and now am 170 lbs. The doctor no longer considers me as suffering from lipidemia, and my lipids are well controlled.  The side effects of dry skin, itching are constant, and the flushing is now rare.

I took it for 9 days. First few nights got flushing and sweating during sleeping but wasn't bad and I did not get up. In fact I slept pretty well though the nights (better than before). Did not take aspirin only some food with it. on the seven day starting to itch on arms and felt like throwing up. Got bloating stomach and loss of appetite. Felt like being on wire all the time. When I started to throw up at my allergist's clinic, I stopped the drug and went back to Lipitor which gave me tingling on my feet and my neuro doc tested me as having neuropathy. What to do? I have to have something.I don't like the discomfort, the itching and disorientation that Niaspan gives me. Have to pick the lesser evil of the two, maybe. Will check with my primary soon.

Not to be confused with chest pain, more of a pain to the touch.  This happened on two separate occasions.  Pain lingered on for at least a week.  No other noticeable side effects.  I did have a bad experienced when combined with caffeine.

I realized that my doctor did NOT give me specific instructions for taking the drug, and I started checking. I stopped - the started again taking a lowfat snack prior to medicating. None of that worked! I take blood pressure medication Norvas, and a dirutic (spelling). I now wonder if this combination is good. Will be going back to my doctor. I cannot take Lipitor, Crestor etc. I start getting severe muscle and leg cramps.

I took with a baby aspirin, crackers and right before bed as instructed.  I woke up a couple of hours later with a hot,flushed feeling and a very rapid heart rate... thought my heart was going to beat out of my chest!  The worst part was the next morning, I woke up dizzy and stayed that way all day, felt like I could not even drive safely and nauseous as well.  I will not take again and wasted over $80 on this drug... it's not worth the side effects to me.  Will work at lowering my weight and exercising instead!

I have not noticed any other side effects. I read online that it may increase blood sugar and since my blood sugar level is elevated, I wonder if the niaspan may be contributing to that. I will ask my doctor.
Increased Triglycerides and Cholesterol	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	9/15/2009 4:31:39 AM	I have only taken this drug a total of 2 times 500 mg. The first time I mistakenly took it in the morning and felt tingly all over and tired with increased heart rate. The second time I took it was at bedtime and slept through the side effects. However, I'm choosing to discontinue the medication because my baby, who seemed to be weaning is now going back to nursing again. I'm probably one of the very few people on here who are younger and I've had to battle high cholesterol and triglycerides since I was 15. I have PCOS and one of the symptoms is elevated cholesterol. I'm also taking 2,000 mg of Glucophage and that seems to have helped my total cholesterol. However, my doctor prescribed this for my elevated triglycerides. I plan to try this again once my baby is completely weaned or if I don't become pregnant again.

I took aspirin before taking as per dr orders.  The first day I felt kind of out of sorts and generally sick.  The second dose was taken at 10:00P.M. and I went to bed.  By 11:00 P.M. I was awake, I could not get much air.  I was burning from sternum up.  We called 911 And I was diagnosed with an allergic reaction.  I was hospitalized overnight.  My Dr., My sister, and two of the nurses had experienced similar events.  I will never take this again and I will advise any that I know to stay away from this drug.

Only one episode of flushing, and that was my fault, didn't take my baby aspirin with it. I take niaspan 1000mg extended release. I take this medicine in am along with my plavix and aspirin. I am just wondering if the plavix which is already thinnning my blood is the reason I don't have any side effects from it? I also take pravastatin 80 mg. 
Low HDL Cholesterol	Bettielittle, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	55-64	8/27/2009 5:25:30 PM	I have Diabetes and along with that medication I just started Niasin and take it at bedtime. My HDL is 36% and my triglycerides and LDL are slightly below normal.  My overall Cholesterol is 107 which is below normal.  The only problem that exist for me on the medication is a minor dizziness.  So far, no other side affects and if it will raise my HDL to prevent a heart attack or stroke, a little dizziness is worth it.  I will report back in October after my next blood test.

I have had chronic hives for five years and am on Zyrtec, Singulair, Claritin daily.  On the fifth day of this medication I had my hives break through my normal meds.  I took my niaspan dose went to bed and woke up at 1AM bright red all over my body with burning pain like there was a hot iron on my whole body.  I started to feel like I was having trouble breathing.  I called 911.  The perimedics said my blood pressure dropped sharply.  I had to lay on the floor so I wouldn't pass out.  They gave me Benedryl and the burning redness disappeared.  It was not flushing -this was very painful burning.  I know what flushing is I've had hives for over five years.  I will never take it again.  My doctor denied that this was a possible reaction.  When I got to the hospital the male nurse said his wife had had a similar reaction recently and would never take it again either.  I was scared to death.  I thought I was going to die.  It was not fun.

Been on 500mg Niaspan 1ce daly at bdtime now 4 awhle(20mg Simvastatin, 25mg Atenolol, baby aspirin) Blood tsts shw it wrks wel. Flshng 'n prickly-skin snsation do all but go away in time. Had these f x only on upper body and primarily on face but with more severe episodes experienced shrtnes of breath. I found it helped alot to lay very still, breath deliberatly and have my wife place cool wet facecloths on my face. Episodes never lasted 4 more than 20min. then had no trouble going right back 2 sleep. Got p'd-off at side-effects a few yrs ago n' quit but th blood #s got worse quickly so strtd takin it again. This stuff has 2 good benefits by 'lowering LDL' and 'raising HDL'. Two birds w/ one stone!! The side-fx won't kill ya so if you can hang in there till th side-fx go away, it'l B worth it.

About a year ago I started itching just on my left arm for a couple days at a time.  Now I'm itching again.  Will stop taking Niaspan for a couple days and see if this is my problem.

He was smart enough to tell me to take a full asprin AND a Benadryl about an hour before taking Niaspan, and then to take the Niaspan right beore I jump in bed.  My worst side effect so far has been minor itching occassionally but more so the &quot;tingling&quot; feeling all over if I wake up in the middle of the night to potty.  Have not had blood test yet so do not know how effective it is yet.
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	8/1/2009 12:15:48 PM	Let me do a post script on the below bragging statement that I haven't had any side effects. I guess I jinxed myself. Been off of aspirin for four days now because of a colonscopy planned for Mon. but still taking niaspan, for four days I was still okay, until two hours ago, I started with chills, warmth and within 5 minutes felt and looked liked I had 3rd degree burn all over. Guess the aspirin does make a difference in how it effects you.  Will not take it again until I go back on the aspirin after my procedure.
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	7/30/2009 7:22:13 PM	I  have only been on this drug for two weeks. I take 1000mg Niaspan Extended Release every morning after I eat breakfast along with 81 mg. aspirin. I also take 80 mg of pravastin. I am very, very, drug sentitive and my cardiologist was so worry what it would do to me, that I had to have someone to be on stand by for reactions I might have. I was frightened to take it, but did it, believe it or not I have not had first symptom. I hope this don't jinx me, will have blood work done in two months to check on progress. I was on Vytorin, but lost job and couldn't afford it anymore. I didn't know you shouldn't eat chocolate, I eat chocolate all the time. Keep my fingers cross and hope things continue to go well.

IN THE LAST 2 WEEKS I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE TOTAL BODY SEVERE REDNESS LIKE THAT OF A SEVERE SUNBURN,EVEN MY SCALP FELT LIKE IT WAS BURNING ALONG WITH RINGING IN MY EARS AND AN ELEVATED HEART RATE . BEFORE NOW .. MY EXPERIENCE HAD BEEN UNEVENTFUL. THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE NIASPAN THAT IS NOT IN THE OVER THE COUNTER NIACIAN. IN THE PAST I TOOK OVER THE COUNTER NIACIAN AND GRADUALLY WORKED UP TO 3000 MGS A DAY..TIME RELEASED AND NEVER HAD THE REACTION TO IT, AS I AM NOW EXPERIENCING AS I AM WRITING THIS. I THINK THAT THE DRUG COMPANY THAT MAKES NIASPAN NEEDS TO GO BACK AND DO MORE STUDIES ON THIS DRUG AND FINE TUNE IT . I HAD TO HAVE CATARACT SURGERY AND HAD TO DISCONTINUE IT AND I DID NOT RE START THE OVER THE COUNTER NIACIAN. WHEN MY CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS RECENTLY EVEN THOUGH I WAS TAKING SIMVASTIN, NIASPAN WAS ADDED .  BOTTOM LINE , I AM REALLY ON THE FENCE ABOUT NIASPAN AND WONDERING IF THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE WORTH IT. ALONG WITH THE BURNING, ITCHING,INCREASED HEART RATE ,  DONT SCRATCH AS IT WILL ONLY MAKE YOUR SKIN BURN EVEN MORE.AND CHILLS WITH THIS EPISODE, HOT TO TOUCH SKIN,APPLICATION OF COLD WATER TO THE SKIN..CANT EVEN FEEL THE COLD WATER .  800 MGS. PRESCRIPTION IBUPROFEN HELPS BUT IT TAKES ABOUT 30-45 MINS TO KICK IN, DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF YOUR ALLERGIC REACTION.

I also take many other Vitamin/mineral(s) plus an asprin at these times as well.The most interesting note on reading the reviews would be about Chocolate,I have aChocolate protein shake every morning as my breakfast with no side effects.

You will build a tolerance to the flushing.  The flushing is uncomfortable but easily tolerated.

Flushing with niacin is a natural sign that you have reached a saturation level which differs across people.  Rather than take prescription strength and suffer with severe side effects--or abandon the treatment completely--buy an over-the-counter dosage and take to the verge of such symptoms (rather than being overwhelmed) several times per day.  In my case, this equates to 250mg x 4 (or 5x).  I get a very slight flush (and no itching) at those levels.  I'd take more if I could.  Also, note that the time-release version may reduce short-term side effects but damage the liver.  Read more on an informative and progressive site called doctormyself.com.  - Joe P.

Flush was minimal, even if I had a few drinks before hand. But at 2am this morning woke up on fire! burning/itching/red skin like sunburn. I had eaten a Heath bar and a couple oreo cookies right before i took it. Read here that chocolate or coco butter will intensify flushing. That is an understatement! DO NOT EAT ANY FORM OF CHOCOLATE TOO SOON BEFORE OR AFTER YOU TAKE THE MED! Will NEVER do that again! Think I am going to go to urgent care now to see if I can get a shot to stop this, its almost unbearable.

Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Male	65-74	6/15/2009 9:15:24 AM	I have been taking Niaspan for at least a year. During the past several weeks, I developed an awful itch and burning sensation. The itch was so bad I had to go to the emergency room. The itch affected my entire body with a primary area being my feet and lower legs. I took hot baths that helped some; yet, the itch was intense. The medication prescribed by the emergency room doctor helped. Yet, I began to eliminate the possible causes of the itch and stopped taking Niaspan. Then, I started taking Niaspan again. The itch, burning and needle sensations began. So, last night I could not sleep due to the itch and burning. I searched Niaspan as the first medication and other persons described what I experienced.

I had borderline high total cholesterol and my HDL was always too low.  I am now safely in the norms on my tests.  I initially had a few episodes of flushing, with the most severe brought on by eating a bunch of chocolate candy prior to taking my Niaspan.  I always used to take my aspirin 30 minutes prior to taking the Niaspan, but now I take them at the same time and I never have flushing anymore.  It seems that you develop a tolerance or resistance to the flushing over time.  As long as your flushing is not unbearable, hang with it, it gets better.

It was ok with Vytorin ( three years) but with Zocor upset stomach, tingling, cramps,and of course burning. I don,t know if it's the Zocor mix or not. I did not have this problem with Vytorin.

I took the asprin at 8;30 with a applesauce. Waited until 9pm to take the niaspan 500 mg. I think I was awake more so because I was waiting for something drastic to happen from all the negitive reviews on here. About 4 am when I awoke I felt as though I had a sunburn on my face, I got up took another asprin figurine the other one was out of my system by then the flushing lasted about 20 minutes and was gone. Nothing I couldnt handle, I thought about putting on a cold wash cloth but wanted to see just what I was in for. Well that was it! Tonight night 2 hopefully it won't be any worse than that. And I woke up for work feeling good not sluggish.

Have experienced very severe burning sensation in feet and severe pins and needles in feet and hands, as well as very dried-out skin from feet to knees. After six months of this agony, I am stopping the Niaspan with Doctor's approval to see if the side effects will eventually stop. The burning feet have me feeling almost disabled, and the benefits (my numbers are all improved) simply cannot be worth the pain.

The first night I had a flush feeling which lasted 8 minutes, mostly felt in the scalp. The next 13 days no reaction. Then on the 14th day I had a reaction of harsh flushing in my face from the eyes down into my chest and both arms.  My lips grew very dry and numb, my sinuses became blocked and I felt like my toung was swollen.  It became hard to get a deep breath.  I had taken the niaspan, 20 minutes later I took 1 Senokot stool softener about 15 minutes later I ate a banana.  I began having the reaction within 5 minutes of finishing the banana.  I am not sure if the stool softner caused the reaction or the banana. the reaction lasted about 2 hours.

I take this once a day at bedtime.  I found it was very important to take a regular aspirin a 1/2 hour bedfore and to take the Niaspan with food.  Without the aspirin or when taken on an empty stomach I would have flushing and hot flashes.
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	HB, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	5/8/2009 10:36:57 PM	Just started Niaspan 500mg 4 weeks ago (I can't take statins due to adverse reactions).  I have had problems with flushing  only 3 times but each time it was proceeded by a feeling like thousands of bees are stinging me...this stinging feeling lasts anywhere from 10 min to 45 minutes. I do take aspirin 30 minutes prior and also take the niacin  on a full stomach. Don't know why this reaction doesn't happen every time I take the niacin (maybe the niacin is not standardized properly and some pills may have a slightly higher dose than they should--maybe poor quality control at the manufacturer?)...could it be made in China???  Was wondering if anyone else gets the stinging feeling.  As far as how this is working to lower my cholesterol levels, I will have to wait and see...haven't had any follow up blood work yet.  Hope this works!

Low HDL Cholesterol	zacman, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	65-74	4/1/2009 1:59:13 PM	This is actually not a review - yet.  I am posting to see what other users may think about a recommended usage for this drug.  I have total cholesterol of 170, Trig at 93, vldl at 19, ldl 115 and hdl of 36 with a hdl ratio of 4.7.   I got total cholesterol down to 170 with exercise and some diet modification.  But I have never been able to get hdl to the recommended range.   With the prospects of some of the side effects reported here, should I start taking this drug as recommended for the hdl issue, or are there other ways to address this? If I am supposed to post this question elsewhere, please advise. Thanks to all. Note, I had to click on stars in order to post, so used one star even tho I have not yet started the prescription.

I am also on Coreg and COQ10.  I found that if I left at least two hours between when I took the coreg and COQ10 and the niaspan that I stopped having the problem with flushing.

After Niaspan: T-Chol 181, Trig 150, LDL 100, HDL 52.I've taken 3000 mg Niaspan daily, at bedtime, for over 3 years now. This is the highest therapeutic dose recommended. Side effects include flushing and itching, and occational tightening of tendens behind knees. Niaspan should only be taken at bed time as the liver produces cholesterol during the sleep cycle. The other benefit is that the flushing and itching is significantly reduced or eliminated during sleep. The flushing never really bothered me too much... at least not to the point that I ever thought about discontinuing Niaspan.My triglicerides can fluctuate upwards of 300 at times, which I attibute 100% to alcohol and sweet mixers. Cutting out alcohol and sugar drops my Triglicerides down to 150. If flushing and itching are your only side effects, I highly recommend sticking with Niaspan as the flushing and itching will subside. Start with a low dose and build up tollerence before increasing dose.I had taken niacin a number of times years earlier, so I knew about the flushing and itching in advance of starting Niaspan. Niaspan side effects are nothing in comparison to immediate release niacin. I rarely get any flushing or itching now... and not a big deal when I do. I just expose my skin to the air and go back to sleep. I've tried verious statins over a 7 year period and none of them lowered my cholesterol to the level that Niaspan did. And Niaspan side effects are nothing compared to the side effects statins cause.In summary... Niaspan has given me the best results for high cholesterol treatment... far better than statins... with the least side effects for the treatment of cholesterol.Best of luck.

Other	bgp, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	2/16/2009 11:30:45 AM	My cholesterol has never been real high but I have a strong family history of heart disease.  (Blood tests have shown that I did inherit that genetic predisposition.)  I am a woman and I was in my 50's when I finally found a doctor that listened.  He did some tests (stress test) and I was diagnosed with peripheral vascular disease.  I had an angiogram and it showed that I already had several blockages.   The cardiologist said that I had the arteries of a 70 year old man. Several years before all of that, I started taking  OTC time-release niacin on my own.  I started with 500 mg and over a 3 or 4 year period, increased it to 2000 mg.  I  had &quot;flushing&quot; occasionally and still do but nothing like I have heard from other people.  Any flushing I have is very mild and only lasts about 10 minutes. I think this is probably because I started on such a low dosage and increased the dosage over several years. The cardiologist wanted me to switch to niaspan and take 3000mg  a day.  That is when he told me not to eat chocolate within 2 hours of taking it and to take it with an Alka-Seltzer (the original), which contains aspirin.   It turns out the 3000 mg causes other problems so I am back to 2000.

Not too bad, have  heart disease in family, have 2 mild leaking heart valves.  Docs want to increase hdl to over 40 and ldl to under 100.  Been on fishoil (Lovaza) prescibed 2 1gm 2 times a day,  1/12/09  total chol 161, ldl 110 (still) trig 84 and hdl is 34.  Slight improvement.  Over a year ago my HDL was in the low 20's.  Doc wants me to try this drug to help increase my HDL and lower my LDL.  Not sure if I'm going to even start.  Have irregular heartbeat on occassion as it is, plus panic attacks.  I'm also a caregiver 24/7 so am concerned about dizziness, fainting, fast heart rate, etc...  I may try an OTC smaller dosage and see how that goes first.

My dr. was very clear:  This is the best shot at saving my life.  Have heart problems on both sides of my family. Dr. was also clear about *325 mg* aspirin, NOT baby aspirin, take at night w/ applesauce.  He told me this med can actually take out the plaque in my arteries and the flush is worth it.  Got through first week on this knowledge and it's not easy, but I have kids to live for.  Flush WILL get better.  STICK WITH IT!!

I get reactions every couple of weeks.  They are severe.  The word, &quot;Flushing&quot; doesn't come close to what I experience.  Sometimes I have to have icebags placed all over.

I TAKE MINE AT BETIME WITH AN ASPIRIN AND LIGHT SNACK.  I FOUND ANY GRAPEFRUIT PRODUCTS BRING ON THE FLUSHING AND ITCHING, SO I AVOID THESE.  I BELIEVE I HAVE BUILT UP A GRADUAL TOLERANCE.  IF POSSIBLE STAY WITH THIS DRUG IT IS LIKELY A LIFE SAVER.  THE CONSISTENT HISTORY OF BLOOD WORK OVER A 5 YEAR PERIOD MADE ME A BELIVER.  IT IS AN EXPENSIVE DRUG.  BOTTOM LINE, AFTER A TOTAL OF 6+ YEARS I HAVE NOT HAD ANOTHER HEART ATTACK!

It has worked wonderfully in adjusting my HDL I am at a level my doctor never thought I would reach, but take my advise, don't eat anything with chocolate within 3 hours of taking the pills. I have tested this myself at least 4 times and I have had white cake and its fine and ice cream and sugar cookies no flushing. (yes I am a Diabetic but I cheat). great drug for me.

I followed the instructions and took it right before I went to bed with a low fat snack. Three hours later I woke up in burning pain. My entire body was tingling severaly and I felt like my body was on fire. I couldn't even stand the sheets touching my body. I was getting up to go to the bathroom because I was nauseous and when I stood up I blacked out. My wife said I hit the floor. My wife had to call for an ambulance because I was passed out. I was conscious again once the paramedics arrived. My blood pressure had dropped, my heart rate was fast, my entire body was red, I was tingling from head to toe and I still felt like I was going to burst into flames. When I arrived at the emergency room I was dehydrated. The doctor advised that many people experience this type of reaction with this medication. Over the next 24 hours I continued to feel tingling throughout my body. I will not be taking this medication again because the physical trauma is not worth it to me.

Flushing lasting longer than the month that the Dr indicated - but not too bad.  If you can tolerate the flushing this is great.
High Cholesterol	Doggerboy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	4	Male	55-64	12/15/2008 10:00:06 PM	Having been on this drug about two weeks, I can't speak to how effective it is yet or how satisfied I am cause I haven't been back for more blood tests.  One hour after my first dose I started reading these reviews and fear came over me as I waited for the hammer to drop.  Nothing happened.  I take the aspirin, eat and then take the pill.  I've had one incident of severe flushing as described by others.  It started in my ears and them moved over my whole body.  I jumped up when I realized what was happening and popped two benedryls and the episode passed within an hour.  I attribute this incident to having a high fat food day.  I had a bunch of chocolate covered almonds and then some Whoppers (malted milk balls) before my dinner.  I won't do that again.  Steer clear of a high fat diet.  No other problems so far...hoping it helps lower total cholesterol and raise my HDL.

After dealing with the side effects of the niaspan my BGL were still in the mid 300's even after cutting out 90% of my carbs for the day.  After I quit taking the niaspan my sugar levels dropped to the normal range within 3 days and I was able to start managing my diet again.  Would not take this if you are diabetic at all.

I began with 500 miligrams and gradually increased the dosage to 2,000 miligrams per day, taken before going to bed. I have had a very difficult time dealing with the flushing and itching that occured frequently.  These side effects were so severe that I had very poor sleep and became practically psychotic.  My HDL rose to 37 but it was life in hell.  I have since stoped taking the medicine and my HDL is currently 36.  If something can be developed that has less nasty side effects I would happily take it.  I am absolutely faithful in taking the rest of my medications.

Prior to starting Niaspan my HDL was 34. After 6 weeks it was raised to 37 goal= &gt;40). My overall Cholesterol is 111(&lt;200 preferred), my LDL is 61 (&lt;129 ), Triglicerides =65 (&lt;150 ). Other meds= Toprol XL, Lipitor, Zetia. Am stopping Niaspan and hoping my Cardiologist and General Physician can figure out what I need.

Taking the Niaspan Oral at this time of day minimizes the flushing I would normally experience if I took it earlier in the day.  I am usually asleep although if I do wake up within the first 3 hours (bathroom break, for example), I may feel a little &quot;residual flushing&quot; in my face and may feel somewhat warm but it never prevents me from going back to sleep.

After six months at 1000mg with no change in HDL, my Dr. upped me to 1500mg.  I go back soon to get the HDL tested again.  I have had some bad reactions to this, probably about one per month.  It starts with the flushing (sever hot flash) before sunrise, and after I get out of my morning shower the itching starts.  This is unlike any itching you could imagine, the prospect of ripping your skin off actually becomes appealing.  Conversely, after about an hour, a serene and slightly euphoric feeling settles over the derma, but its hardly worth the itching phase.I'm hoping for one of two things at my next appointment, an appreciable increase in my HDL for which I will continue treatment, or no movement so I can scrap this medication and avoid the nightly fear of the reaction as I take the med.

I gradually built up to 3000mg each night for three years now!!! GO TO SLEEP after taking this medication! Apple is good at bedtime I also noticed.  Shower helps if you get caught in the flash. I was surprised no one said anything about gas and diarrhea ... whew the ole' colon is clean in the morning. Drinking beer is NOT good for triglyeride levels, eat a low carb diet, cut out rice and pasta, eat fish, take OMEGA3 fish pills, sea salt, tomato paste all good stuff. I drink less beer now as the doctor said beer does raise HDL levels which is good. I get my exercise and get a blood draw every six months. I feel better taking this medication ... if I skip a dose I find I get rather angry and incoherant and live a lil more dangerously. The alternative of clogged arteries and dieing like my dad at the age of 58 does not appeal to me.  Best wishes for happiness and longevity. :-))
Low HDL Cholesterol	cpoo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	11/7/2008 12:11:19 AM	I was prescribed this medication for low HDL and unlike most people was able to sleep through the flushing side effect. I would, however, be dizzy, lightheaded, and faint a good portion of the next day.  Totally unable to function without having to lay down every ten minutes.  Side effects for me ruined my quality of life. Will not take ever again.

Now after 3 months on the drug nothing I have hd the flushing once since then but it goes away after about 10 minutes. my trigicerides and coloestoral have come down some total effectivness remains to be seen. Can't tkae aspirin but find that an apple helps at the outset or a peanut butter sandwich will help with the side effects.

All this the first dose, after talking to DR. started baby aspirin and for about 1 week, I was okay.  Then exactly 1 week later, still taking the baby aspirin first (30 min before), I start once again with the &quot;sunburn like&quot; reaction.  I took benadryl to counteract the Niaspan and after about 45 min, I am still itching, not burning as badly, but prickly, itchy feeling skin.  I decided I AM NEVER TAKING THIS STUFF AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!

Started at 5500mg and went to 1000 after one month. The flushing was bad at first, even taking it WITH a meal and an anti-inflammatory, but has subsided to a couple of times per week. The main complaint, side effect wise, is the itching I get most every day. It's so bad I have drawn blood, even taking Benedryl didn't help the itching. My numbers? LDL and Triglycerides went UP! HDL still low. My numbers have actually gotten worse. LDL=300+/HDL=still around 35/Triglycerides went from my normal 800-1000 to 1200. I eat only whole grain cereal for breakfast AND dinner and have a bowl of canned fruit with dinner bowl of cereal(Cheerios). I have no idea what to do. Can't take Statins as I get the &quot;rare buit dangerous side effect&quot; and Zetia seemed to help but doc thinks it is dangerous. I am up the creek I think. I didn't know other things that have been going on are side effects either(gout attacks, arrhythmia,light-headedness,sweating to chills to sweating to chills all in one minutes time, all night long. Will talk to doc about dropping this horrible drug!

Once in a blue moon I have flushing, but that is usually only when I forget to take some aspirin before taking it.

I took it at night before bed (I also drank a glass of wine around that time) &amp; occasionally I would get flushing, &amp; pin needles all over. Then a month ago I got arrhythma and intense flushing. I stopped taking it &amp; called my Doc. A week later he called me back, was unconcerned and told me to take aspirin 30 min prior to the Niaspan. Instead, I now take it with breakfast so that I am not also ingesting alcohol. Once I experienced a mild hot flash. I put down low effbecause the HDL has not risen much since I've taken it, but it is above the minimum. Is it all right to take it with a multivitamin?Thanks, Al

I have never had another problem with it. I always take it just before bed time. I drink plenty of water as I am taking it.
Low HDL Cholesterol	delucajt, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	4/17/2008 10:30:18 AM	My MD put me on this med to help raise ny HDL.  Just had a blood test and my HDL has increased while my triglycerides have been lowered to their lowest level in the past several years.  However, I am also taking fish oil and red yeast rice supplements.  The side effects have been moderate with flushing being the primary one.  I've had a couple of episodes of the burning,itching &amp; rapid heart beat.  Those nights are horrendous!  I hate to eat something right before bed so I've been trying to take ibuprofen the 1/2 hour before.  What works best is to take a PM version of the ibuprofen &amp; actually get a good night's sleep.  Did complain to doc, but she liked the blood test results too much to take me off of it for my complaints.
Slow Progression of Disease of the Arteries of the Heart		4	1	2			4/9/2008 10:35:12 AM	After taking the Niaspan for about 2 months, my total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol results were better, but my glucose gradually has risen.  I was told by pharmacist that niaspan will raise glucose levels.  I don't think it is worth it if it causes another problem.
High Cholesterol	Chelle, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	4/5/2008 8:24:21 PM	Its not the flushing sensation I have a problem with. It is the ballooning of my face and the tightness of my skin, about five hours after taking the medication that drives me crazy. I have made several attempts to talk to my doctor but can't get a response. Think I will go back to the OTC Niacin, had no problem with it.

It was very unconfortable. I switched to the  extended time release and it helped with the itching but not the hot flashes. I started taking a full dose asperin and food before taking and still had problems day and night. I stoped taking it on Feb.15th and I am still having hot flashes! Is that normal? I can nottell you if it helped with the colesteral since I could not stick with it. My test on 2/8 was still heigh with total colesteral at 270. 
High Cholesterol	drfuzz, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	3/18/2008 2:16:12 AM	I am a medical professional and have prescribed this medication for many of my patients. The chief complaint with niacin is the flushing and itching. I began taking 250mg. at night and after the first dose noted a slight cardiac arrythmia, irregular heart beat. This happened with each dose and worsened until one night I thought I needed to call an ambulance it was so bad. I am wondering if a cardiac arrythmia could be the cause of the complaints of lightheadedness I am reading in the reviews. My suggestion, since this drug has not been on the market long, is to be very careful about taking it. I won't be taking it again and have had no arrythmia since stopping the drug. I am a healthy, active 60 year old of normal weight with no history of heart disease. If you get lightheaded check your pulse in your neck and if irregular contact your physician immediately and stop the niacin.

Used aspirin as directed and had only periodic bouts of flushing.  After 3 months went to 1000mg - trying to boost &quot;good&quot; cholesterol.  Overall seemed to go okay, but notices more bouts of flushing along with more upset stomach, diahrea, and some sleeping problems.  Dr. recently boosted to 1500 mg and flushing is more frequent and more severe as are stomach problems.  Very little improvement in HDL level.  I'm about to dump this drug.

Has greatly lowered triglycerides, when all else has failed.  I have had a few hot flashes in the night, but with an asprin at night in ususally ok.  I found when I do have an episode an allergy pill seems to work - not sure why?

I only took one dose and had extreme flushing and itching of the arms and a rash on my arms.  THis was after 2 hours taking the drug and then after this subsided I had chills for another 30 minutes.  It was a scary experience and my tryglycerides are not that high.  I will try an alternative medicine and watch my diet better.  I didn't know that taking aspirin or ibuprofen before would help.  But, I won't try it again.

I followed my MD's advice of taking an aprin i/2 hr. before and taking it with a low fat snack at night. That is, until last night when I got a full blown episode of flushing and intense itching on my arms, chest, back and legs.  Is there something that can be done when this occurs to lessen the side effect?

High Cholesterol	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	2/25/2008 4:08:51 PM	I started taking and became hot and prickly burning sensation. Niaspan is niacin which is a vitamin in the B family.  I bought slow released niacin at the drug store ( OTC) 500mg and take a baby aspirin 1/2 hour prior and have no side effects. The slow released niacin is the same thing but without side effects. The drug company is capitalizing on a vitamin and charging a lot of money for something thats available at any health food or drug store. Try the more natural kind!

I've taken for two days and nothing happened.  I took the aspirin 1/2 hour before the Niaspan and ate a few crackers with it.  I had no flushing, no rapid heart rate, no nausea or lightheadedness.  So far so good.  I'm hopeful that this will continue.  I had one hive on my arm this morning but it could be allergies...no itching at all though.  I'll watch and wait.

I tolerated 500mg well, but had to go off the 1000mg due to side effects of severe flushing, rapid heartbeat, and lightheadedness. Merck is supposedly coming out with a no-side effect medication in replacement of niaspan this spring. I'd be willing to try that, otherwise, I won't take niaspan ever again. It was horrible.

I take other drugs like statins before bedtime that I don't mix with the niaspan. The flushing is an issue but my big gripe is being lightheaded to dizzy sometime after taking the drug. I'll have to try some other time as I can't handle the dizziness.

Low HDL Cholesterol	beachboy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	55-64	1/14/2008 6:42:51 PM	After two heart attacks and surgery for six bypass grafts, I began with 1000mg daily.  In November I had a stent implanted and my cadiologist doubled the dose to 2000mg daily.  Big mistake.  Extreme itching and prickly feeling all over from ankle to neck.  Deep scratches have drawn blood due to the itching.  Torso badly flushed and looks like a horrific sunburn.  On physician's advice, will reduce dosage by half or stop alltogether for a few days.  Then will resume at a lower and hopefully effective dose.

My ears are ringing and I am &quot;pink&quot; from head to toe and have a rather severe itching/burning sensation over my entire body. I guess this is the flushing but anything touching me makes me itch so it's good it is 2am and I'm at home and not at work because I can't wear cloths at all right now.  Wow, this is pretty bad!! Have no idea if it works yet but I'm stopping it right now.  I really don't know at this point if it has been effective so the &quot;Effective&quot; rating I selected is meaningless but I would have to say this reaction makes me &quot;Not Satisfied&quot;.

High Cholesterol	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	65-74	12/24/2007 5:33:35 PM	I have been fighting Lipid levels for twenty years. My levels have maily been off the charts. I have tried every Statin drug, and all the others. The last time I went to my cardiologist was was given another profile since I have been on 500mg of Niaspan, and 10/40 Vytorin. Here are my new results after eight months. They are unreal. My HDL 60-LDL 111-Total chlorestrol 203- Tryglicerides (sp) 111.My Doctor told me that mine was better than his. He could not believe the 70% drop. Whether it was Niaspan, or Vytorin 10/40 just don't know. I have seen my total chlorestrol over 350. I have seen my LDL near the 300 mark. I have seen my HDL at 20. With those numbers over the years I cannot figure out how my heart as not blown out of my chest amazes me.. For those who wrote in complaining of a little burning around the facial area I would suggest taking asprin, and it will helprelieve the flushing, and the lite burning.  Like I said earlier I do not actually know if the Niaspan, along with the Vytorin lowered my profile 70%.But when my Cardiologist is happy and smiling at my results, I am happy...

Having to take the aspirin before taking it is  also a difficult to remember. Wind up taking too many pills at bed time,not happy with the drug at all.

Some of my other meds cause itching and I keep hydrocortisone cream nearby. I don't want to take it, especially after reading all the posts!

I take aspirin, the med. then applesauce after a meal. I have no problems except I have experienced a fast heart rate and lightheadedness.  Could this be from the Niaspan?

In the beginning I used to get flushed and itching.  I learned that if I eat 20-30 minutes prior to taking this (nothing spicy) and take 1-2 asprin's/ibrophen ( spelling) no flushing or itching.  If I have spicy foods for dinner I make sure I wait 3 hours prior to taking the drug. Cholesterol is doing much much better.  I have been taking this drug for a little over a year.  In the beginning I had the same problems as everyone else but they have pretty much subsided.Good luck:)

This is the 3rd time my doctor has insisted I try it. This morning I had the itching and burning again - I have almost drawn blood from scratching my arms so much. I just called called the doctor and told her I refuse to take this any more. 
Low HDL Cholesterol	 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female		11/8/2007 9:24:16 PM	Been on it for 6 months and HDL only went up to 34 (was 28). It is easy to use, but be sure to take the aspirin before or you will wake up feeling like your on fire!
Low HDL Cholesterol	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	11/7/2007 11:26:33 AM	After the first three nights, I had a reaction (moderate) about 8 hrs after the third dose. After that, ever morning the same thing, times would be differant from 1 to 2 hrs differance. I stopped using this for four days, and then restarted, the first two doses went fine, the third dose gave me the same reactions as above only around 4 am (7hrs later), I will try again for another three nights to see if there is a change in reactions. If not, I will contact my physician.

I have been on med now for several months and is getting worse instead of better. Never had trouble with any of that either until i had beeen on med for 4 months. Ruins my sleep how healthy can that be

Of course when I am rubbing my ankles together and they look at me as if I were on drugs, opps, I am. Overall, this has been ok for me.

The itching discontinued after several minutes (maybe the aspirin helped?)Then it didn't occur on subsequent doses...until I forgot to take it for several days. When I began taking it again, I had severe itching and hives the first night which subsided within an hour.  We'll see what happens tomorrow...

Low HDL Cholesterol	CLP, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	10/27/2007 1:31:52 PM	I have the worst effect of all side effects listed on the warning.  Take the aspirin and eat before you take, but even that did not help me.  Be careful because with the slow release the symptoms for me kept getting worse throughout the day....seeing stars, headache, dizziness....felt like a bad day at the amusement park.  I'm trying diet and exercise now before I try another drug.

What I have learned is very important to take an aspirin 10-20 minutes before taking the Niaspan.  It has worked GREAT for me!

But if you awaken within 2 - 4 hours then the flushing, burning and itching is terrible.  I also experienced a fainting spell one night when I got up.  If you drink ANY alcohol it will greatly increase the side effects, even a small glass of wine with your evening meal.It has been too early to tell if it is lowering triglycerides.

I'd rather have heart surgery all over again than suffer with the infernal itching. My cardiologist believes the severe itching is unrelated to the Niaspan because it has occured only twice since I started taking the medication 6 months ago. I disagree. It seems to me the unbearable itching is caused by the Niaspan, together with some other unknown factor. There may be something to the &quot;spicy food&quot; connection posted by others.  Last night, I ate a bunch of hot peppers an hour or so before taking the Niaspan. I woke at 3 am, with a tolerable hot wave, followed by the dreaded itching. Pure torment! My chest, back and legs were bright red. A cold (very cold) shower helped a little.  (The only thing worse than a cold cold shower is the itching from Hell). On the first occasion, two months ago, Benedril helpped some, but relief did not begin for over an hour after taking it. (Take at least two tablets!) But last night, I didn't mess around with Benedril. Instead, I took two codine tablets I had left over from surgery. Relief! If you are suffering from this terrible side-effect, may God be with you!
