I am a longtime type-1 diabetic with wild blood sugar swings, doctor calls me a &quot;brittle diabetic&quot; Glucerna shakes and bars have helped me get better control of my glucose levels. I replaced both breakfast (with a shake) and lunch (with a bar) then I eat a light supper. Levels almost at a normal and I have lost weight as well. I recommend this to those with my type of diabetic issues.

It's very convenient. I normally don't eat Breakfast, and I know it's important that you do. I have had no problems with it. LOVE IT!!! Yum Yum Yum

He broke out in hives very shortly after drinking the shake.  He had to go the the emergency room to be given Pepcid, 50 mg. of Benadryl, and Solumedrol intravaneously.  He continued to take 50 mg. of Benadryl every 4 hours by mouth.  He took 75 mg. of Zantac every 12 hours.  He was given a prescription for a steroid, Prednisone, for 5 days.  Four days later he was so miserable he went back to the doctor.  He was given more Prednisone steroids for 14 days.  He was to continue the Benadryl and Zantac.  He was given a 5% cream, Clobetasol Propionate, to rub on the hives.  He was to bathe in Epsom Salts.  He was covered from head to toe solidly with the hives.  He not only itched severely, but he was in pain.

It appears to control the blood sugar level. However, my platelet count start to be less than normal. Eventually, it reach a dangerous level - 80 (140+ is normal). After I stopped take it, two weeks later the platelets count reached 100. 6 months later it reached 132. Be very careful with this seemingly good blood sugar control. I would never touch it again.

I started again this week, one a day then 2 a day for 2 days and I have uncontrollable bowel movements with no warning.  I don't even dare to go out today, Thanksgiving. No more for me.

It was not painful but very uncomfortable. I drank Glucerna once, sometimes twice a day.  That is, until I figured out what was causing this horrible flatulence.
