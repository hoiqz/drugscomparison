Rheumatoid Arthritis	old lady!, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	12/26/2008 12:13:25 PM	Having had RA for 58 of my last 60 years, I have had serious progression of this problem within the last 5 years.    I just had an injection and the impact of it has been almost miraculous at this time. I, of course, have had many, many injections through the years.  Each time it has been of great benefit.  I am preparing to begin Orencia, because other than this most recent injection, nothing else has helped.

I was unable to sit, stand, or walk. Pain medication would hardly work. I've had a series of 2 epidural shots, and I'm walking, sitting, and back to some normalcy. It works for me.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	12/28/2007 11:23:43 AM	I have recently developed arthritis in my left knee, it was very painful to the extent I couldn't walk or stand when I got up in the mornings. We (doctor &amp; me) tried a few NSAIDs drugs, but they provided no relief. I will use this treatment until it no longer provides the relief I want.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	12/14/2007 3:17:24 PM	After a cortisone injection in my spine the only thing it did for me is to cause increased pain and it didn't do a thing to alleviate the problem I was having.Also. for those that may undergo this injection please note tat it is a bit painful probably d/t the viscosity of the drug.
