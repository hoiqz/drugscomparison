She has not has any side effects of this medication.  Family felt she did not need the medication and the dosage was decreased dramatically.  In two days the client's behaviors have increased. Refusing cares and increased agitation.  Sometimes we don't know how well a drug is working until the dosage is lowered or discontinued.  For this client the medication works very well.

I am requesting my Dr. to take me off as the side effects are very severe... I would rather suffer the consequences of Alzheimer disease then live by feeling sick with severe flu symptoms every day of my remaining life.

They are maintenance medications; improvements in a loved one's symptoms are not expected but slowed decline in functionality is the goal. My Aunt will be going home tomorrow from ALF on this medication to maintain her independence. All drugs have side effects but the sleepiness is likely depression that common with Alz Dementia. Keep it real and read the Alzheimer's Association literature.

We have seen no improvement or decline in her memory, but she has experienced extreme fatigue over the past few months and at month six, she had a seizure.  Since coming off the meds her energy/endurance has returned and her memory has not worsened.  She does not wish to try other treatments for dementia due to her experience with this drug.

If I eat nothing, my stomach is fine but I lose too much weight.  I feel best, but still tired, if I eat lots of water and eat unprocessed food.  Things like canned soups and frozen dinners give me nausea and stomache.  Unbelievably, greasy food like sausage and cheap frozen pizza make me feel the best.  I would like to hear food specifics from others.dw
Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Type Dementia		1	4	1			2/7/2008 11:03:45 AM	My mother was taking this drug.  She experienced nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite, severe weight loss and within 30 minutes of taking it in the morning would become EXTREMELY TIRED.  She would spend most of the day just sitting in a chair.  The final day, she wandered from the house, had no idea where she was and probably would have died had she not been found by rescue personnel.  She has not taken this drug in over 30 days now.  She is MUCH better without it.  She is up and about, participating in activities,eating meals and loving life again.  This was a HORRIBLE experience - not only for her but for the entire family.

I do feel better and see some results.(Of course never as much as we would like)  Although I notice a side effect is flatulence and that has been somewhat of a problem, especially after meals.  Am taking otc meds for that and get some relief
