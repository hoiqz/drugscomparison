Cancer Involving the Kidney Cells	photographer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/3/2012 5:47:45 PM	After having my left kidney removed in Oct 2010, spots in the lung were addressed. Started drug Jan 2012, reduced spots in lung by March but stopped reducing by end of May. White hair, lose of hair, lose of taste, diarrhea, high blood pressure, were all side effects that were tolerable.  The black spots in the vision were not. Since no further reduction to spots in the lungs, a switch to &quot;Everolimus&quot; is recommended. New side effects to look forward too!!!

On April 26, 2012, the FDA officially approved Votrient for Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcomas.Knowing that FDA approval was imminent, I began taking Votrient on April 21, 2012, for Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma in my left flank/retroperitoneal.I am a 22 year survivor of MFH sarcoma (now known as UPS), and had been on traditional chemotherapy for 8 years.  I had success with ifosfamide/adriamycin, and gemzar/taxotere.  But, my tumors mutated to grow resistant to those chemos.I have no surgical or radiation options.VOTRIENT looks like it will prolong my life!  My doctor had given me 6 months, unless I could find a drug that would work.  I tried two clinical trials.  And, now VOTRIENT!  Compared to anything I have taken, Votrient has few side-effects.I had a slight increase in blood pressure (that started on Day One).  I may have a little fatigue.  I couldn't tell you if my hair color is changing -- I have been bald for 8 years.If I have any new side-effects or changes, I will report again.Thank you, GSK and FDA (for fast-tracking the approval).

It has worked quite well on the soft tissue tumors, keeping them stable or shrinking, but not as well on the bone mets. Diarrhea did not become a problem until after the first six months. Other than hair color change, no other side effects.

A spot then developed in my left lung. This was removed by sugery. Another spot developed in my right lung and was determined to be renal cell. I began taking voltrient 800 mg and after 5 mos and 2 wks this spot was gone. I stoped taking it for 3 mos and another spot occured. I have been back on voltrient for 6 mos and this tumor has reduced by 50%. Side effects have been almost constant diarrhea and some nausa. My hair has turned white and I have noticed some thinning.d

Also have to take several relatively high dose blood pressure meds to combat the elevated blood pressure side effect.

At one point we decided to go to 600 which caused serious diarrhea. Has anyone had good results at the 400mg dose? My recent PET/CT showed previous tumors in check but 1 small new spot. I have been on Votrient for 8 mths.

Had a cancer in my right in 1999 and the kidney was removed.  In 2009 I was ct'ed for 8 months until the Pulminologist has the area between my lungs biopsed,  showed 3 clear cell lymp nodes and one renal cell cancer.  Have been going to MD Anderson for over a year and my last vist (FEB) the doctor said 2 lymp nodes had schrunk and 2 were slitley larger.  Am optimistic and believe in MD Anderson.  Keep the faith and pray to God.

When taking sutent my sugar increased, when taking afinnator my sugar increased, when I started taking this votrient my sugar decreased.  I was taking 10 mg twice a day and now I have backed off to 5 mg daily.  When I first started takng Votrient I had to close episodes with low sugar.  I've had to back off sugar medication until down to 5 mg daily and holding my own right now.  Yet I can find no reference to sugar in the list of side effects.  Do you have any?
