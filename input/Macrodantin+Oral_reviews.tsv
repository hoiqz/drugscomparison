Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	vegasvictim, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/24/2012 12:39:15 AM	I also had a cysto with biopsy and was given 7 day course to prevent UTI. I took day after surgery with mild nausea. Second day I felt like I was coming down with the flu. #rd day in bed most of the day, chills, sweating, dizziness, weakness in left leg. Intense pain started in left big toe joint, and moved to include ankle. Kept me awake all night, along with violent vomiting. No fever, so I thought I may have food poisoning or blood clot. Belly pains started same night and pulse was fast. My tongue felt slightly swollen 2nd day, but went away and came back next day. Scary scary stuff! I hope none of this is permanent or liver involved. My doctor's office said stop it immediately and called in Bactrim. I have shoulder, foot and ankle pain still. Nausea better....10 hours since last dose. BE CAREFUL with this medication and know these supposedly very rare side effects!! I somehow think they may not be as rare as maker claims. I will NEVER take this medication again. I thought I may of had a mild stroke or was getting a blood clot with the foot/ankle pain. I will ask doctor for blood tests on Wednesday follow-up visit to make sure my liver wasn't damaged. ALSO--we need to all call the FDA and report these side effects so they know how bad and common they are. Good luck everyone &amp; God Bless.

Coli Bacteria	Penny, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	4/4/2012 11:04:31 AM	I took this 5 weeks ago with success after battling chronic uti's for months and was finally infection free. I developed another uti 1 week ago and was put back on it. Within 24hrs I developed severe watery diarrhea my dr told me it would settle and to continue taking it. After 4 days it was very severe I was living on the toilet. I refused to take anymore and my dr said I was having a reaction to it. Less than 24hrs after my last dose the diarrhea intensified and turned to blood. I have now been in hospital for 3 days trying to bring the bleeding under control. My first experience was great but after this I would not recommend it to anyone. I am in agony the bleeding and diarrhea is out of control. It had gotten that bad my blood counts are dropping and the skin on my bum his peeling and falling off. Please be careful with this medication if you experience any side effects stop taking it straight away.

I hate just throwing away $100 like that but my health is more important.As for my side effects, shortly after taking one i felt like i was going to have an anxiety attack &amp; then fell asleep on the couch. When i woke up i felt like i had took a handful of xanax. I couldnt think straight, talking like im drunk, and running into walls. I am supposed to be taking 2 a day for a month but there is no way.

I feel absolutely no relief.. My stomach hurts and it constantly feels like i have cramps in my lower abdomin.  I have not thrown up but feels like it is always a possiblity. I am now concerned after reading all of these reviews that I will end up in worse condition than when I started taking it. I was ok toughing thru the side effects when I thought it might actually provide relief but now i am thinking twice about continuing on this medication. 
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	tdd, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	9/23/2011 12:25:01 AM	I took the drug 9 weeks and the doctor stopped it. I was to take it 12 weeks. I have sores in my mouth, sores on my tongue, my mouth burns, loss of taste, and I'm worried the UTIs will return because I stopped this. After reading all these reviews I'm nervous. The first week on the drug I was very sick at my stomach but that stopped after changing to taking it at bedtime. Because I'm staying closer to home I notice every ache and pain because of my inactivity. I need a 2nd knee replacement but there is no way to do this when you are having chronic infections. I'm very frustrated and not happy with the macrodantin. I don't want to take it again and I would like to get some relief in my mouth.
Urinary Tract Infection caused by Klebsiella Bacteria	The5425177, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	5/24/2011 2:04:04 PM	I have only been on Macrodantin (nitrofurantoin) for one full day. It seems to be helping w/ the UTI symptoms (pain, frequency, urgency, &quot;mishaps&quot;), but I'm noticing grogginess and weird mucus-like dicharge vaginally and rectally. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm afraid this is going to get worse, and definitely don't want to deal w/ a yeast infection that can be caused by this medicine. Who wants to trade one infection for another which is equally uncomfortable? I guess I'm asking, is it worth the side-effects, b/c I know a kidney infection is painful and hard to treat. I want to prevent my UTI from reaching that point.

MY PCP gave me this drug knowing that I have RA and elevated liver enzymes due to use of phenobarbital to control seizures. Needless to say, after reading these reviews here I'm discontinuing use. I'm just glad I only took it for 2 days. I can't believe the incompetence of my PCP!! I won't be seeing her again. I'm so sorry for all of you who have lost loved ones because of this drug.

I'm pregnant and was given this medicine to take to take care of a UTI but after the first day of dosage I started feeling lots of abdominal pain and drowsy, headaches, and chest pain. I decided to research and after reading your reviews I will no longer be putting my unborn child nor my self in any more danger. Thank you very much, again, for your comments!!!!
Urinary Tract Infection caused by Staphylococcus Aureus	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/3/2011 7:52:19 PM	I am deathly allergic to sulfa drugs and this is in all my medical info. The nurse asked if I could take Macrobid. I said as long as its not sulfa or Macrodantin, I'll try it. The pharmacist said this has some sulfa in it so to monitor it carefully. So I was given a prescription of NITROFURANTOIN MONO/MAC. From experience I always look drugs up before I take them. Good thing as this is a generic of Macrodantin. This drug can kill you if you are allergic, or have just about any illness. I'm dead if I don't reach an Emergency room within 30 minutes. Always look up the name of the drug before you take it.

I now have something similar to pneumonia brought on by consuming macro dantin for 1 1/2 yrs also.  I can barely breath, talk or have any energy.  The woman dying in ICU is so sad.  I am almost there myself.  I have a gall bladder stone operation scheduled for Monday and my lungs aren't really ready.  I have 88% oxygen and must exercise them.  I guess the pneumonia like systems are worse than the real thing.  It's a glue like substance that's in my lungs.  I was hospitalized for 3 days this week and the ER doctor figured it out.  The pulmonary doctor and surgeon all agreed.  Why isn't this documented?  And, why did my &quot;wonderful&quot; urologists not warn me of this?  My family and I are stunned.  I could be that woman dying in the ICU.  I sound awful and my breathing is labored.  Is it because I drink so much water that I am not at the point of dying like this woman?  My mother said I should participate in a &quot;class action suit&quot;.  I totally agree.  I was not warned and I should have been taken off this drug and perhaps put on another one for my recurring UTI's and bladder operations.  I also have osteo arthritis - got to wonder if this was aggravated by this drug as well.  I am in a lot of arthritis pain and now on Naproxen 1000 mg a day.  I wish I didn't have to take any pills .

Other	Older, hopefullly wiser, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	10/30/2010 6:56:25 PM	I received this drug for a possible bladder infection.  After 2 pills I was chilling, shaking uncontrolably, temp over 101.  Too sick to take pills the next day and recovered overnight, but not blaming the drug at that point, I took a 3rd pill with lunch.  Two hours later I was shaking and chilling again with temp over 102.  Vomitting was intermittent.  In the ER for 6 hours for rehydration, medicine to prevent infection, and another to stop the vomitting.  Two days later and hopefully wiser, my primary care physicial told me that I was having an allergic reaction to this drug and that the culture of my urine did not show an infection.  I am still recovering 2 weeks later.
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	10/21/2010 7:16:22 PM	I had taken Macrodantin because I was having a cystoscopy. I took 1 pill one hour prior to the cystoscopy (9am) and 1 pill 12 hours later (10pm). At 6 pm that evening I started to have joint pain in my knees and ankles. As the night moved along it got worse and the joint pain was traveling up to my back and shoulders. I thought I was coming down with the flu. I took some tylenol to try to relieve the symptoms but the pain was getting worse. I had not been able to sleep either because of the pain and the chills . At 12:30 the diarreha started. Then severe chills, fever and vomitting. My husband placed a call to the urologist that performed the cystoscopy and was told to get to the ER. I vomitted several times in the car enroute and while in the ER. I had severe pain in my body and was shaking uncontrollably and the fever was climbing. In the ER my stats showed my blood pressure has decreased to an unacceptable number (50) and my heart rate was way too high. I received  morphine and a drug to stop the vomitting. I was told I was having a severe allergic reaction to the macrodantin. The ER admitted me as a patient and I spent several days in the hospital. I don't know how this drug has remained on the market and how often it is prescribed. I hope others can learn from this including doctors.

The sore throat persisted until it became difficult to swallow. My head started aching horribly as did my neck and upper shoulder muscles. Feeling completely sick and miserable all over and decided I had the flu. Stomach cramps, watery diarrhea and dehydration. Dizziness, water retention in legs, stomach and lower abdomen cramping. Feels worse than the flu as I hurt and ache all over and still have the UTI.

Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	Henrietta, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	3/5/2010 2:12:15 PM	This drug was prescribed for UTI after Cipro didn't do the job and almost immediately the patient felt nauseous, feverish and achey. Was told by physician that she most likely had a 2ndarybug or virus. Continued taking for 5 days and began having chills and the shakes. Stopped taking and went to ER and found she was in complete liver failure.  Was admitted to hospital and treated for 48hrs with solutions to rehydrate and other antibiotics to clear the UTI. Liver enzyme levels were dangerously elevated and she almost died. Still being monitored with blood tests and rather debilitated. This drug is very dangerous and should never be prescribed.

The drug did nothing for the bladder infection so my dr. took me off of it.Three days later I was unable to breathe &amp; had to be rushed to the hospital. I was told that I almost died. I was in critical condition &amp; in ICU for 36 hours. I remained in the hospital for 5 days &amp; was told to never take this drug again because of the reaction I had. I had memory loss which is still a problem.  I have been dizzy a lot since then. I also have had a terrible ringing in my ears that the doctors can do nothing about. I am deathly afraid of this drug and any other drugs in this category.

The first time I was very nauseated but did not think it was the med.  The second time I was severely ill--vomiting for almost 4 hours.  Cold and clammy-sweats ect.  I thought I had picked up the stomache flu.  Took the pill yesterday afternoon and you guessed it-severe vomiting ect.  Seems I was sicker for a couple hours longer.  Horrible experience both times.  I won't be ever taking this again.  Two times is not a coincidence.

My OB's office prescribed this medicine to me over the phone, and in less than 48 hours (only 2 doses)the baby died.  I ended up with Kidney and liver failure, and spent several days in the ICU, and about 1 1/2 weeks total at the hospital.  I'm blessed to be alive, but BEWARE that this may not be safe if you are pregnant, despite what many OBGYNs will tell you.

In rehab I was taught to eleaviate the urin in my bladder by self catherization. Unfortunately I was prone to urinary trct infections. My Urologist put me on a daily dose of 50mg of Macrodantin. After 8 years I switched Urologists and was told I should have been taken off the Macrodantin the first year. I asked why and was told it can cause scarring of the lungs. I made an appointment with my primary Doctor for lung tests. We found my lung capacity was 50% less than 5 years prior. A CT of my lungs also showed scarring.

I think the uti is gone but i have stomach pain. i feel like i have been doing crunches over and over in my abdomen.  I have had pain in my lungs that is sharp and kept me up all night last night.  I wish I would have researched the drug more before taking it.  I have3 left in the bottle and I am scared to take them.  I am only 22. im scared from reading other reviews that I have done permanent damage to my kidneys and lungs. I would not recommend this drug to anyone.

Within hours of taking the first pill I was nauseated and had severe diarhea. I did not think the med was causing it. Within 24 hours I was in the ER. They told me to stay on Macrodantin because it was not causing these symptoms, and told me to treat the diarhea with imodium and they also gave me an anti-nausea med. I became even more ill as time went on, still taking the Macrodantin as prescribed. My husband talked to a pharmacist and he said to stop taking Macrodantin immediately until I could see my urologist.  Within 24 hours of stopping the Macrodantin the nausea slowed.  It took several days to start feeling like myself again.  I had only taken 5 pills over 2 1/2 days to get such a severe reaction! I'd rather live with the UTI!
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	lec, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/20/2009 12:28:19 AM	I have been researching another medication and now I am scared spitless to take it (fosamax).  Just to compare the process of reviews and how it could help me, I checked macrodantin, a med I have taken daily for over 20 years.  My experience has only been positive.  One pill daily has prevented the near-constant UTI's I have had since I became sexually active at age 20.  My doctors, through the years, tried all kinds of different treatments - taking a certain med only when I had sex, drinking cranberry juice (old school), etc.  Finally, at least 20 years ago, my obgyn put me on generic macrodantin and I have been virtually UTI free for all these years.  I have had no side effects.  Though, I have had knee replacement and hip replacement, I have no idea if they are related.???  I chalk that up to arthritis.  If I were stranded on a desert island, I would want this medicine with me.  I don't know if my experience is typical or not, just know it's been a good fit for me.
Bladder Infection caused by Enterobacter	captainjoan, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		6/30/2009 8:47:30 AM	(Two 911 calls from allergic reaction.) Prescription for Macrodantin from MD. That day High fever 103, severe chills, pain all over, rapid heart beat, vomiting, severe pain in stomach and right side. Drove Mom to ER and was told to continue taking Macrodantin &amp; sent home.  Later that night called 911  EMT's thought heart was the problem in ER said nothing they could do until they took vitals and admitted Mom 6 days found nothing (all test ran good) Mom was unable to walk and had severe pain in right leg.  Took one Macrodantin and Chills, Fever 101, Pain called MD that prescribed Macrodantin and I was told that not Macrodantin and to take mom to hospital again had to call 911 Mom got so bad.  Again EMT's thought it was heart and not Macrodantin (antibiotics) do not cause the fever, chills, pain, vomiting).  Doctors in ER said not the Macrodantin.  Again admitted Mom and we asked for a Specialist and the next morning got an Internist and told him about this drug and he went and LOOKED IT UP and said it could absolutely be Macrodantin.  Within 24 hours Mom was feeling better  and every day since has been improving.  Started walking again slowly.  During first trip to ER getting mom into ambulance the EMT's broke a rib on the left which was complicating issues with severe pain Mom had in abdomine.

While in intensive care there was another female that also was having liver failure that had been on Macrodantin.  Since my transplant 1-1/2 years ago, I have talked to 3 other persons that have liver damage from this drug.  I feel they drug should be removed from use.

I am in the process of some test.  It has worked taking care of the problem I have with UTI, but this cough is driving me crazy.
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	75 or over Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	3	4	2	Female		10/5/2008 11:11:39 PM	My mother has been on Macrodantin for 8 months.  After one month, I noticed a rash on her legs. Her doctor prescribed a (.05%)fluocinonide cream which didn't help.  Now she has developed a secondary fungal infection on her legs, arms, and is now a few spots on her chest.  I keep on telling the doctor's that she's having an allergic reaction to this drug (macrodantin). They all tell me no.  So I went online and one of the side effects is a rash. I want my mother off of this drug immediately before it effects her vital organs.   
Other	Sue, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	9/9/2008 7:13:50 AM	After a day and a half of taking this medication I woke up unable to move my tongue as the saliva glands underneath had swollen so badly.  The rest of the glands under my jaw followed suit, and I was in a fair bit of pain.  My whole mouth seemed to be inflamed, and I have now lost sensation in the front of my tongue (hoping this is not permanent!).  I won't be going anywhere near this stuff again.
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	JV1053, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	4	1	Female	35-44	8/16/2008 10:50:34 AM	Six years ago I used this drug and now do not have a colon.  I have been through a horrible ordeal and it has changed my life forever. I am sure that this drug is fine for some people, however I do not believe that it is worth the risk that go along with it.  I developed pseudomembranous colitis, which is uncurable and in my case resulted in the removal of my colon.  I suggest not taking this drug.  And if you do I suggest taking a probiotic while you are on the medication.  
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	sf, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female		8/12/2008 7:58:34 PM	My mother ended up in the hospital and is still there with all of the side effects listed for this medication. She has been taking it for 5 months.  She will never take it again.  We are still waiting for test results from fluid drawn from her lungs.  Hopefully it has not damaged other organs.  Her doctor said this drug caused everything.
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	Rachel, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1		25-34	4/23/2008 7:16:13 AM	This medication was presribed to me &quot;to be taken as required with food&quot; as required ment after intercourse. I took about 5 tablets over a month with no problem, a couple of weeks ago I took one and about 8 hours later came down with an awful fever and my body was aching all over. I slept if off and in the morning I was better but had a very mild rash across my chest. A few days ago I took another one this time a fever came on about 5-6 hours later, I was feeling dizzy, my body was aching all over, I was nauseated and finally I vomited violently. I spent the whole next day in bed with fever/chills and my body aching. I am finally better today. I felt like I had been poisoned after taking this medication, please be very cautious when taking it.
