Neuropathic Pain	MMNS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	6/4/2012 2:09:24 AM	I have early onset arthritis, depression, autoimmunity, plus dislocated my elbow 4 months ago.  The arthritis was so bad in my right knee that I needed a cortisone shot in it at 43 yrs old?  Had several Rx from different Drs that were making me feel totally out of control, so went to see my primary Dr to review all my meds and figure out which were best to take.  She took me off off all the codeine based meds and changed my depression meds.  Now I take 50 mg of this for pain and depression plus celexa for depression as well.  I can hardly believe how much better I feel.  There is little to no pain, I can walk comfortably.  I even noticed that the occasional lower back pain I used to have has gone away!  I was told to take this and the celexa before bed so the drowsiness hasn't been a problem.  I have noticed that I am more irritable than before.  Overall, though, I have had a positive experience with this drug.

I was going through a terribly stressful time at work and noticed a HUGE difference in just a few days on 30 mg.  I also began sleeping better than I have in years!  The dry mouth was difficult for me, but worth it.  I also had some constipation, but nothing that some stool softeners couldn't help.  After I got through the worst time I decreased to 20 mg/day, and have settled there nicely.  The dry mouth is no longer a problem and I am still sleeping great and emotionally stable.

Depression	professor, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	65-74	11/2/2011 9:30:43 PM	Have been on the drug for over 25 years now. Had to go through a whole host of other depression Rx's before finding this one to be effective.  There are side effects: dry mouth; ringing in the ears; weight gain--which has to be attended to; but it is the only Rx that has worked for me.  So the trade off in terms of putting up with the side effects has been worth it. I use Biotene mouthwask to handle the dry mouth--it's effective. I have to watch my diet but my determination does me well.

Over about a year, I worked up to 40mg a day (taken at night). I've now started to take 50mg a day. Early on, last year, I had dry mouth and was sleepy. Constipation has been an ongoing issue, but is easily addressed with a daily dose of fiber supplements. I think there's been some impact on my weight, but not terrible. The more serious side effect was that at the very beginning, the med made me feel more depressed, sometimes even somewhat suicidal, but I decided to stick it out for a while, and I'm glad I did, because the side-effects subsided after about a 4-6 weeks. The very big upside is that my pain was significantly diminished, and my sleep got much better (I hadn't had a decent night's sleep in 5 years without Ambien, and I do react well to sleeping meds). I still sometimes get headaches from neck pain, but my MD suggested an Ativan (Lorazepam), which I take occasionally, and which usually helps. Over time the Pamelor also had a positive effect on my feelings of depression, and my fibro-related fogginess lifted quite a bit. I have had some recent resurgence in pain, so my GP suggested  that extra 10mg a day to go up to 50mg (something my neurologist had recommended many months ago). I started in the past week, and am noticing renewed side-effects--the dry mouth (and bad taste in my mouth) is back, I'm sleeping long, long hours (12-14), and the constipation is worse.  BUT I'm hoping that, since these eventually eased before, they will again. Overall so far, I think Nortiptyline (generic Pamelor) has been a very successful treatment for me.

Dose started at 1 pill at bed time. The only side effect I noticed was sleepiness within an hour after taking the dose, and upon waking, I had no head pain. 25mg per day for 6 months.Month 7, the dose was increased to 50mg per day. Side effect of sleepiness increased as result, and minor constipation was noticed. I have no headaches upon waking in the morning.

Depression	bilingual, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	6/10/2011 11:51:17 PM	I have being taking this medication for eight months now. Each pill is 10mg cap. At first I took one pill, then my MD asked me to take 2 pills. One pill mostly stopped all the crying and sadness I had, but was not able to fall asleep fast enough. Then, my MD asked me to take 2 pills, I did not do well since I really was not able to sleep at all. Now, my migraine,neck pain and crying are starting again. My MD asked me to take 2 pills again and add Tylenol pM for night time. I am not really sure whats going on. My migraines are active twice a month for at least 4 to 5 days each. For the migraines I use Relpax, but I need this medication constantly within my reach. Overall, I do not feel that Pamelor will help me entirely.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	5/30/2011 10:39:34 PM	This medication took a couple of weeks to start working. After about 2 weeks I could tell a difference in myself. I was happier and felt less anxious. My family noticed a difference in me too (I wasn't soo gloomy and grouchy anymore.) For the most part I would say Pamelor has helped me. My only issue is that I sometimes forget to take it. I take it once daily at bedtime. If I'm really tired when going to bed, I sometimes forget to take it. I end up missing that dose because I don't want to take it the next morning (because I'm concerned that it might be too close to the next dose.) When I miss 1 or 2 doses, I end up feeling depressed, angry, and anxious all over again. This has just happened to me, so today I set an alarm in my phone to remind me to take it every night. All-in-All, As long as I keep up with it, It gives me great results!

It's the best.It has few of the side effects of the others.I've been on many TCA's, and Imipramine leaves Nortriptyline and the others(like elavil)in the shade! You will not wakeup groggy,it does not cause palpitations,youwill not be dizzy,etc.This is the stuff! It also causes more mood elevation than the others.I wake up every morning downrighteuphoric(happy,content)! It works for the samethings pamelor and elevil are used for(exceptnot the best for sleep-only causes mild drowsiness)Try it.you wont go back.Smalldoses are very effective.Difficulty urinatinggoes away after awhile.Makes skin pleasantlytingle-becomes less with time.
Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	5/9/2011 9:46:01 PM	DO NOT TAKE THIS MED.I used this med to help with my almost daily migraines. I am 16 year old female. It was the biggest mistake of my life. I felt pretty good for about three months with no problems. I was first taking 10mg a day, then upped it to 20mg.I smoked once and had a reaction, but didn't think much of it. I took Excedrin for a headache which has caffeiene and had another reaction. My heartbeat was nearly 200 and could not see straight, dizzy, talking to myself. Rode in ambulance so out of it. They diagnosed me with SVT (heart condition) which was caused with from the Nortiptaline. I quit cold turkey and was completely insane for two weeks. Hearing voices in my head, wanting to die, extremely sleepy, did nothing by lay in my bed.I am still suicidal and it has nearly been a month. I'm surprised I have made it through everything. I prayed every night for God to just keep me alive through all the pain and suffering. I know have extreme anxiety(chest pain, cannot see clearly, feel like I can't breath, very snappy with people) and before taking Pamelor I was a pretty happy person. I told myself I would never take drugs again, but am now surrendering to Zoloft. I can't live like this.

I've had RA for 19 years, depression for 19 years, menopause going on 5 years and fatigue since I can't remember when.  I have been on every medication possible for above issues.  After reading these reviews, I thought I would give Pamelor another try.  I only took it for about a week and got so frustrated because I did not experience any positive results. Actually, NO RESULTS at all. I guess that is the &quot;mania/anger feelings&quot; that come along with depression.  Thanks to all of you who took time out to write a review whether positive or negative.  It made me feel I need to give Pamelor time to adjust to my body.  Since, the doctor has prescribed adderall which has relieved only the fatigue issues.  Wish I could find something that would help with at least one more of my ailments.  If anyone has any ideas, please please please advise.  I am so ready to enjoy life since the above has robbed my entire 30's and most of my 40's.  (I will be 48 in June).  raynebeaux2@yahoo.com   I would certainly appreciate any and all comments.

I only take this at night but it is working. I was taking Topamax but it was causing acid in my urine which could lead to kidney stones. That is the reason for the switch. The only problem I am having is that I have notice a weight gain and I have only been taking this for 3 weeks. Will the weight gaine taper off? This has been the most effective of the drugs I have been on. I took Neurotin for years and talk about weight gain. I then went to the topamax but I do feel taht the Pamelor is working better than both if I can keep the weight down. Any suggestions about that please let me know @ vaphilly41@aol.com

Had a dry mouth, which was relieved by having sugar free gum or candy.. Never gained an once of weight. In fact I lost weight on this medication as my depression lifted ( I'm a stress eater). Felt a little mentally detached, but that could have been the depression. I'd use it again if symptoms returned. A real life saver for me!

The worst side effect is that my breast hurt.  The doctor says it is not possible but the pharmacy says it is.  All I know is that since I have started taking this drug my breast have gotten larger and extremely painful.  Dry mouth is a big side effect.  This medicine is also hard on my stomach.  I am trying to get off of this and onto something else.  I have an excellent doctor so I am sure he will help. Definetly do not like this medicine.

I have very few to no days without a headache or migraine. He originally started me at 50mg at night. i noticed them becoming even more frequent but my actual migraines weren't lasting as long. (they only lasted about a week compared to a month solid. It helped some, but not enough so he increased me to 75mg and added 5mg of Bystolic. This medication has caused my headaches to become more severe, and more frequent. I also sleep far too much, causing my to not be able to wake up for school, and to make it even worse i keep getting sunburnt doing activities i normally do not get sunburnt doing. This is one of the worst side effects to have living in Florida. I want to try to get on a different medication I do not burn on.

It took about 2-3 weeks to work, but I haven't had a headache in 8 days now!  I am definitely pleased with this aspect. The only side effect I've experienced that I don't like is constipation, but I have IBS with constipation anyway.  I take Metamucil, stool softener, eat prunes and apples to combat that.  I do sleep longer and feel just a tad sluggish in the morning but it dissipates quickly enough.  I dream a lot, though, not bad dreams, just busy. I wake frequently but have no trouble falling back asleep.  I am menopausal, too, so part of my sleep disruption is due to that.  Overall I'm happy with Pamelor.

Neuropathic Pain	glowingem, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	12/28/2009 11:26:46 PM	My neurologist put me on this for migraines. I have noticed a slight decrease in the frequency of my migraines. I do not think the side effects are worth it though. I feel like i'm in a fog all the time and have had suicidal thoughts. If you are not depressed do not take a depression medication. I feel as though doctors should use pain/migraine Rx for migraines. I have become very irritable and snappy with my husband and others around me. I am a very nice person that is not my personality. I have thought about suicide 3 times since starting this. It has made me crazy. Will be seeing my Dr. in a week for another option.

I'm taking Pamelor for migraines. I have daily headaches and Pamelor decreased the amount of pain medicine I take a little. Yes, I have days that I take less pain meds but most days it is the same. About 15% decrease. I don't like the trade off of the weight gain. Strange dreams, cotton mouth, takes longer to get going in the morning.

Depression		3	2	2			9/9/2009 5:36:23 PM	I took Pamelor years ago and felt it was a wonder drug.  I felt as though the weight of the world had been lifted.  My doctor recently gave me Pamelor, but the prescirption bottle shows nortriptyline hcl, I take this at night. It knocks me out and I have trouble getting up in the morning and feel so relaxed that I am not functioning at what I would call a normal level. I do not think it is the same.???

Although I still have pain and it comes in waves, I am finally able to sleep at night with diminished pain and that is what makes this drug great for me. Shingles pain is the worst I have ever had and NOTHING helped but this drug. 
Other	EngrDan, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	8/4/2009 8:14:21 AM	My treatment started for migraines. A 250 mg of depakote twice a day and 25 mg of pamelor once a day. This cleared up most of my migraines and the ones I did get were weak in comparison. My life was much better. When I changed neurologist I had to do a stress test for the heart because the two meds together caused heart flutters. So I was taken off the pamelor then all H... broke loose. I became depressed and developed IBS and my migraines came more often and more painful. I was in a downward spiral for two years. My life is getting back to normal but I am not happy about post pamelor conditions.  I now take prozac which helped ease up the post symptoms.

Neuropathic Pain	barb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	5/31/2009 1:59:20 PM	A neurologist rxed for L3-4, L4-5 moderate herniated discs, secondary to Scliosis. Titrated 10mg each week to 50mg. At 30mg noticed decreased pain sensation. I was able to start excercising, etc. Also, had daytime brain fog and lack of enthusiam which became worse as I increased to 50mg.I'm in a stupor! Pamelor has slowed not only my stimuli to pain, but also normaleveryday stimuli that brings enjoyment. Time to DC  the med,and not stop phyiscal therapy ever again!
Depression	leeblee6977, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/12/2009 8:35:37 AM	At 14 I was diagnosed with clinical depression and told I was emotionally disturbed.  I began using this med after trying several others including Prozac.  This was the only med that helped.  At 17 I was weened off because of how well I was doing.  Fast forward to 31, after discussing with my doctor we decided to use this drug again,  I feel much better all together.  I am sleeping better and can handle life calmer.  After a week I feel great about myself.  I am glad this med is still around.

Neuropathic Pain	Jinnyc, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	4/22/2009 11:03:28 AM	For almost 2 years, I've had inter ear pain;been to 12 different doctors, and even had my eardrum ruptured and surgically replaced twice; cervical spine surgery and nothing helped the pain. The only doctor who has helped is a dentist who prescribed 50 mg of pamelor, along with mouth splints; I've been talking this now for almost 3 weeks and have been pain free for the first time in 2 years;side effects concern me quite a bit, such as lethargic, dizziness, lack of appetite, and extreme dry mouth;Dr. will be checking me again in 5 weeks and he stated that he would then try to wean me off at that time; I am just not sure if he does, I don't want the inter ear pain to return. Guess I'll have to wait and see and hopefully the side effects will lessen 
Neuropathic Pain	Dina, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	4/3/2009 6:38:09 PM	Taking for L/2 hnp, L4-5 bulges,L5-s1 slip &amp; deg disc &amp; possible piriformis syndrome. Pain level in butt &amp; legs up to an 8 of 10 at times,sitting was excruciating and I couldn't even stand the bedsheet to touch my left leg/foot. I had a level of 5-6 often.At first on this drug, had heart palpitations, crazy non-stop dreaming except to jerk awake, diarrhea, nausea, eye twitches. started at 10mg a day. Side affects x 4weeks, now none! I've been on it 8 months and it doesn't even really make me sleepy (bummer). Now taking 30mg a day two pills in pm, one in am.On pain-free days I think drug is great.  On bad days,not so great! But bad days now around level 4-5 w/lots of 0-2 days now. I keep up exercise, home physical therapy, ice, stretching, &amp; rest &amp; steroid shots though, it's a multi-pronged approach.I advise to titrate up really slowly,less of a shock that way. I'm trying to avoid having to take narcotics, and trying to avoid Neurontin; afraid I'll want to stab somebody with a salad fork on that stuff after reading it's reviews. (But,local pharmacist says Neurontin mostly just makes you sleepy and someday I may have no choice) Right now,this is helping some, not interfering with my life and I can still titrate up to 50mg a day if needed.Good luck to all of us nerve pain sufferers-many of us look &amp; try to act quite normal, but spend a lot of time in misery.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	2/2/2009 10:06:26 PM	This drug had the following side effects: strong headaches (I am surprised some people take it for migraines), horrible nightmares, dizziness, irritability, drowsiness. The only good side effect: weight loss. I take a very low dosage (25 mg) and this has not helped at all with my depression. I feel just as miserable as when I started taking it. I am going to my psychiatrist tomorrow and request to be taken off of it.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	25-34	12/30/2008 1:27:47 PM	I was prescibed Pamelor 20 years ago for depression.  Taking the drug was very difficult-- it took a good two weeks for my body to adjust to the medicine.  I remember falling over in class because I was so tired-- I couldn't keep my eyes open during the adjustment period.  Also, it caused SEVERE constipation for me.  Overall, the drug worked so-so for depression.  I was very happy when newer depression class drugs became available. In fact, I am surprised that they still prescribe this-- it is so old school.

When I first took it, it even everything out almost to a numbing effect. I did not experience any highs. I took 10mg then 20 mg.

Neuropathic Pain	thirdpin, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	9/30/2008 1:11:20 PM	Pamelor is for me although I was gaining weight, and the migraines remained with me at a rate of about four or so a month. For this I took another prescription drug. However after my doctor added another med, it resulted in nearly 100% reduction of migraines. I have not had a &quot;real&quot; migraine since I don't know when!I sometimes have drowsiness when awaking in the morning on occasions. Sometimes I go through weak periods where sitting becomes a necessity, and standing is not an option. Because I feel that I will collapse otherwise.Over all I have had great success with this med, and it seems like the weight problem stopped when I went on the second med.  I write this positive report because all of the reports I read were negative. Of course my problem may not have been as severe as those whose woes I read.I've been to the well known migraine clinic North of Chicago, to a doctor in Elkhart, IN (whom I heard had success with migraines), then to this neurologist.

While I have not been on this medicine for a long time I have experience the grut of the side effects. I have had no appetite, feeling dizzy, feeling like I'm in a fog, feelng very irritated by everyone and everything and that is not my personality to be that way.
