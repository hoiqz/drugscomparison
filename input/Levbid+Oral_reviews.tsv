Diarrhea	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	1/30/2012 5:53:57 PM	This med is a disaster. It interferes with my very low dose anti-anxiety medication to the point that I am so tired and spaced that I am non-functional most of the day, and feel miserable to boot. I don't even trust myself to drive, which is a hardship. My vision has been affected too. I would have done better to go out and buy imodium -- all I had was diarrhea, not the cramps and spasms that other people have. My doctor doesn't like his judgement questioned, and insists that I take this stuff. But the first two weeks of it have been just awful.

It has worked wonders with the abdominal cramping associated with the syndrome and have regulated my stools. There were a few days I forgot to take it and noticed a difference when I had to race to the bathroom. You're supposed to take the pills 12 hrs a part, which makes it a nuisance, but if it's regulating my bowel habits and gas, I can handle that.

Recently, another generic came on the market after the discontinuance scare.  I have had to cut back to 1/4th the dose due to markedly increased problems with urination. Even at this lower dose, problems remain. Drug was very effective, but I am now concerned that something in this new formulation causes urination problems.

I called the manufacturer, of Levbid &amp; Levsin, Alaven Pharmaceuticals, www.alavenpharm.com  to ask why they were discontinuing it. They told me that they are NOT discontinuing this drug, but it is back ordered. They will be getting a shipment in sometime around 6/15/08. I just got mt RX of Levbid, which is the same as Levsin, but it's a higher dose &amp; time released. Just be patient...at least we know that we can still get it!! I have no idea how the Levbid will work for me as I was taking Levsin, but I have a feeling it will be better for me.

Irritable Colon	about to give up, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/28/2007 2:32:22 AM	I have had a sharp pain in my left flank that suddenly appears at the most random times.  It is so bad that I can't walk, it wakes me from a sound sleep, and I have even thrown up from the pain.  I have been to every kind of doctor and have spent thousands of dollars on tests all to show normal.  I have had this pain for 12 years.  All doctors have blamed it on my Endometriosis until I had a complete Hysterectomy last year and the pain has continued.  I thought I was going nuts until my doctor decided to give Levbid a shot thinking that I may have a spastic colon.  After a couple of days I noticed a world of a difference!  I have always used Lortab or Percocet which then gave me even worse bowel problems and I was not sure what was worse the pain or both.  I have not taken pain meds in over a month and I am just taking Levbid.  For me this is the &quot;miracle drug&quot; I have been looking for!  If you have tried everything I suggest giving this a shot!
