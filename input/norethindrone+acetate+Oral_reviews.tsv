Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	9/14/2012 4:25:07 PM	Was given a prescription to take every day (no skipping or blanks).  Had been bleeding for 7 weeks straight (peri-menopause).  Bleeding stopped, then had one period lasting 7 days.  However, I am also being treated for depression and this medication caused me to become severly depressed.  I do not recommend this medication for anyone with depression or anxiety.

I take it for the first 10 days of each month, and then my period starts about 3 days after I stop the pills. Side effects are tiredness, hunger, and a small amount of swelling in my feet. Not the best feeling, but the pills are cheap and they do the job.

I am going thru per-i-menopause and I was having some heavy bleeding. It took me awhile to figure out why. I was still having regular periods but would have them like every 2 months instead of once per month and I would bleed for 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. And alot. Really scared me. This has helped with the bleeding, but I have gained some weight. Get headachs, have dizziness. Stomach upset. is it worth it? Not really. There must be another way. Natural progesterone perhaps?

Other	flip flop, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	7/5/2011 6:14:51 AM	I started taking norethindrone because i experienced symptoms of hemmorraghing.  I have enlarged fibroids/enlarged uterus.  I have been bleeding/clots now for over a week.  I thought this was supposed to stop the bleeding all together until my surgery, but it has not.  I have been taking this prescription just over 1 month.  Going to ER to check my vitals and have upcoming dr appts in less than two weeks.  Overall don't think this it is completely working for me.

I have cramped seven days after a normal cycle after being on these pills.  I am going to the health food store and seek herbs.

Endometriosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/27/2010 1:19:11 PM	I have endometriosis and the only relief I have found is the Lupron Depot shot. This pill was also prescribed as add back therapy for it. The Lupron Depot sent me into a menopausal state (hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings). I found that combined with the norethindrone acetate (Aygestin), those symptoms went away. I could clearly tell when I missed a pill. I've been dealing with endometriosis for over 8 years, and the 6 months I used it was the only time I felt &quot;normal&quot;. After a year off the drug, all of my endometriosis symptoms are at their worst. My GYN has prescribed this drug again and I am very thankful for that. Combined with the Lupron Depot shot, I think Aygestin is GREAT. 
Other	cristina, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/19/2010 4:04:19 PM	do not take this drug.  My wife took it to stop uterus bleeding before her hysterectomy surgery and it caused her to lose sight in her eye. This is the most serious side effect that is not on the label or bottle.  She is undergoing surgery and all doctors agree that this drug caused the blood clot to stop the eye from working. Please be careful.

Endometriosis	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/14/2009 11:14:59 PM	I have been using this treatment for a year and a half I think it works well.  I am only 21 and have had endometriosis, so this pill was the easiest way to keep that at bay.  However now I am starting to notice all the side effects.  I exercise every day but don't seem to lose any weight, I'm terribly moody (mostly when I'm already under stress), and I feel like I am going through menopause. I feel as though this is a wonderful short term treatment, but I am sure hoping that my doctor and I will come up with a better long term treatment soon!
Endometriosis	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female		1/26/2009 10:03:06 PM	At first this medication was great for stopping the bleeding and pain associated with endometriosis. After being on the medication for a year, the side effects began to intensify. A year and a half later, I had 8 of the 12 listed side effects handed to me in a pamphlet at the pharmacy. I gained 25 lbs. although I ran or worked out every day. The nausea was the worst part, closely followed by the incredibly painful acne. This was a great short term medication for me but I would not recommend it to any of my friends.

I am only 24 years old and feel like i am going through menopause already. I am not pleased with this medicine at all. I dont like the way it makes me feel. I can't sleep at night. And i am always moody. And my doctor wants me to take this medicine for 6 months. I dont know if i can do it. But he said it will help my get pregnant after i finish taking it. So hopefully it works.

I no longer take it, but I was on it about 2 months.  This medicine made me feel awful and not myself.  I think I had every side effect listed for this drug. I called the doctor about problems I was having and he said drug has no side effects,  &amp; to give it time to get in my system.  Here I am 2 months later, at least 2 pants sizes smaller and hair falling out by the handfulls!!! I lost so much weight, I had to wear my 8 yr olds belt.  My hair started coming out in clumps.  It's so bad, I am now wearing a wig, hoping it will start growing back soon...This medicine has not helped my condition at all and I would not recommend anyone take it....

Constipation is a problem as well as heavy night sweats.  I don't feel like myself when I take this medicine.  I have asked for a different type of progesterone and will start that next month.  I hope it doesn't have the same side effects as norethindrone.  If so, I don't know what I will do.  For me the weight gain is the worse.  I have a good diet and exercise dilegently 5 to 6 times a week.  This medicine makes it all seem like I am doing it for nothing.
