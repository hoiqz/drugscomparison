High Blood Pressure	Jan, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	2	1	1	Male	35-44	5/1/2012 10:19:09 PM	My son 35 was given this drug and was on it almost a year during this time he began to retain much more fluid,health deterioration, heart palpitations, chronic cough, fainting....end results severe effusion of pericardium which almost caused his death was in the hospital for 2 month...seem to be hard to diagnosis what was going on but finally with cat scan large effusion was found around heart 2 liters of fluid had built up...most likely it had been building for the whole time he had been on this Minoxidil..he was not aware of this being a side effect and might have figured it out had he known when the symptoms begin. Patients should be told very plainly of this side effect,of course, not all get only a few but it is life threaten...he almost did not survive this ...his heart was failing and hypertensive lung disease had developed as large sack of fluid around his heart caused lungs to collapse in lower part from pressure he was on oxygen for 5 month, developed right side heart failure ..he is now finally off oxygen &amp; recovering well...he had 2 surgeries and a pericardium window was make. He is a dialysis patient and that may be one reason he developed this with this medication but Dr should be more conscious of this happening with patients on this medication. Dialysis 3 times a week is not like taking a diuretic every day to help pull the fluid...he was having severe fluid build up between dialysis and medical people just thought he was drinking way too much which he was not.thankful that he survived this ordeal.

High Blood Pressure	AJH310, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	7/8/2011 11:18:19 AM	I started this medication a month ago. It has lowered my diastolic pressure considerably but has had minimal effect on my systolic pressure. The only two side effects I have noticed, and am tolerating at this point, are that it makes me VERY tired/fatigued and I am having &quot;itching spells&quot; since taking it. As a bald guy though, I am anxiously awaiting to see hair growth on teh top of my head!
High Blood Pressure	Swede, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	4/30/2011 11:58:03 PM	Taking it for 25 yrs (after massive stroke at age 46) - have tried nearly 30 other bp meds (while some/many worked to lower bp, they each had undesirable sides, most particularly depression, sexual, ...).Only sides from minox are fatigue which I can handle and heart racing (very unusual, only 20 or so reported cases of it) which is serious but take Corguard to counteract and no reoccurences of racing heart since then. And hair growth, thickening which, of course I don't mind.It was about 6 months after starting Minox the heart racing incident(s) occurred so it was not immediately evident it was a result of minox. Took some digging in PDR (and consult with drug company) for dr to pin it down.

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	9/18/2010 1:13:53 AM	After being on several different bp medication minoxidil was a last resort, in combination w/ 2 other medications. Worked great, lowered my bp w/in weeks (bp @ stroke level). After 1 1/2 months stopped medication due to excessive facial and neck hairgrowth. Now 2 months later still have facial hairgrowth. Women if you don't mind the hairgrowth medication works great.

High Blood Pressure	just me, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	55-64	11/13/2009 12:02:20 PM	Although it is working really well for my blood pressure, both my parents had HBP and mine is just hereditary, minoxidil has caused  me to have extreme hair growth on my face and neck. I already have very thick hair on my head. This is very hard to control and deal with on a daily basis as I am in a job where I am out in public every day. I cannot afford laser treatments and the OTC remidies are not all that effective. I will be seeing a dermo next month to talk to her about Vaniqa. Maybe I'll be a good canidtate for that.If not, then I guess I will be spending more time at home...

Definately talking to my dr about this to see if there is another alternative med as I cannot diuretics as I am allergic to sulfa meds.
