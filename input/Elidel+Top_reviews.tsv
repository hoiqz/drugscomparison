Eczema Skin Condition Resisting Treatment	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/9/2011 5:23:21 AM	I didn't want to use steroid medication since I had seen my son were in the terrible &quot;rebound&quot; condition after he was using a steroid medication three years ago.  My doctor prescribed Elidel and I satisfied the result so far.  The first day, I felt extreme itchy sensation which may be called &quot;irritation&quot; described as one of the side effect.   After the second days of usage of the Elidel, I don't feel this irritation anymore and bright red  inflammation is just like a light pink skin now.  Amazing!

Atopic Dermatitis	Expensive Eyes, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	8/30/2011 8:45:28 AM	After 2 weeks of allergic reactions to other medical treatment for the dermatitis around my eyes I sought help from a Dermatologist. He said I should not have a bad reaction to Elidel. ONE application proved that to be wrong! Within 30 minutes my eyelids burnt, turned even more red, developed blisters and began to swell even more! Directions state not to use around the eyes, nostrils etc. but the doctor said to use it around my eyelids, it would be okay. Maybe doctors need further training with this product. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/27/2011 11:36:21 PM	I have psoriasis that is on my face and on other sensitive areas of my body my doctor recommended that I use this  because it doesnt have steroids that other psoriasis medicines have that cause stretch marks and it works wonders. Also using this product allowed me a longer time between flare ups because my skin was not addicted to the medicine. 
Other	bite me, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male		10/1/2010 3:36:31 AM	Overly expensive, dubious results. This drug is for well insured suckers. Nothing, NOTHING, works better for my hand eczema than 1% cortizone for a few days, along with heavy applications of Vaseline at night. I use cheap disposable cotton gloves to make this more practicle. Don't waste your money on this ridiculous product. Just quit exposing your hands to the irritants that cause flare ups. Disposable gloves are CHEAP. This idiotic cream is not worth what it costs, unless you're an over-insured sucker who expects a miracle without any effort on your part. That is my opinion. But go ahead, buy the crap and prove me wrong, dummies.

Atopic Dermatitis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/31/2010 3:44:14 PM	I have had ezcema for most of my life, when I was in my twenties my arms looked so bad it looked like I was a leper. My doctor put me on elidel and I could not be happier. I believe this medicine has 'cured' my ezcema because I have not had any problems since then. 
Atopic Dermatitis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	5/18/2010 10:48:05 AM	I put the cream on for two days in two tiny spots on my face and immediately developed a burning fever of my whole face and hands, and awoke on day two with my left eye swollen shut!  My eye doctor told me there is a chemical substance used in this that is administered to organ recipients to help prevent organ rejection.  This stuff is poison and I would never recommend it to anyone.  The worst part is that I only had a little bit of dry skin and I was given a last resort drug.  And to make matters worse I've had a sore throat for two days now.  The dry skin is gone, but at what cost?  Please avoid this cream at all costs.

After 2 days of using Elidel my skin became soft, no rough patches, and no more bumps!  I couldn't believe how well and how quickly this worked. My family noticed the change right away to. My insurance did deny it at first, but my doctor was able to get it approved, and I only had to pay $15.  I had no side effects like burning.  I would recommend it!

I used steroids for as long as I could, but after discontinuing them, it came back. Very itchy red bumps. Once I started using elidel, after a few days it went away and my skin had a soft touch again. It didn't burn at all when I put it on, but I do have to put lotion on over it because my skin would still be dry.

It just made it worse. It burned and did not help me at all. I would not suggest it to anyone with cronic eczema. Maybe it would work with people with mild ezcema

Took twice as long to heal because of medication.
Other	Debs, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/24/2009 11:12:34 PM	My husband got a rash round his eyes and nose it was dry and horribly irritated this was going on for nearly a year, our regular doc prescribed a cortizone cream and then a dermatologist did the same.  Finally we went to another doc who told my  husband to immediately stop using the cortizone, his face swelled up like a balloon.  it turns out that the skin had gotten addicted to it;  he couldnt leave the house it was so bad so he went back and the new Dr. prescribed this elidil.  Overnight the swelling was down and within 2 days it was cleared up.  It hasnt returned since.

This med makes the area feel &quot;hot&quot; when applied. Dosen't seem to work, the rash just re-appears somewhere else.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/10/2009 4:19:42 PM	I had an allergic reaction to an antibotic which manifested in icthy, severely swollen, watery eyes which in turn caused a nasty rash and redness like a mask around my eyes.  I am prone to dermatitis anyway, so this was a familiar irritation, but nothing was helping with the two weeks of itchy irritated skin until I used Elidel.  I used it sparingly and very carefully around my eyes four times over two days.  There was a slight burning sensation with the first application, but it quickly went away and was not an issue after the initial application.  Elidel worked like a charm for me.  It is expensive, I was very lucky to have insurance pay for all but $25.  I certainly didn't need the whole tube or even a quarter of a tube for this situation, but I am sure I will have another rash again for one reason or another.  I should also note that I did end up taking a steroid for my allergic reaction as well which may have altered my results with this medication.  Whatever the case, I found great relief quickly.

Doctors have told me to use oatmeal, drink water, apply baby oil (the worst thing I ever done). Finally at the age of 21 I was prescribed Elidel and it worked miracles for me. Within a few days my skin cleared up. No more rash all over my body, no more itching, burning sensations. Finally something that works!!

Not only is it very expensive but we feel it doesn't work very good. It also burns his skin after applying it. For the cost of the small tube, I wish it would work better. 
Atopic Dermatitis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	5/17/2009 9:57:23 PM	I developed eczema at age 20, all on my face and scalp.  I had itchy, dry, and flaky patches that made me look like I had a bad disease.  Hydrocortisone did not help.  My Dr. prescribed this topical cream and my itchiness and scaliness went away.  But it has worsened my inflamation to the point that my face is almost entirely red.  I wish that there was a cream for the redness, too.
Atopic Dermatitis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	4/28/2009 6:48:52 PM	i also have eczema &amp; rosacia.  it got rid of my rash (atopic dermatitis) but i don't use for the eczema (i've used ultravete &amp; haven't had a flare up in over 15 years don't use anything right now) but for the redness, it makes my face hot (burning for few days then it goes away) but i feel like heat comes out of my skin &amp; it's warm to the touch.  I have better results from nizoral &amp; noritate mix or just now metro gel. I have very sensitive skin &amp; am slavic origin so I am very pale.  After reading the risks, I don't think i'd like to use long term. 
Other	Nashrunner, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	4/6/2009 10:03:54 AM	After having have rosacea for years, going from one Dr to another, I finally found one who &quot;got it&quot;. He Rx'd Elidel cream which ro use for rosacea is really a cross-label purpose but it works! I am much less red and broken out, everywhere I was previously, and it's easy. All there is to do is wash and slap it on. There's no burning or other sensation involved. I've taken everything from Accutane to Oracea and this stuff wins. I am advised that rosacea is a life-long condition. I am planning to live for a long time. I hope they never stop making Elidel. 
Eczema Skin Condition Resisting Treatment	lbadams11, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	3/25/2009 9:51:33 PM	I developed eczema as a teenager and would get periodic rashes all over my arms, chest, and back. Elidel works very quickly, for the rashes were usually gone in a few days, but temporarily, for they always came back. It doesn't help the itching at all, which is almost a bigger problem than the rash itself. If you have a small temporary problem, I say it's good to use. But if you have chronic eczema, there are other medications that are more effective in the long run.
Eczema Skin Condition Resisting Treatment	Leora Rosen, 0-2 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	0-2	3/12/2009 1:09:30 PM	I used it on my just-under-2-year old twins with severe eczema--both were up till 3:30 am screaming and very uncomfortable (they are typically good sleepers). Both seemed to be in pain not only at site of application, but in generalized way. I used it on broken skin (they scratch to pt. of bleeding) which I only later read is NOT advised. Nor is using it on this age kid. I think risks of this drug are not worth it--not to mention how miserable it made my kids.

Extremely bad patches on his cheeks that would often begin to bleed because he would scratch them so much.  We tried using several non-rx creams from Aveno to Aquaphor.  Then we tried a prescrptiong steroid.  Nothing seemed to work.  Elidel cleared his face up after the first 3 days of use.  Now we use it only as it flares up.

We started using the Elidel and were very pleased with the results. I heard and read the results regarding cancer and we stopped using it. I had become very concerned. Nothing else seemed to work nearly as well as Elidel. Now, when the breakouts are bad we apply a very small amount to only the affected area and it is enough to clear it up. I will continue to use it but only if absolutly necessary and only a small amount directly on the outbreak site.
