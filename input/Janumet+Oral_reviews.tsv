Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus		4	4	2			7/24/2012 11:03:21 AM	Since taking this medicine, my body ached me so bad, that I had to take 2 advils for relief, in which, I do not take pain killers, unless I am ready hurting........My muscles ached me unbelieveable......I stopped taking this medicine, for that reason only. Otherwise, it really works to control my blood levels.

I have both Asthma and Diabetes.Before I started the Janumet my oxygen saturation was usually 99% and was never lower the 97%.  I was on Janumet for only 3-5 weeks and my oxygen saturation dropped to 87%.I was wheezing, and I never wheezed before, and should have been on Oxygen.  If it had fallen to 86% I would have been hospitalized.  If I had caught a cold, I probably would have died.The medication is a killer and almost killed me.

It's brought down my sugars to 120-180 on average, but it doesn't seem to be enough.  She doesn't want me on insulin, but I have a hard time eating ANY carbs, including low carb wheat bread (10 carbs per slice) WITH my medication.  Any kind of carbs sends my sugar soaring through the roof!  Any comments or advice?  HELP!

Worked but still had highs and really bad lows (50-55). Doctor game me some janumet samples--amazing--nothing over 100 even eating what I want. A new doctor swithed me to a newer pill (Tradjenta) with Metformin--what a joke!!! All the old highs came back--200-300. Switched back and now is down to normal again like I don't even have diabetes, These pills are great, slight side effect with a stuffy nose at night but it works so well that I take one janumet in the morning and then a generic metformin at night and that helps the stuffy nose. Look online at the janumet website where the first prescription is free and then for the next year it is $5 a month--thats right $5 a month. Then the second year you can switch to januvia for the same deal and just take regular metformin. That is my plans. Good luck

Started Janumet about 5 days ago. i'm having stomach issues which are tough but tolerable. Feeling some pain in stomach but not sure itf it's from the side effects of having gas and bloating or if it's a side effect of the Metformin. The good news is that blood sugars are the lowest they've been in the past year.

But I have noticed an huge increase in energy. I look forward to walking and working out. I wake up feeling like I slept. So far so good other then the stomach issues that comes with metformin. I cant wait to see my BS levels drop lower.

Have had tests done and no one seems to know the cause... My levels have decreased but I'm wondering if Janumet is the cause of these side effects...

I am hoping my readings will get better yet, they do seem more stable through out the day. My Dr. switched me from 2000 metformin to janumet because my A1C was staying at 7.3-7.5 and not getting any better. I am really hoping this works for me. I love taking it only twice a day instead of every meal with the met. No side effects other than loose bowels that I already had with the met.

I am guilty of not taking meds as described, but since being on the janumet sugar levels are coming down and ac1 is getting lower. I had to learn how to take the janumet. I can't take on an empty stomach and I have to eat within 10 minutes of taking this drug.  I no longer have muscle problems associated with diabetes, my vision has cleared up and I am a lot more energetic and I have had some weight loss.

Lost 10 lbs in this first month with diet and exercise, have tried to lose in the past and wasn't able to, so thinking the med must be helping to make it easier.

Overall, am happy that I do not feel nauseated anymore after a meal, and my levels are staying pretty well under control.  My main side effect is the dizziness when I bend down or move my head side to side, and also a &quot;buzzing&quot; or &quot;zapping&quot; in my ears which I did not have prior.  Did not see on any posts anyone else having this happen, so it may not be a side effect from the Janumet?

Seems to be worst if taken on empty or partially full stomach. If you take this be sure you do so with a very hearty meal.  Otherwise you might have some halitosis issues.

Results amazing--fasting bs dropped to mid 90s, as is bedtime bs check.  A1C has been 5.7.  Anxious to see what it is now.  I also take Vitamin D, which has kept my bs levels consistent for some time.  Has anyone else checked Vit. D levels and gone on supplements?  It makes me feel much better.

It works great.

I have been taking Janumet and within a week my sugar was down to 170's!  I have noticed a few side effects: headache, bathroom issues, dizziness, pain in eye sockets, trouble seeing, etc. But could be the high sugar, change in eating habit or the meds.  I am also on med for high blood pressure.  It sky rocketed to something like 225/125 when in the hospital.  Over all I feel much better!!  Only issue I have now is not being able to see clearly.  But that seems to be getting better.  I will continue taking this medication, it seems to be working rather well.

I do take it with food.  When I take it at supper, I get very tired about two hours afterwards.  Although I do have to say I feel better, more energy during the day.  I have noticed a decrease in appetite.  Which is good. I am hoping for weight loss.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	2/21/2009 1:02:33 AM	Newly diagnosed, my sugar counts were &quot;OFF&quot; the scale, yes I mean &quot;OFF&quot; the scale.  At first I was taking Mel.(?) alone, did not help. Dr. put me on Janumet. Along with diet, exercise and meds, my sugars went down to below 100's in two weeks and are staying there. We are working on &quot;weaning&quot; off the meds slowly.  I am not a person that likes to take meds.I had and still occasionally get the usual diarrhea and cramping.  All that I can suggest is go see a dietician and exercise if you want to beat this.  It does work but requires dedication from yourself.

I also take glipizide twice each day.  My blood sugar is running from 111 to 185 each day when I test.  My question is whether or not I am taking too much Metromin each day??(This is my second request for an answer.)
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Ramadan, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/12/2008 5:05:55 PM	I was diagnosed and placed on Metformin 2X1000mg.daily approx. 1 yr. ago which was erratic in controling my blood sugar level it was replaced with this med. which I have been taking for 2 days to date and I've experienced immed. results.Presently, although I've experienced initially a slight itchy sensation,which have dramatically subsided,I've recordedconsistently lower readingssince. I feel more alertness,energy and general overall wellness then  I felt since prior to diagnosis and during Metformin treatment alone.Although I'm due for a A1C comparison test in Dec. thus far I believe and am very hopeful of this drug promise of a lower level from my now 8.7. NOTE:Also, prescribed inconjunction with this med. will be Duetact which I'll start today.Coupled with these two and with proper eating and moderate exercise I see a future of averting insulin dependency. Look for another evaluation from me in approx.3-4 weeks or sooner if unanticipated effects occur.

Have lost 30 lbs., don't crave chocolate/sweets much any more, actually don't crave food much in general.  Sugar is down to normal range, which was the main reason for taking it.

My doctor switched me to Janumet, what a wonderful change.  My A1c is now below 7 (6.7) at last testing.  I have found that if you take this drug with food, it works far better than just taking it on an empty stomach.

It is decreasing the amount of testosterone in my system.  When I was first tested, my doctor told me my level was at 117, and the normal testosterone level for a woman is 70. I don't know my new number and it has been a few months now, but there is a significant decrease in the amount of body/facial hair now.  I have also lost weight as well, so I am very pleased with this medication.

It is working better for Glucose Control but it has created severe itching and allergic reaction on my skin.It does create a greater shortness of breath that Metaformin did.

I had some high daily sugar levels for about 5 to 6 weeks, then it start work well and some appetite loss and less cravings of  rich foods, but I did increase my vegetable and fruit intake. 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	35-44	9/19/2007 9:58:46 AM	I have been taking janumet for about a month.  My average fasting blood sugar has also risen by approximately 40 to 50 points.  I do believe a slight weight loss has begun due to not processing as much blood sugar into unneeded energy and eventually fat.  To counter this, I have upped my intake of a supplement called Super Citrimax which contains niacin bound chromium.  While this supplement is by no means a cure-all, it has helped me.I had been on Avandia, have no signs of heart disease, but my doctor switched me to Janumet because he felt it to be &quot;something stronger&quot;.  At my next appointment, perhaps sooner, I am going to ask to switch back to Avandia because it works better for me.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	9/18/2007 7:09:36 PM	It is a one pill a day regimen so it is very easy to take.  I've had no side effects and my blood sugar has come down into normal limits.
