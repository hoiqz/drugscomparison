Trental seems to help prevent severe cramping while walking even though I can only walk short distance.  I have not had any side effects that I am aware. I take 3 pills w/food 3 times per day.

My pharmacist told me that it had been discontiued. They gave me Pentoxifylline, after taking them for a few days, I noticed that I was getting a headache so I stopped taking them.

Other	myjoyznhim, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	2/1/2011 3:09:42 AM	My dermatologist prescribed this medication to help with a not so common skin condition, GA, and it worked wonders after 2 months of 400mg 3xdaily. Then my condition started to get bad again but I did not know that smoking (which I started up again recently)decreases the efficiency of the drug dramatically. I wish the doctor would have told me this before I started the medication but don't know if that is the total reason why my treatment failed. I am still taking it but am doubtful as to it's beneficial. I have had trouble in the past filling this prescription, but my pharmacist checked another pharmacy and they had it in, otherwise, no problems getting the medication. Is there anyone else out there that has an usual experience with this medication that effects their skin or other side effects? I hope this helps someone.

It eliminated the ulcers on my fingers and as far as I am concerned is a Godsend.  It certainly is available.

I found nothing which stated from Sanofi-Aventis, or the FDA that the drug was discontinued.  Hang in their.

Other	chris, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	35-44	4/23/2008 2:30:41 PM	I'm taking Trental for Peyronies disease.  I suffer from SVT which I told my dr.  After 2 doses of Trental (1 night, 1 next AM), I suffered the worse SVT attack in years.  My heart beat was weak, unable to correct itself and I felt faint as a result.  Doing my normal corrective techniques I got it under control.  24 hrs later I'm still not right but getting better.  For me, I have to stop taking Trental.  Given my experience I would suggest SVT sufferers take heed when considering Trental.

Peripheral Vascular Disease	Robbie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	10/12/2007 2:40:16 PM	When I first began this medication, it made me very dizzy, so instead of taking it 3 times a day, I took it 2 times a day--once in the evening and once the next morning.  The symptoms began subsiding (skin breakouts, itching, allergic flare-ups).  I had been in severe pain.  Once I began the medication, the pain was GREATLY reduced in approximately 4 weeks. The pain lessened as time when on.  By 8 weeks, the pain was almost gone.  Then it plateaued and stayed there as slight pain. By then I had taken 90 days' worth of the tablets.  Since my prescription was still open, I ordered another refill of 90.  I am still having slight pain, which is exacerbated when I walk steps or climb hills, but it is MUCH better than it was!  I couldn't even walk at all!  I will continue to take the medication, and am scheduled to see my doctor in about a month to see what he says. I am a 65-year-old black female, and diabetic.  Hope this helps someone.
