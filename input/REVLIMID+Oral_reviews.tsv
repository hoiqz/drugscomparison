The theraphy initially prescribed by my oncologist were a combination of dex(steroids)and Revlimid. I am a 65 yr old male with no prior medical conditions. On the  fourth day of the revlimidtreatment I had to be hospitalized because of a severe reaction. My body portruded with whelps, my head, face and arms swelled up and I became red and itching all over. I was released from medical emergency after four hours of treatment. The next day my oncologist took me off this medication. He is to prescribe Velcade instead of Revlimid now.

Within a few months myeloma started to worsen.  Was started on 15 mg for 21/28 day cycles.    I was in remission within 4 months.  That was 3 1/2 years ago. Only side effect is irritable bowel and I think it is the cause of a metallic taste in my mouth

Started revlimid w velcade and dexamethazone in 5/11.  Not effective enough.  After clinical trial in fall, did 2 cycles of revlimid alone, 21 days each.  Side effects were exhaustion, slept 16-20 hrs/day and severe dehydration due to miserable diarrhea -  seemed like irritable bowel syndrome.  That was at 20mg/day.  Didn't finish 2nd cycle.  Light chin numbers actually doubled in Revlimid alone.  Adding cyotoxin this week, reduced rev to 10mg to lessen side effects.

FDA is currently reviewing all available information on this potential risk and will communicate any new recommendations once it has completed its review. At this time, FDA recommends that patients continue their Revlimid treatment as prescribed by their healthcare provider.  The benefits and the risks of Revlimid should be carefully weighed when prescribing this drug. Healthcare professionals should be aware that Revlimid may increase the risk of developing another type of cancer. Revlimid is used to treat a type of blood disorder known as myelodysplastic syndrome. Revlimid is also used along with other drugs to treat people with the cancer known as multiple myeloma. Additional Information for Patients and Caregivers Do not stop taking Revlimid without talking to your healthcare professional.Discuss any questions or concerns about Revlimid with your healthcare professional.Continue to report any side effects you experience to the FDA MedWatch program using the information in the Contact Us box at the bottom of the page. Additional Information for Healthcare ProfessionalsPreliminary data derived from evaluation of outcomes after longer-term exposure to Revlimid and from controlled clinical trials conducted inside and outside the Unites States shows an increased incidence of some second primary malignancies, particularly acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and B-cell lymphoma malignancies, when compared to controls.Since lenalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide, FDA is also currently reviewing all available information on this potential risk for thalidomide.At this time, there is no recommendation to

Moved to FL and began Rx treatment in December 2008. I completed two cycles of Revlimid (25mg) and Dex (40mg at 10x4mg) before stopping all drugs three weeks before going to UAMS L'Rock, AR for stem cell harvesting in April 2009.  Took no drugs from May 2009-Oct 2009 when at that time I had a tandem stem cell transplant procedure at UAMS.  As a follow-up to my stem cell transplants, I as put on a daily (every day, w/no days off) regiment of Revlimid 15mg as a maintenance drug  and have been on it daily, ever since.  I have had minimal side effects: occasional feeling of being extra tired, infrequent muscle twitching (leg), some muscle cramps (usually resolved w/a Potassium supplement).  The daily Rev seems to be working, but the financial cost is huge!  My annual out of pocket cost, even with Rx insurance, will be in the neighborhood of 12,000 USD.  In the scheme of things, I suppose it is a small price to pay for another year of life.  Still, I would like to see the cost of Revlimid reduced significantly, not only for me, but more so for others who have less of an ability to pay and need to take Revlimid for their MM.

She complains of no side effects.  She remains in constant pain in her back and stays in bed most days.  For the longest time, her family dr. kept telling her that her back pain was due to back spasms.  A year later, at the University Hospital, she is in stage 3 Multiple Myeloma.  I have read all the posts on here and my heart goes out to those who have lost your loved ones, and say God is Great to those who are well....I hope my mother pulls through this as well.

Found early by random blood test. She had no symptoms except elevated plasma cells. Two full body scans nothing there. She had been on the drug for 19 days when she had a blood clot go into her lung and she died instantly. Acute pulmonary embolus was the official cause of death which is one of the main complications of this drug. I pray this helps someone.

Bonemarrow 45% cancer cells. Mom also has Diabetes, HBP and Interstitual Cystitus. 09/09 She began treatment: 18 Rounds of Radiation on hips, Revlimed 25mg, 21days on/7 days off, Decadron 40mg 4dayson/4 days off. Potassium and Calcium daily; Once a month Zometa &amp; Procrit. Her pain was extreme due to the size of the tumors.The only significant side effects were from Decadron: Glucose levels averaged between 200-515. Agitation/nervous,increased thirst and urination which lowered potassium level causing severe nauseau. 11/09 We were Blessed w/the news of ZERO Cancer cells in Bonemarrow. 01/10 REMISSION!!! Mom's Oncologist said,&quot;He couldn't believe it had only been 4 mo's ago and that he had never seen anything like this&quot;. His words were,&quot;it's a MIRACLE!&quot; Revlimed was lowered to 15mg.  04/10 PetScan Results:  No signs of new Cancer! However, scan revealed fractures in R Ribs and L Hip. We were shocked because she hadn't fallen but, were so thankful. Mom still has pain in back and hips but,it's nothing close to what it once was,bones are very fragile from the Myeloma. However,we truly believe God is in control and is guiding her Oncologist towards her healing.

The doctor says that his blood count is WNL however it seems as if the side effects of the cocktail (decadron and revlimid) have taken effect.  His legs, ankles, feet and face are severly swollen and he seems to be aggitated all the time. It's difficult to determine if the meds are causing him fatigue (he can fall asleep anywhere, anytime). Additionally, he has type2 diabetes and the cocktail has been known to increase blood sugar and effect kidney function although his proteins have been only slightly elevated. His skin is VERY dry so you would think he's dehydrated but because of the effects on the kidneys, he's constantly urinating. It is understood that this is not a cure all to the disease and some days are going to be worse than others but I wonder if he would have benefitted from infusions rather than the oral treatment. Yet, I remain hopeful that this will go into remission and the happy, on-the-go father I know and love will be up and about soon.  For those of you who have lost a loved one, my heart goes out to you.  Thank you for sharing your stories.  -Rachel

I have been on Revlimid (clinical trial in Canada) for 24 cycles.  I am currently taking 20 mg.  My counts have been in normal range for six months.  I have few side effects; certainly nothing compared to what chemo would give.  I am fatigued; the doctor doesn't know if this is a side-effect of Revlimid or lingering CLL.  I have my follow-up CT scan and Bone marrow aspiration in two months to determine the extend of remission.  I am so thankful for this drug; particularly that I am receiving it through a clinical trial at no cost to me.  Everyone has a different story, but mine is a good one.  Thank God for Revlimid and for Princess Margaret Hospital; Toronto.  Both have been life-savers.

Last month he developed Shingles and a blood infection. His doctor said its from the revlimid that lowered his white bc. He passed away on 10/01/2009 due to a heart attack. I strong believe he developed a blood clot or pulmonary embolism and that killed him. He had never had any issues with his heart.

All this on only the first cycle, after which my doctor took me off Revlimid.  More than a month later still have the chest, rib, and back pain.  I'm in fairly early myeloma and they started me on the highest dosage, maybe that was a problem.
