When I first started the danazol I felt horrible.  I have severe headaches and vomiting, but these side effects went away.  After 6 months of the treatment I still was bleeding daily, so my doctor has put me on Divigel for 7 days and scheduled an ultrasound.

I have to take this medication or I end up in the hospital. I wish I could find the company that makes this medication because Sometimes I can't afford the danazol.

Cystic Disease of the Breast	noname, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	1/4/2010 8:39:23 AM	I'm on a low dose 100/day for breast pain.  Breast pain reduced but not gone.  Side effects include lower back pain, dizziness, frequent (daily) bleeding/spotting and a weird feeling in my throat, like I swallowed a grape that won't go all the way down the esophagus (I didn't see this listed in the posted side effects).  Some vomiting, but without nausea - weird.  No weight gain on this low dose. Anyway, I've been on it a month and will continue the drug to see if the breast pain goes away completely (I hope the bleeding stops too). My breast pain was so bad, even these side effects are worth the reduction in pain I have experienced so far.

It appears to be working because my breast cysts fluid activity has decreased. I don't have to have the painful aspirations as often and the pain has stopped. I want to know about long term effects too. So far I've only had slight weight gain but not sure how new dosage will affect my weight. Some doctors say take for a while where as my new prescription will be ongoing.

Thrilled with results; 1st time in years that my body is making healthy red blood cells.  Side effects (dizziness, lack of menses, lower back/joint pain) are well worth ability to live normally again.  I am very concerned with lack of long-term effect data. MDs say I can stay on this long term, but if that's so, why are athletes told to stay away from anabolic steroids?
