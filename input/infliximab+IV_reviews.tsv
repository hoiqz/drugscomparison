Crohn's Disease	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	8/23/2012 8:56:15 PM	I have been taking taking infliximab IV since I was 14, I have my infusions every six weeks which can be a little inconvinient but I have a very understanding employer and the benefits out-weigh the hassel. Before starting I was very sick unable to do much of any thing after the first couple infusions I began to feel better and now live a farely normal life, and have had no bad side affects from it.
Severe Ulcerative Colitis	skinamarinkydink, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	8/23/2011 12:40:20 PM	Sitting in a chair for 3 hours getting an IV was not what I thought of as something I thought I would ever look forward to- that is until I developed UC.  My initial symptoms came on hard and fast.  I was very scared when I first got my diagnosis- 25 years old with 2 very young children.  While my doctors were able to get it into intial remission using steroids and Asocol, the remission only lasted a year.  The symptoms came back- only worse.  I was so tired that I did not know if I would ever be able to function as an effective mother again and had to stay close to a bathroom all of the time so I worried that I would become a shut in.  My doctor's recommendation of remicade sounded frightening but if I could have a fraction of the results that he was implying, I knew I could not pass it up.  While I do still find myself tired-- especially immediately after a treatment, I am able to work full time and take care of my children in a capacity equivalent to before my diagnosis.  Remicade gave me back my life.  
Crohn's Disease	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Male	13-18	6/13/2010 11:20:32 AM	Patient on Infliximab, upon use I have felt better after 2 years of constant colic pain  and diohrea. However, the side effects of this drug i believe can be very potent leaving me  as an individual unable to carry out daily tasks example wash dishes yet the majority of the beneficial factors of this drug are amazing in regards to this treatment; by a majority i do understand the vast amount of detrimental factors can cause additional illnesses and stress, without regarding this drugs large fee. Overall, I understand this drug to be beneficial for  sufferers of crohn's disease yet it  use is  one to be carefully monitored by  your medical professional due to the numerous  side effects.

At first it way very expensive, $18,000 per treatment (using 10 vials), now cost is 1/2 of that. Very satisfied with drug, but the infusion process is a pain since you have to get it intraveinously. The crohns is now in remission. The only dissapointing effect of crohns is the constant diahrea.
Crohn's Disease	Smithy :-), 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	2/21/2010 1:56:11 PM	Iv been haveing Infliximab IV for 5 years, i was 21 when i had my first, its the best thing they could have done for me as it works wonders, only downfall is that i have to have it every 4 and a half weeks but for 90% of that time i feel 'normal' and can do normal things with my 5 year old without feeling too tired or in any pain. I personally would definetly recommend it but everyones body is differant and may not feel as good as i do on it.
Severe Ulcerative Colitis	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	45-54	12/28/2009 1:35:56 PM	I hae been suffering from sever ulcerative colitis for the past few years.  I was stable with Asacol until about 1 year ago.  the doctors tried 6-MP (azathioprene).  i was extremely alergic and began vomiting for 12 hours until I went to the ER suffering from dehydration.  I started Remicade shortly after that episode.  It has been great.  My colitis has subsided and I am living a very normal and active life.  The only issue is that a few weeks after getting an infusion, I develop pain and swelling in my joints.  However, I take advil or tylenol and i feel better. The drug has been great.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	CynthiaV, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	45-54	7/6/2009 7:56:23 PM	I have tried 2 other IV/injectable drugs (Enbrel and Orencia) but neither provided much relief. My rheumy recommended Remicade and I was a bit nervous because of all that I had read and because of the extended infusion time (1 1/2 to 2 hrs) but trust him so decided to give it a try.  I am very glad I did. This drug has been like a miracle for me. I actually began to feel its positive effects almost immediately.  My exhaustion is a thing of the past and I feel much less stiff and joint inflammation is also down. I'm fortunate to have great health care and so the cost is a non-issue at least for now. I hope costs decrease so more people get to try it out.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Lmw, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	1	3	Female	45-54	1/9/2008 8:02:08 AM	Remicade works very well for me. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is very inconvenient to use as I have to take 1/2 day off work every 6 weeks and I go to the hospital to have it administered via IV. It takes about 3 hours from the time I arrive. It is also very expensive and many people can not afford it. Side effects that I have are frequent mouth sores and occasionally, very sore gums. They clear up quickly but can be very painful.
