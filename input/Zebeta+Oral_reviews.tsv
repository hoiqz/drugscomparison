At first it seemed to work well,however my top number has been running high, my doctor prescribed triamterene w/hctz 37.5/25 a few months ago.  However my pressure is still running about 135 over 71, pulse about 65.  Do I need to be concerned?

High Blood Pressure	Thatgirl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	55-64	2/21/2011 4:00:31 PM	Taking only 2.5mg for almost a yr. now for slightly high BP &amp; palpitations and works very well for both.  Too bad I have to cut the tablets for this dosage as they're not available at that lower strength. Taking at bedtime greatly helped with tiredness /dizziness.

I do have a little dizziness now in the morning, but nothing like on the Bystolic. Thanks to My2Cents for PM suggestion.

It has made a remarkable improvement in my life with no noticeable side effects.  I saw my doctor after experiencing what I call &quot;noticeably concerning&quot; heart symptoms. EKG was normal, however the echocardiogram revealed an extremely pronounced MVP condition. I was asked to wear a halter monitor for 24 hours to record cardio activity; it revealed a very high rate of electrocardio events. This medication was prescribed to alleviate the symptoms.  I will return in one year to re-evaluate.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	1/9/2010 4:33:22 PM	I take Zebeta to control tacycardia as a result of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). I take it in combination with Florinef. The two medications together help tremendously!

The generic didn't work well for me. I had to switch back-so I pay the higher price. I too have experienced tingling in hands and toes at times.

So far, I have not had to raise my dosage.  One thing that seemed to be very helpful, I take this at night before I go to bed, so I do not notice any dizziness etc.  Blood Pressure is pretty stable, and heart rate is very good as well.

My blood pressure is also lower, though it was not high to begin with.&#160; However, I am wondering if maybe it has something to do with my GERD, as it started to get worse after I started the Zebeta.&#160; I also have psoriasis and just discovered that this is contraindicated in Zebeta use.

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	7/6/2009 5:53:28 PM	Overall this drug has been a net positive for me.  It has effectivly controlled my heart palpitations, which got up to 170-200bpm. It has allowed me to cardio exercise (run/jogg)for the first time in a year.   It has not significantly lowered my high blood pressure. SIDE EFFECTS: I have had noticible numbness/tingling in my hands and toes, occasionally spreading to forearms even rarely my face.  -Tired and lightheaded occasionally.

However I still have some chest pains,but I might need a higher dosage, I'm planning on discussing it with my doctor in the near future. Besides that, Ive had decent results.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	4/27/2008 2:00:29 PM	This medication is totally wrong for me. Although 5mg, it has lowered my heartrate TOO much. Hasn't lowered BP effectively. Will have my dr. remove me from this. More research is needed for bp meds on women. We are so overlooked.
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	2/21/2008 11:34:32 AM	Same here with the numbness in the arms.  It has helped my blood pressure, but I like the numbness.  Also, feel very lethargic since I started taking.  
High Blood Pressure	teachermom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	2/9/2008 11:24:39 AM	lowered blood pressure but my hands started going to sleep at night and when on computer.  Dr. said it may be carpel tunnel, but in both hands?  and right after increasing Zebeta?  still researching.....
