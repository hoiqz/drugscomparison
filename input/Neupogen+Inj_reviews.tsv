Decrease of Neutrophils in the Blood from Cancer Chemotherapy	Pete, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	65-74	8/27/2012 11:29:26 AM	On Aug 15,2012, I was unable to have chemo treatment due to low neutrophils in white blood cells. I was given the first shot of neupogen, followed by 2nd and 3rd on following 2 days. After the first shot, I had severe pain in lower back, as well as, pain in other joints. I felt terrible in general, with swelling in some joints and low grade fever.  I took hydrocodon-acetaminophen 5-500 to relieve pain.  The pain subsided in 3 days.  I found side effects of neupogen worse than neulasta.I had chemo again the following two weeks when neutrophils were low again. My Oncologist decided to give 4 neupogen shots spread over 4 days rather than 3 days.  It worked beautifully. I just finished the 4th shot yesterday and feel fine. I feel tired and a little weak, but no pain medication was necessary during the 4 days. If not for neupogen, I would not be able to have chemo as my immune system was too low. I am grateful for neupogen and neulasta (which I have had in the past).  They do the job of restoring neutrophils in white blood cells which allows me to have chemo to kill cancer cells. The question is do I want to suffer a little to achieve my goal of having chemo to extend my life?  Yes! I do.
Neutrophils Decreased by Medication	Mikey tryed it, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Male	55-64	8/24/2012 7:03:55 PM	On HCV treatment therapy-Low WBC's Neutrophils expected range 1500-7800_ Mine 610 &quot;one 300mcg Neupogen injection went to 11,674 &quot;Wow&quot;. But, med decreases to about 50% in 2 days. Occasional tolerable body aches,feels a bit weird. Slight short nausea, may try leg INJ. I read Neutrophils are like the Cops attacking and killing the bad guys on site. With Neutrogen,the cops are on steroids. To much Neutrogen they turn into the &quot;Keystone cops on steroids with sloppy over kills. The Blood work is important. Over all we are lucky to have a drug that does something so important as to save us from infection with minimal side effects. So take it, deal with it, kill those bad guys, keep up with the blood work, Good Luck

Decrease of Neutrophils in the Blood from Cancer Chemotherapy	Mir , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	10/12/2011 1:38:27 AM	I have taken 480mcg (the higher dose, there's a 300mcg dose too) for three sessions now - they brought my neutrophils, white blood cell count and hematocrit all up - really well! I had one evening of pulsing pain starting from lower back - real misery, but got permission to take ibuprofen and even just 400mg of that knocked the pain out. Have also had extreme pain on defecation once. Aside from these two, and only one lasted a few hours, all subsequent treatments have not really increased joint pain much. They *have* increased nausea/acid/gas, but meds help that. Just keep on the ondonsatron and you'll be ok.

Worth it. No side effects at all, been on this for about 2 months, and probably will be for another 5 months. Excellent drug!Note bring to room temperature b4 injection and no sting will be felt, doesn't loose pharmacological properties for to this.

The injection doesn't hurt much at all. I didn't have any side effects until my 5th shot. I have experienced pulsating pain in my lower spine and some other bones. Nothing a Tylenol can't take care of. Also I had a headache (but not sure if that is related or not). Overall, piece of cake.

Since she has been getting this med, she is experiencing severe headaches with right jaw pain and facial sensitivity.  After receiving a shot today, she has developed a reddened ring around her right eye (looks like a black eye). She is due for another shot tomorrow but I am going to ask the doctor to recommend another treatment remedy because she is really not feeling any better at this juncture.

She was a mess. One shot of this drug did the trick. The count when 1.4 to 12 in about a day. It leveled off to about 9.

Decrease in Neutrophils of Unknown Cause	almac, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		11/27/2008 11:41:09 AM	In 1994 a blood test revealed an almost zero neutraphil count from unknown causes but which was eventually attributed to &quot;auto-immune neutrapenia&quot;. Neupogen was prescribed in 1995 and I have been on it ever since then. At present an inj of 1 cc twice a week maintains my blood count within acceptable limits 
Congenital Deficiency of Neutrophils, a White Blood Cell	luv2fly, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	11/26/2008 1:08:16 PM	Been on injections every other day for almost a year. I am a flight attendant for a living so when I work I am subjected to all kinds of bacteria and germs. This drug has been a life saver for me as when I was younger in the 80's I would be in isolation in the hospitol over and over since back then nothing could raise your white count. It has enabled me to have a normal life without becoming deathly ill. (Which happened prior to this drug.) I find that the lower my count is, the more I feel the side effects. So at times it is worse than others.Nothing too bad, just headache and some pelvic pain. This starts about 5-6 hours after I inject. It is aways gone by morning. As long as I stick to my schedule I do well. I can inject better with larger syringes as they hold more and I can inject it faster. The insulin syringes are more awkward...but are free with the script! Just make sure you always take your shot out of the fridge about 20 min before you inject it as it doesn't sting as much when it is room temp.

My White count was very low.  Tuesday night was bad. Pelvic area and lower back pain. Wednesday and Thurs bad too.  Started taking 1/2 Percacette twice a day.  This seemed to help.  Recommend premedicating before shot to downgrade the side effects.

My white count is stable, and that makes it tolerable. I am on 1000mg Ribiviran daily and Pegasys injection for Hep C. These two drugs caused my decrease in white count.

Late in day start to get a &quot;distinct&quot; headache. Just get slight muscle pain and pelvic pain. Interestingly, have two small places that look like a rash, one on each hand, that Dr. says is from the drug. This isn't bad but never goes away. HATE giving myself the shots.....plus I travel for a living so it is a hassle keeping the vials chilled!

It has stabilized my counts so that I am not getting sick as often. It did not really help when I took the larger doses 3 times a week. It was also difficult to get my insurance to cover the RX for me to take it myself at home.
