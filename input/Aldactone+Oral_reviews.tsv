I found it most helpful.  I've been on it for over 2 weeks.  I have been crying about 25 times a day over just about anything. I'm  emotional anyway, but this is way out of control.  Any comments PLEASE.  Thanks. It has also softened my facial and leg hair.  
Male Pattern of Hair Distribution or Hirsutism in a Woman	kgs, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	4/9/2012 7:43:54 AM	My primary care physician put me on this to help with the excess facial hair from PCOS; however shortly after starting this medication, I started having panic attacks.  My heart would race, my chest would ache and my right breast developed a hard lump that I thought was a tumor.  Shortly after stopping this medicine I didn't have anymore panic attacks, my heart rate went back to normal and the size of the lump in my breast as decreased.  I never noticed any change in the amount of facial hair I already had prior to starting this medication, so I'm looking into laser treatments instead; however it's fairly costly.  I wish this medicine would have worked for me since it cost me $10 a month vs. several thousand for the laser treatment, but the adverse reactions are not work the benefits.

At 3 mos potassium level then reached 5.1 and went into bradicardia &amp; collapsing, no reduction in swelling.

Visible Water Retention	drugmama, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	2/17/2012 11:14:36 AM	I have been on Aldactone for three days. I couldn't go to work today due to terrible stomach cramps. I woke up in the middle of the night with numbness in my right hand and slept terribly. Mostly I'm dizzy. I feel like very tired and just not myself. I've been on blood pressure meds for several years and had hoped this med would take the place of the other. I'm sticking with what I have. 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	11/5/2011 10:54:27 AM	I was prescribed this medication to treat the hormonal acne that comes along with PCOS and it is VERY effective. I started out on 50 mg a day but was bumped up to 100 mg a day when the 50 mg was not enough. I saw results right away and my skin was completely clear within three months. After being on 100 mg for well over a year, my dosage was recently reduced to 75 mg a day and there has not been a change in my skin at all. My skin looks great and I've been so happy with the results.However, it's not all good. Blood potassium has never been an issue for my while on this medication, but I have definitely experienced the frequent urination; this side effect is really not that bad considering how wonderful my skin looks, but other side effects have made me question whether or not I should continue taking Aldactone. For the entire time I've been on this (about two and a half years now) I've been regularly fatigued, constipated, and my hair has thinned drastically and lost its natural curl. While my complaint about my hair may be vain, being tired and constipated all the time is very unpleasant. I will say, however, that I am NOT entirely certain that these side effects are a result of the Aldactone. They could very well be a side effect of the birth control (Seasonique) that I was put on around the same time I began using Aldactone. Other than those complaints I have been very happy while on Aldactone.

I take 25 mg 2x a day. I NO longer have high blood pressure, lower extremity muscle spasms, fluid retention, or fatigue. I have been able to workout and have more energy. I was 165lb, and now I weigh 135lb. The only side effects I've had are frequent urination, decreased appetite, and mild numbness in my extremities; however, I had the numbness before. I am happy with this medication.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/6/2011 9:02:28 AM	This is a fantastic drug.  My dermatologist prescribed it to be for hormonal acne as I cannot take birth control (due to a blood clot) and my skin is amazing. I was on the fence about taking a generic form of accutane for my skin, but we tried 25 mg of aldactone twice a day and my skin is now completely clear and flawless!  I have had no side effects from this medication and as far as I know it is completely safe.  Your doctor may require blood work every few months as this medication may increase your potassium levels, but most if you're only taking 25mg twice a day you should be fine.  One thing I must point out is that it takes a few months before this medication works in full!  Your skin WILL NOT get worse while on this pill (which is why I love it) but it will just take a few months until it is fully in your system to stop causing pimples.  I highly recommend this medication to anyone struggling with acne.  Also, MD Forte skin care products are great to use in combination with this mediation.  I used MD Forte cleanser 2 and MD Forte cream 1 day and night and now have flawless beautifully pigmented skin.  For those considering accutane, try this first!  Hope this helps!

Visible Water Retention	KerryTrent, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	12/31/2009 5:31:03 PM	This Spironolactone(Aldactone) drug actually does exactly what the doctor said it would do.  He told me that due to my 6 Heart Attacks at age 35 followed by 3 Pulmonary Embolisms at age 42, I needed to be placed on diuretics as well as many other medications.  This medication was one of his choices because I was having tons of SEVERE cramps in all the muscles in my entire body which were quite debilitating.  This medicine he said would not only reduce the amount of fluid in my body but would also elevate my Potassium level.  I was also placed on a Potassium supplement (Klor-Con).  Over a period of time (and I do mean about 12 to 18 months or more) the cramps lessened to just a couple times a year.  The one thing he did NOT tell me however and I had to figure out for myself was that the Spironolactone stripped my body (I am a male) of ALL my body hair except the hair on my hair and Pubic Hair!!  All the hair on my legs, arms, arm-pits, and even my face stopped growing and began to fall out and was not replaced!  After I figured this out, I made sure to have him remove this medicine from my regimen, which he did, and my hair began to return within just a few weeks and within a few months it was almost fully restored.

What I have noticed is severe pain in both of my knees.  It took me awhile to suspect this med, I went through a process of elimination.  Some days I can hardly walk down the stairs or do normal activities. Don't know if this side effect is worth it, may have to stop because of the pain.

I've only taken it for a month but I've seen results. My doctor prescribed this medication before I try Accutane. I have been suffereing from acne since I was 14 and I've tryed many OTC treatments and also oral and topical treatment prescribed by the doctor. I've noticed that the bigger ones have dissipated. Since taking this medication I've had slight cramping in one of my legs, shortness of breath and fatigue. Nothing too major. If this continues to work then I won't end up using accutane. I hope this comment helps some. This medicine isn't usually prescribed for what I'm using it for.

But the pain (muscle spasms) subsided (but did not go away)  very slowly over the course of two weeks.  Now after two weeks of not taking the blood pressure medication, I still have a problem with some pain and numbness in my thigh muscle.  I have been prescribed a muscle relaxer and an anti-inflammatory medication but the side effects persist. I will need to follow up again with my doctor because these side effects will not go away.   I would never take this medication again and urge others to question their doctors about another blood pressure medication if you need one.

I do not recommend this medication if you are already on something else for HBP. I see my doctor this morning and I am taking this medication back to him.

He explained that the drug binds to the receptors on my oil glands, blocking the hormones from binding there and activating them. My skin has been clear for several years now. It's been necessary to increase the dosage over time, but it's really been a miracle drug for me. I was surprised not to see this listed as one of its uses. The added bonus is that this drug comes in several generic forms, since it's been around for so long, so the treatment is less expensive than any other I've tried---and 100 times more effective!

I will keep you informed if anything changes.

Other	female bicyclist, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	10/30/2007 12:12:07 AM	My dermatologist prescribed this drug for perioral acne.  It worked great for the acne but I had severe thirst and terrible mood swings with loss of energy and excess fatigue - something I have never had trouble with in the past.  I have been off the medication for a month now and I feel SO much better.  I was surprised that this drug so adversely affected my mood.  I would rather have the acne!  I may have been more susceptible to the meds because I exercise (and hence sweat) a lot.
