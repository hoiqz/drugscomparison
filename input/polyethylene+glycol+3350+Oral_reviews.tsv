Other	DrC, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	8/17/2012 8:18:54 AM	I am a physician and recently have had two bouts of diverticulitis recommended by my GI doctor.   As for me, the Mirilax type goes best with applesauce. But there are other necessary things to do: drink at least a glass of water, add fiber to your diet, knock off caffeine...askdrweil.com gives more sensible advice.  It doesn't seem to stop the absorption of other meds.  But don't expect a single fully formed stool as you would with psyllium, such as Metamucil. 
Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements	 Female  (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female		6/22/2012 9:28:40 PM	I am a physician and I will never take this medicine again. I am an articulate person and all I can say is that it makes me deathly ill . I feel like I want to jump out of my skin to escape after its ingestion. Repeat exposures have had an increased effect

It mixes well in any liquid with little or no taste.  She started having, from day 1, multiple soft stools.  May have to adjust her dose?  But great, fast, results and a med a child will actually take!

Now I take in am in hot coffee and pm in hot tea.  I feel so much better and am regular at last.I have a new found sense of calm about me and no fear of creating more hemmorroid pain when I go to the bathroom.  One thing.. the first two weeks my feet would itch intensely after dosing at night,(benadryl helped)  but this has resolved.  Best product I've tried for relief.  Glad my Dr. prescribed it!

It works well for me, taken every other day it softens the stool and I have bowel movements about every other day.

I take Lyrica twice a day for pain. It is a narcotic &amp; it makes my bowel moments hard. I have been using Polyethylene Glycol for the same amount of time. It has been very helpful in giving me relief.The only thing that troubles me is my throat gets scratchy &amp; I seem to have alot of mucas. I haven't seen anything that would indicate this is a side affect. If anyone else is having this same problem please write about it here.

I have tried many other medications and therapies for infrequent bowl movements and none have worked for me except Miralax.  I went from having painful and unsatisfying bowl movements once a week to having one every day!  I even found that taking miralax once every other day was just as effective.

I don't know what to do at this point, either deal with it or discontinue and having to cope with this stomache upset, urking up undigested food or belching it up bloating and painful spots in my belly like my ishtemic colitis is coming back or constipation which is extremey painful to pass because its too big and hard and creates lots of blood loss.i had a bifemeral bypass and an intestinal aortic bypass back in may on the 19th and i am still healing from that. I am beginning to think that i am having some blockages from twists and obstructions  due to the surgeries then. Can you give me a clue about what i can do to correct this other than to discontinue this because it does work well for its purpose. I have tried dolcolax and several other OTC meds that are totally ineffective. Thanks

Patient 33 years old good condition wheel chair bonded.By day # 5 he had developed marked abdominal distension. Examination showed distended and tense abdomen on palpation with mild RLQ tenderness. Diffuse dilatation of ascending colon and transverse colon, with presence of gas all the way to lower rectal region including small bowel dilatation.Treatment was started with; tap water enema and periodic change of position (Right side, Left Side, Prone position and Vertical position), 15 to 20 minutes per position.After the first bawl movement as result of 330ml Fleet enema, a second 600ml Tap Water (Distilled Water) enema with gravity 3 ft high was administrated. The discharge was a gel like yellowish stool in amount of 700ml. There is a great suspicion of polymerized polyethylene glycol. Day #6, the passage was open with more discharge of gel like stool, gases and improvement was evident. The patient had no history of mucus.

Other	Tutsie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	6/3/2008 4:00:07 AM	I use MIRALAX with the instruction of my doctor who recommended that I take this medication as long as I wish -- longer than 7 days as recommended on the bottle, and consult her if I feel anything out of ordinary.During second week of using MIRALAX; one morning, afgter having a bowel movement, I felt my heart skipped a beat, than I felt faint as I was having a heart attack. I was pretty scared and called my friend who took me to emergency at a local hospital. They checked me very good and assured me that I did not have a heart attack and the heart monitors did not show skip in my hearth beats. The doctor said I was fine, go home and go on with my life. Deep down in my heart, I knew that the way  I felt that morning had something to do with taking MIRALAX longer than it suggested on the bottle even though my doctor said I could. I am very  conscientious about my health and I read lot. I felt I might have lost some of my oils and minerals out of my body and may have depleted my electro-lights by using MIRALAX. I was talking to my sister about it and she suggested I should try taking  &quot;Emergen-C&quot; twice a day. I followed her suggestion and it worked. I now take MIRALAX everyday and also take &quot;Emegen-C&quot; twice a day and so far I did not have that awful feeling again but yet every now and then I feel very light skip in my heart beat. I feel &quot;Emergen-C&quot; keeps up my electro-lights. I had one of the worse constipation problem since my 30s and this is the first time I am having daily bowel movements thanks to MIRALAX. I feel MIRALAX manufacturers should take into consideration what I an telling here. Thank you.
