Vaginal Inflammation due to Loss of Hormone Stimulation	Coco, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	8/15/2012 12:13:19 PM	Inserted on Friday night. No problem. Woke up with a bad migraine on Saturday. Spent half the day getting rid of the migraine. Next day milder migraine symptoms that went away by late morning. Sunday PM developed another severe migraine that sent me to my bed early. Took  out the ring on Sunday night and threw it away. Cost me 120 dollars. They should give a deep discount on the first one to see if you can tolerate it.

Was very satisfied with it making my dryness issue go away. Hope I can find something else to take without these issues.

Was tired of having to insert an applicator full every other night and wearing a panty liner the next day.  Also the cream didn't provide a uniform result and I always still burned after intercourse.  My Doctor suggested I try the Estring for 3 months and see what I thought.  Have been using Estring for 8 weeks now and just love the results I am getting.  My Vagina feels normal again and doesn't hurt during intercourse or burn afterwards.  However, there are some down sides to this drug.  My husband can feel it and it is not comfortable for me either- so now I take it out before sex. Another thing is It never feels like it is inserted properly even though I insert it into the vagina as far as I can, and by the end of each week I am swollen inside and uncomfortable with it riding so low in the vagina and my side aches (I do push it back up throughout the week).  So, for the last two weeks I have been removing the ring on Friday night and inserting it back on Sunday night before I go to bed. This gives me a break over the weekend.  By Monday Morning everything is back to normal &amp; I usually don't feel the the discomfort from the ring again until about thursday aafternoon.  This seems to be the only way I can use this drug. I will finish out my three months and then take a month or so using the cream again and then go back to the ring for another 3 months.  Hope this review helps.  I would recommend you at least try it and try different things like I am to make it work.  The results are awesome it's just the discomfort that is not.

I had a hysterectomy many years ago.  I have problems keeping it in place but the worst problem is extreme itching and irritation.  Almost unbearable. I will no longer use this ring because of that.  Wish it had worked for me because I won't use oral hormones due to history of heart problems.

I have no discomfort except for sexual pain.  It is no better.  It's so discouraging that sex is still extrememly painful - searing, burning pain.  I wonder if vagifem would work better?

No major problems, just infrequent morning headaches.  I'm dieting, and weight is still coming off so it isn't hindering weight loss.  I FEEL BETTER, with MORE ENERGY, and MUCH LESS DISCOMFORT SEXUALLY.  Hope things continue to improve.
Other	Victoria, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	7/16/2011 9:21:00 AM	Could only use for about 3 weeks.  Swelling and burning sensations after about a week of use.  Could not keep it in place and it would come out while exercising.  The hard plastic ring was difficult to place and it could be felt. Cost $183.00. Weight gain of about seven pounds during the 3 weeks I used it.  I took it out until I can talk to my doctor.  Also I am concerned about the blood clot issues because I have large veins in my legs.  Would not recommend for the cost/weight gain problems.

Other	bergybrat, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/22/2011 5:53:31 PM	For approximately 3 years, post menopause, the vaginal burning and dryness became something I began to live with.  I  tried purchasing numerous creams and vaginal lubricants, none of which actually helped.  Sex was very painful.  At my annual gyn exam, I expressed that I did not believe that I would ever have anormal sex life again. This year, my physician recommended Estring.  Long story short, the vaginal dryness is almost completely gone and my sex life is back to normal.  I am amazed that so many woman are silent about this problem which seems to be rampant among post menopausal women.  It has been the only product that was successful and I tried most products sold in pharmancies and tried many so called holistic products purchased over the internet.  I would recommend trying this product.  I was very hesitant but so happy I did.
Other	dt, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	45-54	2/4/2011 12:00:51 PM	I am 52 and had a total laparoscopic vaginal hysterectomy done 6 weeks ago and developed a grade 1 rectocele post-op. At my 6 week check up, my gyn and I decided to trial the Estring to see if it would help with the semi-discomfort my anterior rectocele was causing me. She inserted it. I was optimistic with reports on website postings, but had to remove it after 4 days due to continual discomfort, even after repositioning it. It also made me feel bloated, and there was nothing to bloat in my lower abdomen-it had all been removed, but my pelvic area felt like I was on my period. Maybe some body types don't adapt well to this appliance. It's a 5cm semi-stiff ring and too bad it is not more flexible. I can't imagine wearing it and exercising. Also, Pfizer, the manufacturer, has not done studies on intermittent use and storage of the device-I called them. I think they should, as many women may wish to use it intermittently. It was too early to tell if the device helped my rectocele. It wasn't in there long enough to know. The concept is a good one - lowest levels out there for estradiol to the vagina, but wish they could come up w/a device that wasn't so big and so stiff. I am an RN, so I did a lot of research on various .org websites before purchasing. My co-pay was $30 so I feel like it was worth trying it for that amount. Sounds like others have had better luck than I did.

Vaginal Inflammation due to Loss of Hormone Stimulation	nr57, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	45-54	12/10/2010 2:32:29 PM	I started using Estring about 4 months ago for menopausal dryness and related discomfort that defies description.  Within 3 weeks I felt more human.  No discomfort or dryness at all which couldn't delight me more.  However, it seems the price I pay is dizziness, not constant, usually when reclining or rising from a reclined position and most especially after a glass of wine. For whatever reason I did not connect the dizziness (3.5 mos now) to Estring.  It got so bad I took myself to 2 different doctors, neither of whom made a connection to Estring (dizziness was BAD and has subsided though not disappeared).  After scoping out various web sites this morning I'll remove the ring and see what happens.  Geeze--I hate to lose the benefits, but can't take the dizziness.

Marked Inflammation of Urethra, the Canal that leads From the Bladder	10 yrs after menopause, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	55-64	4/9/2010 3:16:21 PM	I tried estrogen creams, but they caused irritation.  Vagifem suppositories worked better for a while, but didn't help enough at the once a week prescribed dose, and they were expensive.  For the last six months, I felt some degree of burning and the urge to urinate most of the time.  Four weeks after inserting the estring, I feel normal again, have experienced no side effects, and the cost of the 90-day ring is less than the cost of the once-a week 3 month prescription of Vagifem. 
Other	thankful, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	2/21/2010 8:41:41 PM	I was given this ring for vaginal atrophy, once i changed doctors who kept treating me for yeast infecctions...NOT THE CASE.  I had a complete hysterectomy at 29 and now in my early 40's, I have learned that vaginal walls were breaking down and my symptoms mirrored some of the symptoms related to yeast infections.  I have been using it for about 6 weeks now and my vagina seems back to &quot;normal&quot; as far as dryness, no more burning, irritation or inflammation.  I have, however, experienced hot flashes but they sure are worth the discomfort I was having from using a daily does of 1 mg Estradiol... I'm happy so far and feeling like myself again.  It has not impacted my sexual drive one bit!

I wanted to stop twice and after taking it out, 2 days later I experienced estrogen dropping, confusion, headache, stomach ache and a complete feeling of doom and gloom. My doctor told me she never heard of anyone having these symptoms, but I have to put it back in two separate occassions because I felt the estrogen drop and it was a nightmare.  Don't know how I will ever get off of HRT. What a nightmare.

Although I seem to have attained a bigger middle, weight has stayed around the same but the waistline is bigger. Do you think that is because of Estring?  
Other	canada, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	3/17/2008 11:40:59 AM	I used this for 4 months for vaginal atrophy, while it did correct that problem it caused others, it caused bowal inflammation and vaginal inflammation. It was as if my body was rejecting it. My abdominal and back pain was so bad I had to take it out. Toxic shock syndrome can be, all be it rare, an end result of this. The theory and convenince is good but I can't see how anything foreign can stay in your body all the time without causing problems, especially in moist tissue. I would not use this product again.
