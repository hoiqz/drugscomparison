Rectal Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	7/2/2012 6:48:10 PM	Found it is very important to wash all the parts to this medicine or the medicine will come out under the tip and waste. Had bleeding for over a month using it 2 times daily. Went up to 3x daily and it stopped the bleeding in 1 day.

I have found nothing over-the-counter that works. Proctofoam HC shrinks/heals hemroids if used properly. It is, however OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE. I cannot imagine why one little cortesone foam dispenser should cost $75-$100 or more.

It is somewhat effective but VERY EXPENSIVE!  Also, foam constantly  leaks out of the applicator wasting it. I called the company but they were not helpful in replacing the drug.  I contacted my doctor and my health organization to complain about the poor dosage delivery. UNACCEPTABLE AND EXPENSIVE TOO!!
Rectal Disorder	jj, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	5/11/2010 4:16:22 PM	After giving birth I developed hemorrhoids. Although I still have them, this medication has made me more comfortable. It has a numbing sensation and soothes the area. My only complaint is that the foam sometimes leaks out of the applicator wasting it. It was also expensive, even with insurance. But it has provided some much need relief.

The number of uses you get from a 10g canister is inconsistence...I got ~25 uses from one canister and only 10 from another.  I contacted the makers customer service about the normal number of uses and never got a reply.  If they can't answer a simple question then they won't get my money.

I've found the two active ingredients over the counter which I can easily combine and apply, works as effectually and costs 1/5th the price.
Anal Itching	Happy Camper, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	35-44	11/12/2009 3:24:02 AM	My first minor internal hemeriod. The whole area was itching and waking me at night. This drug was immediate relief with a slight numbing effect. Love it so far. 1st application before bed, let's see how this works. If your itchy or burning, this works  
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	2	Female	25-34	10/23/2009 6:53:08 AM	I have been taking Proctofoam twice a day for three weeks and have experienced virtually NO relief - I'm still uncomfortable, going to the bathroom is still a painful process, and the area is still highly inflamed.   Like 'tiny dancer,' who reviewed above, I have very painful hemorrhoids as well as an anal fistula that leaves me feeling pain all of the time. I dread going to the bathroom and I almost always bleed, even several minutes following. After such great reviews of Proctofoam I was hoping for better results.

Rectal Disorder	Tiny dancer, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	3	Female	19-24	10/25/2008 3:07:36 AM	  I currently have an anal fissure which feels like I'm giving birth through my rectum each time I have a bowel movement. This is the most pain I've ever gone through, and it's EVERYDAY! Proctofoam really hasn't made much of a difference for me. I still am in excruciating pain. I feel like the topical lidocaine the doc gave me numbed the area better. I hope this helps!

Luckily my doctor prescribed this medication and it really worked miracle. It really took a lot of suffering away.

It does burn a little for a few moments after using it, but it works great to relieve the pain from painful hemmroids and fissures.
