Ringworm of Scalp	Jenzerbi, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	5	3	Female	3-6	8/22/2012 11:09:58 AM	My 4 yr old just started taking this 3 days ago. He complaned of a head ache... But then it goes away. I am very worried because I have noticed his mood change... He becomes hyper after taking it and has started to get in trouble at his school. Which has never happened. His teacher mentioned this to me yesterday. I don't know where I stand with this med. I may discontinue it and just use topical cream. Though it is on his scalp and its hard to put cream on each one. He has one big one that oozes out and others that are very small. I am so frustrated!

She most likely picked the fungus up from our local public pool and we have been dealing with this since the beginng of July 2010. We are seeing very noticable changes on her scalp.  She is getting her hair back and it is staying in even after being brushed.(before the meds. her hair would come back and upon brushing would fall right back out).  We are also using a fungal shampoo, Keto 2%.  The only problem I have had with my daughter was getting her to take the medication, the flavor it comes in is a orange and has a bitter taste.  She would make her-self vomit after she was given the oral medication.  There were no other medications available to her so we had to get it down her somehow.  We put it in juices, ice cream, pudding.  You name it and she found it everytime.  I went to our local Walgreen's and they were able to change the taste by adding bubble gum flavoring to it.  It was the BEST $2.99 I ever spent.  She takes it now with no fuss what so ever.  We have had no side effects at all.  The medication MUST be taken with fatty foods this helps the body to absorb the medication.  Ringworm is easy to catch and hard to get rid of.  It is a long treatment, so stick with it.  As soon as you think it is gone and stop treatment it will come right back.  Check with your Doctor before you stop treatment.

Ringworm of Scalp	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	2/19/2010 8:23:56 PM	My six year old daughter contracted ringworm of the scalp somehow from school. Her pediatrician put her on this for six weeks. It has progressively gotten worse! Its scabby and seaps liquid sometimes. Its painful for her to brush hair and even getting bald spots. It has been a very hard experience. After six long weeks of this medication, she has just changed her to another today which she will have to take for a month. I only pray this works better!

She caught this nasty fungus, and I don't know how because she is not in school/daycare. I find it very effective;however, it does take long to treat almost 8 weeks to be exact. I was also given Nixoral to help speed up getting rid of this nasty fungus.

Before, His ring worm would heal then comeback again. This morning when we got up I check his scalp the blister are going away and he said it was not hurting him anymore. he did complain of a slight headache and felt a little warm, i'm not sure if that is side effect related. I do enjoy how easy it is to use.

See no difference yet but doc did say she needed to be on it for 2 months to make sure it clears up.  Ringworms don't look like they use to.  Hers look like scabs instead of rings and her hair is still there.  Have to give the meds with fatty foods or milk or your child will have diarrhea but mine has not had any yet.
