Bipolar Depression	luluroberts57, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/5/2012 1:08:06 PM	I have been using the delayed released 1500mg for about over 15 years. I have tried other meds with no success. It is not a cure all, but no med is. I have no more anxiety, but I do deal with depression from time to time. I also take klonopin when the anxiety comes on.

Rapid Cycle Manic-Depression	moonkittyleo2002, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	25-34	5/7/2012 8:03:08 PM	I take 1500 mg every night before bed and it definatly makes me tired. If I dont go to bed soon I nod out. Most of the time I am still manic but thats more enjoyable then depression. If I drink to much with it the next day I'm more depressed. When I wake up in the morning I usually feel well rested. The bad thing is I get side efects I don't like: When I first tried the pills it felt like it was zapping my brain I would get a real quick zap like feeling in my head as if it were killing brain cells. LOL that only lasted a few days thank God cause it freaked me out, Loosing more hair than usual when I shower or brush my hair, some drowsiness, some nausea,some dizziness, I've noticed my skin seems blotchy or lacy at times, but I dont know if its related. I have real bad tremor, I cant find words sometimes and loose my train of thought frequently, I feel dazed alot, And I can feel my heart beating alot and it seems so fast, last time I checked it was 96 bpm and I was resting. Blood pressure has been a little high also. I dont know if all of these side effects are from Depakote because I also take other medicines as well. But if any of you exp. the same ones then it probably is this medication. my brother in law also takes this for grandpa seizers or whatever there called and he takes alot of mg but if he drinks to much he will still get a siezure.

I don't know what launched me into a manic crisis, but it was very severe. Well, I suppose I do know; it was a series of health problems that included hospitalization that were not related to my mental health.But Depakote ER stabilized me somewhat within two days and fully within four. This is keeping in mind that those I love were considering calling 911 and putting me in the emergency mental health system my mania was so bad.

I went from being violent and suicidal to functional and content. Highly recommend it. Only problem was it caused me to shake quite bad but after slightly lowering my dose and adding welbutrin I feel almost normal most of the time.

Amazingly, instead of gaining weight I've dropped 6 pants sizes. The medicine has caused me to become somewhat depressed though. It helps with my seizures some. I still have a seizure from time to time. Hopefully more seizure patients give a review of this medicine.

This medication helped both. You have to tweak your dose to get to the right amount. Make sure you get your blood levels checked too. That can help you determine if you are at a healthy dose. Overall, a great drug. It has kept me from going off the deep end MANY times.

I was a year getting my liver rid of some of the fatty deposit build up. My doctors solution was to double my dosage. I got a new doctor. 12 years later I still have liver function issues and have it tested every 3 months. I consider it dangerous although it is commonly used. I was hospitalized in April and they tried to give it to me by iv. Good thing I was awake. It might have ruined my liver for good.

My photosensitive epilepsy and to help control my schizoaffective disorder. I have been on my medication now for almost 12 years to help reduce my seizures. I gained some weight with this med, but mixed together with Geodon, I just ballooned up. I've slowly been losing the weight now for a few years, and am now on a higher dose. I was on 1,000mg and now am on 1,500mg because stress caused my seizures to come back. The new dose also really keeps me calm. I love it. I'm more relaxed and less irritable now.

I am taking a whole lot of other medications. I was taking Depakote ER for years a while ago at 1500mg. It worked okay, but my other meds weren't right. I stopped it. I have some new meds and now I take 1000mg of Depakote ER and it seems to help with not only my mania, but my anxiety too. I think it's definitely worth it, if you find the right combo.
Bipolar Depression	Burningbrightly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	5/14/2011 11:50:08 PM	I fall on the &quot;Bipolar II&quot; scale and have historically managed my symptoms with Depakote, Zoloft and Topamax.  I also keep a mood chart (downloadable for free in the app store), quit drinking alcohol years ago but begrudgingly gave up the ghost on my favorite lattes.  I have a 'manic' protocol (take some seroquel, step away from the credit cards...) and a 'depressed' protocol (guaranteed endorphine/laugh producing gems).  2 months ago I had to give up Zoloft because I was concerned it was kicking me manic, then depressed.  Now you have some background.  Depakote makes me feel closest to 'my old self' as in, my true personality.  I have been through so many medications off and on since my teens, and was off meds altogether for my young adulthood thinking it was a misdiagnosis.  My biggest complaint is getting the dosage right, and therein lies the rub:  the weight gain, in my opinion makes it a moving target.  I've outgrown two dress sizes in the five years I have been on medication for bipolar disorder.  The greatest weight gain I've seen is with Depakote.  I take other medications (Topamax) as a 'booster' but it also supposedly prevents weight gain.  I haven't seen any assistance this last time around, which is frustrating.So, yes, Depakote works on my symptoms, but the side effects are basically people asking me &quot;haven't you had that baby yet?&quot;.

Have RLS since taking these, but ill take RLS over the rest of my problems anyday! i get slightly racey thoughts at night and some anxiety but i think its time for my meds to get upd again (every 6months for depakote lvls) this has been a miracle pill for me

Manic-Depression	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female		5/1/2011 10:53:43 PM	F*** this pill! A few months after I had my son I had PPD, and had a breakdown over relationship problems. Instead of letting me cry it out in my room, I was hauled off to a mental hospital, where the doctor gave me this along with a cocktail of other meds. I gained almost 60 pounds in less than 3 months. I went to my family doctor, and she told me that this medication made me blow up like a balloon. After I had my son, I lost 30 pounds very quickly and was the &quot;smallest&quot; I had been in a long time, but now I still have about 28 more pounds to lose before I can get back to my pre-Depokote weight. :( Never let anyone put you on this medication!

I switched to Depakote ER in 2004, and have had my longest continuous time without seizures (7 years) compared to any other Rx (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol).I gained more weight with my antidepressant (Remeron) than with Depakote.  Depakote ER is great, and you only have to take it (brand) once per day.I cam getting ready to try generic, with some reservations, because I recently lost good health insurance coverage.Dale HowardAtlanta, GA

Lamictal worked well, but when I lost insurance coverage, couldn't afford it.  Started Depakote ER for approximately 5 years. I take 1000 mg in the morning and another 1500 mg at night.  I don't like it.  I'm tired all of the time and have gained 50 pounds.  I have difficulty remembering things.  I still have seizures at least 1 to 2 times a month and worry about liver problems from the drug.  My doctor doesn't want to change the drug right now because, he said it would be difficult for me to transition from this drug to another without it causing me many more seizures in between.  After 10 years (since I was 11), I'm still searching for a drug that will keep me seizure-free so I can at least drive.  Wish I could find something that would really work, without the awful side effects.  I really wish for a miracle...that they would mysteriously vanish and never return.

Was hospitlized for dehydration and the doctor told me it was not due to the medication, but it took 3 other doctors and scope procedures to tell me it was the depakote causing this after vomiting for several weeks. Doctors (neurologists) should know this that is who put me on it.

I had never had migraine pain in my life, although I have had visual migraines for as long as I can remember.My neurologist started me out on Gabapentin.  That stopped the headaches, but I was dizzy all the time.  He had me stop taking the Gaba, and I was still dizzy.  That's when he decided it was basilar migrainus.He had me start taking Dabakote ER 500mg.  I haven't been dizzy since the first day, and only rarely have barely noticeable headache.  I have put on a few pounds in the past two months.  Need to get more exercise.

I also take 100mg Topamax and 100mg of Lamictal two times a day. These products seem to work very well. The Depakote has taken most of the migrane away from me. I am very happy for all of this work from these drugs, which was from an accident and major surgery. So the major problem I have now is this. This week I ended up in the hospital with alot of pain in my left side of my chest up to my neck. They found now heart problem. Which I am glad to hear now. But I do imagine there could be many issues and problems involved here. Let me know if anyone has had anything like this. Thanks,Jim

I have been given every medication out there for getting rid of a migraine once I have one, none of them work. I was put on Inderal, and it reduced my Chronic headaches greatly, but I still had Migraines about once a week, which really messed with my job. My doctor then added Topomax, I couldnt really tell you how it did with the migraines, because I had every side effect it list, I literally became crazy. So I was switched to Depakote ER to take along with the Inderal LA, it worked great, I went from 4 migraines a month, to 1 or 2 a year. However, I gained over 20lbs the first year, and was always tired. I had to go off of the Depakote a few months ago, because I am trying to get pregnant, and my husband says that I am nicer/less irritable since I went off of it, and oddly, my migraines have not come back as bad as they were before I started taking it. However, I am starting to have anxiety attacks, not positive if they are directly related to the stopping of the Depakote though.

One, I do find the pills hard to swallow with water, so I use OJ. Two, the side affects can be depressing at times. Whether it's weight gain, fatigue, changes in vision, mood swings, memory loss, diarhea (sp?), and most prevalent, tremors. I do take propanolol (sp?) to help offset the tremors, but I have yet to notice any huge improvement. All said, it's better than having a seizure. Both for me and the ones around me.

I'm sure i gained about 10 pounds on the medication. I understand they usually prescribe this for patients with bipolar disorder, but I swear, it gave me severe mood swings.

Worked well for a while upon first diagnosis of BP Disorder. Same doc switched me to Seroquel, and I turned into a drooling, non-stop sleeping, weight gaining blob-hated Seroquel, never felt like &quot;myself&quot;, and always in a fog. Switched psychs, one with a healthy disdain for Seroquel; prescribed Divalproex ER. At first, felt ecstatic; then the tremors started-hands &amp; voice-so he tacked on some Clonazepam for my tremors, short-fuse, and out of control anxiety disorder. Saw the doc yesterday, July 24, and he raised my Divalproex &amp; Clonazepam doses so's to fall more in line with weight to med ratio, as I'm still having severe mood swings. I was reminded, the last time I stopped taking my meds altogether and was on the verge of suicide, that I must commit to my mental health treatment &amp; that I'll always be on meds. The mood swings I have now are nothing like what I experience unmedicated-I don't like, understand and fear that person; it's all a matter of working with my (your) psych-though it does/can take a lot of time to find what works best for each one of us.

It increased my appetite. As a result, I gained over 40 lbs in the 3 years I was on it. My libido was non-existent, I was always tired, I was highly irritable, and STILL kept getting migraines. It wasn't until I requested a copy of my labs be sent to my Primary doctor, that I found out that my Liver profile was that of someone who was about to go into liver failure. My primary doctor demanded I stop taking it immediately and go to the specialist to request a different medication. Needless to say, he seemed to think my primary doctor and I were undermining his expertise and reluctantly agreed to cease the medication, but had no other replacements. Bottom line, I don't think it was worth the serious effects to my personal, physical, and sexual aspects of my life. Not to mention the expense ($150 for a 3 month supply).

Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	4/7/2010 2:47:07 PM	This medicine was prescribed for my 16 year old daughter when lamictal didn't work alone anymore. From the 3rd day she was sick with violent vomitting, double vision, dizziness and vivid nightmares. We ended up in the emergency room because of this. The side effects were so bad she was totally dehydrated that they could not even get blood drawn from her because her veins were to tiny from dehydration. She had 2 bags of saline just to be able to walk again because she was so weak.(she was like a baby that could not hold their head up) The diagnosis ended up being it was inflaming the lining of her stomach. (keep in mind that this was the lowest dose possible 250mg).While the medicine stopped the seizures, the side effects were a nightmare. She wanted to die because of so much pain and said she would much rather have seizures than deal with that. I would just recommend to people taking this, that you keep a close watch for serious side effects. It may work for one but not another but please be your own advocate and ask a lot of questions. I did most of my research on google and web md,and talked to pharmacists. Good luck and God Bless everyone who has to deal with this, it is a hard condition to handle.

Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/25/2010 10:48:15 PM	I have lived with Bipolar since my teens. Went into hospital and am on 1500mg a day. No weight gain (dr. ordered Topomax to help with the weight gain that is reported with Depokote) works great with Zoloft and Nexium for the heartburn and just 75mg of Lamactil I now feel great and it has only been a week.  Was in the hospital for 6 days.  I recomened that anyone who wants to get to the theraputic level quickly be admmitted to the hospital.  It saved my life as I am a very depressive bipolar person. Feel free to email me if you would like to know more or anything about depression or just someone to talk too.  Good Luck to all.  Karrilee@live.com

Convulsive Seizures	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female		1/21/2010 3:04:54 PM	This prescription worked well to completely control my seizures. However, the side effect list is long and daunting. It required me to have monthly blood tests for liver damage and it can be devestating to a pregnancy which was frightening. It has many long-term dangers. I also experienced a lot of weight gain and fatigue. I gained 30 pounds within 2 months of starting it and slightly more in months following. I would consult with the doctor about additional options if available.

I thought I had Parkinson's. I also gained 15 lbs. Felt like nothing mattered. I wasn't as good a mom b/c I didn't react to anything. Also, my triglycerides went over 500, which can cause pancreatitis. I saw here that Depakote can cause that. It is possibly fatal. I've stopped taking it. My shrink isn't happy, but I'm alive. I just take my Pristiq and risperdal (anti-psychotic) and I feel more like myself again.
Epileptic Seizure	Juan's mom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/18/2009 9:34:18 AM	My son was diagnosed at 4 with epilepsy, he was put on depakote and it had to be adjusted frequently before he had a 2 year stretch of no siezures, but it did give him anger and depression issues. The nuerologist weened him off and in less then 2 weeks off the depakote he had another siezure. Though the depakote worked I was skepitical about putting him back on it because his behaviors at now 7 years old had gotten much worse and was conflicting in school and home. He has recently been put on keppra which til now has relieved him of the anger and depression and the siezures. He has very little side effects to date on the keppra.

It helped me almost immediately. I have not had any weight gain but I have experienced hair loss which can get a little scary! :) I tried Abilify one day and went straight back to Depakote (made me very sore all over). I was taking 1000 mg around 8 or 9 pm and was very sedated when I woke up so I moved my dose to 4 or 5 pm and now it works great!

It has helped stabilize my moods tremendously.  I am also possibly bipolar and it seems to have helped for that as well.  I've been having more mood swings lately so my md just upped to 2000mg ER a day.  I've had no side effects and the drug seems to have worked very well.

Depakote ER is like a miracle for me. As long as I take the prescibed dose, I never have seizures. I did suffer from fatigue the first month or two but once my body got used to it, no more. It's simple, I only have to take it one time a day as opposed to other medications that need to be taken precisely serveral times a day or else you will have a sharp decrease in blood levels leading to seizures. The only negative thing I can say about it is that it's far too expensive.

This alone controlled my seizures and I only take 250 mg 2 times a day.  There is now a generic out Divalproex and it is working.  May affect my liver a bit over time so make sure to keep an eye on it.  I know Depakaine the original form from 1983 gave me jundice (wiped out and my eyes turned yellow). This form has a coating which helps it so do not break it in half whatever you do because this medicine is powerful.  I know when my medicine gets low because I bruise easier now.  I'm in AZ now but when I lived in CT (East Coast) I only needed 250 Mg to control my seizures.  Believe the seizures were inherited.

She took me off of my Lexipro at that time, I have been a basket case for the two weeks I have been on it.  I sleep like Im in a coma, and miss important appointments because of that. I dont think this is the right medication for me and I hate the &quot;out of control&quot; feeling that accompanies it.

It was not stabilizing my mood very well, so my doctor increased my dose.  Before I had to stop taking it, I was taking 1500 mg, which is a pretty high dose.  It caused me to have slowed speech and caused me to stay in bed all day.  I didn't really feel bad from it, but I didn't realize that it was having these effects on me until someone pointed them out.  This medication kept my manic phases under control, but was far too sedating, which may have been due to such a high dose.

Caused severe pain in knees, ankles, wrists and hand swelling. I had to take pain meds because of the side effects. Just switched to Carbmazepine 100mg at night.

Somehow, I've managed not to apply for disability but have had trouble with employement and school. I've been to several doctors and specialists over the years in different states, (a chiropractor, ear nose &amp; throat specialist, acupuncturist, psychiatrist, 3 neurologists prior to this one) and have been on everything from Midrin, Inderal, Elavil, Wellbutrin and Topamax.  150 mgs of Topamax seemed to reduce my migraines but had to deal w/terrible sharp pains in my hands and feet. I maintained a weight of 123-126. I stopped the Topamax when I learned I was pregnant. I tried resuming it when I was done breastfeeding but it didn't work any more &amp; I dropped 12 lbs in a month. After trying Inderal and Elavil (made me light-headed &amp; sleepy), I tried Depakote ER 500mg. Within 2 months, it seemed to reduce my headaches to functioning level but I was always hungry. Then during 1 of the most stress-free times of my life, they flared up w/a vengeance. My PCP and neuro incr. my dose to 1000mg. 5 months from when I first started this medication, I'm already 7lbs heavier and not seeing any improvement. I'm going to try seeing a neuromuscular dentist next. The trade-off doesn't seem right. Its expensive from what I hear but I've tried everything else. OH and I feel it has decreased my sex drive dramatically as well.

The Migraines were dibilitating. I could not do anything when I would get one It was as if I was having seizures. I went to three different Neurologists and got the same diagnosis from all three. One of the Doctors put me on Depakote 1000 mgs a day and the migraines stopped. I felt the best I had felt in years. I am now taking 500 mgs a day.  My problem is the weight gain. I have gained around 50 lbs since taking the medication. I tried to go off Depakote and tried Topamax and it was the worst experiance in my life.  I had every severe side effect on the list. I am hoping that someone reading this will perhaps give me some suggestion as to what other medication I could take.  I have tried to go off on my own a few times and within two days I start getting the headaches and dizzy and feel awful and have to start taking it again. HELP

My life has improved in ways I couldn't even imagine.  I have been completely seizure-free for three years now and I am so happy!!  This has been a real blessing!!
Migraine Prevention	KK, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	2/16/2009 12:45:39 AM	I'm a 50 year old &quot;white collar&quot; male &amp; have had migraines since I was in my 20's - these have steadily gotten worse over the years. One year ago I was getting about one migraine every other day &amp; would never go a day without some level of bad headache. I have been on most preventive drugs that exist &amp; now take a few acute ones as needed.  Also have gone through every test possible (like a sleep study, head &amp; neck CAT &amp; MRI scans, etc.), even tried acupuncture &amp; chiropractics for treatment but they failed to help. About 9 months ago I started on a 1,000 mg night time dose of Depakote ER, am now at 2,000 mg. Not totally impressed with the results so far - still getting daily big headaches &amp; the migraines are now stretched out to 3 days instead of 2 days. The downside is there are 2 annoying side effects: have gained 10 pounds &amp; getting tremors in my arms &amp; legs periodically, especially after physical stress like mild exercise (not too bad I guess). The upside is it helps me sleep better. My neurologist wants me to stay at this dose for another 3 months to see what effect it has, so I'm doing so. On a side note, my Dr. (who I trust) is a big believer in multiple meds at one time as studies show they can compliment one another, so I'm also on Gabitril 8 mg &amp; Tizanidine 6 mg &amp; Migralief 2 per day (non-prescription). Hope this info helps others.

I have temporal epilepsy and a brain tumor that causes me to have episodes of aggression, confusion and what can be best described as emotional dysresgulation and perceptual distortions. I am rapidly gaining a stability of affect that I have never had before in my life, and my sleep is normalizing. I have only recently started this medication, but the benefits I am realizing are improving my life in ways that are unreal. I am thankful for this medication, and am on my way to FINALLY being able to have a life that I feel I am in control of, as well as freedom from crippling mood swings, confusion and fear that was making my life a living hell. The only side effect so far has been a 5 lb. weight gain and some G.I. distress (cramps and loose bowels), which is a trade off that I am more than happy to take.

I had been having major rage episodes-screaming, crying, punching holes in walls, etc. I was also having severe mood swings. The Depakote is the only thing that keeps me stable. If I stop taking it or miss a dose, it is immediately noticeable. I take 500 mg. in the AM and 1000 mg at bedtime. I have not had a lot of side effects. I have increased appetite and gained a lot of weight (25 pounds in 6 months), and developed hypothyroid. However, I started taking Cymbalta right around the same time, so I'm not sure which drug caused the side effects. Anyway, I have had a lot of success with Depakote.

It took many months for the doctors to diagnos him with bi-polar. Hes been on it for about 7 months and its working. Sometimes it gives him mood swings, but the worse side effect of all is the increased appetite/weight gain. Im guessing hes gained at least 30 lbs since starting Depakote.

However, it makes me very depressed. I mean curled up in a ball crying depressed. Plus my hands are like ice and my whole torso area is in pain. Does anyone have a suggestion for another med?

I was having migraines so bad that I had to go to the ER and get a CAT scan to find out what was wrong. Nothing was helping until my pysch doctor put me on depakote. The first few nights they were still there just less severe and now almost a month later I am pleased to say that I am almost migraine free. What a relief that is to anyone who has migraines. Now I wish we could get the mania under control.

Last summer I had a migraine I treated with everything the doctor could throw at me.  Following a trip to the ER, once again the migraine returned within 4 hours.  I consulted with a neurologist who started me on depakote.  I was releived overnight of the migraine.  I have had considerably less frequency of migraines and less severe while taking depakote.  The only side effect I have experienced is sleepiness.

I'm more interested in how it works in the brain.  And since I can't give out an email - I'll have to get info elsewhere.  I have been on Depakote ER for about 10 yrs now with no serious side effects.  My Dr's have recently lowered it by 1/4 which is nice but my usual dosage is or was 1000mg once per evening.  I was told thats a lot.  So I am looking into how this works exactly and what kind of damage I may have or what chemicals I am missing or whatever.  I want more info - as much as possible on this medication.  I would love it if you would put more information on it like what I am interested in on-line.  I'm sure others may be interested as well.  I love webmd.  I check this site out a lot - very informative.

Other than the weight gain, and some mild hair loss, I have adjusted to the meds fairly well. My only complaint is the hand tremors. I am a service tech, and I use my hands all day long. I reccomend this drug even with the side effects, I just watch what I eat to control the weight, and as for the hair, well I am just learning to live with it. However, I could do without the hand tremors.

Used to take in conjunction with Prozac, but the tremors were too unbearable. I'm only 21, but the medicine has caused minor bald patches and a weight gain of about 20+ pounds since I started taking it two years ago. I have been diagnosed as being bipolar I with rapid cycling, and my last episode was a few weeks ago. This medicine isn't perfect, but it does help me get through the day. I'm sure I'll try something else, but right now, even with the crappy side effects, I'm in a good place.
Migraine Prevention	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	11/1/2008 8:17:56 PM	I have had migraines for as long as I can remember, and first starting taking Topamax for prevention.  Worked great for migraines but made me crazy!  I had mood swings, anxiety, trouble speaking, terrible cough, etc. My neurologist put me on Depakote 6 months ago and it is not as effective as Topamax at migraine prevention, but I have none of the terrible side effects.  I do have bizarre dreams, and have gained 30-40 pounds, although my diet has not changed.  But what's the trade off?  Constant pain?  My vanity is not as important as being able to function!

Side effects now are non-existent as I adjusted over time.  This medicine is the best.  It crushes the anxiety and nervousness I always had.  It makes me calm psychologically but physically I want to move around.  I have found taking it 3x a day at 250 is better than 750 at one time.  It works better.  I take a multi-vitamin and my hair is thick.  My cognition is fine.  It's been a life saver.

It has kept my hypomanic episodes under control while the Effexor XR keeps my depression in check. The only thing I do not like about Depakote is the weight gain. I am constantly hungry and have gained 80 lbs since starting this medication. Even when working a physically demanding job (climbing, constant moving) I could not lose weight.

Always being put on Depakote, now it was switched to Depakote ER, 1500 mg in the a.m. and 1500 mg in the p.m. I have found my hands and arms trembling quite often, not being able to sleep well in the night time and up early in the morning too much, leaving me to fall asleep during the day. I don't like my doctor and I feel a second opinion is evident. I will say the plus of the meds is I went through Abbott Labrotories and I get free meds, as you know how expensive they are!!!

However, I think that Depakote should be taken very seriously and never mixed with any type of alchol, as it could be dangerous. There has been weight gain and I have noticed some burning at times, during a BM. I take vitamins and calcuim to thicken my hair. I take 1500 mg @ nite with a cup of warm milk, and a couple crackers or a banana. I had an experience in 1998 with the Old Depakote and a drug called Klonapin. I got lost in the country driving. I took my children to a private Hay Ride at a Farm and went to a party that I thought was for the public, and I was so embarrassed! It was really fun though and we got a tour of the dairy cows and everything! We were even bobbing apples! The people were really nice, then they asked me who we were and said my children were so wonderful. Then I realized it was the Klonapin. Overall I'm pleased with Depakote ER and it really helps me. 
Migraine Prevention	moonium, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/5/2008 8:45:10 AM	I am a 54 yr old female who is bi-polar with recent diagnosis of possible seizures (I have a neurologist appointment coming up). I was on lithium which helped me but with bad side effects (hair loss, trembling, etc). I put up with the side effects because it helped me. My doctor took me off of it a month ago due to me being in stage 3 of 5 kidney failure and started me on Depakote ER 1000 mg/day. I take this before going to bed. The first two mornings I had a slight headache upon awakening. I have to rave about this drug at this point. For the first time in my life, my brain feels like one brain. It is so calm and peaceful. I feel rested. My mind no longer bounces around. I like to describe it as my brain resting on a nice cushy cloud. I have not seen any negative side effects and hope I don't (weight gain, tremors, etc). I do however, believe it is wearing off before 24 hours. Around 8 or 9 PM I start feeling some anxiety, brain &quot;not so calm&quot;, and sometimes a little depression.I highly recommend Depakote ER based on my experience.

I have battled depression and anxiety for a few years and been on and off Lexapro.  This new guy gives me the depakote and I don't think it will help my symptoms.  The first day it made me feel very nervous and jittery.  I am then to take remeron at bedtime which puts me to sleep, on top of cymbalta and anxiety meds.  I just feel the dr. really jumped the gun prescibing this medication to me.  I don't want to continue taking it.

Manic Phase of Manic-Depression	 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	3	3	4			6/16/2008 10:35:55 PM	In January of 2008 I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. My doctor prescribed me Depakote ER for my manic moodswings and at first I found it really helpful. The third month I was on it I noticed that it wasn't helping me anymore. I couldn't sleep at night, the racing thoughts were back, i became very paranoid at night right before i would go to bed and i would still have my manic episodes. As of right now, im not taking anything and Im trying to take one day at the time. My doctor assured me that depakote would not make me gain weight like other medicines and it didn't, i didnt gain one pound the couple of months i was on it, i guess everyone experiences different side effects.

My on-going shaking hasn't gone away and my panic attacks have increased ever since I started taking it. My doctors wouldn't listen to me, but deep inside I know it's the wrong drug for me... and I've been on many kinds of medication for the past 8 years!

Depakote not only robbed me of some of my prime years because I was in a slumber state and unable to articulate my cocoon state but left me in a deep haze. I should not have been driving but that is when I hit a pedestrian in a cross walk mind you and it left my family in horror that we could be sued for every penny we own for the next three years until they settle. I never felt right on Depakote. I lost concentration and they kept increasing the dose after my blood work was not registering high enough. Finally, I left school and left my doctor and Depakote! If you are a loved one reading this sometimes a loved one needs your help with medication when they are being over medicated...

After all the years of being on SSRIs that put me in a hypomania phase, this medication has been a godsend. I also think as a healthcare professional that Depakote works better for bipolar type 2.

But do not have insurance, was costing me $250 a month. Stopped taking it, and now my hair is falling out, racing thoughts back, cant afford to start again.

First used 10 years ago 1500mg with good results,only noticable side effect-hand tremors symptoms tolerable when dropped to 1000mg. At age 35 I'm back on Depakote ER 2000mg/daily for migraine prevention which it has worked wonders for. I have not seen any improvement this time around with my severe depression. Side effects were intolerable WEIGHT GAIN!!45lbs in &lt;4 mos. SEVERE hair loss. I also take Lyrica since 12/06 and recently began Lithium 2wks ago. Though the other meds can cause similar side affects, to me, the timimg of being on Depakote ER leads me to believe it is the culprit of these intolerable side effects, and therefore I am weaning off the medicine.

Other	pauline, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	2/28/2008 11:09:24 PM	I was given this drug as I was hospital as I could not stop crying.  The doctor did not really listen to me and prescribed me this drug.  I was sick every morning and it actually came out in my bowel movements, however it still elevated my liver and I only was on it for six days.  I will say that this is not a good drug to be on and it should be only give to those who really need it.  I really feel better without it. Just make sure you get your liver checked before taking this medication and make sure you follow up with the tests.

Other	MJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	35-44	1/23/2008 2:34:50 PM	Although this medication was very effective for reducing the headaches I was having on a daily basis (caused by flourescent lights), the side effects were not tolerable.  As a 42 year old female I was losing my hair by the handfuls, lost 13 lbs., and since the medication is extremely hard on your liver I felt terrible and sluggish all the time.  I am 5'-7&quot; and was 125lbs at the time so losing 13 lbs was not ideal for me.  Because of these side effects I immediately sought holistic approaches to getting my hair back, turning around my liver and adrenal function, and gaining a few pounds.  I now still have the headaches but after talking with my doctor am again thinking of trying this medication in a lower dosage.  Another option is a holistic approach to repairing the neurotransmitters.  I'm still investigating this &quot;cure&quot;.

The combination of medications that I am on is helping a lot.  They include Depakote, Lamictal, and Paxil.  I am noticing that my hair is thining, but I am 38 and maybe it is just age.  I do notice tremors of the fingers and hands. Especially using fine motor skills. I am glad that I am on medication. Life without them was hell.

I am a 21-year-old college student that was diagnosed with bipolar disorder this year.The combination has worked well for me. I have been stable enough throughout the fall semester and into winter break to make vast improvements to my quality of life through one-on-one therapy.I have been on one form of anti-anxiety/depression drug or another for the past four years, and this has been the most effective.My thoughts still race at times and I can have feelings of extreme happiness that affect my sleep, but they are manageable. As are the lows.I would reccommend the drug.

Other	Marciahill, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	12/20/2007 1:50:10 PM	I have been taking Depakote ER (1500 mg) for several months now.  I have noticed that my hair is falling out and my hands shake.  I have told this to my doctor and he said it's from drinking coffee. I cut back on the coffee but the symptoms are getting worse. He did some blood work, checking my liver and kidneys, the test came back that I didn't have a build up of the Depakote ER.  However, I can't handle have to use to hands just drink something or eat something.  I don't know how to get him to listen to  me. I don't have manic episodes, tho he says that my occasional panic attacks are episodes of bi-polar.  I was diagnosed because my mother had severe bi-polar.  My doctor says I have bi-polar traits.  Any comments/help would be greatly appreciated.

Can't say all signs of disequilibrium disappeared forever, it seems to have decreased the frequency and severity tremendously.  also, the only other medicine I take is Vytorin for cholestrol, so I am fairly positive on what I say above, what I mean there are no complications due to other medicines.haven't taken it long enough to talk about side effects, but I'm pretty bald anyway, so that part doesn't bother me, and i haven't notice weight gain yet, and don't know about the liver as I'll be testing that part in a couple of weeks, but haven't done so yet. Haven' taken it long enough

With consistent use of this drug, my incapacitating migraines have dropped from 2-3 a week to perhaps one or two per month. For me, it's been a godsend, with absolutely NO bad side effects. It even helps my insomnia, as I take it at bedtime and it has a calming effect. I can't praise this medication enough!
