Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	OEmG, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/15/2012 1:31:10 PM	I am a 36 yof post meno osteo pt. Reasearch ANY medication! Do NOT let Doctors &quot;bully&quot; you into taking something by scaring you. This medication has felt like my body is going through heavy Chemo treatments. It dibilitates me to the point I have to call in to work ffrom literally sitting there in tears because my clothes are touching me! I am a 911 Dispatcher and a child of a parent of RA-mother passed away 12/08 after fighting the greatest fight Ive ever been privilaged to witness since 1975. I know what dibilitating pain looks like and sounds like. All of these biophos drugs seem to make these exact same side effects, and once more, these doctors say take this or take Reclast---i think NOT! How is a medication that is supposed to help restucture bone density going to aid in the cause of long bone fracture and joint deterioration? Does that make sense FDA??? Im not one who expects results to magically appear by any means, but Im not an imbosile either. if a Physician, who takes an oath to first do no harm, suggest these types of medications, do your research on the medication AND the doctor. They may just be one of MANY geetting kickback from Pharmaceuticals for &quot;pushing&quot; their drugs!
Osteoporosis	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	7/29/2012 8:05:22 PM	MY DOCTOR GAVE ME A FEW SAMPLES.

I CALLED AND TOLD THE DOCTOR ABOUT MY REACTION TO THIS DRUG.   WILL NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG AGAIN.   
Osteoporosis	scraftwilliams@cs.com, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	7/4/2012 11:53:40 PM	I took 1st sample of this medicine 2 weeks ago on a Sunday. Within twelve hours I experienced severe abdominal pain that lasted throughout the week. Went to work on Monday, left early, stayed in bed all day Tuesday and returned to work with pain Wednesday. I called Doctor, who suggested I try it again. I skipped last week, just couldn't make myself take it again. After much deliberation with myself this week I started second treatment again on Sunday, pain resumed within hours and continues today. It is the 4th of July and I'm not free of pain, and stayed home all day.  Not sure if I will take the third dose next Sunday as the pain does not not appear to be as severe as the 1st dose. Yet the pain is still here.

I had a severe reaction resulting in severe joint pain with swelling of the wrists and hands.  Hands are swollen and hurt horribly.  After the 2nd dose, I called doctor and was told to stop immediately.  Side effects are severe for me!
Osteoporosis	lyndab, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	7/3/2012 5:02:32 PM	Given a sample from doctor as a result of recent bone density test showing ostoeporosis.  Got SERIOUS flu like symptoms, nausea and dizziness caused me to pass out.  The fall could have done more damage than a possible future fracture. I stopped taking after ONE (weekly) pill. DO NOT TAKE

Osteoporosis	Mythology, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	5/29/2012 4:37:25 PM	I have been taking this medication for almost a year now, will have another bone scan in August of this year (2012) to see if it is effective or not. However, the side effect of Atelvia is terrible. The first two months of taking the medication I had a fever every other week. My whole body is achy; my muscle cramp is so painful and it happen so very often that I will have to stop Atelvia next week to see how it goes.
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	Sue, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	4/24/2012 9:11:14 AM	Took my first and only pill on Sunday. Had nausea a few hours later. On Monday had terrible flu like symptoms and ached all over. Chills and fever. I am not going to take this medicine again. Hope it gets out of my system soon. I will stick with supplements. Afraid to try these type of meds. 
Osteoporosis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	4/20/2012 3:52:27 PM	I was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis and was told by my doctor that I had no choice but to start treatment. Atelvia was recommended. I was given a sample dose to start.  After one dose I began having severe body aches &amp; pain in my muscles, bones &amp; joints within 24 hrs.  Felt like I had the flu. Could not eat due to bad stomach pain. Took the maximum dose of extra strength tylenol which didn't help much.  Was afraid to take ibuprofen due to a history of ulcers. Considered going to the ER. Took over a week for side effects to subside. Now the doctor is recommending a trial of Prolia. Not sure I want to take this since I've read many of the side effects are similar and it stays in your system for 6 months.
Other	Jane, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	4/11/2012 7:25:59 PM	I took this drug for several months and didn't realize it was the drug that caused my pelvic pain and pain in my right shin bone until I stopped taking it per my doctor's instructions. Does anyone know how long the residual side effects last?
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	45-54 (Patient) 	1	1	1		45-54	4/8/2012 9:51:24 PM	I took one pill and 24 hrs later I was doubled over in excruciating abdominal and back pain which lasted 36 hours!  I have never taken anything so toxic in my life!
Osteoporosis	Annie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	4/1/2012 2:20:41 PM	This is an update from a posting on 1/8/2012.  I stopped taking Atelvia but had another episode of severe muscle pain three months later - in my other leg.  I do not plan to take any bisphosphonate medications in the future.
Osteoporosis	lucia catayong, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/29/2012 4:36:54 AM	I have used this drug less than a week and the side effects on the medication is right on, pain is 10+ and is a terrible experience.  It is a dangerous drug and should be banned. I do not recommend this medication.  &quot;The benefit does not out weigh the risk!&quot;
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	3/14/2012 2:52:37 PM	I have been taking this for several months. Initially I would have abdominal discomfort a day or two after taking it, but that has subsided. Won't know how effective it is until the next bone scan.
Osteoporosis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	4	Female	55-64	3/5/2012 10:03:14 PM	I have been on this medication for a little over two months with no side effects. I haven't had a bone density scan yet so I don't know it's effectiveness yet. I like being able to eat before taking since I have some stomach issues anyway. I think it helps to lessen the possibility of stomach reactions.
Osteoporosis		1	1	1			2/17/2012 7:37:17 PM	After taking the first pill, 12 hrs. later I was experiencing full-fledged flu symptoms: chills, achy joints, headache, fever...also severe gas in my abdomen (felt like I was being pumped full of helium). Called doc and was told to stop this medication.  I've been in bed for two days; could not live like this every week.
Osteoporosis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/16/2012 1:41:52 PM	I thought I was going to die after taking this medication for only 3 weeks.  All of my joints hurt.  In fact, I lost the use of my middle finger on my right hand for 2 days.  I couldn't walk upstairs because my knees hurt so bad.  I have never had joint pain before this medication.  My bones hurt to the point where I was lying in the bed moaning.  I thought, &quot;this must be what bone cancer feels like&quot;.  My husband said that I was even moaning in my sleep.  The worst thing was the stomach pain.  I took the medication as prescribed with water, after breakfast and then stayed upright the rest of the day.  STILL the stomach pain was almost unbearable.  My doctor said I may have some nausea, but this was way above nausea.  I felt like someone was kicking me in the stomach over and over.  This would go on for 3 days each week I took the medication.  I am still feeling the effects of this medication as I am 4 days into the 3rd dose.  I have decided to stop the medication.  I think the cure is worse than the disease in this case.  
Osteoporosis	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	2/15/2012 1:26:09 PM	I have been on this medication for three weeks and each week I have experienced an aura migraine, first migraine in over one year.  I will quit this medication.

Did not have any side effect with first dose; the second dose I had severe neck pain where if I turned my head, pain radiated to my ears and head; third dose, neck pain but less severe.  I will take the forth dose to see if this side effect resolves itself.  Otherwise, I will discontinue.
Osteoporosis	luffda, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	65-74	1/27/2012 5:13:15 PM	I have taken one dose and have been extreme pain for 4 days. I will not take this again. I think some very serious medical studies should be done to determine the effectivness and horrible side effects!

I was miserable for hours.  The pain subsided in a day or so.  After taking the second pill I had the same results at about the same time.  I then read up on the drug and side effects and will not be taking it any more.  
Decreased Bone Mass Following Menopause	not sure yet, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	12/19/2011 12:07:36 PM	I just recently told by my ob/gyn that my bones are thinning.  She recommended that I start this medication. I only took one dosage (1 pill) but in the follwing days I was sick to my stomach and very, very achy in my chest, shoulders and back that will not go away.  I think I need to give my body a chance to feel better and maybe try again.  If the same type of side effects occur, this will be the last time for me. I have never taken any other kind of medication for this condition. 
Osteoporosis	lorrie, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female		12/16/2011 4:22:34 PM	Started this medication a week ago.  I felt like I had the flu the second day after beginning the therapy..now into my 5th day and my back feels better already.  Will take the second dose and see how I feel this time, but so far I can handle the aching muscles that I experienced the 2nd day after taking.

I was incapacitated for 48 hours as a result of these symptoms.  (despite, famotidine,prilosec, tylenol, tramadol)  To be fair, I had stomach issues 10 years ago and was prepared for possible issues, but the body pain was incredible, and rendered me non-functional.  (i am not whimpy, either) 
Osteoporosis	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	9/19/2011 8:04:10 AM	I have had no problem with this drug.  I like the fact that I can have breakfast before taking.  I was on fosomax and didn't like taking it first thing in the morning with a large glass of water.

Became sick Sunday with flu like symptoms, horrific headache, fever, dizziness and aches. Monday, stomach ache and vomiting. Tuesday and Wednesday, fatigue, heartburn and diarrea. Better on Thursday but exhausted. This is Friday and I feel like I've been beat this week from one little pill. Obviously does not agree with me. 5No, I will not take this medication on Saturday or ever again. 
Osteoporosis	meldoe, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	65-74	8/13/2011 3:28:32 PM	I am on my second week of use.  So far, I have not experienced any of the side effects except a little heartburn on occasion (which went away with a Zantac).  This medication has not been nearly as disagreeable as my last experience (Fosomax) - which gave me severe heartburn all the time.  So far, so good.
Osteoporosis	Meri, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		5/14/2011 9:55:48 AM	I have experienced most of the side effects continually during the 2 weeks trial. I have been miserable so I reported it to my Dr. and we will stop taking the drug for 2 weeks and try again to see if I experience the same side effects.
