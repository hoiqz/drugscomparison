Chronic Trouble Sleeping	PeekabooHope, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/8/2012 10:53:08 AM	I have lived with chrinic back pain for 20 years and then also with Fibro since 2007.  Due to the pain I have trouble sleeping plus restless leg syndrome adds to this and it really makes things bad.  I saw a brochure for Silenor one day in the doc's office and asked if I could try it since it talked about all my concerns (mainly the interrupted sleep intervals).  Within the first nite I could tell that this med was made for me and I was sooooo HAPPY!  The next nites it continued to work and work with NO side effects BUT now there is a problem the manufacturer has STOPPED making this drug and I must look for something else :(  I just switched to Ambien and my first 4 nites were really bad---my feet swelled and I had halluncinations.  I don't know what to do now.  I am really frustrated especially since I had found a medication that had worked.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Ontherange, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/15/2012 1:57:33 PM	I recently have had trouble sleeping but didn't want to get addicted to a drug.  I wanted a drug that wouldn't just knock me out but would actually help me. After hearing horror stories about other drugs from friends and talking to my GP I decided to try Silenor.  I love this drug.  It worked great for me.  I can take it when I need it and then stop with no side effects.  I feel rested and refreshed the next day, no fuzziness or aftereffects that some of my friends have with the other drugs.  I liked the fact that it didn't just knock me out.  When I got up during the night for a trip to the bathroom I was able to go right back to sleep.  I had never taken anything because I didn't want to get addicted to a drug.  Now I have something that helps me sleep in a natural way.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Mary C., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	11/9/2011 11:07:16 AM	I noticed that most reviewers are giving reviews after only a few days on a new medication. I started Silenor after wanting to get off Ambien because I was feeling on the verge of addiction with it. Lunesta did nothing, I gave it the entire month, but never worked. We tried Silenor and did experience some of the same wierd side effects for a few days or a week, but then it slowly but very surely started to work as intended. I sleep longer with it as opposed to Abmien, and I fall asleep softer, not like being knocked out as before. My co-pay is expensive (I got my generic Ambien for nothing) but it's worth not being addicted to a medication. I would recommend patients starting this med to give it more time than just a few days to get the real effect. Then you'll be able to make a far more reasonable choice. Thanks for reading!

Tired ambien, lunesta, ativan, trazadone, remeron, and nothing has worked as well as Silenor with so few side effects.  The biggest side effect from Silenor is drowsiness.  Go figure, that why I'm taking it.  lol

I was getting 3 migraines per week, and on 3 mg. Silenor per night, I am now getting only 1 per week. I can sleep much better and am no longer tensing my muscles at night. It is harder to have an orgasm, and I also have dry mouth, but I am willing to continue with these side effects.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	9/21/2011 6:09:14 PM	I was placed on this medication for middle insomnia, waking at 3am every night and not being able to get back to sleep until 5am and then having to get up for work at 645am. The first night I took 3mg. I fell asleep without any trouble but I was awake at 1am for about an hour and again at 3am for another hour. The second night I took 6mg and slept all night. I thought I had finally found a medication that works. On the third night I took 6mg and went in and out of sleep all night long; I never got down into a deep restorative sleep. I was very tired the next day and had difficulty functioning at work. On the fourth night I took 6mg and was awake at 2am and could not get back to sleep until 5:30am. I was really hoping that this drug would work since my doctor will not prescribe controlled drugs for insomnia for someone my age. I may try it another time on the weekend when I don't have to get up for work, but so far I am not impressed with this drug.

I sometimes have trouble &quot;shutting off&quot; my mind in order to sleep. I have a heart condition and NOT sleeping tends to aggravate it so my cardiologist gave me a sample to try. It did not help me actually get to sleep and since I don't generally have issues with staying asleep, I can't say whether or not it aided in this area. What I can say is the next day I felt foggy, sluggish and down right depressed. It just wasn't worth it for me.

It helps me sleep, but the next day, I feel so dragged out and depressed. I tried 3mg and I didn't stay asleep. Maybe something inbetween 3 and 6 would be better for me.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Suessan, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/19/2011 10:12:05 PM	I have had difficulty sleeping my entire life, only sleeping 2-3 hours on my own and unable to get back to sleep.  Ambien and similar drugs left me too &quot;out of it&quot; to function well at work, plus with concerns of dependence wasn't a good long-term solution.  I improved my eating and exercise habits, but no positive effect on my sleeping.  Did a sleep study with results stating that I had no detected illness (such as apnea) and concluded &quot;Has difficulty sleeping&quot; (not helpful!).  I heard about Silenor and my doctor gave me samples - and my life changes for the better overnight! Using Silenor I regularly sleep 5-7 hours/night and if/when I do wake up, I generally fall back asleep within 30-45 minutes.  Plus no morning &quot;drug hangover.&quot;  It has worked like a charm for me and literally changed my life for the better!

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	pianoplayer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	7/9/2011 1:34:40 PM	I have had trouble sleeping for about four months; Tried Trazodone 50 mg first - was not helping; have been on Ambien 5-10 mg for about 3 months, got me to sleep,was waking up around 3-4 am, never felt like good sleep, also Lunesta for 2 weeks, hated the bitter taste in the mouth afterwards.  Had sleep study taking Lunesta, determined I had sleep maintenance issues.  Took Silenor 3 mg first one time, did not sleep at all, felt terrible the next day.  Told my doc, he wanted me to try the 6 mg.  Tried it one night, my ears were ringing loud, felt I was &quot;wired&quot; - awake all night.  Feeling very tired, groggy the next day.  Have been taking Restoril in between - will go back to this.

I still get up at 4am.  My problem is staying a sleep.  So I am not happy with this medicine at all.

I suffer from insomnia related to symptoms of my MS. After trying nearly everything under the sun , I decided to give this drug a try. I've been on it for a month and still have all three types of insomnia. I find it ineffective.

I have taken this med twice, and it did not help me fall asleep, but definitely got more sleep. I also noticed that it lowers my blood pressur-both numbers significantly-about 25 points. i am also on benazepril.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/13/2011 7:03:12 PM	I've been having trouble sleeping for quite a while.  First I was on Lunesta which worked well but gave me a horrible metallic taste in my mouth which was not worth it to me.  Then I was on Ambien, but no matter how much sleep I got I was still tired all day the next day and could fall asleep at any time during the day.  My doctor gave me some samples of Silenor which has worked really well!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	4/12/2011 12:52:33 PM	I've tried them all and the problem with Ambien and Lunesta is that I was loopy the next morning. At least with Silenor 6 mg here I stay asleep for around 8 hours and wake up without the nasty baggage.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Peppermint Patty, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	55-64	4/6/2011 4:21:26 PM	I just started taking this medication about 3 nights ago because I could fall asleep or stay asleep. The insomia is still there. I find I can sleep very well the next day around 2pm. The remainder of the day I struggle with drowsiness.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Ophelia, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/6/2011 4:42:42 PM	I was given a sample of Silenor after talking with my doctor about my problems with the generic I take for Ambien which was only being able to sleep 4-5 hrs and not being able to fall back to sleep after waking. I took Silenor on friday nite knowing I didn't have to work the next day. Well, Silenor did not help me fall asleep and then when I finally did fall to sleep I had nightmare after nightmare sleeping only maybe 30 minutes at a time. It was the longest nite of my life. I will not take this medication ever again.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	CrocDoc, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	35-44	2/11/2011 1:27:06 AM	I tried Silenor after taking Ambien for several years.  My problem is actually falling asleep, rather than waking up in the middle of the night.  Using Silenor to try to fall asleep is futile.  I did not notice the drug helping me at all with my insomnia.  What it did do was make me groggy the next morning for several hours.  It said not to eat anything for 3 HOURS before taking Silenor; how realistic is that?  Perhaps that was my problem?  Either way I'm going back on Ambien; it works well and is now a generic which makes it way less expensive than Silenor.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Guest, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/31/2011 1:25:11 PM	I was switched off Lunesta because of the bad side effects such as nasty metallic taste in my mouth as well as daytime drowsiness. Silenor has worked well for me in that I can get at least 7 hours of uninterupted sleep without the nasty baggage in the morning. I am on the lowest dose. I can take this everyday without worrying about addiction like Ambien and Lunesta. I choose not to though. What a surprise Silenor is.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	EKC, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/25/2010 12:40:40 PM	After taking silenor for about a month, I realized that I was getting up in the middle of the night and eating sweats, thus packing on the pounds.  After reading the side effects it does mention that people have been known to eat in the middle of the night while not remembering it the next day.  I do remember,  but at least I have now put two and two together on the weight gain and why I was getting up to eat in the middle of the night.
