Migraine Headache	CAM27, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/1/2012 9:46:42 AM	I have taken fiorcet for years.  It is the only drug prescribed to me that gets rid of migraines. I have found that if I take it with a sip of hot coffee or a caffeinated drink such as a Coke it works much better. Make sure you know a migraine is coming on though. This drug can actually give you a headache if you really don't have one.
Migraine Headache	doglover18, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	8/19/2012 10:23:28 PM	If you have started taking this medication then stop now! It did get rid of my headache...but I started getting bounce back headaches within in days and the more of this drug I took the worse the headache became. I have been told to stop taking it by the doctors at the Emergency Room and that it may take up to two months to get out of my system and meanwhile I have to just suffer until it is out of my system. It is highly addicting and hell to get off of. So just stay away from it for good!!
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/17/2012 5:10:29 AM	I have suffered migraines for 40 yrs, Doctors have tried all of the new and improved meds. Nothing worked as quickly as fioricet, last time doc wanted to try something new. I suggested he use it as a suppository, to see how it works. After the laughter he refilled my script. 
Other	Nat, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	35-44	8/11/2012 7:10:58 PM	I've been taking this medication for about a week for cronic back pain and the only thing it does is make me very sleepy.Since I need to be awake during the day but can't seem to stay awake with this med I have no choice but to ask my doctor to give me something else so I can stay awake.This med is not very efective for my back pain and I've noticed that all other posts are for a miagraine hedache so I think my doc made a mistake in prescribing this for lower back pain.I do not recommend this for cronic back pain at all.....

This is the only drug that really works for me. I have no side effects from it. The only draw back is that it will not work for me unless I am having a full blown migraine. If I take it when it is just coming on it has no effect at all

Tension Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/26/2012 8:20:07 AM	I have had headache issues since 1998 but they got worse after auto accidents years ago.  After moving from NH to CA years ago my headaches went away (barometric pressure difference, constant sun, less stress, herbal remedies . . . who knows why?) but after a front end collision a few months ago I have been plagued by constant headaches again.  I have oxycodone, muscle relaxers, high doses of anti inflammatory meds, but none work as well as this.  It's like a miracle.  I can't remember if I tried this with everything else on the market back in 2001-2005, but I had slightly different headaches back then I think.  Either way, it's the only thing I've tried that work and doesn't make me feel crappy in another way (like the sick stomach and narcotic ickyness from the oxycodone.)  My doctor recently expressed concern that I might get rebound headaches, but honestly, why do I care about future headaches that might come when I have them 24 hours a day if I don't take this medication.  Sure I see how it's addictive . . . it works where nothing else does.  If I have to choose between a medication dependence that allows me to live life and continue to work, or a life where if I can get to work I spend 11 hours crying after and 5 hours sleeping (at best) only to start over the next day I'll choose a drug dependence with a potential for future headaches any day.  Living to just work so my pain can get worse every day is not a life.  Prior to this medication I couldn't even make it work some days because I can't hold my head up.  So yeah, I'll take my chances with rebound headaches.  Again, I'm not sure how that is worse than the constant headache I have otherwise.  
Migraine Headache	summerluvr2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/17/2012 9:05:52 PM	I have been suffering from migraines for 28 years.  I can not take the new class of migraine medications like Imetrex and Zomig due to shortness of breath.  The medication I was taking, Cafergot, was discontinued recently.  This is a similar medication that I was put on when I was first diagnosed long ago.  I take the generic form, BUTALB-ACETAMIN-CAFF 50-500-40.  It works extremely fast and gives me relief from these hideous migraines.

This is the fastest acting drug I have had yet. I take one when feel the rebound headache starting, and within 10 minutes, its gone. It did give me the 'fuzzy' feeling, and knocked me out, but i would rather sleep a little more than feel the extreme pain I know would be to come without it. I would definitely recommend to anyone who suffers from migraines and the rebound/chaser headaches.

I have a permanent headache of some sort. I tried lots of meds but this doesn't make me feel weird, don't gain weight &amp; I can carry on if taken early enough. I haven't dealt w/addiction unless massive head pain relief could be considered addicting! And it's cheaper!

I was prescribed Fioricet last year while suffering a sinus infection/headaches.  It is the ONLY medication I have found (with the exception of Excedrin Migraine) that has been effective for me on headache pain.  You do need to take it at the onset, though; If you wait, it may backfire on you and give you a rebound headache.  But, if taken right away, it knocks it out.  I can see how it could affect someone with dependency issues...I don't have an issue, but it can create a euphoric feeling, especially at first (maybe because it contains a barbiturate).
Tension Headache	Addicted, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	4/5/2012 3:31:24 AM	I'm now addicted.  This drug is too easily prescribed.  It took over my life and I now take 10 to 12 pills a day.  I have taken this drug in combination with codeine which I successfully withdrew from but was allowed to continue the Fioricet.  I have been on this drug for over 20 years.  I once successfully weaned off and stayed clean for 7 years...and took it just once and was addicted after a couple days use again.

Tension Headache	jonathan, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	2/24/2012 9:53:25 PM	highly effective for headaches not relieved by over the counter analgesics.  I also have back and neck pain and works as well for that without the nausea from opiates.  Long term regular use not recommended, this drug contains a downer and can result in dependence.  Exceedeing prescribed dosage can accelerate development of addiction.  Mixing with benzos or alcohol will result in deep sleep and can be very dangerous.  Best when used occasionally or short term.  Contains caffeine, lots of coffee while taking this can result in rapid pounding heartbeat.  Withdrawal symptoms mild compared to alcohol or opiates and should not be an issue unless u have been taking regularly for long period.  Relieves headaches better than anything else ive found

Do not under any circumstance, abruptly stop taking this drug if you become addicted. You must taper off.  This drug works but can ruin your life if become addicted.

For me, it's very effective in a way that isn't normally prescribed. It keeps me off narcotics. It's hard to say if I'm addicted or not since I have chronic pain. However, on days when the pain isn't so bad, I take less. I do occasionally get a &quot;high&quot; from it, but not often. I'm able to drive and work, etc. I also have switched to the formula without caffeine to give my adrenals a break and find it equally effective.

Migraine Headache		4	1	1			5/28/2011 5:58:36 PM	no matter how horrible your migraines, stop taking fioricet now! use with extreme caution and take as little as possible to avoid the hell i am experiencing as i go through withdrawal.  fioricet withdrawal is incredibly severe, dangerous, and potentially life threatening.  it causes seizures, convulsions, and delirium.  i have severe anxiety, pervasive and incredibly strong feelings of anger, horrible headaches, nausea, no appetite, lethargy. fioricet has an incredibly high potential for addiction.  many end up in rehab.  it also destroys your kidneys and liver and causes rebound headaches which are worse than migraines and create a vicious cycle. go off slowly and safely before you damage your body and make it harder to eventually come off.

I had taken this pill years ago but it didnt completely cure my migraines, Fiorinal however did but because it is a barbituate they do not like to prescribe this. My biggest complaint with Fiorinal is that it really does a number on my stomach as I have GERD. Lots of burning etc. I see the doctor again in June, hopefully i will get to use the Fiorinal again....
Migraine Headache	Tammy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/3/2011 2:52:41 PM	I've had migraines since I was in the 3rd grade. I am 48 yrs old now. I have tried MANY MANY other drugs for the headaches - but this one saved my life and literally gave me a life back. When I had a migraine, I could not function all day - sometimes longer. This drug has been a miracle drug for me. I also have Bupap for when the migraine is not as bad - these 2 drugs are wonderful. You have to be smart when taking any pain medication and ask yourself - do I NEED to take this if a Tylenol, Alieve, Excedrin will do? It's not something you can take constantly - it's for the really bad ones.

My question is the pain that bad you would risk putting yourself in even more danger. Theres got to be other alternative medication than fioricet and all other drugs containg the same ingredient! I miss my Mom and hate that perscrption drugs do more harm than good!!!!!!!!!!!

I had been on Midrin for years, but that has been discontinued. I also have IBS and wonder if anyone else taking fioricet has trouble with their IBS while taking fioricet.

Migraine Headache	smartin,  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	4	5	4			3/5/2011 2:15:08 PM	I still have break through pain because he headaches are so intense, but it dous dull the pain enough to at leaast cope. It's harsh on your stomach though, so be VERY careful on  taking it regularily, it might cause the throat valve to close to compensate for the stomach valve, and create sever hearburn ,and a lump in the throat feeling, (ask an ENT Dr.) !!

I would go to hospital for pain shots. My doctor had me on 80 oxycotins and morphine for breakthrough pain, it did nothing for my headaches, I have been taking fioricet for 3 years now , not had to go to emergency room one time!!! sometimes I have to take 3 or 4 200mg ibuprophen with one 50-325 fioricet, it causes my headache not to return the same day. It has been a God send!!!!

Migraine Headache	vg in ok, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/9/2011 5:03:30 PM	I have used fioricet for over 20 years and fiorinol for about ten years prior to using fioricet.  This is the only medication I have found to kill the pain of both migraine and tension headaches. It is also the fastest acting medicine I have tried. Occasionally, fioricet will make me sleepy or have a bit of a stomach upset (usually cured by eating a cracker or two). Fioricet causes visual changes due to the onset of a headache to rapidly clear.  When used at the first indications of visual disturbances, it usually prevents the head pain.  I have had migraines and also other types of of headaches for over fifty years and once I found fiorinal and then fioricet, I no longer had to spend days in a darkened room trying to get through the pain.  My trips to the hospital with severe headaches are rare now. For me this drug is a godsend.  I have tried other medications as they have been developed but have found them ineffective.

Migraine Headache	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	11/7/2010 4:27:06 PM	The medication does work when the right dose is taken, generally 1-2 may be taken. I took Imitrex but had to be taken off after starting Lexapro. Then I took Midrin but the insurance wouldn't pay anymore. Now I'm on Fioricet and it works good like the previous mentioned. The barbituate portion is relaxing and sedating. The potential for addiction is very low and the drug is not controlled despite being laced with a barbituate. However, it is still addicting but only if taken a few times everyday which will also kill the liver first because of the high strength acetominophen. Good for migraines, especially after the migraine is over.

The problem was when my son was born ( even though it had been almost 2 months since I had any )wanted to keep my newborn due to possible withdrawl. Apparently we are the patient and not the baby you are carrying. Why would doctors give me a drug that would harm my baby. I do not recommend this while you are pregnant!!!!

I was living on at least 8 excedrin tablets per day for head and neck pain from arthritis. I have no idea if my bad headaches were arthritis related or not but my Dr gave me fioricet this week and I began to take it yesterday while having a really bad headache for the past evening and well into the day. I had the prescription for a few days and was not in a hurry to fill it then this headache that was severe prompted me to get in my car and go get it refilled. I have tried so many other pain medications I really had no illusions about this one until I took it and within about 6 hours the headache was gone and I was smiling again. The use of excedrin was causing me to bleed and get ulcers but it was the ONLY thing that worked on my neck and back pain from arthritis until now. I don't quite know what to say or if it will continue to help but at this point I am ready to shout hooray and keep going with it. I always had to take excedrin to make days bearable so I have no idea if I will have to take as many fioricet. I hope not since I do not like being on strong drugs. I tend to get sleepy and tired on any I have taken in the past and to be honest pain is easier to live with that that awful groggy feeling. As for now I am in shock at how this has worked so quickly. My second day and no bad headache from the stiff neck. Over the years as a young working person I strained my body with physical abuse on the job and now in my late 60's I am paying the price. I am always leery of good reviews but you know what? This is working so far so I wanted to share with anyone who has severe pain.

My current provider has refused to give me more Fioricet since she is worried abut her license and the &quot;terrible addictiveness&quot; of the product. I'm here to tell you I have never taken more than needed and prescribed, so I don't quite understand her motive. As a replacement she gave me Tramadol, which has done nothing, except increase my irregular heartbeat. I'm a heart patient that had a stroke not too long ago and V-Tack that landed me in the hospital. The Neurologist that saw me told not to let anyone change my Fioricet, since it was the best medication for me, given all my problems. At this point in time I'm severely stressed, in pain from another Migraine with aura, which are actually hereditary for the women in my family, short of breath and not feeling well at all. I just don't know what to do, and I'm hoping that someone has a suggestion for me or maybe has encountered similar circumstances and can give me some advice.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	10/12/2010 12:11:51 AM	I have had migraines since I was 4, I am now 33. When I was younger they were completely debilitating to me. They would sometimes last for days. I was prescribed midrin for them in my teens and it worked wonders would take the migraine almost completely away if I took at onset and if I took it later would take most of the symptoms and pain away. I recently found out that Midrin and is no longer being produced and was prescribed Fioricet. It helps some, but nowhere as well for me as Midrin.

It does not get rid of the reoccurrence on the migraines but it does help when you do have one. You will still have the headache, but I do not believe it's from the medication not working. I think it's just your head is irritated from the migraine that just happened. I would recommend this to anyone with reoccurring headaches. Ive never had symptoms of dizziness or nausea but I also would eat something just in case.

Have been off of it for over 3 years now.  I was ordering on line and from many differenct drug companies.  I was taking up to 9 pills AT ONCE because it's effectiviness wears off.

As soon as I feel it coming on, I take one Fioricet with Codiene and within 15 minutes my headaches are almost gone. I have been concerned about getting rebound headaches so I only take when needed.I've taken this drug for my headaches for over 20 years and I am so grateful that it works. Good luck and I hope this helps anyone with severe headaches and/or migranes. I understand what you are going through.

A few weeks ago i went to the dr. and had myself looked at,  was unable to stand the pain any longer, it was interfering with my life. I was prescribed fioricet, tried to have an open mind maybe this medication would actually help me, it did. The first time i took it, it made me feel a little funny but pretty soon i was sleeping and out of pain and that for me is absoulety amazing. I would however like to find the cause for my headaches, but in the mean time i think this drug will help me be me again.
Tension Headache	Fioricet, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	4/4/2010 11:56:30 PM	When I was pregnant with my first and 2nd babies, I was given Fioricert, (w/out the caffeine on preg) and with the caffeine and codeine another...it helped a lot. In my 3re preg.I didn't have headaches. But one day, I had a headache that would not end. It lasted for 9 days with no relief...anyways eventually prescribed Fioricet and have been taking it 2 to 3 times a day for the past several years. I have Fibromyalgia, just diagnosed last summer, which finally explaines PROBABLY the constant headaches...so it's helped me function and is such a relief. The only thing I am wondering is if I'm ever going to be able to get off of it after 12 years of use...However, I'm not willing to suffer headaches and I&quot;m not willing to suffer withdrawls if suddenly taken off this med..As for the tolerance...well, I know with most people, they find it doesn't work well after a while. I have not noticed any problems with it at all...but there are times when my headaches are way more worse than others. In which case, I must use another type of pain reliever w/it...i.e. Tramidol
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/30/2010 1:19:19 PM	I have had migraines since my teens.  Six years ago I had, what I thought was a migraine, go extremely bad and had two brain bleeds/stroke. Please don't ignore a sudden worse than migraine headache! Fioricet was prescribed for the daily headaches afterwards and has saved my daily existence.  I now take them only as needed but am not addicted as some say.  I agree that some drs want to not prescribed them lately and give you xanax instead which is addictive. I'll take fioricet.

If I can take the meds within about 5 min of getting my auras[eye blurriness , spots ect]migraine usually will not be a full blown one. it does make me tired so that helps at night to sleep. I also found that if I prop myself up[laying flat makes the pounding in my head so much worse] and put pressure on the side that the migraine is on that helps along with the meds. Hope this will help a little. GOOD LUCK and remember not all medicine will work the same for everyone

It didn't do anything for my headache, and gave me a chemical burn in, shall we say, one of the most sensative exterior male parts of the urinary tract. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG if at all possible!!!

It works like a miracle for migraines but be very careful to take it only when needed for pain.

Also it works for me when the migraine first starts or if its 20 minutes into it. The only problem i have with this medication is taking it with my antidepressant lexapro. it gives me severe breathing problems so i only take the fioricet when necessary.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	1/11/2010 2:37:57 PM	I'm using this medication during my preganancy, only when I get a migraine, as my other prescription migraine meds cannot be taken right now.  It has been a life saver so far - I could not imagine going through many more migraines for the next few months w/o having this to take.  
Tension Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/2/2010 5:57:30 PM	I have had bad tension headaches for 25 years, sometimes so bad that I would vomit, Dr. thought I had migraines, but after trying Fioricet, and MRI showing arthritis, nerve impingement, the Fioricet works great for me, although i have to take it several times a week, I don't mind because I finally have pain relief. At times when pain is really bad, if I take 2 then a am able to sleep better also.
Tension Headache	RR, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	3	2	Female	25-34	12/29/2009 4:27:19 PM	I would have to say overall this medication helped with my tension headaches. However, after about 6 months of use it no longer worked for me and gradually my headaches returned. I have yet to find a doctor that can treat my headaches without prescribing me with an everyday medication I would need to rely on. 
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/27/2009 10:51:59 AM	I only take this when I absolutely need to, when the pain is unbearable and/or won't go away with just Tylenol.  I think by taking it this way it makes the drug much more effective for me.

Tension Headache	 (Patient) 	5	5	5			12/8/2009 9:01:28 PM	This medication works!  Persons whom experience chronic headaches can certainly benefit from it.  The chance of addiction is very low for pts with a true medical issue, so please don't go on and on about how addictive it is.

Tension Headache	Turbo41, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	35-44	12/16/2009 6:47:12 PM	I was prescribed this medication in 1993 and have been on it off/on for years; although the best 6 or 7 years, I would venture to say I became very addicted.  Initially, the medicaion worked great, but I wasn't abusing them!  Once you start taking more than the recommended dosage, you WILL become hooked.  One of the noted side effects is &quot;intoxicated feeling.&quot;  I did experience this almost within a few minutes of swallowing two pills.  But the after effects are awful.  Sure, I felt great, talkative, energetic, etc. for about 15/20 minutes but it's SO not worth it because when I would come down from it, I would be incredibly groggy, would just want to sleep, had horrific rebound headaches, became nausesous, and lost any and all ambition to do or accomplish anything.  My concentration was also incredibly slowed down when on this drug.  If I have a regular tension headache, I find taking a couple of over the counter Ibuprofen or Excedrin is better.  Take it from me - keep taking this stuff and you WILL become hooked!

However, about 4 months ago, it stopped working completely, I presume I began getting immune to the effects of the medication. The medication not only got rid of my migraine, it caused me to sleep like a baby, which is very helpful in my opinion during a migraine. 
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/28/2009 3:10:04 AM	Since I have suffered migraines since the age of 6, I have been through a huge amount of treatments and medications to try to help with my migraines. After several stays overnight at the hospital hooked up to IV's being given the strong medication DHE(if anyone has ever gone through taking this I am sure you understand the horricfic experience I had with it), a few years ago I finally came into contact with a doctor who had enough sense to prescribe Fioricet for me...and ever since then it has been the number one thing to relieve my pain. I understand that doctors have to take precautions when prescribing this drug, but when there are only so many days supply there, and I have to make it last a month or so it can become hard at times, especially when I have the really really bad attacks...making sure that I have enough to relieve the migraine, and enough just incase I have another attack before I am able to get a refill...so that can be extemely frustrating at times! But, overall this has been the best thing I have found, and the list of meds I have been through consists of 3 long pages. Only being 22yrs old it can be scary having to deal with these consistant headaches, but I feel that as long as I am cautious with my use of this medication and use it as I am supposed to I will make it through, and those of you who suffer from migraines and feel the same, I strongly reccomend giving Fioricet a try.

I've taken it for 3 years now, however like all medications your body eventually becomes immune - I see that happening now &amp; am VERY upset, as this was a miracle drug for me.  Helped so much for so long that I shudder at it no longer being quite as effective as it once was.  I recommended it to my friends who have migraines &amp; they too love it.

I wonder some times if this is an allergic reaction it gets so bad but I ask my dr and he advised me it was normal. Am I the only one this happens to I read many of the other reviews and saw nothing.

Doctors have given me many different preventatives, none work.  Imitrex seems to be all they want to prescribe for pain, then it does not ever work, and I have no &quot;safety net&quot; to relieve the pain.  Fioricet works every time, even daily for short periods.  I cannot find a doctor now that will prescribe it since I moved to a new town.  All the doctors are taught that it causes rebound headache and only prescribe triptan meds for their headache patients.  I am very frustrated to suffer several times a week with headache pain with not relief.  Please someone write a comment with answers to my dilema.

Nothing had worked.  This medication is a god send to me.  I dont care about the addiction to it.

I started getting extremely bad headaches  that would last all day with no relief. I would take excedrin and prescription strength naproxen and it would not touch it.I told my Dr. and she informed me that I was having migraines. She prescribed Fioricet for me and it has been great. As soon as I feel a migraine coming on I take one. I usually wait a little to make sure it's a migraine and not a normal headache. I get drowsy but when it gets rid of my migraine in 20 minutes or at least makes it bearable I don't mind getting sleepy. I don't know if it makes a difference as to why I have been getting migraines but I was diagnosed with endometriosis and adenomyosis.

If I don't take it soon enough I will end up in ER. Dr.s worry about patients getting addicted, they should be worried about there patients having as normal life as they can. I get headache's everyday.

Migraine Headache	creativetouch, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/24/2009 6:20:02 PM	I started having bad headaches around 1984/1985 and I thought it was from a stressful job. I would take 2 Excedrin a couple times a day, several times a week. They were hard on my stomach tho. Then in 1990 I started getting bad migraine headaches off and on. The doctor prescribed Vicodin. I took one and in about 20 minutes started to feel very drugged up, looked white as a sheet and started vomiting. The nausea could have been from the headache pain but I never want to see that drug again. In fact, I told the pharmacy I was allergic to it so they would put that in my records, that's how bad it made me feel. Then a doctor prescribed Fioricet and my goodness, a miracle drug. When I took one the headache was gone in about 15 minutes. I don't have any bad side effects. Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night or early morning with a headache and I would take a Fioricet on an empty stomach with no problems. I do find that doctors do not want to prescribe this medication. It took a psychiatrist to give it to me. I haven't found it to be habit forming and it is the only thing that really works well for me. I will switch off taking it with Excedrin. Migraines seem to run in my family. I carry them with me wherever I go.

Migraine Headache	Tracy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/23/2009 6:04:12 PM	I have fought migraines off and on for years.  I used to give myself shots and the tried just about everything.  Honestly, I typically have a headache every day still, but have learned to just live with them.  I was recently diagnosed with a heart condition and put on a nitrate drug for it.  One of the side effects is headaches, which of course created the mother of all headaches in me.  After spending the weekend in the ER and a shot of Morphine that did not take the headache away, my doctor prescribed Fioricet.  Once I get used to the nitrate, the headaches should get better.  Fioricet not only helped the headache, but I am able to function.  I didnt want something that would make me feel drugged like the shots I used to take.  I can still function and dont have to put myself to bed to sleep it off.  The one side effect, I cant take it at night or Im up for at least another four hours from the caffeine.  Not wired, just not able to sleep.

Migraine Headache	ChrylAn03, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/20/2009 2:34:37 PM	I didn't even know what a Migraine was but I lived next door to a Neurologist and he asked what was going on told him about these disabling headaches that were making me sick and nauseous to my stomach, sound and light made me even more sick feeling and most times when this ungodly headache was going on the smell of food.  I didn't develop these until I had my 2nd child and they got worse after having my 3rd child.  I was 26 years old when I went to his office for a batch of test to find out I had Migraines which do run in my family and was told that not only is it hereditary but that most likely will have them for the rest of my life.  He prescribed Fioricet and my goodness after 10 mins may have looked like death but the migraine was completely gone and actually could function again.  They say this has a barbiturate and is addicting but I was off the meds for about 6 years and was fine.  I am back on it and these Doctors just don't want to give it to you unless they try other things which does not work.  My prescription is 20 pills that need to last for a month and when I get one of those disabling migraines 10 minutes and its completely gone.  Now they want to change it again ... Why change something if it works ... Just leave it be and here I am today 49 years old and just don't want to deal with the pain and want to tear your head off thing anymore ... Let me be happy and live the rest of my life in peace and free of pain.  I take it on an empty stomach and my liver has been tested and is perfect since they claim this is one of the side effects that can cause liver damage.  Those who have never suffered from a migraine on a daily basis have no clue what they are talking about until you actually have to get more than one or two and have to live with them.  My children all 3 of them also suffer from them on occassion not quite as bad and more so my 2nd child - my son just like I do but not on a daily basis and hope he never has to get to that point.

I find taking it with milk helps it go down alot easier. Taking two is  not what I recommend if you're a 1st time user. It is addicting if you take 2 all the times b/c of the way it makes you feel. I've been on it for 7 years and sometimes go weeks without it and never crave the drug itself (but im also on topamax and Lamictal)

I can't take the recommended dose of 2 pills or I feel completely drugged.  I can only take 1 every 4 hrs.  I have been quiet nauseated by this med.  It seems to work ok, but the pain seems more numb than taken away so when it wears off it feels more like a rebound headache.  I will continue to try for the next couple weeks to see what happens.

Migraine Headache	MT-Nat, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	5/2/2009 10:38:47 PM	I have taken it for over 15 years and it makes life bearable (with 2 to 4 migraine attacks a week).  I am dependent on it but don't have addictive problems.  Sometimes it makes me nauseous if I take it in the middle of a serious migraine, but I have learned to stop taking it before the headache gets serious.

Migraine Headache	SBS, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	4/13/2009 8:00:41 PM	This is an extremely dangerous medication.  I took Fioricet for years for treatment of migraine headaches.  I was having 3 to 4 major headaches per week due to having a brain disease.  In 2007 &amp; 2008 I was taking 120 pills per month.  I was sick all the time but didn't realize the medicine was causing major rebound headaches.  I would have a headache as soon as I woke up and would take two.  A couple of hours later my headache came back so I would take two more and it would continue until I went to bed.  I began to become depended on the drug due to the energy it would give me when I first took it and then the calming feeling afterward.  This is a very highly addictive drug that needs to monitored more closely by physicians.  I have a family member as well as a friend who is severly addicted to this drug and it is ruining their life.  I consider myself an extremely strong person that can beat anything but this drug took a long time to stop taking.  It has been almost a year since I took it and I feel much better.  If you suffer from migraines research Botox treatments.  I have been extremely pleased with the results.
Other	tricia, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/3/2009 1:16:14 PM	   Fioricet has been the only medication I can use and get relief from the pain of all headaches including migraines, and the pain of osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia.    I cannot take nsaids or plain tylenol. I have tried several different prescription meds and finally found that fioricet worked for my body chemistry. I need to take, most mornings, 2 to free me of pain and even mental fog, or at least put it in the far background and then 1 or 2 later in the day.    I do not find it addicting as I have gone without it at times. Unfortunately, because it is listed as possibly habit forming, my regular physician wants to limit my use to two a day and even get me off of it because of the butalbital. I am now going to see a pain specialist who I hope will work with me. I need to be able to take from 1 to 5 a day. Fioricet is the only medication I can take that works. And - it does not do any good for me if I take it and find I really did not need it after all - therefore again, it is not habit forming for me. I do not abuse it.   I do recommend this medication for pain relief should over the counter meds not work.

As soon as I begin to feel a slight headache, I take two.

Treximet which is formulated with Imitrex and Naprosyn BEWARE of these new drugs they more then likely are being tested on us! Stick with Fioricet, my fellow migraine/ tension headache sufferers.

Other	samie1126@yahoo.com, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	2/25/2009 8:08:10 PM	I started taking this a week ago, suffering from a constant throbbing headache in my temples since the 31st of Jan., it now being the 25th of Feb. I am experiencing a few side effects one of the main ones being, drowsiness/dizziness, I am also experiencing easy bruising. I am careful to take it every 4-6 hours, as well as record the time when I take it to ensure that I do not take it sooner, when I have a headache (not sure if it's tension or other). This is the first thing I've tried outside of OTC acetaminophen. It works to an extent, but I find it hard for me to function the way that I normally do. I personally have a learning disability and depression (and am taking prescriptions for both of them). I currently am thinking that it cancels out my Adderall XR almost completely, for I am aloof in my daily actions; at work, school, driving, etc. While I feel it doesn't really affect my depression medicine. I also find it effecting my motor skills, I feel more 'clutzy,' and unaware of certain surrounding factors. I do take it during the day, I am careful to make sure that I don't take it if I am to drive a substantial amount of time. I am able to function still, just, as I said before, aloof; but my job isn't one that requires a lot of specialty in it, or attention to detail really. I hope this is helpful, and I plan on calling my Doctor about the bruising, b/c it says it can be from a serious side effect, hopefully that won't be the case.

It helps with the tention headaches but i have to go in and get a shot for my mygrains. If i don't have it my head and shoulders hurt real bad. My doctor won't proscribe it the er doctor does because he knows how a tention headache is. I just wish i could go with out and get better i am tired of taking pills. But i would say this is the only thing that helps

I have not felt any addicting affects at all. On a good week I might have 1 day without needing to take them and have no ill effects. Wonder drug.

If prescribed for you use with caution. It can cause the dreaded rebound headaches, too.
Tension Headache		5	5	5			1/27/2009 9:58:08 AM	tion I've used, Originally I was prescribed this at age 12 in a small quantity because they put me through a battery of catscans and brain scans until they decided this would help and that it did. My headaches are history with this, Fioricet is the anti-imitrex, Also assists with body aches.

I stopped taking the medication on my own and wound up having seizers and then had to go to a hospital for withdrawal.  After if got out after i year i started taking it again when i tried to stop again same thing i signed myself in got the drug out of my system and have been drug free and h/a free for almost 7 years. The stoned feeling and the groggniss  is not worth what i went through thankfully after being through all of this my headaches have gone away for good i went through menopause at the same time thought the headaches would get worse but they went away now i wonder if they were all migraine's or mostly rebound headachesthe medication works very well but please be very very careful on it. I am not an additive person but please be careful with this medicine it almost took my life.

Darvoct was the only thing to kick it at the time. A doctor in college gave me this when I described my pains.  Since then I have continued with it, and never become addicted. I've taken it for 11 years. No side effects really except sleepy, but that could be just from the headache as well.  I use this for tension headaches and migraines.

Tension Headache	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	12/18/2008 9:55:04 PM	I started taking Fiorinal in 1991 for mixed muscle tension/migraine headaches that started after an anesthesia headache that took a blood patch to stop. I spent about 2 years experimenting with various migraine/depression meds and had adverse reactions to them all. This ended my career. After about 3 years, I added Imitrex which handled the migraine component better than Fiorinal alone. Then, I switched to Fioicet to reduce aspirin stomach upset. Have about 1 migraine and 10-15 muscle tension headaches per month. Fioricet always works for me without any adverse reactions. Many doctors are reluctant prescribe fioricet because of addiction fears or rebound headache possibilities. If it works for you, and your doctor won't prescribe it, find a doctor that also works for you. Best taken on an empty stomach with a warm caffeine free liquid. Before bed, take it wth warm milk.

I'm now taking Fioricet and find that it helps for the most part. However, I feel that I'm dependant on it and was told that it can cause rebound headaches, which I believe is happening.  However, since it is inexpensive and effective in the moment, I'm sticking with it for a while.

Little to no sleep at night. Tried it all; Cervical blocks, occipital blocks, facet injections, tramadol, amitriptylene, protriptylene,soma, halcion, skelaxin, flexeril, codiene, vicodin, physical therapy, deep tissue massage, bio feedback, surgery, etc.  This is the only med that touchs them.

My doctor gave me a label &quot;Mixed Headache Syndrome&quot; which basically means I have different types of headaches...tension, migraine, menstrual.  Before getting the correct combination of meds, I would pace the floor for hours and then hang over the toilet throwing up. The combination that really works for me is ... Fioricet (especially for the tension headaches that go up the back of the neck), fioricet with codeine if it increases, relpax for the migraines, especially the ones with the aura/the bright flashing lights in front of my eyes.  If all these don't kick in, I take tranxene to knock me out.  It's better than showing up at the Emergency Room or wishing you were dead.I have 8 sisters and we all carry Fioricet for our headaches.

It was a disastrous and possibly life-threatening experiencing experience. So now I don't even keep the same medications in the same drawer! It is an effective medication, and I never suffered any kind of difficulty stopping it, but definitely do not mix it with either Soma or alcohol (as it contains acetaminophen as well).

Tension Headache	jillian, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	6/5/2008 5:31:57 AM	This medicine usually works pretty well for getting rid of my headaches.  The downfall is that is makes me very sleepy and if I take it at night, I have trouble getting up the next morning and I stay pretty groggy for most of the next day.  If I take it during the day, I usually end up falling asleep about 2 to 3 hrs after taking it.
Migraine Headache	new season, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	5/30/2008 3:18:32 PM	I have been taking this drug for well over a year now,for migraines. It works most of the time,but the next day I feel useless &amp; low energy. It is worth it NOT to have a migraine,but try two or three cups of Reg. coffee first! I would not recomend taking more than twice a week however,as it can effect ones balance.My migraines are what i call level 10s at times so do take with a suppository for vomiting.Both can be quite effective.

Have been taking it now for 5 years with no problems, although my doctor is now recommending that I stop taking it and take topomax.  I have not yet had the opportunity to discuss this further with him. His nurse indicated some problem with the drug that has recently been brought to his attention.

This stuff barely ever works for me, sometimes if I catch it right on the onset, but other than that...NOTHING. To those of you that havn't gotten releif from this, try the fioricet with codeine, the codeine takes the edge off and the fioricet keeps the migraine away.

But watchout for those REBOUND h/a's with this medicine! Even my doc. said this med. is one for bigtime REBOUND h/a's!! I have h/a's 24/7, all the time, and this med. works ONLY to make the h/a tolerable, but NEVER fully takes the h/a away completely. It's never been a &quot;miracle drug&quot; for me, unfortunately. If anyone knows of a migraine/tension headache &quot;miracle drug&quot; out there, please let me know! My head is killing me! I live with these things constantly! I think I'm &quot;hooked&quot; on the Fioricet though... and I heard that's one thing to watchout for... it's one that you could become dependent upon... it seems if I don't take it, my h/a's only get worse! I don't know what to do! Any help is appreciated, thanks!  REEBEERENEE@aol.com

It is the only thing that I can take, and still function normally.
Migraine Headache	jsellman, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	2/2/2008 8:04:29 AM	I started taking this med after discovering that I developed an ulcer from years of taking Excedrin Migraine to deal with my migraines. I LOVED my Excedrin and was really reluctant to stop because I knew it worked in less than 30 mins. and 9 out of 10 times the migraine would stay away. Well, the Fioricet works the same way for me now with none of the side effects. So I've put away the Excedrin (because the doctors and I really thought I had IBS all these years). It's worth taking to me. Because it's a mild narcotic, I ONLY take it when I really need to (migraine is greater than a 5 or 6 on a scale of 1-10). I also just had to switch from taking amitriptyline as a preventive med to Topamax...wish me luck and good luck to you!

Tension Headache	tension, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	13-18	1/29/2008 4:43:40 PM	I think this med is pretty good, i really enjoy the relaxing feeling, and that is the part that could become addictive, i never though i would have to rely on pills to live my life, i feel that i have grown a dependency on this med, i also have taken oxycodone, that worked better than anything but i cant get prescribed to that, but i am satisfied with this drug the only problem is i end up having to take more that prescribed, just like i did with my dolgic plus. If anyone else finds this med addictive, or dependant, please reply to me, oerall though great med

Only thing, you will test for abnormal liver enzymes, I tested for years and no one ever said that the meds were doing it.  The retested over and over and ran different blood work, the last thing they wanted to do was a liver biopsy!!  Now, I am trying to, after ten years, to try something different! Magnesium, B-12 and COQenzyme is supposed to prevent migraines.  Hope it will work!

Migraine Headache	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	19-24	12/20/2007 12:43:12 AM	I was given this in order to manage the pain of frequent migraines.  To be honest, I felt no difference after taking it than before taking it.  Even when taking two tablets I felt no difference.  Though my past experience with all migraine medications has been unsuccessful, having none to date that have ever given any relief.
