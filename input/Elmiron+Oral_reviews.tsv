Bladder Pain	muddpuppy79, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/7/2012 12:48:56 PM	I was so afraid when I started reading reviews on this med. However, I was desperate and decided to try it. I started with 1 a day for a week; 2 a day for a week, and eventually 3 to avoid full blown side effects. I noticed within 2 weeks a difference with bladder symptoms being better. I do and still do have stomach upset, but better than bladder feeling like it's on fire! This med gave me 95% of my life back. (some ppl take it out the capsule and swallow the powder). They say it helps avoid stomach upset. I did not see a real difference. Hope it works for you, sorry for those it does not. Been taking since August 2010.

I do have blood in my stools at times and have had colonscopy with no adverse findings.  I believe this is caused by the this drug--I was off of it for a period of time and the blood in my stool stopped, but have seen it again since I resumed the medicaiton.

My biggest concern now is I just started seeing blood in my stools and I will call my Uro/Gyn in the A.M.  Has anyone else hadthis symptom??
Bladder Wall Inflammation	Glenn, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	11/3/2011 9:50:27 PM	I have been taking this drug for about 10 years. I suffered with Interstial Cystitis for three years because I was misdiagnosed with prostatitis. I was on antibiotics and pain meds for three years and felt helpless. I knew I could not go on living like that. My PC suggested a new Urologist. The new doctor performed a cystocopy and found my bladder wall was fully inflamed. He started out with bladder cocktail instillations and that helped but when he put me on four Elmiron per day I was amazed. It took about 3 months for it to start working but once it did my pain was gone. I must stay away from acidic foods and drinks. Tight fitting pants on my waist can cause a problem. It is very expensive but thank God for Elmiron!!

Bladder Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/7/2011 12:39:10 PM	I have had uti's most of my life. In 2010 I was diagnosed with Intersitial Cystitis (I.C.). I was afraid to start Elmiron because the side effects I read about. I was desperate for relief after 6 months of severe flares and pain associated with I.C. So I started off with 1 a day and each week added 1 pill until I was at the recommended dose of 3 a day. I feel this medication gave me my life back. I can eat a larger variety including Spinach Alfredo Pizza :) The only down side I've noticed is I have headaches and upset stomach most of the time. It is not enough to keep me from taking the Elmiron though. I would recommend Elmiron to anyone with I.C. Just start off slow like I did so maybe your body gets used to the med.

Pain went THROUGH THE ROOF !!!  After taking Elmiron again, the i.c. Pain, after a time went away again.

Bladder Wall Inflammation	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	3/2/2011 9:30:23 PM	I was taking elmiron for about 4 months the first time I took it , and it worked great. All my life I have had UTI's ,kidney stones, and horrible bladder pain. I had surgery and they saw my bladder was inflamed. My urologist sent me to a different urologist. He is a specialist for IC. I found out i was pregnant and stopped taking it. I had severe pain immediately. Then had to start taking it again. If you have IC and become pregnant try to stay on elmiron if at all possible. I had a miscarriage at about three and a half months. After that I continued to take it. But it has not had the same effect as last time. It's like all my symptoms came back worse.If at all possible do not stop taking it if you can. A break in the routine can take months to correct. I also take a med. called Urelle it helps when you have a lot of burning pain.I have been diagnosed with IC for a year . I still have problems remembering to not rush to the doctor with a UTI for antibiotics. The flare ups feel just like an infection. I had a cyscostopy done and they found scar tissue inside my bladder it is very painful. I didn't know how common that was for others with IC.

Bladder Wall Inflammation	dpark, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/6/2011 6:44:18 PM	I have suffered with bladder problems all my life so for the longest I just thought I had another bladder infection.  Then the pain started to get worse so I went to my ob/gyn &amp; ended up having a hysterectomy.  That was a really hard recovey because I still hurt so bad.  My husband was getting really frustrated with me because I always complained about the pain.  It got to where I was having spasms and the pain was so bad I would ball up in the fetal position.  A new uroligist came in to town and as soon as I told him my symptoms, he knew, did a cystoscopy and the lining in my bladder looked terrible.  I started Elmiron and it took a good 4mos to get some relief, after 8mos much better and now a year and a half and I'm pain free.  I also have other auto-ammune disorders, hashimoto's thyroditis &amp; fibramyalga. I would recommend Elmiron to anyone diagnosed with IC.

I took Elmiron for 2 years, 3x a day.  I saw no improvement in 2 years.  It was a pain to take 1/2 hr before or after each meal and it did nothing for me.  I discontinued the drug and now suffer from severe bipolar depression.  Im not sure if it had anything to do with it but I did not suffer from any depression before.  Also, I had been throwin up alot recently and now I suffer from gastritis and possibly have celiac disease.  Its just a bad drug all around and causes so many side effects.

It began about a month after my Hystorectomy. Many different doctors didn't know why I was having so much pain and one told me &quot; Your &quot;exagerating&quot; and there is no way you have that much pain&quot;. Of course I walked out of that office in a hurry. Finally I found a Urogynocologist who listened. I started treatment with the &quot;Sling&quot; with no help what so ever. In March I started on the Elmiron, I was sceptical because it could take up to 6 months to really work. BUT to my suprise in less than 2 months I started having much less urgency. still had the pain, frequency &amp; leaks. He added Detrol La, that took away all but the Pain!  the first of June he added Amitriptaleen 25 mg. OMG!! The pain is nearly gone. Only when I'm on my feet many hours do I get discomfort!  These 3 drugs work together like a team along with a strict diet of no acid! I still have some pain with sex but its tolerable. I hope in time this too will lessen. Side effects: Tiredness, constipation &amp; weight gain, all things I can live with as long as theres NO PAIN! WOO HOO!!

I stopped taking it about 2 months ago and I have not noticed any change. when i was taking it there was no change, except more of my hair fell out, i developed IBS sypmtoms, and just got really depressed because it was suppose to work! I still have to use the bathroom around 35 times a day-im only 28!  i am so depressed it didnt work. i am now going into my doctor once a week to have meds placed directly into my bladder.  Maybe this med works for others, but for me it did nothing but negative things. and it was expensive and i have great insurance!  If you have IC with frequency-i never have much pain-but it just doesnt help.  heart breaking.

However, the hair loss, weight gain, additional bruising(combined with other meds), dry eyes and enhanced allergy response has me willing to take a vacation from Elmiron for a while and remain on the diet striclty to see if I can handle life without this medication. It may seem crazy but, I'll try and see what happens. Good luck to all who suffer with IC as I have.

I suffered from Interstial Cystitis for years but was never diagnosed correctly. I had test after test and seemed to stay on antibiotics. I was on the verge of sucide due to the pain and helplessness I felt. I did not want to go on living like that. My PC finally told me about an OB/GYN who specialized in IC. I started out with bladder cocktail instillations and the helped but when he put me on Elmiron I was amazed. I took about 3 months for it to start working, but once it did, my pain was gone. Totally gone.  I am lucky because my Insurance covers this drug. I have been off of it for about a month now due to surgery and I am back to miserable now. I can start back again in 4 days and I will be so glad. I wish that all of my fellow IC sufferers could have the same results I have with Elmiron. It saved my life.

My doctor told me this drug does not work for everyone, I am just so grateful that it works for me. Yes, the cost is high.

Other	Mom_on_Call, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/21/2010 1:52:17 AM	I was finally diagnosed with IC in 1997 and started Elmiron as soon as came on the market. It took 4 months to start working, but when it did the relief was unbelievable. I was finally able to go out without crying continuously. I'm still taking it 3 x a day and it's 2/2010. I also have Sjogren's Syndrome (which is related to IC) Fibromyalgia and DJD. Both are autoimmune diseases. I haven't had any real problems with the drug other than breakthrough pain at times and occasional UTI's. Unfortunately, at the moment I'm having excruciating pain that hasn't been diagnosed yet. I have had 5 UTI's since December 09, extremely unusual. Hopefully, it's not related to the Elmiron since I have been on it for 12 years. I haven't had any of the complications that the people have written about and I'm very sensitive to new drugs. Without the Elmiron I don't know what I would have done since DMSO caused extreme  pain and had to be removed immediately. I'm also very careful to never miss a dose. The thought of having to wait months for it to start working again is truly unacceptable.
Bladder Pain	CarolynBrook, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/17/2010 4:22:50 PM	After numerous failed silver nitrate instillations, this drug, taken orally, was the key to helping my interstitial cystitis pain. I originally took 100mg 3x/day, but now I am down to 100mg 2x/day with no recurrance of bladder pain. I now can eat many more foods that used to upset my bladder, but always be careful and take small amounts of new foods to see how you do. If you have problems with hair loss, take BIOTIN supplements and those symptoms should subside.

Bladder Wall Inflammation	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	12/31/2009 2:41:02 PM	I have been taking Elmiron since August of this year.  I have noticed problems with dry eyes and have had to start taking Restasis for that problem.  I wish they would make a generic available for Elmiron because it is so expensive.  I have also added an over the counter product to my treatment of IC and it's called Prelief.  If you take at least two pills before each meal it really seems to help with preventing the symptoms of IC.  (My urologist has approved the Prelief.)  Good luck to everyone out there in dealing with your IC.  Unless you have this problem, you can not understand the pain and life changes that come with this disease.
Bladder Wall Inflammation	mash, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	12/15/2009 10:37:25 PM	I have been taking Elmiron for about 10 years and I rarely experience bladder pain but still have urgency and frequency when I eat certain food or quit taking Elmiron for awhile(usually due to cost). I also have fibromyalgia and allergies and I was aware many other people have this problem but I didnt realize dry eyes and hair loss were also noted. I have also had dryer eyes and a small amount ofhair loss in the last couple of years. I do feel the side effects of taking Elmiron are better than not taking Elmiron and dealing with all the IC symptoms!

I went to one OBYGEN who did a bladder tack thinking this was my problem...but I continued to have pain I have had test for bladder cancer.  That was negative.  All of the doctors I went to said I had protein in my urine and treated it with antibiotics...finally I found a doctor who knew what test to do and this medicine is wonderful.  I only take two pills a day, (he prescribed three) but my insurance will not cover it since they see it as a pre-existing condition.  But with just the two pills a day I am still feeling 100% better.  The only side effect I have noticed is the easy bruising.

Bladder Wall Inflammation	jas1963x, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	45-54	11/10/2009 10:54:41 AM	Been on this med for 90+ days now for Interstitial Cystitis.   For several years now the doctor has given me antibiotics to combat prostatitis (urgency, frequency, dripping, forcing, false alarms, bladder pain) but it never worked.  After going through a cystoscopy IC was found.   I take 3 capsules in the morning and 3 capsules in the evening.   Tried to take 2 capsules 3x daily but it wasn't possible to work into a work schedule.   I noticed a decrease in my bladder pain with mild flare-ups once in a while if I don't watch the type of foods I eat (greasy, pickles, vinegar salad dressing).   It has greatly reduced the sense of urgency, not being able to hold it, and the pain.   The dripping still continues but at least I don't have that pain.  I did notice that if I take anything for headaches/pain such as Advil, Aleve, or Motrin my problems comes back.  I guess these OTC drugs inhibit the effect of Elmiron.  The only side effects I've noticed is an occasional skin irritation/scratching and some hair loss from an already receeding hairline.   I don't have another check-in with the doctor for another 90 days so we'll see where I'm at with continuing this or calling it quits.

I finally found an urologist that knew what my problem was.IC. I have been on Elimron for 3 yrs now. I can't live with out it. If I miss one pill, I know it within a matter of hours. So I rarely do miss taking it. It was hard for me to rember to take it during the middle of the day, so I take 2 in the a.m. and then 1 at night before going to bed.  I eat and drink whatever I like.

Started on 4 pills/day. After 1 year, I went off of it for a month and my symptoms returned. Now back on medication, but down to 1 pill/day. Aside from initial stomach pain, it is pretty well tolerated.  I am so much happier on Elmiron. It has helped my symptoms tremendously! I would definitely recommend it for I.C. patients.

Elmiron took 2-3 months before it became effective, abdominal swelling went down, but hair-loss increased,...have started a new process with my Urologist. She opens the capsules, mixes the ingredients with a solution and pours the Elmiron directly into my bladder by  catheter.  I love these treatments, they work faster, easier and better.

My pain was so bad I could hardly walk. Two weeks after starting the medication I noticed a reduction in the pain and inflammation and in three months I was pain free. I have weaned myself down to one pill a day. I tried to stop it but the pain returned after three weeks. I am so happy with the results of Elmiron. I never had any side effects and I can eat and drink anything I want. It gave me my life back.  I just wonder if I will have to take this medication the rest of my life.

I've taken elmiron for the last 6 months and have had no success whatsoever with it. The side effects however have been quite prevalent. I've suffered constant nausea, nose bleeds, ect. Most recently my hair is falling out like crazy. I stopped taking it a few days ago as directed by my physician. I know it may work for some, but be aware of what else may occur while on elmiron.

This is my second time taking Elmiron.  The first time it worked wonders, of course you must follow the diet as well.  After having my son, I started having major flare ups so I started on it again, hasn't worked as well this time have been on it for 5 months.  But I haven't been as strict w/ the diet either.  My advise to others w/ IC is don't give up,  it's hard to have a &quot;normal&quot; life, expecially sex, but it can be done. You need to have a lot of communication w/ your partner.  
Bladder Pain	maryanna, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	2/7/2009 2:40:13 PM	Elmiron is the only approved drug on the market to treat I.C.  I have been on Elmiron for 6 months and while the pain has subsided the side effects have taken over, head-aches,blood in stool,run down feeling plus a few minor symptoms.   When I was  diagnosed with I.C. it was severe but I deal with the side effects and go on, I do not let it impede me life.  There is no other alternative. I choose to tolerate the side effects rather than the unbearable pain and damage I.C. can do to the bladder. Also, keep an open communication with your Dr. Call her/him and talk, come in and see her/him if you need a rescue treatment, for me they help and last longer than they did in the beginning. Support from your Dr.is important,for me it makes this condition much easier to deal with.  She is always there for me and in these times  that is rare but so very necessary.

The only time my bladder may hurt is when I overdue a food like too much acid as in tomotoes or red wine.  Other wise it has been a life saver. Only have bursing if I take Vitamin K or too much fish oil. I stay away from Vitamin K that will do me in on bursing. The only way K does not burse is when I take half the Multi Vitamin that has it. Better to not have it in the Vitamin. But that is hard to find it without it.

My consultation with the Cleveland Clinic was no help at all, and in fact exacerbated  my condition.Finally, after attending a seminar, my urologist prescribed Elmiron, and explained that it was a treatment of interstitial cystitis(IC). For me, it was a miracle drug. Within three days of beginning this therapy, my pain receded and I have been pain free for two years now. If you have been diagnosed with chronic prostatitis, Elmiron could resolve your symptoms. Mention Elmiron to your doctor who may be unaware that it sometimes works for men.

Bladder Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	9/9/2008 6:21:07 AM	This medication took several weeks to startworking, but it allowed me to be able towork again and to lead a more &quot;normal&quot; life.The pain isn't entirely gone and I do haveflare ups, but it has helped so much.  It is expensive but I have a good insurance which pays most of the cost.  I started out taking four a day, but after 2 years have been able to reduce to three a day and now2 a day, but if I have a flare-up I will goback to three a day dosing.   My main side effects have been severe hair loss, easybruising, and fatigue, but I can live withall of this to not have the severe bladderpain that I was experiencing before startingon this medication.
Other	IClady, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/24/2008 10:42:31 AM	I have been taking this and Ditropan XL for 6 years now for my IC.  It initially took about 3 months to start working and almost a year to get the full potential so i say stick with it for awhile if you can.  It is the only way i can work full time.  Diet is a huge part of it for me.  Avoid soda,coffee and beer for sure.  Vinager is pretty bad too.  For those of you having trouble with the cost, contact the manufacturer. When my job was cut last year and i was laid off they paid for an entire year supply.  Side effects got better over time.  Dry mouth and eyes for sure.  Drink water and carry around eye drops.  I also have fibromyalgia and IBS.  And so does my mom.  I swear it is all related to one main problem with the nerves in my body.  I am only 28  Does anyone else have these conditions along with the IC?
Bladder Pain	KylieJoy76, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	7/22/2008 8:55:37 AM	It took the doctors 3 years to diagnose my IC as they thought it was my Endometriosis. They put me on this and I made myself stay on it as I was soo excited to get some relief of pain and finally be healed! But, after 4 weeks on it I had to stop taking this medicine for several reasons. One, it made me nauseated, dizzy, moody and I just didn't feel like myself. I lost so much weight cause of the sickness I get from this my doc took me off of it until I gain some weight back, but I am not gonna take it again! The side effects are soo horrible and that is upsetting as I waited 3 years for them to figure out what was going on and have a diagnosis and now the medicine that is the only thing that heals the bladder wall makes me soo sick! Two, I have no insurance and this is almost 300 dollars a month where I live and I am also on Ditropan XL which is 100 dollars a month! I still take that because that is awesome for the pain!  I know the doc said Elmiron can take months to years before I see a difference, but the Ditropan XL helps the spasms of my bladder and I am soo grateful for Ditropan XL! If you can't take Elmiron and haven't been suggested Ditropan XL you should ask your doc for it! Elmiron and Ditropan XL together makes a faster recovery IF you can handle the horrible side effects!

Bladder Pain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	7/2/2008 3:42:17 PM	I have had pelvic pain intermittently for years and finally was diagnosed with IC. Started on drug 4 months ago, taking two in morning and one a night. Some lessening of symptoms, no major side effects but I sure hope this works for me. It is very difficult for me to stay on the special diet and really do not know if it makes much of a difference in my case. Has anyone tried elavil in combination with this drug and had success? What other pain relievers have been helpful?
Bladder Wall Inflammation	Ginger Snap, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	1	3	Female	55-64	6/28/2008 9:16:26 AM	I have been using Elmiron for 1 1/2 years.  It took time to start being effective (4 months) and now after all this time, I am in pain again.  Not as sever yet but for it to come back I am sure the full pain will return.  The doctors do not want to prescribe anything else for pain because this is suppose to take care of it.  What is wrong with doctors today?  We know our bodies better than anyone.  I am not a junkie, and don't even take asprin unless I really nead it.  Maybe I need to find a doctor who has had IC for awhile.  I would recommend Elmiron to everyone who has IC, however don't count on it forever.

I stopped it when I became pregant and for several months therafter.  I had forgotten what relief it can bring from what was once very mysterious and terrible, side, back and upper quad pain.

I have an excellent doctor (Susan McSherry. Mine was a full-blown case of IC, with severe pain, no response to any drugs or DMSO, the only relief were opiates, although, Elmiron was part of my treatment.  It was not effective at first, the drug didn't start working, until my pain and symptoms modified, which took about two years. Since then, and with regular doses of Elmiron, I have no more bladder pain or other symptoms. For the past seven years, I take only one 100mg, daily.  However, it is a very expensive drug, is a generic available, yet?  
Bladder Wall Inflammation	birdlady7260,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		6/6/2008 4:38:37 AM	this completely relieves my symptoms of pelvic pain, frequency and inability to void. Unfortunately my insurance does not cover this med which is a real proble. How can we make them cover it?
Bladder Wall Inflammation	nanapam, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	45-54	5/22/2008 11:09:43 AM	I biggest complaint is that I stay so tired and emotional since I started this drug. I was also put on allergy pills,flomax and two antiscotic drugs. My doctor explained that all these working together will most benifit my condition. IF, I take them all like subscribed, I stay so weak and dizzy, that I can not function in daily life. I need to lie down most of the day and feel so helpless. If anyone else is taking these made meds and are experncing these side effects, please email me at pamd53@verizon.comLet me know if these side effects will go away. I love to work in the veg. garden and flowers and have no energy to do either.

Bladder Wall Inflammation	Maggie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	35-44	4/29/2008 8:56:38 PM	I began taking Elmiron 1 yr ago.At first, I was on a twice daily dose, but found that I was still in pain. After I switched to 3 times a day and noticed a big diffence. The drawback for me was that I lost some of my HAIR in the back and had to get a short haircut. Now it is growing out andno more hair loss since. It was hard to get used to taking it 1 hour before or 2-3 hours after a meal, but over time I found it easier. My eyes are sometimes dry too but I found drinking more liquids solved that problem. Although it is hard to have to take a pill three times a day, it really took away about 98% of the pain for me. 
Bladder Wall Inflammation	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/18/2008 2:39:46 PM	After ten years of severe pelvic pain, I finally found a Dr. who knew what I had. I have been on Elmiron for two years now and it has changed my life!! Took about six months to feel any difference, but beleive me it's been a godsend!!!  Yes, it is expensive, but without it I would be a recluse, staying inside while the world went on around me.  Give it time to work and I think you will be surprised. No bad results for me....no hair loss, headaches or upset stomach. Elmiron has given me back my life pain free. Follow your Dr.'s orders and take it like it's been prescribed, and don't expect it to work overnight or in a couple of months, because it won't.  And if you have any problems TALK to your Dr....He is the one who has the answers you seek.  Good Luck and hopefully you will be able to go out and truly live your life to the fullest without pain!

Bladder Wall Inflammation	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/12/2008 7:25:49 PM	I began taking elmiron 3 times a day, but after 6 months I asked my doctor if I needed that dose.  He agreed I could cut down and see what happened.  I cut down to 2 a day for approximately 3 months and then to 1 a day 3 months later.  I have tried to stop completely, but the pain returns.  By taking just 1 dose a day I can basically eat a normal diet.  I am still extremely careful with acidic foods.  I feel very fortunate.
