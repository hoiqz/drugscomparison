Schizophrenia	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/23/2012 11:50:26 PM	Clozaril is the only medication that worked for my schizoaffective disorder.  I became a functioning human being and able to participate in every day life without voices constantly hounding me and confusing me.  The only draw back to this medication is that you have to get your blood drawn once a week for a whole year and if after that your stable it's fine but if your test comes back too low after that one year is up, you have to start the whole year over again - going once a week to get your blood drawn for the Clozaril.  But it's a sacrafice I'm will to make for this wonderful drug - Clozaril gave me back my life.  Thank You

However as a last ditch effort I was put on Clozaril for the lack of  severe side affects  (ie my eyes rolled to the back of my head, strange movements of my hands). With Clozaril I had mostly the best of both worlds.,

I feel like I am able to cope better on clozaril.  I have tried many drugs and clozaril works the best for me.

Such as remembering faces and names. Tasks that need to be done or schedules. I gained considerable weight, and have not been able to lose weight around the tummy. My doctor spent about three months getting me off of this and on another more recent drug. Thank goodness.

He has been on several anti-psychotic and anti-depression over several years. Appx 5 years after Clozaril being available he began taking it. It has been the most helpful and effective anti-psychotic medication for him. As most know, the lab work for blood draw is a pain (once a week!) but for the last year has been going once a month for labs. I also have a nephew that is diagnosed with the same illnesses and hoping he will get placed on Clozaril. If something new should come on the market that is just effective and mental health saving minus the labs, I pray for that day!! I just wish there was a cure for this &quot;dreaming while awake with nightmares&quot; mental illness. God's grace to all who suffer and help care for those with it! I am a caregiver and I salute those who endure!!!

Nothing worked that well until he started taking Clozaril.  He is now attending College with great grades and 90% of symptoms gone. We are so thankful.

Monthy bloodwork and doctors appt. required.  Taken at night puts you to sleep but wake up is much better than other anti-psychotics.  Causes pain in joints and muscles(not severe).

Very difficult to maintain employment and relationships when one cannot remember!  Otherwise it's been a godsend.

Why does this occur?When I do take the Clozaril, I get tired about 1 to 2 hours after I take it.  When I do take it I usually sleep through the whole night.  I have to get my blood drawn every other week, which I really don't like.I started taking the Clozaril about 8 to 9 years ago.  The thing I really hate is if I don't take it I can't sleep at all during the night. Why did they invent a drug that messes with your sleep patterns?  I hate that.  Honestly, I do!
