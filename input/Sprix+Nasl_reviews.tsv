Severe Lower Back Pain from Kidney Stones	ngio64, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	45-54	6/25/2012 6:22:34 AM	I sprayed with my head tipped forward, aimed toward the outside of my nose. Some burning. Within 10 minutes I had NO PAIN. I had just had kidney surgery and dilauded was not even helping me. The Sprix took away the pain for 3 hours. When I forgot and tipped my head back and sniffed, it hurt so bad, I thought I would die. It still worked though. I reread the directions and it has not hurt like that again.
Acute Pain Following an Operation	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	25-34	6/22/2012 1:11:54 PM	The 1ast 2 times I used it I thought I was going to die! i just have internal hemroid surgery and this spray hurt 10xs worse. Well I called my dr the next day and watch the video and what a differnce!!! I just took a dose and felt no pain and feel so much better. As long as you don't inhale it and watch the video it is going to work and take away the pain and NOT put you in pain I promise!!!

First after taking I would sneeze up to 4 times then it really burns in the nose &amp; sinis area,makes your head throb,gives you the feeling of the worst sinis infection you've ever had, makes your face &amp; nose feel hot, bring you to you knees, scares the you know what out of you. Get the picture?  On top of all the misery I paid $132 for it.  It would have been more, but I had a $25 coupon. This is a med for pain and anti-inflamation and it causes more??  This is pathetic to put people through this.  I'm writing this to warn people to be aware of what the drug companies are doing to make a big profit.  Dr's beware of what you are doing to your patients.  It is a nasal spray and is very misleading in how to use...not like regular nasal sprays that we have been using forever. What a rip off.  I suffered through 2 bottles &amp; couldn't take any more. So, I carried the remaining 3 bottles back,told my complaints,&amp; got a full refund. I also let my Dr. know. I suggest anyone else that is suffering with this to do the same.  Does it work after the horror stops?  It makes you feel weird and not worth what you go through for what little relief you get.  I rate this the worst drug experience I've ever had and hopefully to help others to avoid this horrible drug.  Remember the oath of &quot;First do no harm&quot; well, this does harm.

This product has been the most effective for the treatment of my migraines. After 5 consecutive days of pain, this was the product that gave me almost instant relief.
Severe Pain	ETerry, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	65-74	6/8/2012 12:44:03 AM	I have experienced great relief from neuropathic leg pain when my other drugs have stopped working. However, I'm disappointed that I can only use it for 5 days. I don't know what else is out there for pain.
Severe Pain	KULPN, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	6/1/2012 3:18:06 PM	My neurologist gave me this for migraine pain not relieved by triptans.  I used it as directed (watched the video)  I had immediate intense pain in my nose, my ears, my scalp, face and down the back of my neck.   It was the worst pain I can ever remember having.  even worse than steroid shots in my achilles tendon.  I ended up going to the ER because it scared me to death.  I will never use it again.  
Severe Pain	Tellergirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	5/9/2012 9:34:28 PM	I suffer from migraines so severe that I go every 3 months for nerve blocks and botox injections.  The 1st time I used this medicine for a migraine I thought I was going to die. It felt like I had shot draino up my nose and swallowed.  It burned so bad and my throat was raw and all I could do was drink to get rid of the sensation. BUT it worked to get rid of the headache...so when I got desperate for relief I would take it again. I told my doctor about it and he said others had had the same complaint and the rep told him to tell us not to inhale and to sqirt towards the outside of my nose and let the rest drip out.  It WORKS!!... and it doesn't drip back down your throat and burn so bad. SO if you've tried it and stopped because of the burning, go to the Sprix website and watch the patient video on how to take the med, and try it again.  It might be worth it for you! 
Other	Kerry, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	5/1/2012 12:10:23 AM	I was prescribed this for lower back pain and sciatic pain. I will admit I have a crazy work schedule and did mis doses. It is very important to throw away the medication 24 hours after use and apparently I have a good doc who explained not to inhale the medicine. There is an awful taste and burning sensation sometimes. I came on here to find out if the hives I got were from the medication or maybe from the heating pad I laid on after using the spray. I threw out the instructions, but remembered reading that somewhere( I think) as they were almost immediate after the heating pad was applied and lasted 24 hours after. Just a heads up in case it's the med. I was almost done with the nasal sprays.
Severe Pain	Anna, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	4/27/2012 2:12:20 PM	My first use was almost my last !  The burning sensation, taste, tearing were intolerable. On a whim, I watched the video on how to use the meds on the internet. This is not to be inhaled !!!!! I sprayed it to the side of my nose, and had almost no side effect at all ! I am so happy that I watched that video. The medicine has worked well, and now that I know how to use it, I am a fan. This is new, so if your doctor or pharmacist did not tell you not to inhale the spray, then tell them. Education them is the way to help someone else who just assumes that you inhale like the other nasal sprays that you use. Good luck and God bless to all who live with severe pain. Try this drug the correct way, it will help most, in my opinion. Thanks for reading.
Other	35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1		35-44	4/19/2012 5:42:54 PM	I would rather be in pain than put this stuff up my nose. 
Severe Pain	fibi2626, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	4/6/2012 10:13:36 AM	I read ALL of the reviews to see what I was getting into.  I absolutely HATE nasal sprays.  I would rather have a suppository (sp?) than a nasal spray. I was scared to death. I agree that it stings like crazy in the nose, throat &amp; if you gag then the taste in your mouth is like sucking on a sweaty sock BUT the medication DID work. I have been suffering with migraines for a long time &amp; have already used almost all of my personal &amp; vacation time (total of 4 weeks &amp; 2 days) &amp; it is only 1st week in April due to migraines. After all time is used, you are on probation for the REST OF THE YEAR &amp; could be fired @ any time if you miss too much work. This is a Godsend. I just used it for the 1st time yesterday &amp; my throat is still a little sore today but my migraine is GONE &amp; I am @ work instead of in a corner of a dark room with a cold washcloth over my face doped up on Percocet &amp; muscle relaxers. 
Severe Pain	J91966, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	4/3/2012 8:23:30 AM	I have had Toradol/ketarolac for about a year in the intermusculal injection form. This form is much more effective but is no longer available at any pharmacy. This nasal spray is not as effective as the injectable form and is far too uncomfortable. The burning and sinus discharge after use is ridiculous. It should be taken of the market and the injectable form be made available to the public again. To the drug company who made this means of delivery for this drug, you must not have tried it your selves. If they had it must have been the money that took to develop it that would have been lost that made it even get to the general public. Gentleman think again, &quot;if it's not broke don't fix it&quot;
Acute Pain Following an Operation	Dental Work, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3		35-44	3/30/2012 4:27:36 PM	After oral surgery, I was given Sprix for pain relief / anti inflammatory. The first use similar to others was intense burning of the nasal cavity. It was very effective on reducing the swelling of the gum line and kept pain to a minimum. Side effects of upset stomach, and tiredness were experienced.
Other	DC12, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	3/30/2012 10:03:55 AM	The worst experience of my life!!!It burns like shoveling Clorox combined with broken glass at a lighting speed inside your nostril until literally crashing in your cerebellum. I screamed in pain taking even my pony tail down given the horrendous headache that followed, the pressure was horrible and for the next 5 minutes my eyes were tearing up and had an intense migraine. I felt the whole trajectory that the medicine traveled from my nostril to the back of eyes, forehead, until stopping in the bottom part of my brain. I only did one side and will never use it again. Effective YES but at the cost of feeling like death is eminent and please dont think that Im making a joke. Consider yourself warned against this medication. If your Doctor prescribes this ask him if he has ever used this medication before and if he hasn't invite him to use in front of you to see how he reacts to it. I have had my share of pain in the past, had a baby, a surgery complication, and have never ever felt like screaming at the top of my lungs but this medicine was horrendous.  This is my first time ever writing a review and Im the type of person that will scream for nothing. If this review is not enough to convince you against this medication, please consider that a shot will do the trick and get your pain killer medication this way instead. 
Other	Maggie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/14/2012 9:21:10 PM	I was diagnosed with a pinched nerve in my neck, which caused pain in the bach shoulder and down my arm. I used the Sprix nasal spray and OMG, the burning in my nostrils was so painful. My eyes poured out the tears from the burning and I did not get the relief I was hoping for. The cost was rediculous and they tell you to only use each bottle for one day (one spray up each nostril twice a day) and discard the rest. I don't understand why that is necessary.    
Acute Pain Following an Operation	plrbear81, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	25-34	3/7/2012 3:42:52 PM	In reading these reviews there seems to be a clear dichotomy - those who know how to correctly apply the medicine are finding it effective and tolerable, while those who do not are having difficulties.I was prescribed Sprix after having my right wisdom teeth removed. A few years earlier I had my left side removed and been prescribed percocet - but that left me too doped up to function and thus I was looking for an alternative medication.Fortunately for me, my orthodontist was familiar with the drug and told me the right way to use it - spray AWAY from the middle of the nose/septum and towards the outside of the nose and DO NOT inhale. You can pinch your nose if necessary to prevent the drug from dripping out.Following this method - there was STILL a SLIGHT burning sensation but it lasted &lt;45 seconds! The pain relief was as good if not better (b/c I could function normally) than the narcotics I got last time! *Also, I would like to say if the sting from the drug you're taking is worse than the bodily pain you are in that necessitated use of Sprix, then you probably didnt need a prescription strength pain reliever to start with!I strongly recommend the drug - I hope this helps other patients who seek potent non-narcotic pain relievers.
Other	blueyeshlb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	3/7/2012 12:00:39 PM	I read these reviews before using Sprix for the first time.  I will tell you no matter how you tilt the bottle to the outside of your nose - it still burns!! Every time!! Burns the throat, the eyes, the sinus cavity in general and even my ear! Most of it would run out unless it just made my nose and eyes run so bad it seemed like it was running out.  When it hit my throat it made me cough so hard I was almost gagging.  Make sure you have plenty to drink to stop the burning and get rid of the nasty taste.  I was prescribed this medicine for migraines and even though it says it is a 5-day pack, when you are only doing one squirt in one nostril every 6 to 8 hours, it lasts lots more than 5 days.  I'm not sure what there is to get addicted to - the burning is the only feeling I got from it and that is definitely not addictive. This medicine did nothing for my migraines, but I kept taking it hoping it would eventually...nope. I called today to get something else.  I'm hoping for something that relieves the pain, and doesn't give me more pain.

I finally found a drug that beats my migrane pain. My doctor did warn me of nasal irritation. I did feel a slight burning sensation which subsided shortly after use. To any reading, aim the bottle to the front of your nose and spray. Dont inhale, thats what I was instructed to do. I would reccomend this product a 1,000 times over.  Thank you Sprix people!!!

It burned my nose so bad my eyes poured with tears and it made my throat was raw and burned as bad as my nose was burning. I tried it again thinking it would be better but it was worse. It did help my pain but it was not worth the burning. I will never use this medication again!!!!!!

This medication did not even buffer the pain in my lower back.  At just under the $200.00 I paid for this medication, was the burning to get my mind off my back pain?
Severe Pain	can't remember, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	65-74	1/26/2012 12:33:35 AM	I tried to spray it my on the inner and outer side of my nostril and still had a lot of burning, but it only lasted for a minute.  It relieves my headache pain quickly whereas Vicodin works slowly.  I am impressed.  It causes me to salivate for about a minute, which I could not find in the side effects.

Pain relief was amazing. I wasTold how to use it correctly so I didn't experience the burning sensation others have reported. After using for five days then discontinuing uselike instructed I was in minor pain and had to use crutches. Had to use Vicodin until I could get another script for sprix. I love this drug.
Severe Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/26/2011 8:28:50 PM	This medication does burn but spraying it towards the inside of your nostril instead of straight up you nose helps a lot with that problem. It did help my lower back pain from a severe pulled muscle. It didn't completely take away the pain but it took the edge off!
Severe Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	12/22/2011 3:48:56 PM	I used this med for moderate to severe lower back pain related to a ruptured disc.

Sprix is my miracle drug...my physician did warning me about the nasal burning and told me to spray on the outer nasal mucosa &amp; let excess drip out - still got my full dose &amp; only experienced a tickle/tingle sensation in my nose.  Pain relief was almost immediate, I take my bottle with me to work &amp; redose every 6 hours.  No more days home in fetal position for me!!!

Then the pharmacist told me if it burned I was using it wrong. After I followed his instructions it did NOT BURN AT ALL.  Don't squirt it strait up your nose and don't sniff. Squirt it toward the outside of the nostril and let it soak in. It works I promise. I wish I had this when I was a lot you get and had horrible menstral pain. It would have been a Godsend!!  Why don't the doctors tell us how to use it and it would be so much better. Also my husband tried on of my bottlesBc he had gout, and now he wants a script. Don't make u sleepy at all just no pain in less than 10 min. Thumbs up!!

My doctor suggested this product.  I thought...great, a nose spray, easier than injections...super.  Nope.  You have to keep in the refrig, or at least that is what the box says.  They burning when you spray in your nose is horrible.  I read another post where they suggest you aim at your outer wall inside your nose and do not breathe quickly.  We'll see.  The watering eyes and horrible burning was more than I could handle.  It did work though.

Severe Pain	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	25-34	11/6/2011 8:27:48 PM	I used this drug for severe head pain that 800mg of ibuprofen wasn't doing anything and I didn't want to take a narcotic. It worked really well, but I must warn that if you suck it up your nose it really does burn. My doctor had me point to the outer wall of my nose and not sniff (as someone else described) and 90% of the burning went away. The pain relief is fantastic, and now that I have figured out how to use I am a big fan!

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	11/1/2011 4:12:00 PM	The nasal pain was so bad I almost forgot about my migrain. Also, the amount of pressure it takes to make the spray come out in any but a stream is way too much. The fact that it has to be kept cold makes it difficult to use while traveling. The only reason I use this med for migrains is the fact it is one dose, this stuff I had to take two doses. Not worth it. Still have four bottles.

After one use I was afraid to take it again.  so it was a waiste of money, time, and im still in severe pain.   
Other	Mickey, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/27/2011 10:32:54 AM	I recently had an outpatient surgery endimitriosis abalation. Where they administered it in the office. The nurse was very knowledgeable and advied me of the burning, and sprayed it on the side of my nose instead of straight up into the nostril, where it causes the brain freeze sensation that others experienced. It absorbed rather quickly and felt like I had had tow drinks and very relaxed so that they could give me the locals' I needed in my cervix. 
Severe Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	9/20/2011 1:41:32 AM	I am a nurse and would not recommend Sprix to any patient. I had severe burning in my nose from the first spray so I couldn't finish the dose therefore no pain relief. It hurt so much my eyes watered and nose ran so when I sniffed it spread the severe burning down my pharageal cavity and the medicine taste was so bitter I began coughing. I had to blow my nose and rinse my mouth so ended up removing what little medicine I got. The severe burning continued for about 15 min even after all that - it was nothing short of sniffing red pepper. There are too many drug choices and alternate routes for toradol; patients do not need to be submitted to this.  Even worse, the drug rep did not tell us about this side effect and I didn't get any warning from the pharmacist. I will be letting my doctor know so this doesn't happen to other patients.

I was not prepared for, nor are you cautioned ANYWHERE IN THE INFORMATION PROVIDED FOR BOTH PATIENTS AND PRESCRIBERS, that the burning sensation upon use nearly makes it useless.  It's all I'm left with, so I have no choice.
