Acne Rosacea	jbar, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/27/2012 1:13:19 AM	The medication was expensive for me (maybe it was my insurance or where purchased) but well worth it. My skin was totally cleared up within 3 weeks. Also the tube should ast a long time as just need to put on a thin layer.  Non-greasy, no smell..great stuff!

Acne Rosacea	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/21/2012 11:40:48 AM	I had rosacea for a number of years before I took the problem to the doctor who then treated it with Metrogel. The symptoms lessoned quickly, and I maintained my clear skin with once daily use. Then began to use it only when I saw symptoms beginning. I highly recommend this product.

So, I probably am allergic to this medication or it is far too harsh.

Dr.took me off oracea, and have been using metro gel for the last 6 months, and every things been fine up until a month ago. I now have a dime size red area by the lower corner of my mouth that the metro gel seems to be bothering, when I use it it stings on that spot, so I stopped using it in that area and the red spot is doing better. Making another Dr. appointment because I don't know if I should stop altogether.

I've been using it for approximately 15 months. I use the 1% in the morning only. What a life changer! I am so thankful that my aesthetician recognized the condition, and that my dermatologist prescribed it for me. I highly recommend this product! 
Acne Rosacea	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/19/2010 5:08:38 PM	I've only been using this for one week with a frequency of every other night.  The persistent acne that rosacea caused is completely gone.  I'm stunned!  I've never had anything work so well.

I've so far noticed a decrease in redness and my skin feels much smoother and far less &quot;angry-looking.&quot; I use it at night, with Finacea in the morning. My dermatologist also recommended using only Dove Free soap to wash with, and salt/cool water soaks for five minutes two times per day, which is actually very soothing. I've had this problem for so long, thought it was just acne, so I've been attacking it with every product I could find, which was only making my skin worse, more irritated and horrible-looking - I'm so glad I finally made that appt. and read your reviews - they were very helpful and encouraging!  
Acne Rosacea	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/2/2010 8:38:07 PM	Easy to use and very effective.  I've tried every other ointment out there (both over the counter and prescription) Metrogel has been the most effective.  I've noticed at least 90% improvement.  Haven't experienced any side effects.  It did take at least 6 weeks however before I noticed a difference.

If I wait too long between using I will have an outbreak and it will take at least a week to get it back under control.

It does a wonderful job of keeping the face clear along with removing the redness that always seemed to be there.  As someone who also has Chronic Urticaria, this medication caused no reactions.  Highly recommend!  
Acne Rosacea	g, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	10/30/2009 4:00:54 PM	I used MetroGel for about 3 months, it have not done much for me, it did however, keep my rosacea from more break ups. For the last month, I have not been using any creams recommended by dermatologists. I researched on my own about rosacea and found other way that could help. I drink nettle tea, nettle removes all your toxics from your body and makes your blood stronger, I take extra vitamin C. I also apply on my face Vitamin C Serum, and I found out about Mario Badescu and I bought some creams from them for rosacea. Within 3 weeks I notice change in my face, a lot of redness is going away and do not have breaks ups.

Acne Rosacea	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/13/2009 8:01:11 PM	I just developed acne rosacea a month and a half ago after extreme stress and tanning. Once I started using metrogel and stopped tanning, the redness went away in less than a week. I still have tiny little pimples and whiteheads though that have not reduced much at all. I never had these before and I hate them! My derm. prescribed it once a day w/ Oracea (oral antibiotic) and I'm still doing both. I am increasing the metrogel to twice a day now to see if I see improvement. My stress level has not reduced much and I notice flares of the acne and redness when I have a particularly stressful event. When I do have redness I use Eucerin redness relief moisturizer that is green tinted and it works wonders!!

Other	LL Cool J, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/1/2009 3:07:28 PM	Oddly, I began using this medication after my mother passed away (it was her RX).  I had a red, raw rash beneath my breasts that I assumed was sweat/irritation related (and I am fairly flat-chested).  My dermatologist gave me several different salve samples to try, but nothing seemed to work.  Out of frustration, I began using the Metrogel 1%; EUREKA!!  I can't believe how quickly the rash/redness/soreness disappeared (after 1 week's usage).  I know this RX was for mom's roseacea, but it certainly worked on my rash!
Acne Rosacea	Karen2be, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/28/2009 2:19:18 AM	I have suffered from acne since my teen years  it seemed to get worse with age! I was given this gel many years ago and didn't give it a fair chance..you must be consistent! It has worked wonders and no boils even! Always had boils before that time of month..and not now! 15+ years of tetracycline and this is much beter! I will be 40 soon and finally free of acne! I apply three times a day and only have slight dryness..that's great because I am usually so oily! I still have scars from the boils but they are getting better now.

I have been using this in conjunction with Clenia and washing my face more often than before. My face improved dramatically, but I cant be sure which of those three things is what did it most. 
Acne Rosacea	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	35-44	1/21/2009 9:10:21 PM	I have been using this medication during the winter and I notice that my skin has gotten very dry. Using a light mosturizer like Cetaphil afterwards helps with the dryness. 
Acne Rosacea	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/30/2008 12:52:44 AM	MetroGel seems to have cured my rosacea.  I had incredibly painful tiny white heads covering the apples of my cheeks coupled with sore redness that was actually hot to the touch.I used MetroGel 2X a day religiously for about a month.  My skin got a little dry and flaky, but when I decreased my usage and the flakes came off, it was like I had new skin!  I still have pink cheeks from having had rosacea for so long (I think some of the capillaries are busted) but my skin is in great shape.  I now use MetroGel about once a week mixed in with a little bit of my night time moisturizer.

Metrogel lotion is easy enough to use but in 12 weeks my skin is just as bad, if not worse. My skin is oily and using Metrogel seems to make that even worse as well.

I was perplexed and thought I was dealing with a make-up allergy!  Even my doctor diagnosed me with adult acne and gave me an oral antibiotic.  One day a friend asked me if I had Rosacea--I had never heard of it.  I went to my doctor with this information and was prescribedMetrogel/or Metrocream, coupled with an oral antibiotic to take for the first month and with any subsequent flares.  It has been almost 15 years and the severe symptoms have never returned.  I use the cream, because it seems to work better for me--I swear by it and don't let a day go by without using it at least once a day, sometimes twice.  It's fabulous!

I felt I looked awful and had to cover my skin with thick makeup. I was finally given this by a new dermatologist (in addition to an oral antibiotic for the first 60 days). I used this at night (and use Finacea in the morning). I have seen a 95% improvement in my skin after about 2 1/2 to 3 months. I am now comofrtable going makeup-free and still feel I look great! In fact, I have been told by many people that I look 10 years younger than I am...I work in a beauty store, of all places.Don't stop using your rx unless your derma tells you to! It can take time to see results.

But Metro Gel has changed my lifr. I used to have to wear a lot of makeup and you could still see the redness, today I went to work with no makeup on and I was so pleased no one noticed or remarked about my face being red for the first time in years.

Also, Medco mail pharmacy does not recommend it and I have to pay considerably more for it than other treatments they prefer...but they wont tell me what those treatments are.

I have used this medicine since the mid 1990's when needed.  While there is appearently no cure, the symtoms are controlled very well.

She prescribed Metro-gel cream .75% plus duflican 100 mg (anti-fungal) I promise you, I began to see results the next day. No itching or burning with this cream. (I dont tolerate gels well) cream works better. This combination is a miracle. Please use a mild castile soap cleanser to better pamper your skin while healing. I love this metro-gel. Doctor said it would take 3 weeks to see results. But not me, I saw them immediately.

My   dermatologist prescribed Metrogel to be used once each day, with an oral antibiotic, Doxycycline 100mg, twice each day. Today ws my 1 month check-up and my face looks so much better. I have to continue using Metrogel daily.
