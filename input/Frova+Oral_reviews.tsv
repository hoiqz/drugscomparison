Migraine Headache	Robyn , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/31/2012 3:40:33 PM	I call this my miracle drug! It is so small but yet so effective.  I have suffered migrains for over 15 years and this is the only medicine that works. I never have to take the second dosage, and it usually kicks in withing 30 minutes. Only side affect which I will graciously take is that if I take it too late then I am just worn out after its gone - but no pain! So definitly take it on the onset of the migraine - don't be cheap with the pill - it is expensive but it works so it's worth it to me.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/17/2012 8:58:28 PM	The drug has been most helpful in making migraines bearable,  I can usually take the medication at the onset of the migraine and have it take effect.  It does make me feel a little sleepy and I do have to urinate more, but I am not required to be in total darkness in bed.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	11/9/2011 3:57:15 PM	I have had migraines for 12 years and nothing makes them go away. After discovering FROVA last year I thought I had found releif. Until recently I never had to take the second pill. Now I find myself suffering late in the day after already taking my two in the morning and early afternoon. For mirgraines that are not that severe I would recommend FROVA but I am heading to the doctor to see if there is anything stronger out there.

Migraine Headache	Ann, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/12/2011 5:25:57 PM	I have had chronic migraines for over 30 years.  Have tried all other meds.  Frova works the best of any for me with little to no side effects.  It must be taken at the first sign of a migraine.  Very, very expensive!  
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/9/2011 10:00:48 AM	I have been taking Frova for about 2 years. Only once have I needed to take a second dose to relieve a migraine.  I have experienced no side effects at all.  I tried one other migraine drug but it made me dizzy.  Frova does not.  The ONLY complaint I have is that I wish it worked faster.  It always takes 2 hours to work if I have any food in my stomach or 1 1/2 hours if taken on empty stomach.

I would often have to suffer a couple more hours and take another one and see what would happen. My new Dr. suggested Frova about 5 years ago and I love it. It can be taken when working or continuing to do whatever you normally do.  There is no discomfort or weird sensations and approx. 90% of the time, it eliminates the migraine and keeps it away.

Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	35-44	9/24/2010 2:01:18 PM	This pill worked in the beginning of my treatment with it.  But now it seems like I have to take 2 pills to get the relief I was getting w/ 1!  It is ridiculously expensive.  I don't understand how any pill can cost that much, esp., with our private insurance.  And as I migraine sufferer of 18 years, I have tried everything under the sun!  I wish someone would come up with something that works, and that doesn't cost thousands of dollars!
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/8/2010 8:33:35 PM	Miracle Drug!  I've been suffering with migraines for greater than 2 years and this is the first thing that has helped.  Within 30-45 minutes of taking it the migraines are completely gone.  Definitely worth the pay to be pain free.

This drug has saved my sanity so many times.  Only drawback - takes about an hour to work and you should lie down for about an hour after taking it.  Also, they need to lower the price on this drug.  Too much mark-up! 
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	6/7/2010 7:54:32 PM	I took this medication for the first time today, before work... Big mistake.  It worked on getting rid of the headache but i was dizzy, tingly, had hot flashes, and was really sleepy.  Although the side affects were there it was easyer then having a Migraine and work.  I think that my body just needs to get use to it.
Migraine Headache	frog, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/17/2010 3:48:19 PM	I took Frova for the first time this weekend.  The first sign I was getting a migraine I took it. With in 30 minutes it was gone and it didn't come back! I had no side affects from this drug!
Migraine Headache	J.C., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/6/2010 6:07:01 PM	The side effects from this very expensive medication are not worth it.  Plus, it did nothing to take the my migraine away.  Excedrin Migraine works better and is MUCH less expensive.  Frova caused severe abdominal pain, which caused me to be up all night long, sweating and on the toilet...extremely long night.  Plus, the pain of the migraine was not completely gone after taking the medicine.  What a joke.  I just can't recommend taking this medication.  I just hope I can get some of my $ back, as I just picked up this medication yesterday from my local pharmacy.  Horrible experience.

I have tried Imatrex, Migrainal, Accupunture, Biofeedback, Physical Therapy and nothing has ever even touched the pain. The first time I tried Frova it took away my migraine not just knocked it down I mean it got rid of it like it was never there. It has been a miracle drug for me and gave me back my life. My life was a horrible experience due to migraines and their control of it. I now can make plans and not worry what if I get a migraine I know it will be gone in a matter of minutes.

Tried Imatrex but it did not help.  Frova seems to work for me--my doctor recommended it because he had seen it do wonders for other female patients.  It does not make me sleepy nor does it make me dizzy.  Absolutely no side effects.  I find it works best if I take it at first sign of a migraine, lay down and close my eyes in peace and quiet.  In about half an hour the headache is gone.  I do not go anywhere without having it with me.

It works very well for me.I tried a couple different migraine pills at first but they made my face bones ache while still experiencing the migraine just slightly for an hour to two hours before the migraine would go away. I find this is not so with Frova and have used it sinced. The migraine subsides within an hour of taking it.
Migraine Headache	JANE, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	3	1	Female	45-54	12/8/2009 1:22:56 PM	DO NOT TAKE THIS MED OUTSIDE OF A DOCTORS OFFICE! I HAD HEART PALPITATIONS AND CHEST PAIN WITH A FEW MINUTES OF TAKING IT AND AFTER A FEW HOURS AN EXTREMELY DRY MOUTN!
Migraine Headache	rayrick, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Male	7-12	10/28/2009 12:42:11 PM	BE CAREFULL. My nephew who is 11 had/has migranes from a fall he took in August 2009. He was given Frova for the migraine. When he took the pill on the onset of pain, in no time he became loopy but he snapped out of it with in a few hours. Later that night, on the on set of another pain, we gave him a second pill. The loopyness with the chance of harming himself/others came back but lasted for days this time in a local hospital. We through out all pills after that. Now he gets the same loopy side effects w/o the meds. Right now he's in a mental ward with with people trying to figure out how to fix this. When it comes to your kids taking the meds, be very carefull. VERY CAREFULL
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/13/2009 10:09:25 PM	I began experiencing migraines in January '09 and was very frightened. I still don't have a reason for why I all of a sudden started getting them. I have been thru all the tests with no real results. My doctor finally precribed Frova and at first it was wonderful...one pill and the headache was gone within an hour. Now I am having to take 2 pills a couple hours apart to get any relief and then it's not completely gone just dulled enough so I can function. I consider this medication effective because even though it doesn't totally relieve my migraine pain all the time at least I can function. I don't go anywhere without it because I never know when one is gonna hit me. It is pricey but my insurance covers it completely. I have no side effects whatsoever.I would strongly recommend this medication to anyone experiencing any kind of migraine pain.
Other	Sweet Sue, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/13/2009 11:13:07 AM	Previously my migraines were triggered by my menstrual cycle and would last for seven days jumping from side to side behind my eyes.  I previously used Imitrex but Frova is soooo much better. I don't have that &quot;cotton head&quot; feeling that you get with Imitrex and it really works better.  I can't tell you how much better my life was on Frova.  I'm now 59 and no longer have a monthly period but I do have MS and am taking weekly shots of Avonex.  These are beginning to trigger migraines for me and I had one Frova left and took it after 2 days and voila! My headache was gone immediately.  I can't tell you how much better this has made my life, I was going to stop the shots for MS but now I don't have to as long as I can afford the Frova.  My prescription plan recently made me totally responsible for the cost and they are extremely expensive.  I'm looking at Canada and Mexico to see if there's a more affordable way.

Before, my pain lasted for several hours and then I could really only recover after getting some sleep.  Now, I take a pill and I'm better within an hour or so.  If not, I take another one and that certainly takes care of it.

I can take it and go to work it also has a greatcalming effect on me.  I might want a napat end of day, but the pain is gone!  
Migraine Headache	HondaChic87, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	9/13/2009 5:43:09 PM	Now i have had migraines since I was 7, so currently 15 years. I am currently taking Topamax everyday to slow them down, but they do happen. I was taking Relpax and it did work but I didnt like the side effects so with speaking to my neurologist he suggested Frova. Well the other morning I could feel a migraine starting to form but it was very slight, so I take the Frova like you are suppose to, well 4 hours later all of a sudden my migraine hits me full force out of no where. So it only disguised it for a few hours, and it was out of the timeframe to take another one so I was stuck with my migraine for the rest of the night. I will never take the pill again. I would never say don't try it. Because different things work for different people but that is my experience.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	8/12/2009 6:13:39 PM	I severe migraines lasting days to weeks at a time. This medication helps breifly if I can take it soon enough, but forget it if I can't.  Does however make me sleepy.

Migraine Headache	muddypaws, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/30/2009 12:20:09 PM	I have recently discovered a money-saving trick about migraine medicines, for me.  I have migraines that generally last for 4 days, triggered by just about anything: hormones (menstrual and mid-cycle), weather changes,  perfume/smoke/other chemical exposure, sudden drastic change in sleep time/hours, stress or overexertion - you name it.  I have found Frova and Relpax both to be pretty effective (Relpax makes my whole body hurt - as if every surface is bruised.  I don't generally experience that side-effect with Frova).  But like everyone else, I find the cost hard-to-swallow, even with insurance.  My last two migraines have occurred at a time I just didn't have enough money for more than a couple of pills.  I decided to try taking just a small piece of a Relpax (about 1/3 of a pill), and it WORKED!  Next time I tried it with the Frova, and again it got rid of the migraine.  WOW!  I am thrilled.  P.S. For those with menstrual migraines, I have also found that if I regularly take a high-dose B-vitamin supplement, my migraines are reduced in severity and duration.  Also take Aleve along with the Frova  or Relpax also seems to boost the drugs.  Worth trying.  One final note - once I had to go on a STRICTLY NATURAL diet consisting of only natural meats and veggies, no grains, sugars, fruits, or aged or processed items for about 6 months, and after the first 2 months, my migraines COMPLETELY disappeared and didn't return until a YEAR later.  Hard to live like that, though.

For the most part, it works pretty well.  It usually prevents a full-blown migraine and sometimes prevents the headaches altogether.  Most often, though, it cuts back on the severity of the migraines to where a couple of naproxen along with the frova will take the pain away.  She does have the side effects of fatigue and fogginess from being on it, though.  It is less effective, though, if her period comes early and she hasn't started the frova, yet.  Then, it takes a couple of days with some headache before the frova takes effect.
Migraine Headache	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	13-18	6/9/2009 5:45:13 AM	It makes the migraine go away but I'm very restless when taking it. I can't sleep.

Migraine Headache	vanessa5, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	3/1/2009 9:08:32 PM	I had some migraine success with Frova. I liked how it felt &quot;mild&quot; compared to Imitrex. Imitrex sometimes makes my headache worse for about 10 minutes, but then it disappears. With Frova, my headache mildly melts away. But then it would comes back 12 hours later. Supposedly Frova stays in your system longer than other medications, but it was not strong enough for me. Those of you that are still searching for a solution, should try it - maybe you'll have no side effects like me andhopefully it will work for you. But for me, I need Relpax or Imitrex.
Migraine Headache	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		1/31/2009 10:45:33 AM	This is the only medicine to relieve my migraines.  works everytime, usually only one pill but occasionally I have to take 2. the only sideeffect I have is dry mouth. i recommend this to anyone who has migraines and other meds aren't working for them. It is pricey, but my insurance covers most of the cost.

Being 21, I finally have been prescribed Frova. This drug works wondefully. I had taken the first pill about an hour after I started feeling a slight pain come on. Within an hour, my headache was relieved. I did feel sleepy after taking the pill. And, there was no need for the second pill. And 7 hours later, still no headache. This has worked better then anything I have ever tried! I am so glad for relief finally.

However, I am a nursing student and after reading the side efects I am more terrified to take the medication than to get another menstrual migraine. Can someone who takes this please give me information about the side effects that they have experienced? ilp1000-forever@yahoo.com Thanks sooo much.

I took this medicine at work with a very bad migraine. I might have taken it too late, but since it was my first time, I was hesitant to take it while at work just in case it knocked me out. Well, it not only knocked me out, but I also got severe stomach cramps and had to got pee a lot (yes I said it!). I zoncked out on the floor in my office for about 3 hours (good thing I run my own company!). I might try it again if I get a migraine at home to see if it is any different.

At first one pill got rid of my migraines, then I needed two. Last time I took this med I took two pills and with no effect at all.  I have frequent migraines and I have taken this pill while on topamax and without topamax.  I think the topamax may help with effectiveness, but I am not sure.

After trying 5 other medicines, I am finally taking this and it is wonderful.  I can take this medicine at work and it does not make me sleepy.  Also I can take this medicine the night before if I know the weather is going to change drastically overnight (which is a major trigger for my migraines) and I will wake up the next morning with no headache.  Sometimes I do have to take a second pill to get full relief, but not often.

This Frova is great I only have to take it once and can function as normal. Cost is secondary if the relief is primary.

Two tablets, taken a few hours apart, will almost always take care of the headache.  Makes my teeth numb though and usually causes mild &quot;medicine head&quot;. :)
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/9/2007 8:50:20 PM	I have clusters and this has been working pretty well to treat them, except this last time (today) - I have taken 2 in 4 hrs and still the headache isn't completely gone - but at least I can function!  My co-pay is very expensive on this at the pharmacy, so you may want to check that out first so you aren't unpleasantly surprised.
