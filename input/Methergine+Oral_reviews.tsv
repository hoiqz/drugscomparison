Hemorrhage Following Delivery of Baby	Laura, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	45-54	2/24/2012 11:37:37 PM	Although this medication was effective for controlling/preventing postpartum hemorrhage, I had a very weird reaction to it. After the intramuscular injection in the hospital I felt very strange. Almost as if I was out of my body. Difficult to explain but   I very much did not feel like myself at all.  I chalked it up though to just the excitement and exhaustion after giving birth. About 6 to 8 hours later I finally felt &quot;normal&quot; again. Two weeks later I began to experience some gushing bleeding so I was prescribed some Methergine tablets. After the first tablet I had the same bizarre feelings. I could not wait for it to get out of my body so I could feel back to myself again. Twenty years earlier I had taken this same medication for some postpartum bleeding and had no side effects whatsoever at that time. After this last time and my freaky reaction I will not ever take this drug again unless my life depended on it.

Dr. chg'd from Tompamax to this. Horrible severe musclular cramps from between shoulder blades all the way down back into hips and legs. Has anyone else suffered from contracting body muscles. My current dosage is 1 tablet 3 times a day.
Incomplete Abortion	beware, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	2/20/2010 4:05:59 PM	I took this med after an incomplete abortion, for &quot;retained products&quot;.   Anyway, I took it for 3 days and on the 4th and 5th day I had severe and debilitating cramps.  I even went to the ER for the pain, and I've never been to the ER in my adult life for anything, that's how bad the pain was.  If I knew it was going to be that bad, I would never have taken this pill.  I was on the couch in horrible pain for 72 hrs!!!  I couldn't get more than 4 hrs of sleep at any given time because I would wake up in pain.  Motrin, Vicodin, and Tylenol was hardly effective in controling the pain.  As far as it being effective, I guess it did what it was suppose to do, but I sure paid the price with pain!  In short, if I would've know....I would not have taken this drug and would've opted for the D and C instead.  I don't even know if that kind of pain is typical or not, haven't been able to find out that information online, and I haven't been able to get a straight answer from any healtcare provider.  If you take this med, be prepared for pain and heavy bleeding (if taken for similar reason).  I would do it when you can plan to take time off work, etc.  It was a rough go for me and would never do it again!!!!

Other	VM, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	9/21/2009 9:27:12 AM	Given after an abortion. Has given me painful cramps each time that I have to take ibuprofen with which seems like it would negate the effects.I was told this medicine would both help with the uterus to control bleeding and the cervix to close back up so it seems like I need it but it's not a nice medicine to take.

Other	BOB562, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	8/5/2009 6:32:08 PM	I am using methergine for migraine.  Combined with Motrin 600 mg trhee times a day it has been effective in cutting my migraine rate in half from ~12/month to 5-6/month.  I am concerned about on-line comments of long term effects of atrery hardening.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	6/24/2009 8:05:07 PM	I was placed on this med for migraines just 4 weeks ago..I for the first time in 10 yrs have reduced my migraines by half..I have been on several treatments this is the best thus far
Other	ruth, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/10/2009 3:27:24 PM	I have been on this medication since 1988 to treat migraine.  It was very effective for me and although as I get older I do not need to take it as often, it was a lifesaver for me.  I took it daily for many years.  
Other	Sharon1E@aol.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	1/11/2009 6:19:01 PM	I was prescribed this medication for Head Pain Treatment.  However, after being on it for 6 months, I must go off it for  month.  At that time, I must have a chest x-ray, MRI of the abdomen and echo.  This scares me that there could be some serious side effects to this medication if this has to be done every six months.
