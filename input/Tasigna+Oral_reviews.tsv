This has been very scary since heart disease runs in my family.  I was told by an oncology counselor to take this med 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating but now I am reading the opposite.  That may be why going to sleep is so frightening!  I'm taking this med the wrong way!  No vomiting or dizziness.  And fatigue is not too bad.  So overall, this medicine is truly lifesaving for me.

Chronic Myelocytic Leukemia in the Accelerated Phase	Taos Guy, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	9/3/2011 1:09:29 AM	In 2006 I had a Near Death Experience with a 60% Blast Crisis at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston after Gleevec failed. I was on it since 2002.I got on Tasigna immediately after the NDE and it was Heaven! I never looked back.Gleevec caused brain damage to my pain receptors, so I'm on Morphine three times daily. That's a tough one to manage!But for Tasigna I can't say enough good about it and MD Anderson. If you have Cancer get to them immediately. They are the World leader in Cancer for 7 years!

But after 1mo on tasigna, no side effects have occurred. (exception: I am iron deficient) 
Type of Leukemia - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia	dodeme, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	5/20/2010 7:06:37 PM	I began taking Tasigna about 1 month after it was approved. It has been so much better than the 2 I had taken before. I recently began having many health issues which I only just learned are due to the side effects listed on this site. I probably have about 90% of them. I jsut wished someone would have told me about the side effects, as I have recently thought that my time was drawong near. That was very scary.
Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia	ibpatti32, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/1/2010 2:59:31 AM	This is a drug that you must follow the direction to a T. Absolutely DO NOT consume any grapefruit products as I did on my 2nd day and had a 8 hour black out. After being on ot for just 1 month, my H&amp;H, RBC, &amp; WBC are in the normal range. I was on Gleevec on 9 years but the cml grew resistent to it. I am feeling very positive about the results so far. You just need to get your body accustomed to it, then you are set. I'm determined to make this work. I have been battlking CML for 16 years!!!
