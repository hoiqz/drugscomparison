It was something I was born with. Until I am ready to have a hip replacement, I'm only 29, this is the only thing that allows me to be able to walk. I've been taking it for almost 4 years now and have had no side effects. The only thing I notice is a little car sickness (when I'm not driving) and when I don't take it, my hip is in pretty bad shape and it's hard to walk. My would not be functioning without Daypro.

Near the end, my urine output was severly affected (went every 10 hours and barely). After only missing 2 doses, my urine output returned to normal. I refuse to go back to this medicine.

I also have psorasis (moderate) that I have had since I was a child.  This drug is the only change I have made in my diet and it has significantly improved my skin.  I will be asking my dermatologist (who has me on Humira injections) if we can add this to my regiment.  The only side effect I have noticed is that I have been experiencing a few bad leg cramps.  But, this would not be enough to make me want to come off of this drug.  It has been wonderful!

Daypro has helped with these conditions but I'm going on a two-day headache and the ringing in my ears is distressing.  I do, however, need to get w/Doc to determine if it is the medication causing these side affects.

The pain is almost completely gone after taking one month.  I have gained my life back. Side effects, however are not good. Frequent morning headaches, stomach aches, and diarrhea. Right now, for me, it is still worth taking- even with the side effects.

Carpal tunnel sysmtoms are completely stopped with this medicine. I can miss one dose and feel the pain. I've had no side effects that were detrimental to this drug. Has allowed me many hours of pain relief and a more normal day to day living. Arthritis in hands is getting worse now. My doctor is changing me to Mobic. Hopefully it will work as well as daypro.

The medication does afford me a few more hours of sleep than previously.  Perhaps a proper diagnosis will determine if this is the medication I should be on.  Stomach pain does get severe at times, but the good news is it has seemed to curb my smoking. : - )
