Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/27/2012 2:46:24 PM	I have lived with migraines for 18 years and have gone through so many different treatments before my doctor switched me to Botox injections every 3 months and Relpax for when I get a migraine. Both are miracle's to me. I was having about 28 migraines a month with recurring to no relief at all. Now I only get about 5 a month and I take the Relpax and it is gone within an hour or so. The only down side is that I get 9 a month and have to pay 13 dollars for them. 
Migraine Headache	headacheallday, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	8/16/2012 9:33:34 PM	After 3 nerve release surgery, I started being treated for the new picture of my illness. The first try was treating with Relpax. Extremely expensive, impossible to be approved by my insurance for the correct number of tablets a week...First week - I was supposed to take a max of 4 a week - it helped a bit...3rd week, my headache - which is milder after the surgeries - were back, not as intense, not as steady, but back.

Migraine Headache	Jingle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	6/5/2012 8:51:39 AM	First time using it - got rid of the headache within minutes - which I LOVED but the side effects are really making think I don't want to take it again.  I got the tightness in the chest and jaw and I just feel completely drained.  Maybe it will get better since it was my first time taking it. I rarely have any of the side effects noted so this was a first for me.  Would have given it 5 stars all around if it weren't for that weird feeling I got.  I would give it 100 stars just for getting rid of the pain :-)

Migraine Headache	Charlie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/26/2012 10:25:18 AM	I really want to share the benefits of Replax with each and every migraine sufferer.I have had severe and debilitating migraine since birth, the kind where I would lose my vision become paralized from the wait down, I would be vomiting and screaming in pain. I have tried every migraine drug that has become available over the past 40 years with no relief. I really didn't think I wanted to live like this any longer as the pain had taken control of my life. I could barely make it too work most days and I could never plan to do anything, I lived my life in fear of the next attack which was always only just around the next corner. I started seeing a new GP and I broke down to him and said I just can't do this anymore and he asked me if I had tried Replax? I said no, but I'm willing to try anything, not having much hope as I have been so excited about new treatments many times and then really disappointed when they all didn't work. So I started on 40 mg, the next migraine I took my 40mg Replax and it really was helping but with an hour the migraine had broken through.So I took another Replax and it helped but once again the migrain broke through.So now I am on the 80mg tabs and Replax has completey changed my life. I thank my doctor everytime I see him and tell him how he is truly responsible for me now having a pain free life. I can say yes to friends and make plans to do things, I can work and not have to feel so embarassed of all the time I had to take off. Please if you are a migraine sufferer of any degree, you must try this treatment.I have had no side effects, I just have my life back.x

However, it did give me fast heart rate and that was quite uncomfortable. i'm on the lowest dose. I was, i am pregnant, so i can't take it until after i'm delivered. but i will gladly take fast heart rate over vision corrupting migraine!
Migraine Headache	dlavin, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	1/29/2012 3:53:41 PM	I am required to use my Relpax 40mg onset of a migraine, and not to take another one for 2 hours. Well at 1pill 40mg does not work on mine, I have to take the 2nd pill 20min to 1/2 hour later if my head can stand it. well sometimes that does not work and I can only take 2 pills in a 24 hour period. So I end up taking my Fioricet if the 2nd Relpax does not touch my migraine,then the pain in my head starts to go away....I know you have to be careful because taking Fioricet to much can set off cluster migraines..but to be honest with you....I get my migraines 15 days out of a month and last bad one i had lasted 8 days in a row...

I am a Contractor and cannot take mind altering medications and the Relpax worked for me the first time and has NEVER let me down yet. So many years of trying medicines that made me all strung out and then we tried this and it was like the story of the Three Little Bears-it was just right!  My insurance won't cover it and I can only get 9 tablets per month at $308, but I only use it in an emergency.  I did the IV w/Demerol and Morphine in the old days and that was so bad.  I'd have to stay overnight at the Hospital and all.  I just wish they would make medications that were not so expensive or at least make the insurance companies cover them.

It's a bit more expensive and my insurance keeps trying to get me to switch to Imitrex (which doesn't work for my migraines) but I refuse to switch.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/7/2011 5:34:35 PM	I was previously on Maxalt, which didn't always work for me, when my Doc prescribed the Relpax.  It works well for me within a half hour of taking it.  The only downside is the price.

Migraine Headache	kellysue, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	9/9/2011 3:17:20 AM	I am disabled by my frequent and all the other stuff that comes with the package. If I feel a migraine coming, I take my relpax, a couple of tylenol 3's, and a phenergan. So far after 20 years of searching, trying most of the triptans, Relpax is head and shoulders above the rest. The only thing I'm worried about is I am living on very limited income and my insurance will only let me have 6 more pills. My Doc wants to put me on Maxalt. I tried it and it barely touched my migraines. Luckily, I did some research and found that Maxalt is contrindicated when taking propranolol.(which I have been taking for years for migraines). The only reason I'm not 100% satisfied is because I am afraid I won't be able to control these migraines from hell- This is the FIRST TIME I'm not heading to the ER screaming in pain, wondering if they think I'm a drug seeker.
Migraine Headache	Active Middle Age Mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/23/2011 4:53:28 PM	I've tried many of the meds in the &quot;triptan&quot; family&quot; and have found nothing to be as effective as Relpax. Approx. 90% of the time, Relpax is very effective at getting rid of my migraine headhache.  The majority of the time, I only have to take 1 pill w/very little, if any, side effects.   The other 10%, I immediately start vomitting w/my headache so I can't keep any meds down for prevention.  My migraines started in college, tappered off when I had childred in late 20's - early 30's, and then returned in my late 30's.  I see a Neurologist regularly and am now taking Topimate 100mg night, Relpax and will use a steriod pack if we can't break a migraine cycle that lasts for more than 24 - 36 hours.  Not sure why my migraines are increaseing in frequency and pain as I get older but it's not fun to live with for me or my family!
Migraine Headache	Lifeback, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/18/2011 12:27:00 PM	I have daily migraines that no doctor can seem to diagnose why except that it is &quot;thought&quot; to be premenopausal. After trying about 50 different medications, and several different type of Dr's my Neurologist prescribed Relpax. It is amazing! Yes, I do get a little tired sometimes but I have my life back. I've been taking Relpax daily for about 6 months now. I know only 3 per month have been tested but I would be in bed daily with no life if it weren't for this miracle drug. Pfizer needs to study daily use to let consumers know of any long term damage. If I wait and take it when I have a headache it takes about 2 hours to kick in so I take it at the first sign. It makes me feel happy (I believe it's because I have a life) and takes away &quot;all pain&quot; such as neck/back/muscle pain. Relpax doesn't work for everyone but for me, it's my life. My insurance tries to limit to 6 per month but Dr's request can override that. When I began taking Relpax, I would have a heaviness in my chest but my body must have adjusted to it because now I have only slight tiredness. I can deal with being tired by drinking caffeine. Relpax is truly a miracle drug!   
Migraine Headache	Lena, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/14/2011 9:29:30 PM	I get migraines 4 times a week. Relpax has been the best medication for me.  I have tried Imitrex and others nothing has worked as well as Relpax 40mg. The downside is at times I feel very weak and my body feels heavy, there are other days I take it and I am fine. I try to take it at night before bedtime if I feel one is coming and it worksgreat. 
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/26/2011 12:16:12 PM	I suffer from migraines for 10+ years now. I've tried imitrex, that doesn't work as fast and the side effects after are flu like. Relpax relieves headache within 1 hour of taking and rarely do i need 2 pills to get rid the headache. the downside is the cost, but if you nee to come back from a rebound headache, tylenol 3 with codine is great1

I wish there was another way to administer it other than oral
Migraine Headache	Kathryn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	5/25/2011 8:05:21 AM	I'm apparently sensitive to medication, but Relpax did nothing for me. I took a dose in school about noon, and nothing happened. At one point, it reacted with my other medication and caused me to have an allergic reaction (I was taking Verapimil, Topimax, and Nortriptlyne). I still have a good amount of pills I haven't used yet.
Migraine Headache	ken, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	55-64	5/15/2011 12:14:29 AM	Took it with breakfast about 7AM.  About 9:30, was so tired I went back to bed and slept for 5 hours.  Stayed up about 3 hours, and went back to bed again for 4 hours.  Up again about 7PM, but drowsy and weak.  I'll stick with Imitrex or Vicodin and Xanax.
Migraine Headache	KITKat, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	13-18	3/18/2011 7:15:16 PM	Took the medication for the first time for chronic migraine.  Within 20 minutes the pain from my migraine began to subside but my neck began to become increasingly to unbearably painful.  Then more symptoms developed: jaw pain, tongue discomfort. Headache eventually went away within hour but at that point neck pain was as bad as migraine had ever been.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/16/2011 7:21:48 PM	This is very effective for me; however, you should take it as soon as you feel a headache coming on.  I've waited by taking other pain relievers and when I finally took Relpax it took longer to work and my symtoms lasted longer.  When I take it first I am very pleased with the results and my day is not ruined by pain.  The only side effects that I sometimes get are sleepiness and sometimes a little bit jittery.
Migraine Headache	m21, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	3/14/2011 12:00:45 PM	I ended up in the hospital with severe rectal bleeding that ended up being an ischemic colitis, most probably caused by the 2nd dose of Relpax. Extremely scary experience. I will suffer with the migraine if this is the only thing that will help my migraines...
Migraine Headache	Jadejewels1983, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	3/10/2011 4:26:01 PM	I find if I take this as soon as symptoms begin it works very well.  I sometimes require a second dose.  I sometimes have the feeling that my limbs are heavy and feel very cold, but still would rather these symptoms than the headache and vomiting! I used to only get 9 pills for 90 days thru mail order but started to get it locally and get 9 pills/mth.  No generic so a bit pricey but worth it.  I sometimes have difficulty with nausea/vomiting if the headache is full blown before I awaken to take the meds and then can't keep it down.  Does anyone have a suggestion for what to eat with it, cause nothing seems to work if I get to that point which happens somewhat often?

I got my life back!!Now my docotor told me that I have developed a rebound headache.  Now I have to go off this med cold turkey, What is a good med to take so that I can keep going?
Migraine Headache	dont have one, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	1/24/2011 12:52:45 PM	I have had Migraines for over 30yrs. As of now this is the only medication that is working some of the time. It makes my hart rate very high because of that my doctor prescribed Lorazepam to treat the side affect. Every time I take it there is a 50/50 chance it will work. It beats a shot if it works. I do not like them at all.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	11/12/2010 10:42:29 AM	I found that if I don't take the Relpax right away, I need to take 2 pills. I also found that if I take 1 Tylenol Extra Strength at the same time it works even better. The Relpax gets rid of the nausea and I don't get as sleepy. The biggest drawback is the price.

I use to take Imitrex, and I have found that Relpax works better. Downside however is the cost and the fact I only get 4 pills per month. Also, I feel really strange....the pill gets rid of my headache, but I feel like I'm floating or in slow motion, somewhat fuzzy, and I get a slight sore throat. Does anyone else get these symptoms?
Migraine Headache	Always Read Frirst, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	45-54	10/15/2010 1:38:59 AM	I have been taking this med since I did not like the side effects of imatrex, 20 years. But recently was having insurance payment issues, the dr. had to make approved to get the 30 day max at one time. There has been a new side effect of having  Stoke. Buyer Beware. To get over being exhausted try caffeine.
Migraine Headache	Jamie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/9/2010 8:59:03 PM	This medication has changed my life.  I suffered with migraines that lasted 3 days and tried many of the other migraine medications with no relief.  I really thought I was doomed to live with them forever.  Relpax works within 45 minutes of taking and relieves ALL symptoms.  I use to be laid out for days praying for the moment when relief would start to come.  I missed time with my family, work and social commitments.  Now 1 pill and I can continue with my day virtually uninterrupted.  I can't imagine my life without it.  The only downside is the cost, but it is truly worth every penny.  If you have never tried this medication and are suffering with migraines, I urge you to try it.  
Migraine Headache	yogaguru, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/7/2010 9:35:51 PM	So far Relpax is the best drug for taking care of my migraines.  I do have to make sure I take it right at the start of my migraine or it isn't as effective, but usually it takes care of the headache and the other side effects (like nausea) that go along with the headache.  It doesn't give me the unwanted side effects like Treximet does also (dizziness, fatigue, nausea).  I am also worried about rebound headaches, because over the years the amount of pills I need a month has increased, but I have always been on more than one type (being careful not to mix them) because my insurance only lets me have 4 to 6 pills a month.  I used to need about 7 a month (combined), but now I need around 14 a month.  I'm not sure if it is the Relpax that is causing that or the Treximet (the other drug I take--which I'm trying to find a substitute for that doesn't have the side effects) or both or some other reason.  I have an appointment with an endocrinologist to see if hormone therapy might help decrease the amount of migraines I get a month because the main cause of my headaches has to do with my menstrual cycle.  We'll see.

I usually get at least one headache/migraine per week. This is the first medication I have been able to take that relieves my headache within a short timeframe and allows me to function throughout the rest of my day. I have see comments about the cost...If you think these are expensive, I used to use a different drug(Imitrex)and I paid more money for less pills, on top of that the medicine made me nauseous/sick and I couldn't function on it. Relpax is worth the money for the job it does. I am very pleased!!
Migraine Headache	Tonya, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/6/2010 7:00:26 PM	I have extreme weakness and fatigue after taking Relpax.  I am sluggish, nauseated, and have no energy for a full day.  It is worth getting rid of the migraine, but I wish I felt better following treatment.

I'm still not sure if I really get migraines or some other type of headache but this works for me.  I only worry that it may cause rebound headaches.  I have up to 20 headaches a month and end up taking between 6-12 Repax pills a month.  Can it be addictive?

My daughter used it but it didn't work for her. This pill is not for everyone. Because of the price I use it sparingly. Use it only when over the counter meds. don't work.
Migraine Headache	Paula, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	5/26/2010 8:14:26 PM	I took Relpax last night for the first time. with 20 minutes I felt like someone was choking me with an extreme amount of pressure. with 40 minutes I had extreme rightside facial pain up into my ear and down to my chin. by the time I got to the emergency room my tongue hurt so bad it hurt to move or lightly touch, very nauseated also. Needless to say it went in the trash, but on the good side it did work for the migraine

If by chance, I do not catch it soon enough, I take my second dose. My migraines are severe enough that occasionally, I will have to take a second medication. That is a rare occurance. I cannot take the generic medication - Imitrex. Something in it makes me vomit - not high on the list of things to do with a migraine.  
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	3/21/2010 12:19:07 AM	First off, this med. is expensive!!! I suffered from migraines that completely took over my life. I quit my job and was miserable. I took this on occasion along with my Topamax. When I took one, I would be comatose for days. It knocked me out within an hour of swallowing it. I'm not sure if it ever helped with the pain b/c I was sleeping the whole time! Had to stop taking b/c I had to atleast be AWAKE to take care of my son, even if I was in pain.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	3/10/2010 11:35:21 AM	The medication is effective in stopping my migraines - more effective at onset, but takes a little longer once it's full blown.  The problem that I have is that the symptoms I experience seem to put me right on the edge of a heart attack.   I experience shortness of breath and moderate to severe chest pains.  I suffer from indigestion and this pain is very different from the indigestion feeling I experience.   I'm kind of at an impasse:  medication works but concerned about, what I consider a severe side effect.  Will have to consult with doctors on alternative...will probably go back to acupuncture which seemed to help as well.

But, alas, it finally kicks in.  Also seems to tigger my asthma. Otherwise, good.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	25-34	2/19/2010 1:03:36 PM	This drug is very expensive but it works.  If I take it right away, it works great.  I have found that if my migraine is full blown, it takes much longer to effectively reduce the pain but it usually makes me drowsy or spacey and causes my vision to become slightly cloudy so I usually can sleep for an hour or two and wake up refreshed without a headache.  It costs me about $150 for a 6 pack due to having awful insurance but is well worth the cost.
Migraine Headache	beckerbutt, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/14/2010 3:30:12 PM	I have been takeing this medication for a while now for my migraines. But when I have a basilar migraine i have to take midrin.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	1/31/2010 12:42:58 AM	Relpax was the best migraine medicine for me, until I became &quot;immune&quot; to it and it was less effective and I had more rebound headaches.  I didn't have any side effects, and the migraine was gone within an hour.  I'm on Treximet now, and I'm going to go back to Relpax if it becomes ineffective.  (the lower scores are due to it being less effective with time)
Migraine Headache	Rebecca, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/22/2010 3:30:10 PM	Relpax is my favorite migraine med. I'll take one and an hour later there's no more pain, and it rarely comes back. It does make me very drowsy so, if I can, I'll nap after taking one.

Migraine Headache	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/1/2010 10:52:25 PM	this has worked very well, even when my migraine is pounding away.  Usually quells the ache within 2 hours.  Very rarely have to take a second one in a given day.  Doesn't make me as drowsy as other meds have.

Migraine Headache	CH, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/7/2009 9:54:04 AM	I have been taking Relpax for 6 years now and is the only medication that has taken my headaches away completely in less than 1 hours. I feel 100% better and able to funtion completely the rest of the day. My issue is getting a doctor to prescribe it. They all tell me I am having &quot;rebound&quot; headaches from the mediation itself. Since I have had headaches now for 30 YEARS... I would say rebound is not exactly correct. My insurance does pay for 12 per month but that is the limit. My doctors seem to think that I should not be taking more than 1 or 2 a month. Obviously they do not suffer from migraines! Migraines have been a battle for my entire adult life and if Relpax is the only relief I can depend on why can I not have it &quot;as needed&quot;. Give me a product that is safe to take as needed! PLEASE!

Just like all of you who have found it to be a wonder drug for your migraines; beware, DO NOT TAKE TOO MUCH!  I have been adding more and more tablets because I have had more and more migraines.I now have the migraines everyday which are caused by increasing the Relpax on a regular basis.  Now I am in Detox to rid my body of the Relpax.  I do not wish this upon anyone.  Seek expert advice.
Migraine Headache	PainBgone, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/25/2009 12:55:52 PM	So far, Relpax has been the only drug to actually deliver results that I am stunned by. I was getting severe migraines about 1-2 times a month that were bad enough to send me to the emergency room. And I am not one to just go to the hospital on a whim.. The pain injections I would receive would knock me out within 15 minutes and I would be out until the next day. My neurologist prescribed Nortriptyline @ 50 mg for my reoccurring &quot;regular&quot; headaches and gave me Relpax for the migraines. Well, the Nortriptyline has really worked well on the everyday headaches and I'll pop a Relpax when I have a migraine, which has decreased to about one every 2-3 months, and within an hour it is gone. My only regret is that I waited almost 20 years before seeing a neurologist about my headaches. (I am still waiting for a check from all the OTC pain reliever companies for my single-handily keeping them rolling in the cash from all the massive amounts of pills I was taking)Yes, Relpax is on the expensive side, but it is worth every penny..

The pain is so intense I usually vomit and cannot function. I was prescribed Relpax and have taken it a lot. It helps with the migraine within 30 minutes, but does give me a weird pain in my neck and makes me a bit loopy! I do feel better the next day and don't have that &quot;DUll HEADACHE&quot; that I always would have in the past.

I would sometimes take up to four Excedrin Migraine pills, six Anacin and at times four Advil IN ONE DAY!!! Now I take one Relpax and I am good to go. Thank God for this medication.

This works in about 30 minutes.  I love it!  The only problem I have is my insurance will only give me 6 per month at $45.00.  So, I let my headache get pretty bad before I take it to be sure I don't waste them.  Sad, but that's insurance for you!

I've been on Imitrex and I had horrible side effects. I've also been on midrin &amp; that didn't seem to help at all.On Relpax I have NO side effects. It helps my migraines within 30 minutes. The best drug ever! Will continue to use.
Migraine Headache	MINGO, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	10/15/2009 8:19:02 PM	I have a current perscription for RELPAX from my family doctor. I have been suffering a steady stream of frequent migrains for the last 18 months. However I have had migrains since the early age of 5.Most perscriptions were basically pain medicine. Imetrix was one drug perscribed by a Neurologist 15 years ago. The migrain stream dried up and the headaches were subdued.I am entering menopause and the stream of migrains are once again flowing rather rapidly. I have named this condition Mingo. Relpax is a great help to the overall Migrain condition. Most drugs seem to mask,numb or work more effectively with another migrain drug. However I find that RELPAX releives the Migrain and allows me to funtion at a comfortable state in existance.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	8/5/2009 5:40:06 AM	I've had headaches since I was 12 and migraines for the past 4 yrs. This medications works about 85% of the time for me. If I take the full 40mg at one time, I get severely nauseated for 2 hrs and it gets rid of the pain but, if I take 1/2 of the tablet, I don't get sick and it will only ease most of the pain.  I can't complain seeing as I've tried Axert, Maxalt, Midrin, Imatrex shots, and Elavil. For someone that has very frequent migraines, I would actually recommend trying Relpax. You can still function while taking it, compared to most migraine meds. 
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/3/2009 10:13:02 PM	I took Imitrex for a long time and had to take several in one day.  I have 3 day headaches.  With Relpax I take 1 in the morning and it takes care of my headache all day.  I have to take a Relpax every morning of the 3 day headache but it always works.  I have taken Relpax for several years.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	7/30/2009 3:30:41 PM	It usually works best if taken at first sign of a headache or sinus ache.

After talking with my Dr  it is a very rare side affect but it is in fact a side affect for some.  It's worth it though this med works wonderful for someone like me who needs it almost daily.

Also taking Topamax as a preventive. Love that I can continue to work or drive when taking Relpax (unlike with Imitrex - too sleepy), but I am experiencing severe low back and hip joint pain that I have just decided might be a side affect of the Relpax. Anyone else? I did see a couple but not many. I am under age of 50 and don't want to think this is causing arthritis or something similar to set in early.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	7/19/2009 12:20:58 AM	I've been using this for about 5 years. I'm 24 and have had migraines since I was about 11. I've tried Darvocet, pain killers, and Imitrex. This works great! I do agree that it does make me feel drugged. Most of the time I can take half of the 40 mg pill and it takes it away, sometimes even 1/4 of the pill does it. The thing I hate about it is that it's very expensive - about $6 per pill. It makes me tired if I take over 1/2 of the pill and I do get cold when taking it. Strangely enough, it acts like a diuretic for me. Not sure why.

I have tried every drug out there and hated the side effects of all the drugs especially the preventive drugs that made your speech slur and messes with your thinking.  out of all the triptan relpax is the best.  It always works for me but makes me drowsy.  The other only drug that works for me is fioricet.  but you have to be careful with that one because it will give you rebound headaches.  Hope this helps and repax is worth the money
Migraine Headache	mswel, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/28/2009 11:00:25 AM	Finally started taking this a few years ago and it works great. After 30 years I can tell when it's coming so take this right away.  I know it is expensive and I only get 12 per month.  What I do is get the 40 mg and cut in half with a sharp pill splitter.  Have been told that they won't work that way, BUT they do.  Sometimes have to take another half but many times this works and I do it because 12 per month is not enough and I don't want to save them for the &quot;worst&quot; ones.  This also means I can keep some in a container bedside and in my purse and don't have to try to get those darn packages open when I already feel lousy.  Hope this helps someone else.

Would strongly discourage use of this drug, not worth the side effects.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	4/27/2009 2:03:04 AM	I have suffered migraines for many years now and this is by far the best treatment I've tried. While other medications have been effective, the side effects are almost unbearable. Relpax gives me no side effects at all! If I don't catch the migraine early it can take a while to work (1-2 hours), but when caught early it only takes about 30 minutes. 
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	4	5	5	Female	35-44	4/25/2009 7:03:06 PM	Unlike other medications, most of the time Relpax Oral works even after the migraine has escalated.  
Migraine Headache	tinalou, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/23/2009 10:50:10 PM	I've suffered with migraines for 35 years. I've been taking Frova for the last 5 and thought it was a miracle drug; until Relpax.  This is the first drug that relieves the blindness that I experience in the first hour of my headache. My sight loss only lasts about 15-20 min and thus far I've been back to &quot;life&quot; in about an hour.  Before Relpax I'd spend the remainder of my migraine day in a general funk and still needing to take other pain medications.  I highly recommend this pill!

When I feel a migraine coming, I take 1 tablet of Relpax and I can continue on as normal without any side effects except feeling fabulous in about 30 minutes!  Sometimes I have to lie down and relax to get the medication working if I'm having a stressful day.  I love this drug!!! 
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/27/2009 11:27:26 AM	My doctor said to try Relpax and if I am a typical migraine sufferer it would work.  It did. Before that I had migraines that would last 2-3 days.  I'd take Tylenol PM just to numb the pain.  My life has changed in a good way.

I have tried everything and I mean everything.  I have suffered from excrutiating pain, nausea, blurred vision.  Before Relpax my headaches lasted for 48 hours each. As far as I am concerned, Relpax is a miracle drug. I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from migraines.   
Migraine Headache	jbrook, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/6/2009 6:14:09 PM	I love this medication!!! I have only tried one other prescription migraine med before this one -- frova -- and frova didn't work at all.  Relpax is fantastic, if you take it right away when you are feeling the migraine coming on.  It is very expensive, but totally worth it -- keeps me out of the ER.
Migraine Headache	lovinRelpax, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/3/2009 7:53:42 PM	I have suffered from migraines for 20 years. Relpax is the only drug that has ever worked for me. It works in approximately 30-60 mins. I had been taking 40 mg tablets. I found out later that you can get them in 20 mg tablets. Because it is so expensive, I switched to the 20 mg tablets and found that if taken as soon as the headache hits, it is very effective. I only have to take 2 for those that wake me up in the middle of the night. I experience only slight tiredness with Relpax. I would highly recommend this drug to anyone looking for fast effective relief from migraines.

I just recently have started to experience that tingling in my hands.  I think Relpax is great and I recommend it to all my friends who suffer also with migraines.

I do think I have had back pain the next day as a side effect and I am so thirsty in the hours after taking it.  I;d rather have that than headache though!!!!!!!!  I also am on 200mgs of topamax.  I have migraines, icepick and tension headaches.

I was hoping for longer relief.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/19/2009 1:13:19 AM	I was just recently diagnosed with migraines, and this was the first medication my Dr. recommended. It took about an hour and a half for it to kick in. But it worked! I did have some tightness in my chest, but my dr said that would be normal. It also made me feel somewhat &quot;out of my head&quot;, but it was worth it to get rid of the headache!

It has been such a relief to me so that I can function, play with my kids, carry out my daily routine!

I STARTED USING THIS PILL RECENTLY AND IT DOES NOT MAKE ME DROWSEY OR SCATTER BRAINED  LIKE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER MEDICATIONS I HAVE TAKEN IT DOES NOT EFFECT MY THINKING.IF YOU HAVE TAKEN SOME OF THE MIGRANE MEDICINES YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
Migraine Headache	hurricanebetsy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	1/2/2009 8:30:25 AM	Took the medication last night and have only slept about a half hour.  It has made me hyper beyond belief.  I am exhausted and my migraine is still there.  No, it is not as bad, but it is not much better.  This drug was a complete waste of money for me and I don't have insurance!

Migraine Headache	fmmack1306, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	12/26/2008 9:54:11 PM	After taken this medication, I felt like I was drugged. The migraine didn't go away and I slept constantly.  I was unable to do anything for feeling drugged and sleepy. I also had slurred speech.

I am not experiencing any side effect that is the beauty of that pill. It will only work if I take it as soon as I feel the migraine coming. It will not work if I wait to long so I've lurn to keep the pills with me at all time. I never thought I could ever see the end of this painful disease. Thank you to my Migraine specialist Dr Hohol and Relpax. I am now a normal person again.

Then along came Relpax,my miracle drug. I can now have a life. I can play with my kids, I can work! I can finish college. All because of a small 40mg pill. If nothing else has worked for you, don't give up at least try this one, it worked when others never did.
Migraine Headache	Breezy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/6/2008 4:16:31 PM	I have had migraines since I was 13, I am now 27.  I tried other meds but without success.  The first time I tried Relpax it worked. It was unbelievable, no pain and the visual disturbances stopped.  I used to get numbness on one side of my face and the same side hand would go numb too, relpax works before that can happen.  I used to want to crawl into a dark hole and die when I would get a migraine.  I dreaded them because the were so painful and nauseating, now I don't worry about them because I have relief!  The pills are expensive if you are not covered but totally worth the money.  Good luck to you.

Relpax is fast acting and hardly any side effects. I consider it a miracle drug! Can only get 6 pills per month/$55 so it is expensive but worth it!
Migraine Headache	robaam136@hotmail.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/14/2008 1:07:04 AM	For years I suffered from severe headaches. My doctor gave me a label &quot;Mixed Headache Syndrome&quot; which basically means I have different types of headaches...tension, migraine, menstrual. Before getting the correct combination of meds, I would pace the floor for hours and then hang over the toilet throwing up. The combination that really works for me is ... Fioricet (especially for the tension headaches that go up the back of the neck), fioricet with codeine if it increases, relpax for the migraines, especially the ones with the aura/the bright flashing lights in front of my eyes. If all these don't kick in, I take tranxene to knock me out. It's better than showing up at the Emergency Room or wishing you were dead.

I get the fast heart rate and nausea, headache and feel jittery.  With relpax it is expensive but it works and when you have a migraine you will pay anything to take it away.  I highly reccomend it.  Good Luck.

It is expensive and I think it does make me somewhat drowsy, but it's a big improvement over having a migraine. I have needed to take two pills a day on occasion, but it usually works in one dose. 
Migraine Headache	Minnie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/9/2008 12:35:09 PM	This med works quickly and effectively with very little side effects so I can still do my job.  Other medications arent working like Treximet, maxault, immitrex, prednizone.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/23/2008 2:58:10 PM	This medicine has worked great for me. It knocks out the migraine usually within 2 hours, and it doesn't come back. With no medication, my migraines last over 24 hours.  It is expensive though.

Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	45-54	9/2/2008 10:17:57 PM	Relpax is the only migraine med. that has worked for me (tried MANY).  Must take right away and usually within an hour, it's back to everyday life.  My only complaint is the packaging - I usually need help getting the pill out. 
Migraine Headache	beth, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/19/2008 3:13:09 PM	I have had debilitating migraines for years and nothing has worked till now. The first time I took it it made me very drowsy and I got the tightness in neck and throat, but the headache went away. Since, then i haven't noticed the drowsiness and the tight feeling I can deal with. I love this drug and am so happy I have finally found something that makes it go away so quickly. Wonderful drug, truly. I have my life back.
Migraine Headache	 on Treatment for 10 years or more	4	3	4			8/14/2008 2:04:02 PM	I've had miagraines for quite a number of years and Relpax has been helpful to me, not just because of the fact that it get helps my headaches,but because if I didn't have it I would be in trouble. I have a siezure disorder and sometime my headaches have actually caused my siezusres to occur.

Been on Relpax last 3 years, tried imitrex, topamax, and any otc drug you could think of and nothing else helped. This is a Wonderful Drug! Never had any side effects before, but dr just up'd the dosage to 40mg and had tightness in chest &amp; throat. Headache is gone though, almost always gone within 30 minutes of taking pill. Usually only take one. Do have to pick and choose which migraines are bad enough to take a pill for due to the cost, but wouldn't go back to anything else!

Migraine Headache	nmkbutterfly69, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	35-44	7/4/2008 5:33:11 AM	Relpax works great at the start of a migraine. the only issue is that it is so expensive. I have great health insurance and pay $50 co-pay for 6 pills a month. This is out of my price range but it is the first thing that has helped. Any advise as to how I can get this med without going broke. I already pay $90 a month in meds &amp; this on top of it is way too Much! But it feels good to be able to function again. It's truly been wonderful I can work and not have to take as much time off. Cost help is all I need anyone know how to help? 
Migraine Headache	Jefoid,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		7/2/2008 6:46:09 PM	This drug has been a minor miracle for me.  It works just about perfectly every time.  It takes up to an hour and I only get 6 per month, but it has given me back many days I was losing to migraines.  It has truly made my life better.
Other	Ken,  Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		6/30/2008 9:57:25 PM	Suffered from headaches for about 25 years and took every pill the hmo doctors gave me until it eroded my stomach away. It sounds crazy but you must see a traditional Acupuctureist. This took most of my problems away and the relpax assists with my episodes.

Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/5/2008 2:46:15 PM	I have had migraines since I was 9 and I am now 24. This product works wonderful when I feel a migraine occur, but if I wake up with a migraine or it comes on really fast it sometimes takes a long time for it to work and sometimes not at all. If I have chronic severe migraines i have to take 2 pills. you have to watch how many you use if your insurance is like mine and will only let me have 12 pills every month. Overall to me this is the greatest thing since sliced bread since I have so many migraines. I would recommend this to anyone- and would also like to see a generic brand sometime soon.

It took a few hrs for it to work, but I had been running errands all day and waited till I got home to take it.  The pain was VERY severe by the time I took it and I could feel it gradually working.  I had no side effects and would reccomend this med to ANYONE suffering migraines!

I have not experienced any ill side effects from taking it. I'm lucky that my insurance company will allow me 12 per month.  Since it is so expensive, it would be nice to see a generic available on the market.

I do experience drowsiness if I get still and tightness in the throat at times after I've taken it. OTC is useless for my pain, Relpax works within an hour for me. 
Migraine Headache	JWalk, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/4/2008 2:45:22 PM	Tried Imitrex but this works much better.  Within 30 minutes I am so much better it feels like a miracle.  One of the most effective drugs I've ever used.  Price and monthly limits can be a problem.  Also, tends to space me out due to restricted blood flow to the brain.  Best to not work on a day I take it.  But I have worked after taking one and done ok.  
Migraine Headache	valerie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	4/3/2008 9:04:00 AM	my first migraine medication due to bad reaction to tylenol, and took a few hours with 1 pill but eventually relieved the pain did not take second pill, a bit nervous because doctor only gave me 4 pill to see how I reacted to them.  so it is early days for me and so far no side effect yet.  I have 2 left and will only take if the pain is bad, good pain? I do not have neausea or auros with headaches just starts at the neck and temples so now that I am 63 looking for a better quality life is possible pain free.  I have been diagnosed with diverticulitis and suffer pain bowel movements difficult and have been told all is related so, have had this condition for years and tired of feeling lousy so opted to try better medication than over the counter.  Tyleno I am conviced is now causing terrible heartburn acid relux chest pain constipation.  I hope relpax is the one to give me a relief and so far no complaints.  
Migraine Headache	Baby Mary, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/26/2008 8:24:33 PM	This medicine has been a lifesaver. It is the only migraine medicine that has worked for me!  I used to be down for hours when a migraine struck.  If I take this medicine when I first feel the migraine coming on, I am completely rid of the headache within 30 minutes.  Very rarely do I ever have to take two tablets. I do not experience any side effects except being tired for that day - but that's so much better than a migraine that I really don't mind being tired!!
Migraine Headache	help4myhead, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	3/8/2008 9:40:09 AM	This med. really works to combat my migraine although it seems to come back about 12 hours later.  It's the best med. yet for treating my headache.  My side effects, however, were severe drowsiness, constant yawning and nausea.  Has anyone else experienced depression with this drug?
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/28/2008 11:07:15 PM	i take one as soon as i sense one coming on. within thirty minutes i can ususally feel it working. rest is a must w/ me when i take the pill. works everytime and fast!
Migraine Headache	cmg, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/9/2008 1:12:43 AM	I have always had problems with migraines here and there when I was younger, but then I starting having migraines that lasted about 3 days during my period. NOTHING got rid of it. I had tried hormone pills, Maxalt, Imitrex, Topamax, Verapamil, Loratab (after trying OTC drugs first of course) Sometimes it would get so bad I would have to go get a shot of Toredol &amp; it was affecting my job. But after taking the Relpax it has been great! The headache is usually gone in about 1 hour. The only problems that I have is that before the headache goes away it feels like a band tightening around my head and it feels like the headache is getting worse, but then ALL of the pain is gone. I can function at work when I take it, but if I take it and get still then it does make me tired. All in all, it has been GREAT!
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/31/2008 6:22:27 PM	This treatment has been a life saver for me
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/19/2008 10:35:12 PM	This is a relatively new med on the market and i have to say it works wonders.  for years I have been hopping around migraine meds and this by far works the best for me.  Although i will say i occasinally have the &quot;chest pressure&quot; they talk about.  Give it a try .. you'll be greatly surprised! 
Migraine Headache	Lauren, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/9/2008 1:30:52 PM	I have been getting migraines for over 10 years now and usually get 1-2 migraines a week on top of cluster headaches.  My nuerologist introduced me to replax 4 years ago and it has been one of the most helpful drugs I have ever taken.  I also find taking 2 advils with the replax also helps.  I am also on daily preventative medicine.  This medicine is expensive and you are only allowed a certain amount per month so I do have to pick and choose which migraine is worth the medicine.  I do have a back up prescription for something else but it doesn't work as good.  Replax is a life saver and I couldn't live without it.  Before I used to go to the hospital for pain shots.  This drug does make me very tired and my chest tender from taking it but I can deal with that over the intense pain of a migraine.  
Other	kbeuoy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	1/3/2008 5:49:59 PM	I suffer from cluster headaches that only happen once in a few years. This is the first medication I have taken that actually eases the symptoms. I have to take a 40mg pill every 12 hours or so but it actually works. The only other medication that had any effect is Imitrex, but it did not last long enough to really help. Oxygen is my primary cure for the pain. It's taken at around 7-10 liters per min but usually relieves the pain within 15 minutes.

Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	45-54	12/29/2007 3:33:50 PM	my previous migraine med no longer worked after years of use, Relpax works great.  The only change I'd like to see is for it to come in a sublingual tab with an easy open package.  When I wake up in the middle of the night with a migraine, the last thing I can do is struggle to get into it's little packet and then get up for some water.  
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/13/2007 3:49:09 PM	This medication works wonders. It's important to take at the start of symptoms, otherwise the migraine can return.  Only downside is severe prolonged drowsiness and some nausea.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/11/2007 11:27:50 AM	I love this drug! Within an hour my pain is gone and I am back to normal!

On rare occasions, my migraine is so bad I have to use 2 pills, but that's usually if I don't take it at the onset. Since I started taking Relpax, I rarely even have migraines. So it's not something I have to take every day. I usually only have to take one pill every few months. I haven't had any side effects, and I am so pleased. I couldn't thank my physician more.

Migraine Headache		2	5	3			11/27/2007 4:19:53 PM	It made me a little tired when I took it, and it actually didn't work very well. I'm thinking that I didn't take it at the very onset of the migraine.Also, too expensive. The box only gives you 6 pills.
Migraine Headache	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	13-18	11/18/2007 8:16:57 PM	Took it as my doctor prescribed, however I'm generally sensitive to medications. I started to feel tingly and had trouble breathing and swallowing. I also had some heart and chest palpitations. Despite the excess of side effects, I could tell the medicine helped the migraine, at least a little bit. Too bad the side effects were unbearable. Looks like I'll have to try a new one.

I have dealt with mograines for years and other medications tend to make me feel worse. I can take it at any point during a headache and the pain is releived within an hour.

In rare instances, I have had to take 2 in a day and that was probably less than a handful of times.  Honestly, this medicine has probably given me back quality of life.

It doesn't require you to sleep it off. There is no headache hangover the next day. The only problem I have with this medicine is you are only allowed 6 pills for a month and they cost $160.00

Migraine Headache	Debbie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/22/2007 9:28:16 PM	You name it, I've tried it.  I have suffered with migraines since I was 14.  I am now 37 and for the first time in my life, I have found a drug that actually gets rid of my migraines without completely knocking me out.  The only drawback is that it makes me so relaxed that if I get still, I will fall asleep.  I liken the feeling of being on Relpax to having your eyes dilated.  You don't feel &quot;drugged&quot; like so many of the other migraine medications, but it does make you feel &quot;wierd&quot; like having your eyes dilated.  However, that is a small price to pay for getting rid of a migraine.  I am still able to function at work while taking the medication.

And Relpax is the best for my migraines. I only take one at the first sign of pain,and thats all i needed and I'm usually in pain for 3days,but not now I'm fine with Relpax. 
Migraine Headache		5	5	5			10/10/2007 11:12:49 PM	I have had a lot of problems with Imitrex making me feel sick.  So far, I haven't experienced that with Relpax.
