Been on it almost 2 years. Concerned that I will need testostorine. Patch or something.  Anyone else seen testostorine decreases?

Enlarged Prostate	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	6/8/2012 10:05:55 AM	51yo, taking med for 2 months.  Urinary symptoms somewhat improved after first week, dry orgasm after first dose.  Very mild nasal congestion, no lack of libido as some reviewers have reported.  Stopped a week ago, ejaculation returned but so did weakened flow and dribbling.  Will refill prescription and resume taking med.  Dry orgasm not a big issue because I've only had a slight decrease in orgasm intensity and lack of semen doesn't bother me.  We're no longer in the baby-making business, anyway!

I usually take the drug early in the morning. One morning I took the drug a little earlier than normal, got on a flight and passed out. Same thing happened with Flomax. My doctor recommend taken the drug at bedtime. I have not had a problem since. These drugs can drop your blood pressure which will cause you to faint. Please read up on the side affects of these drugs. Taught me a lesson. The drugs still gives relief. I am considering the TUNA procedure. Read about it should fix the prostate problem.

It helped somewhat with force of urinary stream and stopped urge and frequency. Still get up as always in the night. Very unhappy with this drug. Dr. wants me to stay on it 3 months but I am pretty sure I will not. Side effects are miserable.

Rapaflo is the best drug that I have used so far.  The less semen does not bother me and it certainly does not bother my wife. But more importantly I don't get dizzy from it and it works better than the others.
Enlarged Prostate	JBK, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	19-24	8/16/2011 7:55:59 PM	I find that rapaflo works very well for my BPH. I dont have any urinary retention and dont have the urgency to go all the time now. The biggest side effect is the lack of any ejaculation. It very much lowers pleasure, but with the BPH and prostatitis it is very much worth it. I do notice that I am the only reviewer on here that is in the 19-24 range. Maybe being young has helped with the side effects.

I think at first I was retaining urine.  It can also make you feel a bit unstable, but if careful you should be fine. I take it around 1700 (5 PM)
Enlarged Prostate	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	5/12/2011 9:56:16 PM	37 Year Old Male.Was diagnosed with Acute Prostatis and given anti biotics as well as Rapaflo to help with urine flow + frequency and the misery/pain/senstation radiating thru my groin and surrounding area.Overall Rapaflo worked fairly well to reduce frequency and flow right away.  Within 1 day it provided relief.Overall it worked fairly well to reduce pain/burning/sensation but that took longer and may have been in conjunction with the anti-biotics.Stuffy nose as well, but that went away in a couple of days.Retrograde Ejaculation worst side effect.  Does not seem to go away as long as you take the drug.  Goes away in about 3 days after you stop taking it.  To compare - If you feel the standard male ejaculation is always a 9 or 10 (scale of 10), retrograde ejaculation is about a 2 on the pleasure scale.Terrible side effect but the relief is worth it for the short term.
Other	Scorpiokarma, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	65-74	4/19/2011 2:38:42 PM	Rapaflo does work and works well. The BIG down side is the horrible side effects. My Doctor mentioned one side effect and none of the others. He gave me a few samples and an Rx. I started taking the pill and in 2 days I felt awful and here are some of the side effects I experienced: dizziness, lightheadedness, tightness of chest in breathing, being tired, doing a chore, I ran out of energy after about 5 minutes and had to sit down, a fog in my brain, disorietention, and a few others. I stopped taking the pill after 3 weeks and my body came back to normal in about 4 days. The Pharmacist warned me especially about the side effects and she was right on the money. Best advice if you HAVE to take it, take it at night before bed time not in the morning. This per the Pharmacist and it helped.   
Other	Dick, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	65-74	4/17/2011 7:55:22 AM	I am taking this med because my Dr advised that I might need assitance with my voiding.He scraped a tumor out of my bladder and after several days with a rather large catheter in, the Dr advised that after removing catheter I my need asst. voiding.

Worked within 24 hrs and was able to have a better urine flow. Stopped taking until my regular doctor can verify it is ok to take while on verapamil. Only side effect was lack of seminal fluid during ejaculation. Was told this is normal due to reducing the prostate size. Does not affect functionally of sex drive but will hinder pleasure for those who like seminal fluid as part of their pleasure. Will make for conception impossible. Some minor dizziness is to be expected, but will subside. Best to consult your doctor before making it part of your regiment.

My Dr. prescribe RAPAFLO, my honest opinion has not do anything beneficial up to now, perhaps because I have been on this medication a little over two weeks, but my biggest problem I do not ejaculate that all even though I have normal erection, some thing to worry about because I mind you Im 75 y.o. but I have a very young wife. Other than that I do not have any other drastic side effect up to now but I think I ask my Dr. for another solution if there is any, otherwise Ill think in compromise some how.

Also, I was experiencing extremely severe pain prior to ejaculation - I could only do it with myself and had not had a sex partner for seven years due to ED.

Enlarged Prostate	Mike MN, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	65-74	5/25/2010 5:27:17 PM	Was on Flomax - caused stuffy nose, dry mouth, sore muscles, light headed &amp; some crazy dreams. These side effects outweighed any benefit.  Switched to Rapaflo, only slight stuffy nose remains. Rapiflo does cause complete anejaculation (no ejaculation, &amp; not in bladder).  Slightly to moderately diminished orgasm remains, a somewhat strange feeling but o.k. to good.  Overall, Rapaflo works much better for me than Flomax.  The pluses greatly outweigh the minuses.

Enlarged Prostate	rick, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		3/20/2010 6:56:16 PM	I had been treated at VA hospitals with numerous meds. none helped incdluding FloMax types. VA gives out only generic meds, went to a local Dr. who said try Rapaflo-Hooray it worked went from 10-12 trips a night to 3-4. Cost is only drawback. For me it is very very expensive &amp; for those of us on fixed incomes-the VA has nothing generic of this med, but I will stay on it as long as the pocketbook allows. Sex life went down but cant have everthing at least I am sleeping better, VA does give out a genaric Viagra will give it a try.

Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	2/19/2010 9:10:30 PM	Used for constricted bladder neck. Tried Flowmax, Cardura, and Uroxatrol. Have been using for 2 weeks. No dizziness like flowmax but very stuffy nose. Orgasim is good but nothing comes out like others. Seems to work about the same as flomax. Some relief but still straining many times to start urination.

Enlarged Prostate	MichaelE, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	65-74	1/1/2010 1:26:39 PM	No ejaculate.  Quit for that reason.  Having depression and anxiety.  Suspect quitting cold turkey may have been the reason.

Enlarged Prostate	jd, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	55-64	10/6/2009 1:21:45 PM	great relief but no orgasm...it is a side-effect called retrograde ejaculation. the ejaculation goes into the bladder and is urinated out later. no harm done.
Enlarged Prostate	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	9/26/2009 6:31:02 PM	Was using Flomax but it was not working that great. My doctor put me on Rapaflo and within days I urinated better. It feels like the flow is better. A funny thing was that I have had a stuffed nose while on the other drug and that seems to have totally gone away.
Enlarged Prostate	readysteady, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	9/16/2009 12:57:47 AM	Works pretty well for what it was designed for. Biggest proble is that I hardly ejaculate. I'm 60 yrs old and devoriced, I do have a girlfriend and I have never had this problem. She noticed within a few days.
Enlarged Prostate	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	55-64	9/7/2009 12:20:59 PM	Worked great for my urinary flow and output.I felt like I had completely emptied out.Did not do much for the frequency especially during the nighttime. Could not have an orgasm or ejaculate. A real negative especially considering the improvement in urination. Discontinued the drug and going back to the Doctor to see what can be the next step.
Enlarged Prostate	Dennis, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	55-64	8/31/2009 9:22:14 AM	The medication provided immediate results - but like others, I have a much shorter orgasm or none at all.  Not good!
