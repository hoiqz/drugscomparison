I take 3-4/day of 5/500.  I am little concerned about the Tylenol and the fact I have lost the hair on my arms.  I attribute the latter to the hydrocodone.

When I first took it the I felt no pain for two days, but then the pain came back randomly. It would even come when I just took the Vicodin an hour ago. Maybe I need a higher dose. It works most of the time, but I'll still get pain at least once or twice in the day.

Then it would get rid of people that abuse it because they would od on it. The folks that really need it could get it without having to go through a battery of expensive tests to tell them what they already know. Most doctors won't write a scrip for it for fear of our nanny government. Just my 2 cents.

For around 2 years I took Vicodin 5/500 and just recently had my dose increased to Vicodin ES.  Much more effective.
Pain	Tri-Pod, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	35-44	3/9/2012 10:18:04 AM	i was involved in 2 car crashes a couple years back.  I had double knee surgery  a few years later.  It only lasted a few months and then my problems started coming back.  After another year and a half the pain became miserable.  I hated my life and hated getting up in the morning until I hated getting up the next morning.  The pain was destroying my life.  Without any medical insurance I was SOL. So... I started using heroine.  I used it in very small doses because I didn't really like the way it made me feel, except for the mild relief (due to mild quantity use) of pain.  This went on for 2 yrs.  Finally I was/am able to get medical insurance that accepts per-existing conditions. Then I stopped heroin (ya, that was 5 days of major yuck!)use.  The doctor was such a blessing.  She put me on vicodin (thankfully because I never let heroin get out of control the vicodin still works) for a month then I asked for an increase.  The pill only lasts for about 4 hours and taking one every 8 hours is a bit of a roller coaster.  I'm so thankful for this drug.  Of coarse if doctors were not so stingy and afraid of the gov't I never would have had to take heroin in the beginning.  Oh well, that's the past.  Now I take 5-6 norcos a day along with a Butrans patch.  As my L4 and L5 is about completely deteriorated, my sacrum is torn (still under investigation) and my knees are blown out again I am thankful for Vicodin.  Side effects for my opiate use of 2 1/2 yrs. include: mild constipation, loss of hair on my legs.  Long term side effects unknown.  I hope i never find out.  I want fixed!!!!!

I found it only mildy effective for this purpose.  I have since used it for lower back pain associated with muscular spasms. It is VERY effective for this use as it allows me to relax completely, thus relieving the muscle spasms.

The doctors put her on Hydrocodone with acetaminophen for real bad head aches. Well they never winged her off it but instead kept on increase her doses the they moved on to morphin and other stronger pain meds. Then she became depended on them after a 7 years battle i went thru with all her doctors all her organs shut down due to the damage the meds had done to her liver. SO MY ADVISE TO EVERYONE DO NOT TAKE ANY MEDS WITH ACETAMINOPHEN IN IT. IT WILL KILL YOU! I miss my mother everyday she was only 53 years old and the doctors knew the meds was killing her they just choice to do nothing about it. God bless my mother's soul i wish i was with her to hold her and comfort her.

Pain	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/8/2011 6:52:51 PM	I have been taking this medication for 2 1/2 years since being injured in an I.E.D. attack while deployed to Afghanistan. Some people have a very high potential for abusing this med and precautions need to be taken. I keep all of my narcotic medications locked in a safe to avoid the possibility of my meds being stolen and abused by others. I also am very cautious who I tell about my taking this medication due to the high rate of abuse and illegal sale of this and other prescription medications.  Bottom line is it works great for my chronic pain condition, but I am extremely cautious of how I take it and who knows I take it. Like I said I keep this medication locked up along with all other meds to prevent unauthorized access and to prevent my children from obtaining access and abusing.

I have permanent nerve damage in both legs.  I have been to pain management by Johns Hopkins and I want to tell you, had it not been for Hydrocodone at the time, morphine, and oxycodone, I'd be a basket case.  I was extremely concerned about permanent addiction but the top notch doctors told me not to worry about addiction as my condition will always warrant it.  Therefore, I'm still on pain management with narcotic drugs 29 yrs. later and had it not been for them God knows what would have happened. Thanks for listening!

Other than making it a little numb after taking two tablets in 6 hours, it was nearly useless at reducing the pain. Next time I'll try aspirin. Addictive? Who'd want to be addicted to a drug that does nothing?

It is very effective for my back problems and sometimes even helps my mood a little.  Without it I don't function quite as well due to being in such pain.  Yes, it is addictive, be careful if you are taking this medication, but without it(for me atleast) I'm not a very involved mom due to pain.  I am also on Soma 350 at bedtime which has worked wonders for my sleep.

Other	Kayosphere, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/22/2011 2:23:23 PM	I hate this drug. I have taken it in the past for pain and never experienced any relief - only upset stomachs and continued pain. Furthermore, I left my ex-husband because he was addicted to it. He also started drinking heavily and taking other prescription narcotics as a result, and he started stealing prescription drugs from other people or taking them as payment for favors just to get high. It's possible he's clean now, but I have no idea. He completely ignored me and changed into someone else, and he abandoned me for the drug. Our lifestyle was mostly fine on the outside and no one ever knew, but on the inside I was completely shattered. When I left him he crumpled, and it hurt me to tears. I still love him to death, but my life has been renewed because I'm not struggling to see him through his addiction. I watched my father kill himself with alcohol and I watched my mother enable it for 30 years, so I refused to do it with my own husband. I'm now afraid I'm seeing a co-worker experience a Vicodin addiction, and it's making it nearly impossible for me to work with them. Please, PLEASE do whatever you can to get help as soon as you can to avoid this horrible drug for your health, your sanity, and your relationships. &lt;3

After a previous treatment by my regular dentist, he gave me Tylenol with Codeine ##3. It did nothing.  When I had the root canal done by his collegue and specialist, I told him the Tylenol #3 was insufficient. He gave me Vicodin. I have been satisfied, and hardly had any pain as I took it right away as directed.

Pain	salemsmom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	45-54	9/8/2011 10:06:42 PM	My doctor prescribed this for me to treat pain from severe arthritis and fibromyalgia. It takes the edge off the pain so I can work and function. It does not take the pain away totally. Like others have said, doctors are too afraid to prescribe pain medications because they have been so badly abused by others. It means that people that have genuine pain have to suffer for the abuse/greed of others. If you have pain you have to jump through hoops to prove that you will not abuse them or sell them. It makes winter here in the Northeast difficult to get through.

I don't have Health Ins... this medication is A LOT cheaper than Lyrica, wish it wasn't but, it is. Lyrica costs me $289.00 a month to where Vicodin only cost me $39.00 a month for 60 of them. I am able to do my housework, grocery shop, just get up and moving around. A lot of people say that it not only helps with pain but they get a buzz as well. Me... It's like drinking 3 energy drinks. No normal side effects at all! I'm just so happy that I have a somewhat normal life again. Oh, and a very nice and compasionate Doctor who takes very good care of me.

I had taken the med for several years but only took 1 daily to get me up and going.But when I took a whole one the first time it wiped me out(note:med should be adjusted to weight and diet). So I adjusted to half in morning and then noon. Went well for a while but I did notice some problems with my vision.But after some years of taking this med I notice of a side effect of nausea, and now I cant take them or the thought of taking makes me sick. I do not think this med is good for long term.

I only recommend using it for post op recovery or you are terminally ill. It has ruined so many lives. I had chronic pain and used it for 6 years. My tolerance was through the roof. I had to have major surgery and they could not medicate me enough to even dull the pain. All narcotics work the same way and once you have this tolerance, nothing will help cut the pain and there is nothing that they have alternatively. You never know when or what could happen if you truly need serious pain control. You could be in an accident and not get any pain relief. I personally had a hysterectomy and went through agony because they gave me the maximum limit of IV meds they could and I felt like they cut open my stomach without even numbing it. I could not even speak I was in so much pain, all I could do cry and scream in agony for days.It will be one year on July 14th since I had this experience. I stayed on meds for 6 weeks of recovery and have been off them ever since. In my experience I will only use it if I am recovering from surgery or something truly unbearable. I am writing this because I want people to think about these things when you get on this medication. What happens when you really, really, really need it?  I truly hope that people understand what this medication is meant for which is short term pain relief for Acute Pain. I know how awful it is to be in pain. I still am everyday, but it isn't worth going through that if I were in that situation again.

I love how it takes away the pain within 15 min if I take it at the onset of pain, then it knocks me out so I dont feel it for like, 8 hours. This medication is the best Ive had for very severe pain. Ironically, it doesn't make me nauseated like most acetometaphine does.

Also, I am a complete ditz.  Not worth it for the temporary relief that I get from the pain - I guess if it ever hurts badly enough I might try it again, but it seems like a good night's sleep is more helpful for healing than a night spent staring at the ceiling.

I have had physical therapy, exercises, R.I.C.E. techniques more times then I can remember....I finally found a rehabilitation doctor that prescribed vicodin for pain and its been a life saver.  I have always been uncomfortable while sitting, standing and esp. driving.  I was limited to only walking for exercise and could only do limited house work before this treatment.  It is a pain (no pun intended) to remember when to take the medication at its proper time but the hassle is worth the result.  I can live (somewhat) pain free and live a normal life.

Pain	 Male  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male		4/12/2011 8:41:49 PM	I was given hydrocodone/APAP 5/500mg and it helps me a lot.  I have been having moderate-severe pain in my lower left abdomen, and the didn't determine the cause after two visits.  The medicine helps me but I was only prescribed 15 with no refills so I usually take 1-2 a day as needed, even though I can take 2 every 6 hours. I usually take it at night because it does cause some drowsiness, although some people do not get drowsy.  I know my review has 4/5 stars but I give it 4.5 stars.

It is not something I would get addicted to. It is not strong enough.And I have taken every strength there is. When I hear of people being hooked on them, I believe they are also using something else with the Vicodin.I have had the dentist prescribe them for me, and the dr for a back injury, and I just don't waste my time with them by taking them.

It has been a life saver. I don't have any side effects, i control the constapation with diet. I can,t imagine my life without this, i am able to function and do my daily routine. I also take nerotin, savella, and lexapro. Can't say much about the savella working for fibro. neurotin is helpful for the neuropathy, and the lexapro has been somewhat helful for the depression of having a painful chronic condition.

It works fairly well but I've noticed that you have to be careful about taking it to frequently because you can become addicted to it before you know it. It sneaks up on you before you know it plus the effectivness decreases.

I was in quite alot of pain and began taking one at a time every 4 hours at 8 max a day. On the third day I was feeling much better and only took 2 Vicodin that day - then all hell broke loose, I began feeling dizzy and faint and almost blacked out several times. This lasted a few hours and was very scarry to say the least. I don't know what happened, my wife thinks I was having withdrawls from the higher doses I took before. Be careful with this stuff.

It has become worse in the last 5 years. Norco 10/325, works well but constipates me severley with other meds I'm on also. Good old pitted prunes takes care of that problem. I'm due to start epidurals soon. I had one in my C7 area in July 2008, it barely last one year. I ended up unemployed last year and I could not get an Orthopedist to even see me unless, I could pay cash. So I've went almost 2 years with the pain. If I didn't have to work (High School Teacher) I could manage. Seems that doctors don't think a teacher does much physically over the course of a day, boy are they wrong. I guess to qualify for a disabilty you'd have to be at death's door step or an invalid!

It also helps with stress headaches that nothing else seems to touch (and i've tried various meds).  i do not misuse this drug.  it is constipating when taken regularly.  i add that i take this on &quot;as needed&quot; basis not every day.  i try to utilize cold/hot packs, rice bags, etc. before resorting to meds. no side effects when taken this way.

A good friend of mine was doing the same as I was so we quit together. she suffered from MAJOR withdraws but I didnt have any but loose stools. 3 years later I noe have a toothache and when I went to the dr he gave me some 5's. I came home and took one waiting on the rush I use to get and instead I spent 4 hours throwing up and sleeping! Needless to say i took them back to the pharmcy. I dont think it is for me any longer but that may not be a bad thing. This med worked wonders when I first started taking them but you need to be cautious. if you notice you have a problem get help before its bad. good luck and God Bless.

After many many doses of Ativan they gave me a vicodin and sent me home.  This was the most horrible experience of my life.  I was hallucinating and literally screamed like a banshee (that`s how my mom described my behavior) for almost the entire night after they discharged me.  I would only recommend this medication to someone who has had an unsuccessful time with other meds to relieve their pain.  Again this was the worst experience I have ever had and I will NEVER take vicodin again!!!!

I have been taking vicodin on and off for over 1.5 yrs. If you take it as prescribed it can be effective. With me.. origanally it takes the pain away and also gives me a good feeling and speeds me up a bit. this is where addiction comes into play. So now .. after a tolerance is built up in your system your mind and body craves more. For the simple fact, I don't get the same good feeling and speedy effect i once did. If i take more than prescribed those feelings come back. But see... Now addiction has taken control and i now have worse side effects. I become drowsy due to crashing and alot more irritable as well. On top of all this i will need to get more pain meds somewhere because i ran out. I'm one of the lucky ones.. Because if i take more than one pill as prescribed i become itchy get hives and don't feel well at all. This may not happen with others as everybodys body will react differently. I have witnessed 2 girlfriends get seriously addicted to this drug and they would do anything to get more. This is definately a double edge sword type of drug. If you find yourself taking more than prescribed for any other reason than the actual pain seek help. there other non narcotic meds that can help. And if you are taking alot more than prescribed and run out.. Whatch out. The detoxing off these is horrible! And lastly.. They don't usually tell you. If you are taking more than prescribed it will eat up your liver and can possibly kill you after long periods of abuse. thanks for reading and good luck!

I had 16 knee surgerys between the age of 15 to 20 yrs old. I was on vicodin es and b4 i stopped taking it i could take up to 15 to 20 tabs a day and it didnt take care of the pain nemore. sense then i ended up on oxy and that worked for a short time and it stopped working i just stopped cold turkey and i had no problems with withdraw at all. I am now on durgigesic patch that i change every 2 to 3 days and it works very well for chronic on going pain.

Now, one leg(the one w/replaced hip) is 1 inch shorter than the other!!! This causes tremendous overall body pain.  Withdrawing from Vicodin was HELL. I did it on my own, because my physician's did not know the supervise withdrawel symptons. It took a month. Vicodin at the precribed dose caused neurapathy and worsened pain.  Stay away from this stuff!!! Find another way to deal with your pain.

Cannot feel the pain at all but as soon as it wears off..back again..I can only take it at night as the drugged/heavy feeling doesnt allow you to function. I'm afraid of addiction so only can take it once every couple days.

Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	11/17/2010 11:49:17 AM	I have been using this drug for the better part of two years for degenerative disks (2) in my upper spine. I have been trying to avoid surgery and it is the only drug that allows me to keep working. I am a 40 yr. old family man w/2 young children. I do not abuse this drug but have certainly become much more tolerant to it. I take 1 750-7.5 tab 3-4 times daily. Constipation is my only neg. side effect. This is my wonder-drug as it also greatly reduces a social anxiety disorder that I have been struggling with my entire life. A positive side effect. I am now under pressure from my Dr's to get the surgery I have been trying to avoid for so long because of new DEA restrictions on Hydrocodone/Vicodin. I am NOT addicted to this med as I experience NO withdrawal symptoms when I cease taking it. Even if I were addicted, it seems a better option than the risky, possibly unsuccessful surgery I (may) require (?). In my opinion the Dr prescribing these meds should be sure the patient has no former addictions. How this could be done I do not know. An addictive personality has the proclivity to become addicted to just about anything, and conversely so for non-addictive personalities it would seem. It is simply a shame I am now forced to get major back/neck surgey because of people who abuse drugs they don't need.  
Pain	OnTrackNow, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	11/16/2010 2:53:12 PM	  Took this originally for a herniated disk. Worked immediately when nothing else would. But it also had an interesting side effect... what the literature calls a &quot;false sense of well being&quot;.  In fact I had always suffered from a generalized, sometimes disabling anxiety that was non-specific and largely irrational.  It appears it's a form of Delayed Stress Syndrome from many years of severe child abuse. Consequently when I take Vicodin the &quot;false sense of well being&quot; is not false at all. It's actually more real than reality without it. Vicodin is enabling, refreshing and a cure for more than just  physical pain.  Fortunately I have found Physicians who understand this and they prescribe a low dose (500/5) once a day (more on rare occasions) and feel it is safe and non-addicting. Frankly I wouldn't care if it was addicting since a cure is a cure. If you have to take insulin for the rest of your life for diabetes is that an addiction?  Incidentally before Vicodin I tried all the so-called anti-depressants (Zoloft, Buspar, Prozac, Wellbutrin) and not one had any positive effect at all.

It worked wonders then i didnt feel a thing. I only took 20 of the 60 pills. Now i just had a bad fall and a very severe and agonizing wrist sprain and my doctor almots refused to give me and pain meds. I decided to take some of it again (roughly 250 mg a day. I want to avoid taking too much) and once again its working wonders. I have taken 750 mg across 4 days and i feel much better.

The last 15 years I've been on Darvocet, Percocet and for the last few years Vicodin. I just de-toxed this last month off of the opiate drugs...now I need to find a non-narcotic way of dealing with the pain. Now that I'm 10 days without anything but some OTC meds...I'm feeling pain I didn't know I had. The painkillers were just &quot;masking&quot; the pain I have...surgery is inevitable. Sounds easier moving to Colorado and getting my medical marijuana Rx!

I have degenerative disc disease...the pain going down my legs is bad. I work on my feet in a kitchen all day...sometimes up to 14 hours/day. After being diagnosed in 2008 with MS and having to give myself weekly injections and other meds, I hated knowing that each month I was taking at least 120 tablets for pain. In my last meeting with my pain management doctor, I had decided to get off the narcotics and try it to get along without it. What I've found out after detoxing myself by decreasing the dosage and the amount taken daily, is how much the pain meds mask the pain we have. The stuff works good , but we're still affected by the problem.Haven't decided if I should go back on it, or move to Colorado and try the medical marijuana thing...

That has worse side effects.I have Physical Therapy starting soon  maybe that will help some.As a non addicted person, i have to recommend vicodin as the best pain reliever for me. I limp around in the evening after standing all day and feel subdued pain even when sitting just from standing to long all day. I think the Dr should give me what works and not 2nd rate meds.

Pain	SBee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	7/9/2010 1:17:31 PM	I have been on 10/325 mgs otherwise known as Norco (1 pill 6x a day) but its Vicodin for about 4 years now for severe fibromyalgia and various other pain along with it..  At first it worked great like with most people but as time went on ive been on the same dose and it is no longer effective as much.  If you can avoid narcotics all together for chronic pain try to.  Especially if you are younger, like myself, im 29.  I do recommend it highly for short term use, it is very effective.  But for long term use eventually you will need something stronger, and soon you will be on the road to more potent narcotics, which is not the road i want to be on.  If you can find other ways to deal with the pain besides narcotics, do it.  But to stay on this long term is not a good idea.  I do blame my doctor for putting me on this.  He never had plans to switch me from it when I grew tolerant to it and still doesn't.  Not that I want anything stronger, but I wish he had never put me on them for long term use.

My doctor has prescribed this medication and it has helped trmendously in reducing the amount of pain,however, it does not eliminate all the pain and I have had 4 Doctors tell me I need surgery, which I have refused because there is 0nly a 50% chance I will be pain free. I am 50 to 75% pain free with epidurals and my pain medication. 
Pain	CE, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	55-64	7/7/2010 2:26:33 PM	I was prescribed this medication 3 years ago for pain due to cervical and lubar herniation.  I tried it but it doesn't make me sleepy............it works on me like speed, even if I take 1/2 the dose...I can't sleep and start 10 different projects in one day it also can cause a bad stomach and constipation...It did a good job on taking the edge off of the pain....I didn't have any problem with addiction with this and I am a recovery alcholic for 26 years.............Every drug works differently on all of us.  Good luck and I hope their is a solution for your pain.

I had too much radiation and now have to live with radiation burn, forever, the vicodin helps relieve some of the pain, not all, but some and that is better than nothing.

Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/18/2010 3:12:54 PM	I've been on Vicodin 10-325 for 2 years due to chronic back pain. I have the epidural injection series every 6 months, however, it simply minimizes the pain. Vicodin has allowed me to continue to work, be active, and live a relatively normal life. Due to my pain level, I never miss a dose. It's unfortunate something so effective has such a negative rap. Once my boss found out I am able to function due to Vicodin, he seems to be looking at me in a different light. No worries; I'm the one with the pain &amp; as long as I need it, I'm taking it.

I have already had 1 back surgery for a herniated L5S1. Since 2000 I have had a serious amount of pain and low back problems due to my tade. In September of 2010 I will have been in my trade for 24 years. I have gone to chiropractors, accupunturists, herbalists, physical therapists, orthopeads, neurosurgeons and on and on including epidurals and pain injections. I never would take any pain meds accept Motrin 600 prescribed by my primary and steroids[methylpredsolone]. In 2009 I herniated and tore my L4 while installing a backsplash and decided enough was enough. I am currently under treatment by a wonderful doctor and who has prescribed me Hydrocodone 5/500 1 tablet 3-4 times daily. I tried Percocet, darvocet, Tramadol all with MISERABLE side effects and vomiting. I can take Hydrocodone with NO side effects accept for a little drowsiness which coffee helps, and most of all it allows me to do ALL the daily tasks I must do as a husband, father and business owner eventhough I stll have pain. Atleast its bearable. I do NOT like when I hear so much negative stories about good medication that works for people who have legitimate reasons for their particular need. I do worry about whether or not I would be 'addicted' to it but I know if I cant live with the misery of the suffering that I have endured for 10 years with Chronic Back Pain then I am most certain I will not be addicted to this wonderful medication because I hate feeling like crap to begin with. Thank you for letting me have my input and I hope this helps someone.

I have several severe pain conditions in my back and spine. The NSAIDS made me sick and did not control my pain. I have been taking Vicondin for 8 years 4 Hyd/750 and I know it has kept me alive. I had thoughts of suicide before finally finding an MD who thinks outside the box. I also was in a severe state of depression. I have tried every anti-depressant ever made. I also has severe anxiety and burning pain in my feet. A Neurologist told me to take Lyrica because Vicodin would not help and I was already probably an addict. Tried to get me in rehab. I went to a place out of town got rid of Vicodin , went home and deep dark depression and pain all came back again. He laughed at my MD and he had given me Neurotin and Lyrica plus Cybalta. (My MD already had me on Cymbalta before and no help. I took my pain as long as I could and had to retire because no MD would give me an opiate. Finally, I went back to the doctor who had me living a normal life and he put me back on Vicodin and Xanax. The two drugs the other doctors of all specialty types told me were the worse drugs in the world. My Md said not if you stay on them if they are working. I am depression free, no severe panic, and able to live a normal life again. The Vicodin sort of lifts me up and the Xanax helps with panic and I believe also with depression. Thank God for the few MDs who will &quot;think and practice out of the box&quot; if it works for a patient.
Pain	magrah, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	45-54	5/13/2010 2:09:08 AM	Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen, more commonly known as &quot;Vicodin&quot;, was prescribed for my chronic back pain, and while it was effective for a short period of time, I quickly built up a tolerance to it and the quantity needed to effect my pain levels became far to high. It is for this reason I do not believe Vicodin should be prescribed for chronic pain, and I also feel that ultimately, prescribing Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen for long-term or chronic pain will do the sufferer more damage than good. Vicodin acts quickly, but the effects fade just as fast and then the pain is back again, if not worse. Because the user must increase the dosage to combat the pain, questions of addiction arise, particularly from doctors who do not specialize in pain management. Unfortunately, opiates are really the only drug commonly used for the treatment of pain, and the risk of addiction is always present. HOWEVER, with the use of a long acting time released opiate, the pain becomes more manageable because it not only controls the pain better, it also works for a longer period of time, and for someone like me, with chronic pain due to degenerative disc disease, the absence of pain allows the muscles to relax, allowing for a release from spasm, and subsequently, also working to reduce pain  levels. Vicodin is great for a pulled tooth or perhaps a sprain, in other words, something that will get better, but will hurt for a short while. However, Vicodin is not effective for pain that lasts for years. For this kind of pain, Vicodin will do no one any good for any length of time

In reading the label warning, I found alcohol may &quot;intensify the effects&quot;. Therefore I take half a pill with wine and significantly reduced my dosage. Glad wine intensifies! Taking more than two pills a day will result in constipation, so I eat &quot;lemon essence prunes&quot; at night before bed.

I take it as needed, NOT daily. I have had two back surgeries, spinal degeneration, bone spurs,stenosis, etc. Lots of pain...I sometimes take it for weeks at a time and then don't need for same amount of time, am not addicted...for me it has been a Godsend for the really bad days. For daily use I take Relafen for inflamtion and as a mild pain killer, it has also been show to work on nerve pain and I can testify that it does. hope this is helpful to someone.

It really works on pain and allows me to concentrate plus has a &quot;relaxing effect&quot;. I have a high tolerance to meds so I take 2 at a time but noticed that I had to take them more frequently as the days went along to get the same affect. They kick in fast but seemed to where off even faster. I get total pain relief but only for 1.5 - 2 hours. I can see how these get quickly addictive. If I suffered from chronic pain this would definetely be a drug of choice. For me though, glad when root canal day is here so I can stop popping these like M &amp; Ms.

It helps a lot, but have been dependent on it. It is habit forming and I am having a hard time coming off the drug. I suggest you use it for a limited amount of time, otherwise it can be habit forming.

Pain	1greatzoron, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/2/2010 11:37:50 PM	Have been using Vicodin 10/660 TID for over 10 years now for chronic knee pain.  Was in a car accident and my knee was crushed.  This and Tramadol TID is the only thing that keeps the pain at bay. I'm in pain 24/7/365.  I have to work.  And I work in health care at a hospital, 12 hr. shifts, on my feet.  Remember people THESE meds were invented for pain, use them.  Don't feel guilty!!!  Addiction?  So what.  I cant work without a little pain relief.  And I'm also I guess addicted to BP meds because I have high blood pressure.  What is sad is that we who take narcotics have to go through hell to keep getting them.  My doctor knows how much agony I'm in and I get my meds.  But what about someone who is not faking but has a Dr. that wont treat them because they are afraid of addiction?  Chronic pain NEEDS to be treated and Dr's. need to realize this and treat us better.   Fight for your rights.  Oh and I have never had ANY side effects, just pain relief like I should have.  In fact having pain relief clears my mind so I can concentrate on the task, not on the pain.

When I finally relocated and started seeing a doctor, he prescribed Vicodin and that has been over a year, although the pain subsided from a 10/11 to a 2/3 pain level, but I found myself taking more of it throughout the day. I ended up getting hook and suffered withdrawals for 3 or more days when I was not able to refill my prescription, due to running out before it the refill date. I have now finished withdrawals and will not take this drug on an ongoing basis, my teeth are rotting and my sleep is nill to none, I cannot regulate my sleep. I have cleansed my system and will try Holistic medicine or techniques to try. I do not like getting addicted to something I have no control over. When the doctor thinks that your are misusing the drug, they will not refill your prescrition. My question is, if you tried to go without the medication and your pain immediately excelled to a 10 or more level of pain and you had to ingest more of it, doesn't that mean the strength of the medication needs to be adjusted? Thank you

I have a new Disc put in and also I have 2 rods in my lower back on either side. While I am in pain (dull) for 98% of the time it varies with the temp outside as well as the weather conditions. I cannot sleep in bed so I sleep on a couch or a recliner. The pain gets better when I take this medication it goes down to a mild 4-5 instead of going without 8-9 which is excruating and very unbearable. I think Doctors who prescribe this medication are only fooling themselves and their patients. I have tried other meds and found them to be way over rated. Oxycodone just about nearly killed me and I had a siezure with percocet. The others are jokes. I find that sometimes I have a ringing in my ears and I get migraines so I take Ibruprofine 800mg for that and it really helps. Good Luck everyone!!!!

This med. helps by taking the edge off and to give me some kind of break from the cronic pain. I have been on this for 15 years now and will admit it can be a struggle at times to keep control of the physicle addition. (Not mental, but physicle). Taking any medication like this for a long period of time you WILL get physicly addicted. But I can not funtion on the stronger stuff so I stick to this and try to have as normal of a life as possible. Good luck.

It always took my severe migraines awat at all times. The only set back to beware of is that it highly addictive as your body builds a tolerance to it. Withdrawal symptoms from this medication can be very disturbing to daily activities and work. Constipation was also another side effect. When taken appropriately, this medication worked wonders for my pain.

The side effects of opioids include sedation, respiratory depression, and constipation.  While somewhat effective at decreasing the perception of pain and increasing the tolerance to pain, my personal experience is that the side effects ***far*** outweigh the benefits.  It is disappointing to find that the medical world is still employing  Civil War technology in the 21st century when the list of &quot;effective&quot; analgesics is considered.  C'mon docs and researchers, we can do better than this!!! Really!!!

Pain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	1/11/2010 11:06:34 AM	While working with my physician to raise my thyroid levels, my tsh was 21, I developed dental pain. While waiting for precertification for a root canal, I experienced increasing pain. My dentist prescribed hydrocodone for me the afternoon prior to my scheduled root canal. About 7pm I took one pill and at 11pm took another. I didn't start with the recommended two pill dose because I had never taken more than over the counter meds prior to this.  At 2AM I began to feel panic.  I have a normally low bp and a normally low pulse. I felt like my heart was going to stop.  I went to the ER and my bp was 220/160 and my heart rate was 58.  The feeling was so weird and frightening.  However, the ER doctor coded my experience as anxiety of undetermined origin.  My insurance turned the visit down because psychiatric conditions must be preauthorized.  I felt that this was a reaction to the drug due to my hypothyroid condition.  It took two days for the anxiety to reduce although I had my root canal and must have walked over 10 miles to get rid of the feeling of fear.  I will never take this medication again, but would like to know if anyone else has experienced this reaction.  My normal pulse is 58 and my normal bp is 110/60.  Thank you for your help.

I will say that I am able to do my job all day long while taking this medication, but I cannot take this at night. I have insomnia if taken too late in the evening. I usually split 7.5/500 mg between mid morning and mid afternoon. I take this medication for fibromyalgia, which is difficult for me to accept.I find ibuprofin 400mg twice daily vitamin D 2000iu,magnesium,selenium,glucosomin sulfate, and multi-vitamin, all have helped with pain in my joints, muscles and overall fibro pain symptoms. I hope people will adhere to the precautions in taking too much narcotics. I do not want to become an addict.

My doctors don't know what else to give me for the pain. I go to the ER at least twice a week for migraines because the pain is unbearable. This medication makes me all loopy and very sleepy- which sleep is good with a migraine, so I don't mind. I have been taking this medication for about a year now and I have seen neurologists and other specialists who don't know what is wrong with me. Nothing seems to help but the vicodin due to allergies to the sumatriptan family. I am just afraid of addiction. Insurance doesn't pay for much either.

I had pain in my neck, middle back and lower back. Vicodin has allowed me to be able to sit in my chair to do my job and work. I wouldn't be able to otherwise. I have constipation, but I drink lots of water which has helped this side-effect. I'm sure there are other medicatons that would help me, but my doctor chose Vicodin. I can't imagine trying to work without the medication. I only take the pills as precribed and they have been extremely helpful. Physical Threapy has helped as has chiropractic procedures, but Vicodin has made the biggest difference and helped me the most.

I take the tramadol during the day and Vicodan at night. The vicodan will upset my stomach if taken more then once a day thou so I stick to tramadol mostly.

I also do chiro care, accupunture and water therapy.  This has been my best way of dealing with the pain

Dr.wants me to increase neurotin and vicodin x2. I want to try a new med, something that lasts longer. I have found ice to be more effective if used with pain meds. Spinal surgery should be your last option---period. They fixed one problem and gave me another! My surgeons were the best I could find in a major eastern city, both heads of ortopedics &amp; neuro depts.I don't know were to go from here, maybe Cleveland or mayo Clinics. If obama care is passed my life consist of only pain killers!

Other knee has bon-on-bone but I won't do TKR because of 1st experience. COLD/ICE works best for knees, but one does not always have the ability to ice. So, I use Vicodin at time (say at work) when i am unable to ice knees, or when I anticipate lots of standing or walking.

I do not worry about dependence that is linked to this drug. I take only what I need for pain. In addition, I don't buy into the myth that you will get hooked on this drug. I would rather take 3 or 4 vicodins daily for pain vs. 10 or 12 tylenols a day. the sid effect of taking massive quantities of tylenol worry me more than the vicodins. plus the vicodins work!

This medication is a double edged sword, and should only be taken if you need it, not for the occassional migraine or achy muscle.  Main uses are for people with spine disorders, chronic pain, and cancer.  Can cause addiction, but anyone who takes it everyday will be physically addicted, but this helps my quality of life, if i didnt have it i would go to bed every day at 4pm for 16hours.

I am probably addicted due to the length of time but until we find the source of pain an treat it, I have no choice.  But I echo earlier comments, DO NOT exceed dosing limits, usually 1-2 every 4 hours.  One, it will diminish effectiveness rapidly and two, your doctor and pharmacist will cut you off.  The feds look at this drug very negatively so docs and pharmas are ultra cautious which is unfortunate because it works so well on pain,  and forget your evening cocktail, alcohol loses all effectiveness and it is bad to drink with this med.  Also, watch your intake of the med carefully as it contains a large amount of acetaminophen which can cause liver damage if abused.

In the beginning usually 1 pill would work long  enough to keep my pain okay (the dosage said 1 or 2 every 4-6 hrs. When my back would spasm, the pain was almost unbearable &amp; I did follow the two every 4 hrs and it did make the pain bearable. I did not want anything stronger because I did have to work &amp; I was afraid of side effects.  Two years ago I was prescribed 8 vicodins (5/500) and 4 oxycotins each day while being given 4 months of radiation and 2 separate 5 day runs of chemotherapy for colon cancer.I was told the pain would become &quot;horrific&quot; and that's why the drugs were prescribed &amp; was warned to make sure to take that amount.  I was in no pain except a slight burn at the radiation sight, tender mouth sores and dry mouth and when I had to urinate it burned like fire! (from the chemo, I think). I had an MRI and colonoscopy about six months after the start of treatment and the tumor is gone. I am still taking Vicodin but now just for arthritis.The doc says take upto 6 a day and even though the pain is severe I try to get by with 2 aday or on my days off maybe none. I had pneumonia about two months ago and when I recovered I was supposed to have a chest xray to make sure it was gone. so last week I had the xray and my doctor saw a spot or something on the right lung lobe, he had me come back for a bloodtest and then he made an appointment for me to have a CT scan this week, He wouldn't tell me, but I'm sure he sees lung cancer.

I weigh about 110 lbs and my doctor reccomended that I take 2 pills before school to last me all day (after mouth surgery). I ended up passing out in class and having to be carried to the nurse's office. I was 'asleep' for hours. Definietly do not let children/ teens manage this drug.

I've had 3 back surgeries which makes the pain somewhat tolerable.  I can't take it if I'm at work, it makes me stupid, but as soon as I get home I take one because by then the pain is out of control.  I have spondylolisthesis, sciatica &amp; stenosis.

I felt better, I slept easier, and it was pretty stress relieving too. My only major complaint was it made me very very drowsy. So I would try to put off taking it until the evening despite the fact that I would be in pain during the day.

This was my 1st experience with hydrocodone- 15mg every 4 hours. It BARELY took the a LITTLE bit of the edge off my pain. It made me very groggy and jumpy by the 3rd hour. Desperate for relief, I began taking Aleve. Aleve was FAR more effective for the pain. It made the pain tolerable. I only took it at the strong advisement of my surgeon and to make me drowsy.

Pain	Stan, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	8/10/2009 8:56:24 PM	I have chronic low back pain from degenerative disk disease, usually manageable with Advil or Aleve.  Once in a while however I will bend or move just the wrong way and get sudden severe sharp low back pain.  I was prescribed Vicodin, 5/500 mg, one tablet every four to six hours and got zero relief.  I weigh 225 so my doctor said to try taking two tablets.  WOW, what relief and it lasted almost all day long.  It takes 30 to 45 minutes to start working for me but when it kicks in, Im near pain free, which is wonderful.  The only side effect of concern for me is some loss in equilibrium and probably slower reflexes.  I would definitely not get behind the wheel and attempt driving a car after taking two of these pills.  Fortunately for me, Ive only had to use this medication two or three times a month and while I understand they can become habit forming, Ive not had any problems in this area.  If used wisely and only when really needed, this is the best medication Ive ever had for severe pain.

I take up to 4 daily (sometimes I can get by with none on my days off). 3 years ago I was diag with colon cancer, treated with chemo and radiation and although I felt no pain, my oncologist said to take 8 vicodins daily as well as 2 oxycotins in the am in 2 before I went to sleep at night, I was nervous about the amount, afraid of becoming addicted, but the doc said as long as I stuck to his schedule I would be okay.  I had no pain or side effects to anything throughout the four months of treatment.  I was very pleased because I was initially told that my pain during this time would be &quot;Horrific&quot;. I just had an MRI (2 1/2 yrs later)  I am cancer free. I am always in pain because of my back but am able to work still full time probably because of the Vicodin.

I was in so much pain when I first began it, I would pant from the strength of the pain. I have had 6 lumbar epidural injections over the 4 years, and they have helped alittle. I still get the nerve pain down the backs of both legs to my calf muscles. For me the Vicodin has been a blessing. I tried the lumbar spinal decompressions but they did not help.If it does not get better I may get the radiofrequency injections to zap my nerves. The pain really saps my energy level, by the time I get home from work I usually just am exhausted. I know I have developed tolerence to the Vicodin, but they still do help alot.I think is is an excellent drug so long as taken as prescribed and not abused. I only take mine exactly as my Dr. ordered. I do worry about the tylenol in them, but all my labs are very good after 4 yrs on it.If you are in strong pain, you know what I mean, this is a good medicine.

I have had several injuries. I was bit my a cat and nearly lost my thumb years ago which led to Chronic Fatigue. I am in pain most of the time. I have a high alergy to all aspirin products. Motrin, aleve, etc. So the Dr. feels safe to give my Vicodin which is the only drug I can tolerate. I take 2 at night 2 in the morning. I hardly feel that I am dependent. Vicodin his given a bad name for the over users. And the people that need it. With high allergies to other products.

Other	Leigh, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/17/2009 5:59:55 PM	TO: bubbahlou Vicodin is extremely helpful or hurtful. It sounds like he is definitely addicted. Suddenly stopping the meds as he tried, was very dangerous  he could have died from a heart attack, had a stroke and so on. IF, he is serious about stopping, then he must withdraw slowly. If he is taking one every hour then he needs to stretch it out to every 5 hours (if needed, take a regular Tylenol in-between to help); but, keep up with the Tylenol  you cannot take more than 4000 mg of Tylenol in a 24 hour period  that will damage the liver, big time. Of course, he needs to go to a Doctor that can get him off the meds. Why is he taking them anyway? Does he have some sort of condition, pain? If he is taking the Vicodin, as well as other drugs  he definitely needs to see a Doctor or taken to a facility. I have been taking Vicodin for over 15 years, but under the supervision of my Doctor, for my medical problems and I never abuse the dosage. It can be so dangerous  look at the movie stars. Michael Jackson just died from drug abuse, just as many others have - no matter who is at fault. On the other hand, we must take control of our own lives  the Doctors can only do so much. 
Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/17/2009 5:53:06 PM	TO: bubbahlouVicodin is extremely helpful or hurtful.  It sounds like he is definitely addicted.  Suddenly stopping the meds as he tried, was very dangerous  he could have died from a heart attack, had a stroke and so on.  IF, he is serious about stopping, then he must withdraw slowly. If he is taking one every hour then he needs to stretch it out to every 5 hours (if needed, take a regular Tylenol in-between to help); but, keep up with the Tylenol  you cannot take more than 4000 mg of Tylenol in a 24 hour period  that will damage the liver, big time.

Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/16/2009 2:24:18 PM	I have been taking this medicine every so often for when my Migraines are out of control. I am directed to take one to two as needed for pain. I generally will take only half of one and then the other half of one a few hours later if the first half did not help with the pain. I rarely need to take the full recommended dosage it works so well for me. I am extremely satisfied with Vicodin. I never abuse it and after ten years of taking it (maybe eight to ten pills a year.)this pill is still so effective, I can function with a migraine (and I get bad migraines.) on this wonderful pill! I find it a shame that some people must abuse this drug.
Pain	t.t., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	7/15/2009 7:47:09 PM	The first time I used Vicodin for pain was 1993. I felt depressed and was hooked enough to use up my prescriptions. I had no trouble &quot;coming off&quot; it , however I was prescribed it for a major surgery recently. Now I discovered that I have extreme allergies. I itch from the shoulders up ,developed a minor wheeze and feel a tightness in my chest. I will list this as an allergy and never take this drug again! If this happens to you , report it to your caregiver immediately!

Pain	brokennotbeaten, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	7/10/2009 11:15:33 AM	Severe contusions and possible intervertebral disc damage. Immediately post-trauma given Vicodin. Tried for 3 days and nights. NO EFFECT. Have severe sensitivities to NSAIDS, history of peptic ulcer, and have other chronic sources of pain to which I've acclimated and live with daily. The new back pain absolutely prohibited sleep, rest, sitting, laying, bending, etc. Vicodin possibly ineffective due to pain pathway differing from the target of Vicodin and the block it places on other pain pathway(s), primarily acting via CNS and smooth muscle. Time to heal is all that worked. I went 5 days without sleep. Additional xrays revealed no disc damage. So with deep contusions to my lower lats, 5 weeks ago, still with palpable &quot;hardened&quot; damaged &quot;lumps&quot; in the muscle belly, no vertebral damage, the Vicodin did NOT help. Nor did secondarily ease any of my chronic pain (foot, knees, and hands arthritic; leg cramps at night) for which no other medical professional has been able to help. Myofascia (sp?) release by licensed massage and bodywork therapists at a medical rehab center has helped my acute and chronic pain the most. No pill ever has.

Vicodin helps in the sense that it allows me to do normal everyday activities i enjoy such as carrying my 9 month year old daughter for extended periods of time. It is very effective, but lately the analgesia has been lasting less and less i would guess due to my body becoming tolerent to the drug.  I highly recommend Vicodin for people with Chronic Pain that doesnt respond to normal over the counter medications.

I cut the dose in half and take only as needed. I have chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, and severe irritable bowel problems. When an irritable bowel attack strikes there is nothing except Vicodin that reliefs the severe agonizing pain that causes me to throw up until there is no more to throw up. There are nights I am awake all night with pains in my legs and back. I walk the floors of rub my legs all night until morning when I either finally get too tired to stay awake anymore or the pain finally eases enough to go to sleep. But, if I take a half of Vicodin before going to bed it will relief the pain and allow me to sleep, or when the terrible pain from the irritable bowel starts I take a half of dose and go into the bath tub and the pain eases.

Pain	Hampton Crabber, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	7/6/2009 2:38:56 PM	I have taken this drug for a little over 3 months.  I was not able to relieve my bulging disc (L4/L5) and sciatica pain with the arthritis strength Tylenol, so after taking and finishing prednisone (yuck, barely any relief) and only attempted to take Voltaren (horrible side effects) this is the only med for me.  I only take 2 pills a day (10mg codeine/1000 tylenol total mgs), and feel that is working right now.  I have read that dosage may eventually increase but I am not worried, I don't take any other tylenol products because I read labels, which all responsible persons should be doing in the first place.  I am sick of the people who abuse it and don't read or care what they are taking and now the FDA and others want to take it off the market.  I cannot take anything in the advil family, it does serious problems with my stomach and came very close to vommiting from Voltaren.  Tylenol is gentle on my stomach.  I just want to be able to rid this pain from the sciatica, that seems to hurt more than my disc issue.  It also seems to relieve menstrual cramps which are sometimes out of control and I can't be good mom when I hurt so bad.  Not sure if my dr will continue to fill my prescriptions but it does allow me to walk for exercise and swim with out having a lot of pain after I try to exercise.  I need to lose weight and this allows me relax knowing I won't be in horrible pain after going to the park with the kids.  I don't think my prescription is setting me up to be addicted and I wish other people would be careful about what they are doing to their bodies, I try to and will be hopeful they will keep this on the market.

I was on vicodin for 4 months the first time and now it's been over a year his time. It's great for the first couple of months and then it loses it's steem. For me it takes about an hour to kick in and allows me to moderately function and then wears off after about 2-3 hours. It's sufficient for relieving pain and still be able to function.

To keep my disease under control, i use other daily drugs, but when I am having a &quot;bad&quot; day, this is the only pain reliever that gives me comfort.  I donm use Vicodin foolishly, only when I truly need it.  I know it will continue to work as long as I use it wisely........  Its those that  refuse to use it to control the pain, instead of comfort from possible pain that you read about.  My pain needs control, not some nitwit that lives without pian telling the world people need to learn to live with some pain.  They obviously don't know how to do their jobs very well.  I heard on the news this evening that Vicodin may be taken off the market because people in pain are abusing it.  Sounds like a personal problem to me!

I am given Vicodin 7.5/750 and have also been given Lortab 10/500. Both of these medications work very well if they are taken on time without letting the pain get too bad. For me, I find the more pain I have, the more &quot;loopy&quot; I feel when i first take it, but it allows my body to get some very much needed rest so that I can go about my daily activities. I have never had a problem with addiction to these pills, and if taken properly, can provide you with a TREMENDOUS ammount of relief. I find it works well for my joint pains and for my really bad unbeareable migraines. They can sometimes cause headaches as a side effect, but I personally have not had that problem. Overall, I give these a 5/5 review for pain relief.

After a while the itching quit. Made me somewhat goofy and I didn't like the feeling. Coming off of it was really horrible. The sweating/cold, or hot wasn't good, wish I was told about the come down after taking it.

It has been very effective to me. I've heard that this drug is highly addictive, which is what I'm really worried about. Other than that, I'm very pleased with it. 
Pain	sudharris, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	4/16/2009 10:41:58 AM	In the past, I've been afraid of taking it (because of possible addiction) so waited too long after pain began. The relief was minimal. Finally, I began taking it when my back pain was uncomfortable but not severe and I found relief. About an hour after taking it, I can do house and yard work, whereas before hydrocodone was prescribed I was locked up in pain and could do nothing.  I still take it with great care and almost never take it twice a day as prescribed.  I'm not totally out of pain when I take it, but it is bearable now.

All took med as per instructions and with food.  One had vomiting the entire time, another had severe nausea and chose to try to get by with just ibuprofen, and one is currently taking it.. so far he has vomited once, but this is only his first day.  It works good if you can tolerate it.

I was immediately started on Oxycontin 40mgs and continued to take that medication for several years until some other people i knew that were taking it began to die from it so i quit taking it and asked my doctor to put me back on (Loratab or Vicodin) so i have been on loratab more commonly known as (norco) 10/325 these are 10 mg of hydrocodone and 325 mg of aspirin from what i have been told i am allowed to take up to 8 tablets in 24 hours how ever after years of taking this product i can hardly tell i take it now it is good for short term pain but not for chronic conditions in my book if it is pain you deal with daily and will continue to deal with see your doctor about a longer lasting medicine such as the oxycontin! Which is a fabulous medicine if taken correct good luck to all in pain!!!

He sleeps almost all the time and its beginning to have an affect on our marriage.  He also has rheumatoid arthritis (mild) and his creatine level has to be watched, so he won't take anything else.  He is surely addicted. He has too much pride to tell his drs., but something has to be done.

The first time I took it, I felt like I was high, and it just put me to sleep. I took another one about 8 hours later, and I have felt sick ever since. I have had a headache and nausea for about 16 hours! Awful. Wouldnt reccomend to anyone. I had Tylenol 3's after my 3 wisdom teeth were removed and they helped so much more, and I didnt feel sick.

Pain	backpain, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/9/2009 12:50:05 AM	I have been taking Vicodin daily for about 6 months for chronic lower back pain and inflammation. Obviously it does not help with the inflammation but it does take the edge off the pain enough to be able to carry around my 21 lb 6 month old son all day. I do not like the euphoric feeling it gave me in the beginning but that went away after several weeks of treatment. Sometimes I find it necessary to cut back my dose and deal with the pain a few days then resume my normal dose to deal with the tolerance issue. I am working hard to not have to take stronger narcotics.

I uually don't require more than this &amp; if I do I find the 2nd tablet not as effective.

I am going to need both knees replaced and am very concerned about pain control on the other side of the operations.  My doctor has insinuated I am abusing but I am only following his prescription.  If it doesn't work then we need something else not insulting comments about abusing when they don't have a handle on how on a remedial solution.  I've changed doctors but am concerned about being labelled a &quot;drug seeker&quot;.

My husband swears by it and says it's great...to each there own I suppose!
Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/27/2009 8:04:13 PM	This drug works well for pain.  But it causes constipation and (after taking for more than 3 days) insomnia and itching.  I have taken several times for different things and now have been taking for lower back pain (I pulled a muscles)and have also been prescribed Skelaxin which is a muscle relaxer.  Taken together they work very well.  Although I wouldn't drive, I don't feel too altered.  But I'm sure it must be addictive so I've got to be careful.

Although the drug worked wonders for the pain, it also worked too well for everything else. I took the drug for 1 year and became a major addict. I started going to other doctors and hospitals to get more. When my doctor found out I was doing this, he immediately took me off the drug and put me on a non-narcotic pain releiver. I'm glad he did this because I was heading somewhere I did not want to be.

This is a very painful recovery 3days a week hard therapy and all the rest of the days at home doing therapy so every day is therapy and I should be doing better after two months but my progress is going slow. any advice about this medication and the way I feel would be appreciated, thank you lcvegas44@yahoo.com

Once controlled, left with occasional GI  issues. Vic. 5/500 given for pancreatitis pain. Avoided taking for several weeks due to concerns with nausea when taken 9 years ago for shoulder surgery (threw them away). Finally started taking when in misery for 5 days....scripted for 1 every 6 hrs....took 7 in 4 days with amazing results. Have had a couple of bouts with the pain over 2 1/2 months. Works wonders for what ails me, and hopefully is disappearing with time. NO side effects that i can see....a bit quizzical that I am treating what are often listed as 'side effects' of this med -- but i cannot argue with the results. I am glad to have this for when I need it

I would not recomend takin this if u have depression or anxiety cause its very likely u will become addicted.i have never used drugs and yet i became addicted. it does not take away the pain it just makes u not care for the pain,it is not a cure. I know there are many people here who really dont have a choice due to there extreme pain and may god bless u and make u better. BUT TO THE REST OF YOU- it is not worth takin this for temporary pain , its so addictive and will make even the strongest of u addicted. its not because your weak its because its a drug and thats what drugs do. i wish to god i have never ever taken this medicine. MY LIFE HAS BEEN A LIVING HELL TRYIN TO GET OFF THESE. IF I COULD JUST HELP ONE OF U OUT THERE THEN I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY AT THAT. GOD BLESS U ALL

I only take it as needed for when I can't handle the pain. One downside is it takes a couple of hours to work. It's best to take it as soon as the pain gets really bad.

The best med to take, that hasn't changed in decades, has been a codeine based cough med. Vicodin is one Carbon molecule less than Codeine. Now I don't understand why this slight difference in molecular structure would have such a profound effect on it's efficacy, but it does. If you ever have a choice in your cough suppresant med, please ensure that it is codeine based and not vicodine based. It will have a greater tendency to put you to sleep, but that should not be a negative as that is usually the reason for taking it in the first place. To get some sleep.
Pain	Mark92677, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/28/2008 9:21:02 PM	I have an L5, C2 &amp; C4 disc bulges. I receive a cortocoid steriod injection every 6 months along with a script of Norco 10mg(Vidodin with no Tylenol) and physical therapy. No one treatment by itself would work for me. Norco prevents liver damage from the prolonged use of Tylenol. The Norco was fairly strong at first and did make me drowsy, but over time it's strength lessens, but it works just fine. It does not cloud my mind, it allows me to concentrate and function as an electrical engineer, so long as I don't increase the dose. If I don't eat when I take it, it does make me a little nauseous, so I eat shortly after taking it. Taking this med is a balancing act as you do build up a tolerance, but so long as you do not increase your dose over time, you should be fine in terms of addiction. So taking more for a momentary increase of pain is OK, just so long as the increase is not sustained. Sometimes it's necessary to get ahead of the pain. When you return to the original dossaging be prepared for a lessened effect. This is the trade-off for taking an opiod based med. For me this is a miracle drug as it allows me to function. It has given me back my life. It doesn't have the totally euphoric effect of say codeine or fentinyl, but it doesn't have the disorienting sleepy effect either. For moderate to severe chronic pain, Norco has been a life and career saver for me. Just strong enough to be effective, but not too strong to prevent me from functioning.

My doc prescribed Vicodin and it works quite well for me!As long as I take it with a little snack, I don't get much stomach upset.I do feel fatigued quite a bit, but I think that has more to do with the Fibro than with the Vidocin.I just wish that Vicodin came in a time-release capsule that would last for 12 hrs. My biggest frustration is that I cannot take it constantly to keep the pain completely under control. My doc only allows one pill per day, so I have to save it to take when I'm wanting to go out for the evening, or to do household chores.If I could take it more often, or if it was time-released, my life would be pain free.One note: I do often feel nauseous when the Vicodin is wearing off, even when I have a snack, but the sick feeling usually goes away after 10 or 15 minutes.

I would not call it severe pain, and it only bothered me if I was on my feet too much. So I didn't take it every day. When my scrip ran out, my regular DR. did not renew it. I started noticing a depression coming on. That was six months ago and I now I'm having anxiety attacks. Has anyone else experienced this? I know the Vicodin made me feel good, but I didn't even take it every day!

Pain	Ash, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	12/5/2008 11:09:40 PM	Being a narcotic pain reliever, I found myself taking more than recommended at some points, and could not manage without due to the recurrence of pain. I had to wean myself off on more than one occasion, and revisit it once my pain was unbearable. I've been prescribed Vicodin on-and-off since age 15, and it has been effective for chronic back pain. Being a narcotic though, I think it is more advisable for use for short-term and acute conditions. Tolerance develops quickly with a reduction in efficacy (within a week of regular use for me). It also caused me significant cognitive dulling (could not take an entire tablet at work).

Pain	Betsy Bootstrap, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	12/5/2008 12:01:43 PM	After a car accident in 1989, I took various types of hydrocodone for approximately 4 years until I had surgery. At the height of severe pain, I was taking 300 a month of the 7.5 dosage. After surgery I weaned myself off over a 3 week period, finally going through sweats, diarrhea, and nausea. Very effective for back pain and worth the side effects. About a year ago I began experiencing back and leg pain again &amp; currently under the care of a pain management center taking between 2 &amp; 4 Vicodin (10/325) a day, along with Skelaxin for muscle relaxant and Mobic for anti inflammatory. After multiple nerve root blocks, trigger point injections, heat therapy, chiropractic and massage therapy I am still in fairly severe pain daily. I have tried Gabopentin, Lyrica, different muscle relaxors and pain meds. I convinced my Dr. it was smarter to go with the 10/325 Vicodin even if I had to break in half because of the lower dosage of acetiminophen. The 7.5 version has 750 mg of acetaminophen, while the 10mg has only 325mg so, much better for the liver. My biggest complaint is that dr's are so worried about getting hooked they skimp on pain meds, leaving so many patients in constant pain, vastly decreasing quality of life. They (Dr.s) also blithely prescribe things like Lyrica and Gabopentin with little regard for the side effects or cost. I finally had a long conversation with my doc and emphatically stated i would rather take my chances on Vicodin which has been around a long time, is relatively cheap and WORKS - at least it works for me. I refused to continue to be a guinea pig for every new drug hawked by the well dressed pharmaceutical reps who troll in and out of dr offices, taking up time slots while sick people suffer in the waiting room.

I'm currently on it for an ear infection and shoulder pain. It works well, but it can take a little while to kick in, and I can only take it while sleeping since it makes me really nauseous and dizzy. But I react that way to all narcotics.

Pain relief lingers on the next day without taking more to some degree.  A couple shots of scotch with vicodin increases pain relief.  Euphoric feeling when taking it but causes sporatic itchy feeling on abdomen and limbs every few moments.

Began having depression after 2 months of taking this, decided to ween down, went from 15 to 20 mg per day to 5 mg per day for one week, began having diarreah, flu like symptoms awful headaches, as much pain as had before taking if not more in more areas of the body, vomiting, sweats, chills, then anxiety.  Began having panic attacks and fear of being alone, had to end up on anti-anxiety and antidepressant medication took almost 3 months to overcome withdrawal effects which caused depression and anxiety!  Awful, take it for a short period of time only if you need it, don't take for long periods, will have BAD withdrawals!  I can't believe this medication is even available to people unless you are terminally ill.

I take it as a result of a re-rupture of a disc, and now degenerative disc disease.  It seems that the past few months now, I get very,very nauseous when taking.  This only happend once before I had my surgery and was in very severe pain and taking larger amounts of it- but lately- I only need one to get nauseous.  It kills the pain, but the side effect (now) are really the pits!!!

Now 3 yrs later on 10/660 4-5 a day. Have a small rupture in upper spine and virtually every disc in back is herniated. I also (from fall) have spondylosis and spondylothesis in 3 vertabrae and 2 discs between are dead. Surgery is not an option I am willing to go through yet. I am only 48 and already on SS dis permanently.I also have DD disease and was able to work for years w/ just occasional codeine. AThis med gave me my life back. I could not function w/out its relief. Sadly though you do gat tolerant to that and have to keep increasing doseage.My Md has said next step is morphine or oxycontin,both options make me very nervous. Already have stress about having to go through getting off these meds as changes in treatments are updated. Although I do know I will be on some sort of pain mngmnt. for life if I am to continue living on my own and caring for my pets, home and self. Thank goodness I am also fortunate to have a doc that will treat for pain. All the addicts have made it very difficult for those of us, who have lifelong pain to live and deal with.Good Luck to everyone.

Pain	angie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/28/2008 11:31:47 AM	I have DDD,osteoarthritis, and osteoporosis. I can say this the best drug that takes away my pain even for a couple of hours.  I take 10/325 4x daily but this is not totally releiving my pain, but it does help better than nothing.  The only thing I need to have it increased to 2 tabs 4x daily but I don't think my doctor will do that.  Percocet is like taking candy for me which it means it does work for me.  We need to form together to let the doctors know that we know what we need to make it throught the day and not to be labeled as drug addicts.  We just want to live our lives comfortably.  Thanks

I have mechanical low back pain due to degenerative disk disease. Although I am still very limited in what I can do, without Vicodin, I would be unable to go out, swim, sit all day at my desk, and have some kind of life. I never feel high on it, just my normal pre-pain self; it also allays periodic mild depression and helps with occasional migraines. After about 6 years of 3,000 mg./day, i do not feel i need a higher dose. Yes it is constipating but that is easy to deal with. I try not to take it at bedtime as it is stimulating like coffee so if i have too much pain at bedtime i instead take a sleeping pill (Ambien). In sum, I could not manage without surgery without Vicodin.

One has became infected and my gums are swollen pretty badly... For the most part this medicine helps me... I am pretty &quot;groggy&quot; when I take it so I don't like to be at work while taking it.When I take it, I seem to wake up about every 3 hours... Which could be partly from the pain as well... Half the time I get out of bed though, I have a pretty bad headache. So, I have been taking my medicine with ibuprofen...Other than that, no complaints...

The pain starts in my neck, and hurts the most in my middle back where the disc is, and the bottom muscles are strained. My shoulder blades sting, especially if sitting.I've been on Hydrocodone about a year now, and the last time my doctor prescribed was right before I went into the hospital for a hysterectomy. For the first time, my doctor prescribed me a 30 day prescription for Hydrocodone, so I divided it into 3 bottles, so when I filled my strips, I wouldn't have to count them. About 2.5 weeks after my operation, I noticed the 3rd bottle of Hydrocodone was gone! I looked everywhere. I had just had a party for my husbands birthday, and his teenage son and girlfriend were there. The Hydrocodone couldn't have just walked out, but we had no proof that he had taken them, except that he had problems with drugs in school (pot). I know what everyone's thinking-I took them (except my husband). But I didn't take them, or i would have been sleeping all the time. I was truly pissed, and now, in pain! I went back to my doctory, and they took me off the Hydrocodone and Flexiril, and put me on Soma (samples). It's not working, I'm taking it with aspirin, my back is flaming, and I'm really pissed now. The doctor said he prescribed Hydrocone, it was my job to watch them. He's right, however, I did try by dividing them up to keep track of them. Of course we are locking everything up now, but meanwhile, I'm screwed. They gave me oxycodone during my surgery, so I didn't take the Hydrocodone. My doctor is 37 miles away, near where I used to work. I'm spending $10 in gas to see him, and I didn't get to see him, they had me see someone else. On the phone last night, he said I might be on some &quot;kind of list&quot; the doctors are using. This seems grossly unfair. If they don't want to give me narcotics - fine, but don't give me samples and blow me off when I say it's not working. Is there anything I can do? Thanks

I only take 1 1/2 and then another 1/2 later but you can tell it is causing &quot;more pain&quot; when your system knows its the time you regularly take the medication.

Does not relieve as long as stated and I started building higher tolerances to prescribed doses resulting in steadily increasing strengths. Does work especially well for the first two hours but fades quickly. No major adverse side effects except constipation and hard stools. Going to talk to doctor next visit to see other pain options because of short duration of pain relief.

I tried everything percocet, arthritis medication, tranquilizers, low doses of depression meds which is popular with my condition, nothing works except my 750 mg Vicodin ES's...They are a HUGE help to me my condition is sometimes paralyzing to the point where I was in a wheelchair when I was 16 for months and had to get homeschooled...I wouldn't be able to live normally without it. I get severe hip knee ankle back shoulder down to my fingertips pain started in my hips and worked it's way up my body slowly. I highly recommend it as long as you stick to your amount your doc prescribes otherwise you can end up addicted to it. If you have severe pain, give it a try. Also take it on an empty stomach then eat I have no nausea and it works better that way!

Am able to function and live life. When taken on a schedule keeps pain away or managed. Very rare break thru pain. You do not want to wait for the pain to remind you to take something, it does take awhile to kick in. Have had no problems with needing to up my dosage. Some constipation occassionally, but thats my fault, I know to eat right and drink plenty of fluids. Hydro's are a God send, thankfully my Dr understands this. I would consume way to many OTC's and have minimal relief if any and cause more harm than good. Am I addicted? I'm sure I am in some capacity, but follow prescribing orders, don't take it upon yourself to change anything and you should be fine.

If not careful it can make your stomach real upset so I would suggest eating a hefty meal before taking it. Other than that, use as the doctor prescribed and sit down, allowing it to control your pain for you. Also, if you are still feeling pain while taking it, I would suggest contacting your doctor versus taking matters in your own hands. Taking matters into your own hands WILL cause you to have to make an emergency room trip!

Pain	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/25/2008 8:57:53 AM	I have been prescribed short courses of Vicodin for pain following dental procedures. I was in such agony that I could hardly wait for the pharmacist to fill the prescription. Thankfully she was quick, and the medicine worked effectively to relieve my pain. One time before a root canal I did need something stronger, so the on-call dentist prescribed Vicodin ES. Never any problems with cravings, dependence, or withdrawal.

Make sure you drink plenty of water with this medication and I notice when I eat before I take it, it doesn't work.
Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	7/14/2008 11:26:13 AM	I had 3 root canals in one month and also 4 seperate surguries on my right knee about 13 years ago. Became severely addicted to this medicine. I lost everything just to get it. (jobs, a brand new vehicle, friends and everything I've ever worked for.) BE CAREFUL. Now I have to take a drug called Suboxone just to keep the withdrawal and cravings at bay. There is not a single day that goes by that I don't want to take Vicodin. I was taking up to 21 750 ES's in one day. Now I'm on a drug that's used to treat heroin addicts. I never thaught I would become a junkie! BE CAREFUL, DO NOT INCREASE THE DOSE ON YOUR OWN.
Pain	jpulley, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/12/2008 9:38:50 AM	I have been on this for about 7 years, It is great for the pain, I couldn't make it through the days without it. I have Fibro, and other problems that cause pain. The only thing is after you take it for awhile it does lose its effectiveness, and they have to raise the dose. Started with the 5/500 took for a few years, now taking 3 10/650 a day. Have been on them for about a year now, they are still working. I have had no serious side effects. Some people say they make them tired. They did me at first, but haven't in a long time.

Anyway, this has been a Godsend.  I am almost completely free of pain with this.  I can work out, cook dinner, spend time with my family, and I feel like a real human again!  it's been a real blessing to me.

For chronic pain this is not for you very addictive try useing a non-narcotic such as ultram this drug works very closely to the same as vicodin and is not considered a narcotic

Just went through 3 months of taking 3 to 4 pills a day.  Then you wake up one morning and the pain is gone as fast as it came.  I don't seem to have any withdrawal symptoms.  I do notice that Vicodin sometimes gives me a headache.  That is the only real side effect that I have felt but hey, you just take a headache pill.  I don't know what I would do without it.  It works great for me.

I am inoperable and taking this medication does provide some level of relief most of the time.  However, their are msny times when I get no relief whatsoever due to the severity of the pain.  I have been hit by 2 cars, a truck, fell off the side of my church trying to repair a pipe.  I have also been stabbed twice and actually shot by &quot;friendly-fire&quot;  during my 25 years as a police officer.   I have broken my left wrist 4 times, my right wrist twice and have broken several ribs over my career.  I also have Crohn's, IBD, IBS, Hiatal hernia, duodenal polyps and their is strong evidence that I have suffered at least 2 mini-strokes.   I also have 5 cardiac stents.  There are other health issues but these hit the &quot;highlights&quot;.  I'm only 54..there were 6 kids in my family.  They're all gone except myself and a younger brother.  None of my siblings made it past 54 years....very scary time for me.
Pain	TNBowens, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/16/2008 4:23:17 AM	I have endometriosis, along w/mastoiditis (infection of the bone &amp; air pockets behind the ear) Vicodin ES (2 tabs 3 times daily) along with 800mg ibuprofen 3 times daily really keeps me functional. I've had a hysterectomty &amp; still have SEVERE, crippling pelvic pain on a daily basis.  I've taken Vicodin &amp; Vicodin ES since I was about 19 (now 28) and have had no problems outside of occasional constipation.  It's the only thing short of IV meds that can control the pain that I'm suffering.  I've never taken more than prescribed, and I have had long periods of time that I was not taking it, with now withdrawal symptoms to speak of.  I just recently had to double the dosage I would normally take because of the mastoiditis, but once that has been taken care of (I have surgery on it in a few wks) I'll be moved back to taking 1 tab 3 times daily.  I see a pain mgmt specialist to get my scripts due to the unwillingness of most GP's to prescribe narcotics for longer than a few mos continuously. I would not be able to get outta bed w/out it. At times the pain does get uncontrollable, but I've also obtained a pain mgmt letter to present to the ER &amp; they will give me 10mg of morphine, &amp; 50mg of torodal to bring it back to a level that the Vicodin will handle if necessary. At times it does make me sleepy, but most of the time I feel like I haven't taken anything at all. I used to not drive all day if I'd taken it, but now I don't drive within 3-4 hrs of taking it &amp; I'm fine. This is a miracle for me, and I hope that this review helps someone else!  It can be addictive, but taken properly you will just develop a tolerance to it and may have to increase the dosage from time to time such as I did. It also works better at the 1st sign of pain rather than waiting til it's severe.  I typically take 2 before I get out of bed in the am, and then again about 30 mins before lunch (I eat late) and the last dose before going to bed. It's saved me from having to have a morphine pump!

I have been on Lortab for almost 5 years and it is really losing its effectiveness.  I have permanent damage to my spinal cord due to impinging prior to surgeries.  The Lortab worked very well at first, but isn't for very long term use.  I take two tabs 4 times a day and still in severe pain.  I need something more long lasting.  This medication is good for short term relief.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	5/2/2008 9:09:17 PM	I can't compare it to things like Percocet or OxyCodone, but I'm happy with it and I've been on it numerous times in my life.  I'm currently on it for chronic headaches and my ulcer doesn't allow for OTC pain meds.  Just make sure you take it with food, that's the most annoying part.  It easily causes nausea otherwise.  I read the comment just previous to mine saying she had issues with withdrawal symptoms.  I've never experienced that.  I wonder if it had to do with the amount she took and/or the length of time on it. This is an addictive drug.  I ONLY take it when absolutely necessary to avoid that and have never had a problem with addiction.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	5/2/2008 10:54:55 AM	Was taking for pain and ran out. like others the doctor he wouldnt refill the prescription. The side effects of coming off cold turkey are terrible. Muscle spasms, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, depression, lack of energy and overall bad attitude. So if you are taking these meds, be careful...I have had 2 virtually sleeplessness nights and struggling very much to find the energy to go to school or work full time. The most annoying side effect has to be the muscle spasms.  It seems be more noticable in my mouth and while trying to talk...which is rather embarrassing and humiliating. I don't know if the effectiveness are worth the side effects. be careful and try others before this drug. I feel like crap and won't take them again because the side effects after stoppage. 
Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	4/27/2008 1:52:30 AM	I took this for chronic back pain.  At first, it was helpful and then it stopped working so they increased it to 2 tabs.  I was taking 2 tabs every 4 hrs just to take the edge off the pain.  I found out that this is how this med works.  You will continue to need more and more of it to relieve the pain.

I have been taking Vicodin 5-500 for the past 5 months thru my pain management clinic as well as Norflex for spasms. I was taking 4 doses/day of the 5-500 and 2mo ago my Dr upped the dose to 7.5/750 Vicodin.  The change in strength has made a real improvement for my pain and took it from a steady 8 down to a 4.     I am very pleased with the results.

This drug works really well for me if I take 1 in the morning and 1 in the evenings. It keeps the pain at bay all day long. However it is extremely difficult to convince the doctors because they don't like prescribing narcotics. So I'm forced to take other pain relievers that don't work well at all.

Pain	texas woman, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/19/2008 9:19:27 AM	I have degenerative disc disease, arthritis, and bulging disc in the L4/L5 area.  I am not a candidate for surgery so I have to take something for the pain.  I'm only 40 and it's been difficult to accept I may have to live like this, but thankfully the pain meds work.  I'm allergic to sulfa and this does not cause any reactions.  Even after several steroid injections, I'm having to need the pain meds.  Just please be careful not to get hooked.  It's a struggle for me but can't work, cook, or housework without something to help the pain.  As a single mother, I do the best I can.  Please take in moderation and use only for what it's for. Use mind over matter and continue to live and not sit and focus on the pain/medication.  I think that's how people get addicted.  Hopelessness is overpowering so don't let it take over your life.  Living with pain can be managed with this medication and I'm thankful to have something that helps.  Always eat something with it to avoid stomach issues.

Pain	Mark, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	25-34	3/28/2008 4:16:43 AM	I've been prescribed Vicodin for pain several times, both for gallstones and kidney stones, and once after oral surgery.  To be completely honest, I find it terribly ineffective as a painkiller. It's primary effect is that it induces sleep, which, if I need to remain awake, just means that I am fuzzy-headed and in pain.   Of course, if you're exhausted from the pain, sleep can be a godsend.. but if you have to be awake, it's not that good a product.
Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/27/2008 5:36:51 PM	Do not take this medication.

If I continue to use, I have the most horrifying nightmares. My mother has had the experience. My daughter is smart and just doesn't use it at all. The relief from the medication is not worth the nightmares. I prefer tylenol w/codiene if the pain is that bad.

Pain	Jess, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/22/2008 4:15:33 PM	I have been having severe back pain for a little longer than one year. I was on 5/500 vicodin for a few months it helped at first then stared to gradually decrease in effectiveness. So I asked my doc to up the dosage and he took me off completely. He told me that it is all in my head. I wish doctors would not automatically assume you're addicted if you take narcotics longer than a month. Unfortunetly, sometimes they are physically needed. Then he put me on this stuff called Neurontin. That makes me feel so loopy that I cannot function at work or take care of my 5 year old daughter. Now what I don't understand is how the doctors think they know my body better than I do!!! It is because of all the people that abuse these meds. Please be careful with this stuff we all know what can happen if we aren't. Thanks for listening.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/20/2008 1:15:27 AM	In the past couple of years I have been on and off of vicodin for several different causes (dental work, auto accident, miscarriage) the first time that the medication was prescribed to me I did find that it was very addicting and had a really hard time after the prescription ran out. I have now been diagnosed with RA and Lupus and have found that I am allergic to every pain killer under the sun. It may be a mental thing, but I have found that I do not have a reaction to Vicodin and it's the ONLY medication that I have tried that truly helps with the pain. I now have a long term prescription and find that for some reason I have not had the addictive side effects that I had the first time, I can even limit myself to only take the medication on the days that I am in severe pain and easily refuse to take it if I only have minor, manageable pain :) I do honestly suggest that if ANY other pain medications are effective for you, stay away from Vicodin, but if Vicodin is the miracle for you that it has been for me just remember &quot;mind over matter&quot;. Just be aware that either the medication or relief from pain CAN be very addictive.

Diagnosed after with Spondthelosis Stenosis.Disease of the bones which I didn`t know until I got hurt at work lifting patients,have herniated disks,had 4 surgeries,staph infection in blood.Cleared up now but could come back,I guess i`m in remission.This med does help the pain and you could also get addicted to it,my doctor does urine tests and counts my pills to make sure i`m taking them correctly.If I were`nt allergic to the other pain meds i would switch to another med so i don`t get addicted.I know others that had taken the med Hydrocodone,then started taking other recreational drugs,which is not good.They will even crush the vicodin and take it through the nose.It takes 5 to 10 minutes for the pill to kick in taking it oral.Their ruining their nose and life.My opinion about that,they are stupid.Just be careful on any pain management drug...

Vicodin tablets about a week before the surgery. When I took them the pain dulled enough to be tolerable granted I was a little out of it but it worked well for me and was easy to take. The pills were large but I swallowed them fine. I was satisfied granted I took two at a time because the doctor told me to which made me  sit and stare into oblivion. They did not want me to move which I guess is why plus the pain was pretty unbearable.. my knee was stuck extended straight out because cartilage had torn in half and was wedged between bones. The medicine really helped me to cope with the pain till surgery. After surgery they gave me 1oo mg tablets of Vicodin and they were great to manage pain  while trying to walk again.

I was on methadone, and upward to 13 rx's, no life at all, thank God I didn't get addicted! This medication is helping me so much, I can walk again. My insurance company makes me pay a lot for it when I did run out though, on disability. I have taken it before without side effects, or addiction. Now I am wanting my Dr. to increase the dosage, as it does wear off quickly. I finally have a life again thanks to an old medication that still helps so many. Yes I am afraid of running out, as I am taking more than this little prescription of 5mg 3 times a day. When I take it the pain is gone in minutes, as well as the muscle spasms.

My Dr. prescribed this and it was such a relief to sleep! Finally! I was given a 30 day prescription, it is now January 30th. I did not use it all obviously, but I do suffer from migraines. I usually take Fioricet # 3 for them but I was out, so I used some of the leftover Vicodin and IT WORKED GREAT! Now I am wondering if anyone knows which is actually more effective, and if my doc would  now give me Vicodin instead if I asked? Just wondering, is one worse than the other? HEADACHES SUCK!

If Im quick to take 3/4 of a Vicodin ES before the headache gets a good hold, I can usually wipe it out. Taken with up to 600mg of Ibuprofen helps with muscle pain that accompanies the muscle spasms in my neck and back that come along with the pain of the headache.  What is nice about Vicodin is that you can break the pill and take smaller doses if needed. Nothing has worked as good for me for my headache pain.  I only have to take it when the headaches happen which keeps me off daily meds. Its a great mood lifter too when the pain gets really bad. Being a narcotic it can be addictive. Taking it irregularly and only when needed, keeps that from being a problem for me.  It has been a lifesaver for me and lets me carry on with my family and go to work when I would not be able to with the severe pain. I have no neg. side affects i.e., nausea, mental slowness etc...

I don't think so, I am addicted to being out of pain! My problem is I have a high tolerance to meds, and a very low tolerance to pain. It runs in my family. Most drs try to pigeon hole us. EX. My normal temp. is 96.8 I kid you not, another genetic thing, ever try telling THAT to a Dr. and getting them to listen, you practically have to grab their face and make them look you straight in the eyes. LOL. Good thing my doc. and I got past that:-) At this point I run out about 8 days before my next refill, so I am hoping my Dr. will consider giving me a full 30 day supply, of 2x4hr=6perday. It may sound like alot but I don't get side effects, my Dr.is very careful, and I understand her concern, but we all have different bodies and reactions to things IE: morphine makes me deathly ill etc. But the pain is too much, and as the write up on this site said if you wait till the pain is too bad then the medicine isn't as effective. Sometimes even with my maintained dosages I have days that I just have to give up, cause taking more just doesn't help. Fortunately there aren't too many of those days. Well except now, till I see my Dr. again and let her know &quot; Yes I do need 2 every 4 hrs.&quot; Hopefully she'll be MY Dr. and not get caught up in prying eyes of other dr's opinions. We'll see. Wish me well. Good health and pain free living to us all. Peace

I am in so much pain and my doc does not seem to care at the moment.... THIS DRUG IS VERY ADDICTING. I never ran out early before because I ook it like I was supost to because I had enough to treat my pain. the withdrawl symtoms are almost like a flu hot cold, reslessness. no energy and depression. It has been a few days sence I had any but before I ran out i went down to 5mg 3 times a day witch is about a 4th of what i was taking I was in pain but I didnt have as bad of withdrawls as I have heard some people of having but they are still pretty bad and to make things wrose I am in extream pain, so please becareful and if you need to higher your dosw TELL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY so you dont run out....... you will not be a happy camper. like me.

My dr. sent me to Pain Management when I was released from the hospital stay.  They called me in the middle of the month &amp; asked me to bring in my Vicoden to the office so they could count them!!!!!!  I take 2 500mg a day.  I could very well use 3X this. the fact sheet says to take before you start having pain. But for some reason my Drs. think I should only take enough to ease my pain some what.  Is this normal for them to treat me like I'm an addict when its only been 6 weeks since I broke 5 ribs?

Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/6/2008 12:45:05 PM	I have used this post surgical and off and on over the years for severe back pain.  It works quickly and effectively so long as you stay ahead of the pain.  It is the only thing I have found that is effective for my back pain.  I only take it for short periods of time.  Normally it is when I have had to do some heavy or strenuous work.  As soon as I feel the pain coming on I take it.  Normally just for a day or two and then I don't need it anymore.  I have done this for at least 5 years with no adverse side effects.

It makes me feel nauseous and itchy and I can't sleep well on it. It gives me weird dreams and it constipates me to boot. It does take away the pain and replaces it with slight nausea and also the inability to urinate fully..although I have the urge to go, very little trickles out. All in all it is better than the pain.

It's extremely effective in minimizing the pain; my only complaint is that it often makes it difficult for me to focus on work - but overall, it doesn't interfere with my life nearly as much as the pain does when I don't take it.

Since 2004 I have been taking hydrocodene(500mg) If I could get better pain medication I would...The fact that I am so tolerate to Hydrocodene because of taking it for so many years. There really is nothing besides hydrocodene  that takes away the pain I experience everyday of my life. But hydrocodene helps me take care of my daughter and pick her up and hold her and feed her cause she is a toddler...so she needs help....anyways if I could truly feel all the pain from just daily activites then I would be in to much pain to even enjoy my life. It has helped and probaly will help me the rest of my life.

Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	11/5/2007 4:47:52 PM	Vicodin is a great product for nerve pain.I have taken Vicodin ES for my back/leg pain for several years. I have not found it to be addictive when used as directed (2-4 times per day). I have taken it several times in the past and did not experience any problem discontinuing the drug when I no longer needed it.Vicodin does not eliminate the pain, but does make it tolerable enough that I can get out of bed and take care of daily necessities. I tried a stronger medication a few months ago to better control the pain, but did not like the diminished cognitive ability I experienced. I went back to Vicodin because it lasts longer than the stronger medication and I can still think clearly. I can still drive a car safely on Vicodin, whereas a stronger medication slowed my reaction time. I do experience some short term memory loss from the Vicodin, but it is not severe enough to discontinue the medication. The worst side effect is constipation, but that is handled by increased fluids, a healthy, high fiber diet and daily use of a stool softener.

I could not make it through a single day without it. The drug works very fast, but doesn't stay with you very long, maybe 3 hrs. @ best. It is very easy to build a tolerance and need more &amp; more. Causes extreme constipation so a laxative is very helpful. I feel &quot;human&quot; while taking the medicine...without I don't want to get out of bed.

I have had one bowel resection and so many flare-ups I've lost count.  I'm not sure if because of all the medications I've taken over the years has affected my tolerance, but I've found the only pain medication that remotely even works for me is Hydrocodone and my physician will not prescribe it for fear that I will become addicted.  Should I get a referral to a pain doctor.  I just got out of the hospital after a 2 weeks stay with the usual antiobotics, tests, and Remicaid.  I'm very frustrated with the pain I have everyday and there just doesn't seem to be any relief for me in site.  Any suggestions?

Remember that once the recommended amount stops working then you need to go to something else and leave it alone.  It's an opiate and is easy to get addicted to.

One of the nice things about it for me has been that it deals with the pain but doesn't make me sleepy at all like I've found many other medications do.  Sleepiness is just something I can't live with. I was resistive at first to the idea of taking a narcotic, but the side effects are minimal, and I feel more in control of how much or little I want to take.  There are times that I'm ok with a little suffering.  Many of the other things I've tried just make me loopy all of the time, and I can't stand it.  I wish there were another option that would just relieve the pain more effectively all of the time, but for now I am as satisfied as I can be taking the Vicodin as compared with the available options that I know of.

Even the simplest of things that we humans take for granted can be excruciatingly painful!  I couldn't even turn the page on a book.
