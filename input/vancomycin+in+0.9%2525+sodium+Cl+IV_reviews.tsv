Skin Infection due to Staphylococcus Epidermidis Bacteria	Tiger2sons, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/2/2009 3:24:05 PM	Appox. 6wks ago I had an freak accident. While working out in the yard I bent over and I was struck by a tree limb that pierced a hole in my tailbone. From that I got MRSA. I was placed on several different antibiotics and my symptoms persisted and worsen. Two weeks ago I was placed on Vancomycin in Normal Saline IV. My symptoms have improved, my wound is shrinking and the redness and infection under the skin is improving as well. This antibiotic has literally saved my butt! I have been in the hospital sufferring with this for the entire month and now Im at home with my family, still taking the Vanco with the assistance of our local home health services.
Bone Infection caused by Staphylococcus Aureus Bacteria	Hope, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	45-54	4/1/2009 3:15:51 AM	I have found that the drug causes pain to all the bones and joints throughout my body - just a deep aching that can't be readily alleviated, even with Oxydocone/acetaminophen.  Severe nausea that isn't alleviated by oral medication such as phenargen. Nobody but the pharmacist seems to believe me though.  It has been tough persuading anyone about my plight. 
Blood Infection caused by Staphylococcus Bacteria	labluver, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	2/17/2009 11:30:51 PM	This medicine was very effective for treating my staph infection.  i did have some reactions.  the first round it was infused in 1 hour and i became very itchy and i got the &quot;red mans syndrome&quot; my doctor changed the infustion rate to 2 hours and it worked much better.  i was on the medicine for 6 weeks.  i experienced some insomnia, dry mouth and still tired all the time.  i think the tiredness was due to more from the infection.  but overall i was very happy with the medicine

I had MRSA and so far this treatment is working for me. It pretty easy to use, only thing is taking it every 12 hours can throw off your schedule because mine is adminsiterd by my wife and home &amp; family life had to be adjusted around this treatment plan. But all in all it work fine.
