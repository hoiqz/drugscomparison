Chronic Pain	glw57air, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	8/6/2012 1:36:44 AM	I have been taking Oramorph 100mg for the past 17 years because of severe back pain due to 3 failed back surgeries.  The last back surgery I had 4 screws and 2 plates placed in my lower back along with a spinal fusion.  A pain management Dr. I saw 8 years ago added Neurontin to help with my back pain.  Taking both of these meds for my back pain has helped alot.

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	8/22/2011 4:00:42 PM	I have had a cervical fusion @ C-5,C-6,Bone for this procedure wa obtained from left hip. Also had cardio thoracic surgery (TOS) with rib removal down rt. armpit.This caused severe neuropathy.I am being monitored by a pain management Dr.For my symptoms. He prescribes MS Contin(Morphine) controlled release tabs,100 mg ,one tab ea.12 hours and 15 mg.IR tabs for break -thru pain up to 6 p/day as needed.I have been taking Opiates for 8 years now and as long as these are taken exactly as prescribed they work quite well for long term chronic pain.I started out with Hydrocodone and through the years my symptoms presented such that I required a stronger mechanism to control the pain.I would stress that many other things were tried without relief such as physical therapy,trigger point injections and nerve blocks. I also learned that that it is not only dangerous and one becomes very sick if you take more than prescribed and run out of medication too soon. Also, never crush or chew these medications,swallow whole and most people can tolerate well. My worry is how to detox from these meds. without sickness or worse.What I do know is that it is not safe to try without a professional Dr. Also too many young or people that really do not require these types of medications are driving the cost so high that many people who really do require these medications cannot afford them.

Chronic Pain	vkaye38, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/3/2009 7:08:41 PM	I have been takeing this drug for almost 2 years along with MSIR for break through pain, Lyrica,and Zanaflex,for DDD,Spinal Stenosis,Bulgding and Herniated disc in Lumbar part of my spine, and Fibromyalgia,and still live with some sort of pain rather it be in my lower back, hip, legs, or neck. Is there anyone that takes this mixture of meds? Sometimes I think its alot to take, but I still hurt to the touch all over my limbs and back,also have knots in my back that are tender and hurt to the touch,I know that if it were'nt for these meds I would never get out of bed, but would like to know if there is something else out there that could bring my pain level down to where its not always on my mind. ((Would like to get the amount of meds I'm takeing down to as little as possible)) I do have a life with 3 kids and a husband that I would love to be active with more then what my pain level allows me to be now.

Severe Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	3/6/2008 5:46:06 PM	Compared to Morphine Sulfate &quot;A.K.A.&quot; MS CONTIN,this drug does not work at all for myself or three other people that I know.In my opinion it is the cheap version that tight pharmacies are switching to as to save money at the patients cost.
