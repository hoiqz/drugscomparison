Its been working fine so far but the only bad side effect I have is that it turns my urine blue. Why is this?

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/19/2011 11:17:42 PM	I first used this medication to help me get through a bad UTI.  Then, after having a birth control implant removed and switching back to the pill, my bladder would spasm when I started my period.  Since I was having spasms only a couple of days a month, a long term treatment didn't make as much since for me.  UTA gives me the temporary relief I need quickly and without the irritating side effects of a long term bladder control treatment.

I have a 24hrs cardiac monitor due to palpitations.  It makes no sense since I have no adverse symptoms, I'm healthy and only 39. Then I looked up the possible side effects of UTA and irregular heart beat is listed.  Thinking back I remember more palpitations while I was clearing up a stubborn bladder infection and taking Uta prn. Woe is me though! I can't take Pyridium d/t headaches.
