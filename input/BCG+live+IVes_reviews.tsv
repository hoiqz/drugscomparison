It seems to be working as I have not had a recurrence yet of the high grade tumors that were removed on 2 TUR procedures. I have had some longer than usual side effects after the last treatment in first of September. It has worked for me up to now.
Cancer of the Bladder	life, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	8/30/2012 7:07:49 PM	In 2010, a full course of BCG was given to my husband. During the treatment he endured ongoing bleeding and burning. The bladder cancer has been in remission so far. But, one year later, he developed a chronic cough; at the same time, his right testicle became inflamed and enlarged.  Pathology showed that the testicle was infected by a side effect of BCG treatment called Dispersed BCG Infection  it was removed.  A  CT scan revealed damage and infection in both his lungs, also a result of the BCG treatment and the cause of his cough.   The doctor hopes to control the infection in his lungs with multiple antibiotics for at less 6 to 18 months, but indicates it may not be curable. All this led us to believe chemical weapons of mass destruction would be another way to describe the powerful drugs like BCG and many other chemotherapies.  We know they are destructive; we just do not have choices in many cases on this journey called life.I wish you all the best luck.

Treatments are still very difficult and leave me whiped out for several days.  Difficult but effective.

Cancer of the Bladder	Molson, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Male	65-74	3/7/2010 8:01:36 PM	I found this treatment to be extremely uncomfortable and I am very nervous prior to having this treatment at the doctors office. After trying to hold the BCG inside my bladder for around 2 hours, I begin to have extreme urges to urinate constantly. When I do urinate   it is very painful with lots of blood and dead skin. The first night after the treatment is a nightmare with getting up every 20 to 30 mins to pee, constantly all night long. So much for a good nights sleep!!!!! The treatments have been very helpful but I wonder of they are in fact really necessary!

After each surgery I received BCG treatments for six weeks. After each treatment period the tumors had returned and more numerous than before. The doctor is going to switch to Mitamicin and see if that drug does any better.
Cancer of the Bladder	Blossom, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	10/30/2009 11:16:20 PM	BCG caused sever pain and burning of the urethra and bladder.  Doctor ceased treatment of BCG and I was unable to get any cancer treatment for six months it has been two years since the first installation and the pain in the urethra during a cystoscope is very intense.  Doctors have tried other treatments currently I an use Thiotepa and haven't had pain or burning during the treatment.  Mild reaction of nausea and being a little tired.
Cancer of the Bladder	RB, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	45-54	10/28/2009 5:06:13 PM	UPDATE: 6th treatment was hard to handle. Lots of blood and &quot;stuff&quot; I'm assuming was the bladder lining.  Next treatments will be once a week for 3 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year. Hopefully those won't be as difficult.  I'm still optimistic this is an effective treatment. 
Cancer of the Bladder	RB, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	45-54	9/25/2009 9:14:10 PM	Just had 4th initial treatment.  Doc has had me skip 2, so far, because of sensitivity and bleeding.  I've been bleeding again and having bladder spasms but no fever.  I have total confidence in my doctor and he told me this can be expected.  I'm told this is a very effective treatment and believe the symptoms from treatment to be better than the alternative.

I am currently on three weeks, every three month maintanence BCG. My cancer kept coming back. I have had two six week treatments (one six weeks treatment with interferon)that was the hardest one. I have had several three week treatments. I have been cancer free since July 2006. That was my last removal surgery of cancer. The maintanence BCG has kept my cancer from coming back. When I was diagnoised the BCG wasn't on the web as a treatment, but two years later when I needed some kind of treatment it was there. I didn't like some of the other options out there. For me this option has worked.
Cancer of the Bladder	gloria, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	55-64	2/24/2009 6:46:17 PM	My last treatment made me hurt in the bladder. I have not had this pain before. What should I do?
Cancer of the Bladder	Kirby1932, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male		9/29/2007 9:47:49 AM	The catheritization procedure. One of the six scheduled treatments had to be postponed for a week due to extreme sensitivity and pain in the urethra.  I find that taking pain medication prior to the installation of BCG, especially around the third or fourth week helps trmendously.
