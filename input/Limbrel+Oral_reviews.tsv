Other	Hank, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	65-74	9/20/2012 6:09:45 PM	A year ago I tried Limbrel for one month, one 500mg capsule with food. Did not seem to help my osteoarthritis in fingers &amp; jaw. I tried it again this year for a few days: two 500mg capsules without food, and experienced stomach pain, so I quit. Tried glucosamine this year also, which seemd to help my jaw, but not fingers. Still looking for a good comprehensive solution.

(when material from clothing was dragged over the elbow) I took limbrel for 10 days and the pain went away.  That same pain is recurring now but not by the same cause.   I will see my physician soon , albeit it is a different physician and see what she recommends.  The pain at this time is no where near the same intensity....although this pain is unique to this malady.

Other	DavidM, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	6/21/2012 8:20:21 AM	I started taking Limbrel and I have had very good results.  I played college sports and now that I am over 50 my joints have been bothering me more, especially stiffness in the morning and pain after working out.  I was told that Limbrel could take up to a month to start working, however I felt better after two weeks.  I am not as stiff in the morning and I have found that I am able to workout more and as a result I have lost ten pounds.  No bad side effects so far, but I was told that it could upset my stomach and cause gas.

I had very hot flushing in the face, low grade fever and violent chills, like coming down with the flu. The I had a very difficult time breathing, so much so that I feared I would pass out. It took away my appetite and the fatigue was unbearable.

Both have worked but I would develop significant side effects with them. My doctor recommended Limbrel 500 mg. He told me that the onset would be slower but after taking it for a few weeks most of his patients notice significant relief. It took about a month but the results have been amazing. This is a miracle medication.

I began violent diahrrea that lasted until approximately noon the following day.  It was as if I was prepping for a colonoscopy.  The entire day I was sluggish, queasy and basically just lethargic.  I will not be taking any more of this medication.  Have a sixty day supply minus one.

However, I experienced flu-like symptoms, joint and muscular pain (where it had not been previously) and generally felt ill.  Fortunately, it occurred to me that it might be the new medicine.  After discontinuing Limbrel for 5 days, I am feeling better but not back to pre-treatment health.
Other	CarolsCritters, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	12/28/2010 9:48:54 PM	****I'm the one who wrote on 12/22 &amp; said I'd post an update****After my post that night I started vomiting violently and was wondering if I was going to have to go to the hospital. I stopped taking Limbrel right away, and low and behold 7 days later I'm back to 100%! No nausea, no vomiting, no fever, no achy feeling. It took the full 7 days because I noticed a 10-15% improvement each day. This is really scary stuff now that I've pretty much proven I was being poisoned by this drug. I had also quit all my regular RX's + Zyflamend, but I've been adding those back in with no illness. But I will admit, my deep arthritis pain has returned in every joint &amp; spine, so I guess the Limbrel was doing a good job. However, no pain relief is worth feeling as bad as I did for so long. I realize that each persons body, diet &amp; metabolism is different but for me it was a HORRIBLE experience after 3-4 months of build up in my body. I'm wondering if I should report this to FDA. I would certainly NOT recommend this drug due to my experience with it.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	12/22/2010 12:00:43 AM	I did a Google search for Limbrel reviews &amp; found these 58 WebMD reviews which have been a GODSEND! I've been on Limbrel for about 4 months, prescribed by my Pain Mgmt doc for severe OA of the entire spine, hips, hands and feet (at the ripe old age of 52). All was ok until about 3 wks ago when I suddenly became very sick, vomited 2x, extreme ongoing nausea, stomach pains that resembled my bout with Norwalk Virus and/or when I had an ulcer + on/off bouts w/intestinal issues. I've tried Tagamet, Tums, Pepcid AC &amp; Acidophilus daily but still have stomach pains + unlike the ulcer I've also been achy like the flu, running a low grade fever for the entire 3 wks, and can barely function during the day. When I got blood test results back from family doc my liver GGT count was way off + I was ANEMIC, so my doc corned me w/ possible alcoholism. On my end I kept thinking I had picked up something from the nursing home where I visit my father, but nurses said nothing similar was circulating. It's been VERY frustrating since I have 2 1/2 acres of rescued animals to care for daily and my husband has had to pick up the slack daily while I lay on the sofa + the animals keep coming up to me like something is wrong, checking to see if I'm OK since I'm normally very energetic and caring. I was pretty aggravated at Humana for not covering my Limbrel and I've been paying over $100 per month for this &quot;FDA approved drug&quot;, only now to discover that it might be the source for my feeling HORRIBLE for so many weeks! After reading all of tonights online research I do believe that I'm suffering from Limbrel toxidity. Heck I had started telling people I thought my husband might be poisoning me! I never did pin point Limbrel as being very helpful w/pain mgmt since I also take Tramadol (Ultram) &amp; Zyflamend (herbal anti-inflammatory). But after tonights reading I will certainly NOT take it tomorrow and see if I feel better! Thanks a MILLION to those who wrote reviews~ I'll try to post an update.

It has now happened 2x.  Last year while taking Limbrel I developed colitis.  All meds were stopped and after 3 months and colityis meds started having normal movements.  My doctor did not relate this to the Limbrel.  However after taking one dose the diahrrea reoccrred within 8 hours. I am out $100+.  Very annoying.  why is tis not listed as a possible unwanted effect.

It affects my entire body and destroys cartilage throughout and some organs are also involved.  I also have Rhuematoid Arthritis.  It took years to diagnose me but I found a wonderful rheumatologist who finally diagnosed me with this rare autoimmune. (after visiting Mayo four times and four other rheumatologists who could not figure it out)  I asked about this food medicine and he agreed to hold off on chemotherapy and let me see if the Limbrel would help.  He actually had samples of it in his office!  He also put me on 3000 mg of omega 3, 6 &amp; 9 daily.It has been almost two months and I feel different - much better.  I've even been sleeping better and I believe this is due to the decrease of inflammation throughout my body.  I can still feel the underlying RP and RA but all of my joints are a little better.  Pain not as excruciating and unbearable.For those of you who ended up in the emergency room and were told it was the Limbrel causing your symptoms, I believe were misinformed.  I have taken every kind of medicine out there and all that they did was cause other side effects.  The only side effect I have experienced with Limbrel is nausea, but I was nauseated before I started taking it, so is it the drug?This is one side effect I'm willing to chance vs the toxins of other drugs!!  I think it's unfair of those who insist that all of their misfortunes of health issues were caused from this wonderful drug!  I would bet that they had underlying diseases which were not being diagnosed.........just saying.....A HUNDRED THUMBS UP FOR FOOD MEDICINE!!!!

My doctors had tried to find medication i could take. But each one i either had the rare side effects or i was allergic to it. My pain level became severe and my mobility and daily routine was seriously decreased.Iwent to a new MD and was given a prescription for Limbrel 500-50 one cap twice a day. I was a skeptic. He explained to me that it was a flavanoid and  favan product. There should not be any side effects. And he had had good results with it from other patients. I love this man. First the first time in years my pain level is manageable. My joints have more quality of movement. My fingers are fantastic. No pain.No stiffness. Just Movement as they are suppose to no aching no pain. I recommend this for people who had painful joints. Fantastic medicine. I am also discouraged with MD's that dont take Lupus pain and fatigue as something serious. This pain had affected my whole life. My family, work, social. I feel very much better. I thank the my MD and the makers of Limbrel. Thank you

Almost all my OA symptoms disappeared.  A few months ago, I had to stop taking it for a few days due to surgery I was having.  After the surgery, I decided I didn't need it anymore.  I seemed to be feeling fine without it.  After a few weeks off Limbrel, I started having a lot of back pain that slowly worsened.  I decided to try the Limbrel again and within taking 3 capsuls, my back pain was almost completely gone and I felt like a new person.  I truly believe in Limbrel.

He prescribed Limbrel.  It is definitely a miracle drug and my pain went from a severe 10 to no pain within 48 hours.  The first day I took the medication my stomach was very upset, however, within 3 days the stomach pains decreased and by the fourth day, I felt perfect.  I have been taking Limbrel for a month, I have no stomach issues, no pain in my hands and I work in front of a computer, typing, an average of 12 to 14 hours a day.

After taking Limbrel for a few days, I developed a cough, runny nose, and nausea.  I thought it was a bad cold.  It went on for weeks.  After about a month on this drug and 3 trips to the doctor, I developed severe breathing problems.  I spent 1 week in the hospital and Dr.'s could find anything wrong.  I stopped the Limbrel and with the medrol I was given in the hospital, I started getting better.  I was getting better day by day for about 2 weeks.  I took 2 500 mg. Limbrel tablets in 1 day not knowing this was the problem and developed the same shortness of breath, severe cough, along with fever, chills, body aches, and headache.  Be aware of all the side effects that can be caused before taking this drug.  It causes hypersensitivity pneumonitis which is what has happened to me.  I consider this a very dangerous drug.

After a certain time using Limbrel I developed an unexplainable fever accompanied by chills,body aches,nausea,and fatigue. I had to be hospitalized for 4 days and received 3 units of blood for extreme anemia. The anemia could not be explained, neither could the blood in my stool. After an upper and lower GI work-up nothing significant could be found to explain the blood loss. People should be aware that Limbrel can cause all these side effects. I am 100% better after discontinuing the drug. The slight improvement I found to my osteoarthritis is not worth the terrible way Limbrel made me feel in general.
Other	Erik2136, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	1/10/2009 10:39:29 PM	This Medication has done wonders for my S-I joint which in turn has reduced some sciatic pain. Lots of insurance company's don't cover it yet because it still is an herbal/dietary supplement, but a one month supply at CVS is about $160, which unfortunately is very cheap for a brand name drug. There is no generic for this medication at this time. Sometimes insurance company's will pay if you appeal, your pharmacist will have all the information you'll need to try to appeal or get a pre-authorization, but the work will be worth it if you're able to get it. The med is not addictive which is an instant plus because doctors will not be as hesitant to write an Rx for it.

I have used the 500 mg tablets for 2 weeks and 250 mg for 1 week prior to that. I can't say I felt any improvement. Admittedly, I have IBS so maybe this drug was not a wise choice for my doctor to give me samples of.  The diarrhea started right away and soon became a daily occurance and finally quite severe. I have been off the drug for two days and am starting to feel some relief thanks to lots of Kaopectate.  Do not recommend to anyone with IBS.

Other		1	5	1			9/17/2008 2:56:42 PM	Dr. gave it to me to treat osteoarthritis because I have such a difficult time with the other medications.  I had good results for the first two days; then I started having severe joint pain all over.  On the 4th day I had uncontrollable diaahrea and ended up losing 10 pounds that day.  I lost two days of work and today I am back to work with severe bloating and pain in my stomach.  None of these are listed as side affects, but once I quit taking the medication the next day my symptoms started subsiding.

Other	 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		8/4/2008 10:29:41 PM	Works great with no side effects on my knee pain and frequent headaches.  Why hasn't something like this come along before...all natural and works!  Same effectiveness as Naproxen, that I have taken in the past, with the safety of a vitamin!  Plus does not give me the stomach problems of over the counter NSAIDS.  I highly recommend this product as a first choice pill.  Why bother with the others and potential problems.  Only drawback is potential cost, but if you can afford it and need it...ask your doctor for it.  It works!

Other	55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4		55-64	5/10/2008 6:43:39 AM	I have a torn miniscus and ACL w/ tons of arthritis in my right knee.  Tears from the miniscus were getting caught in the joint-line and causing my knee to lock up.  Have been taking one 250mg in the morning for the past three months and have seen remarkable improvement.Only possible side-effect has been diarrhea.  Not completely sure it's related to the Limbrel, but highly suspect it.

No side effects but has stopped the pain in my legs.  Must take on an empty stomache for full effects.  Please try it if you have OA, it is wonderful...and heathy because it's flavinoids!
Other		2	3	2			3/15/2008 11:59:40 AM	My Dr. wants to rule out arthitis before the possibility that i may have retorn what part of the meniscus i have left since my surgery in 05. I dont feel like the pain is any better..in dact the knee pain has worsened...after seeing the possible side affects as being knee pain, I wondr why this was given to me??

Other	chronic pain, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	9/30/2007 5:20:35 PM	After taking a sample from my doctor, within one hour, I felt improved relief in my joints and I also noticed less fatigue-where before I had to take late morning to afternoon naps from pain and fatigue...  Will the affectivness last?  I will compare results with that of Relafen, as soon as I can.
