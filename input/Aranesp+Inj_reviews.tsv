My doctor keeps me between 11 and 12 g/dl.  Currently I am taking 40 mcl (?)every 16 to 28 days injections. After my blood is drawn it is reviewed at the doctor's office and if it falls below, like 11.1, I receive a telephone call to come in for the shot.

I was good Friday, then on Saturday I woke up wit a massive migraine that I still have &amp; it's now Sunday. I've taking migraine meds &amp; nothing seems to work. I'm still very tired. I need to take this or since my iron is so low I would need a blood transfusion &amp; I'm not doing that! This shot was my only choice. Luckily, I only need it every 2 weeks.

I intend to discontinue injections.  Family physician says if I do not see improvement, discontine.  Very expensive snake oil.  Thank you.  R. Smith

It elevates my blood count and I feel so much better for several days. I have more energy.I wish that I could monitor my blood count in the same way that a diabetic is able to do at home.I don't think I would be able to keep working if I did not have the Aranesp because I get so tired without it.I do have some aching in my bones for a day or two after each dose, but it is minor compared to the problem of fatigue.

Anemia from Chemotherapy	destined, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	6/23/2009 8:35:07 PM	I actually just had my first shot a week ago and am supposed to have another in 2 weeks; however, I feel so doggone tired, I may look for something alternative and mention to my doctor I'd rather not take it again.  My hemoglobin has pretty much been a consistent issue even before chemo, so I'm thinking it's probably because of recent surgery &amp; radiation that it fell lower.  I keep praying that God will give me strength!  I wish the same for you all.

It worked first six months but in the last six to eight, it didn't have any effect on her Hgb count even tho they kept raising the doses. Shortly after a 500 dose she died within 3 days. Hard to say if the injection was the fault or not as Mom had other health problems also.

Anemia from Chemotherapy	kitkat25704@hotmail.com,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		1/18/2008 1:40:54 AM	I get the injections once a month as I have CML. I stayed tired, lack of energy, and my red cells aren't going up. When I was given 3 pints of blood, I felt great, energetic, didn't feel tired after doing a single task. I didn't need to sit and rest after just doing dishes. With the injections given to me at my oncologists office, I find I am more tired each day, no strength, totally drained. If busy on one day, the next I end up sleeping most of the day. I feel the injection isn't helping me, and the fact that I was anemic prior to being put on chemo pills for my leukemia, that I have Conjestive heart failure and retaining of fluids, that it's not treating the anemia or making the red cells increase. Mine stay below normal on a constant basis.
