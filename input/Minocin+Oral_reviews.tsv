Came off meth onto minocin 100 mg M-W-friday. Have had no further flares or side effects since the switch. Liver enzymes back to normal and no pain with joints.

Acne	lau, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	9/13/2010 9:49:09 AM	This medication made me so dizzy. I felt like I was spinning and was not able to function. Within 24 hours of stopping the medicine, my dizziness was gone. I only took it for 3 days, so I did not get any benefit from it.
Acne	MSW, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	9/5/2010 1:22:45 PM	My MD prescribed this for me in July for oral dermatitis. Within three days of taking it, I had a HUGE cyst on my chin. I stopped taking it after a week and eventually the cyst cleared up. (Very painful, though.) I went back to the MD, she said it was a coincidence and try it again. So I did, last Tuesday, but Thursday night I had two more big cysts (again on my chin). I stopped immediately, and one is clearing up, the other is still there and incredibly painful. Has anyone else had this experience? I thought Mino was supposed to clear acne, not cause it!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	decalgal, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/9/2010 1:01:48 PM	I was diagnosed with RA in 2006. For the past 4 years I have used alternating Minocycline and Doxycycline to treat this disease, using 100 mg per day of either one. My disease is in virtual remission. I am able to use generic Minocycline, but must use the Pfizer brand Vibramycin (the generic does not work at all, and created a disastrous recurrence of my RA, almost totally crippling me for several months, until I discovered that the manufacturer had changed their ingredients in the generic doxycycline I had been taking.) The only reason I do not take only minocycline is that I want to avoid the long term side effect of teeth and/or skin turning greyish. So I am now doing one month on minocycline, one month on Vibramycin. My RA symptoms have virtually totally disappeared...hands that were turning into lobster claws, weak wrists, painful ankles and shoulders, all have returned to normal. With these two drugs being so very non-toxic, as compared to the other drugs normally prescribed for this condition, I feel as tho I have been privileged to be using a miracle cure. (But I am NOT cured, as any change in the medications will bring a relatively swift recurrence in flares of this horrid crippling painful awful disease). I wholeheartedly encourage others with RA to try this treatment...it certainly works well for me!
Acne	Fleurette, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	13-18	12/14/2009 8:29:04 PM	the minocycline made my acne a lot better. not completely better, but mostly and that's fine by me.definitely beware of side effects, as some people experience them quite severely. I, thankfully, do not, so it works well for me. :)

Acne	sunluvr, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	19-24	5/22/2009 1:45:10 AM	I have been taking this medicine for about 4 months. I have pretty mild acne but it has seemed to clear up basically all of it. I tan indoors and outdoors and I have experience a couple cases of hives since starting it. I seem to be extremely light sensitive on this medication.
Acne	a_jbishop, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	25-34	5/12/2009 6:23:33 PM	Well,,, I loved the meds but it made me so so sick dizzy spinning nausea man I thought I was dying was in the er,doctors 4 times in 2 days....It really helped my acne but had to stop because the side effects just where not worth it and that means they where really bad!!!Some people can take different things and have no effect I wish that was the case for me with this pill but its not so off to the next thing...
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	3/19/2009 7:59:05 AM	I have taken mino for about 3 yrs.  I have severe acne at the age 36.  This seemed to be a great drug, until I started having a lot of pain about a year ago.  It got worse and worse affecting all my muscles and connective tissue and even joints.  My doctor thought I had Lupus.  I lived with crippling pain for a year not knowing it was the my acne treatment that was causing it all.  Be careful of this one.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	1/25/2009 9:50:43 PM	Yet another new treatment for acne that I've had since I was about 12. I'm now 24. This has worked the most quickly by far, although it does cause some dizziness. I am using it in combination with clindamycin topical gel.
Acne	wondering, 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	3	1		13-18	1/11/2009 8:54:46 PM	my son is 15 and it has not had any effect on his acne.  He is experiencing pain between his neck and both shoulders. Could be a virus but these symptoms are strange.

Acne	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/28/2008 3:51:09 PM	Minocin (Minocyclin) works well for uncomplicated mild-moderate acne. When my acne reappears I take the drug for a while and it clears up.

Acne	Jannellebelle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	10/5/2007 11:57:27 PM	I have been taking this medication for a week. The day I started, I had about 10 active cystic acne pimple surrounding my mouth, lower cheek area, and jaw line. Today, I have maybe one. I love this product, I have had acne vulgaris since I was in middle school, I am now 26. I have tried EVERYTHING!! Proactiv, over the counter, prescription. I was one the verge of going to an acupuncturist, lol! This is the fastest working product I have tried. The only downside is the nausea about 45 minutes after taking each pill. I definately recommend taking it with food (nothing too greasy or acidic), and plenty of water. And drinking alcohol while on it will make you very sick. Giving up alcohol for the treatment course is a small price to pay, in my opinion, for clear skin.
