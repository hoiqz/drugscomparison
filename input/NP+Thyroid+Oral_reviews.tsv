Underactive Thyroid	apelila, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	9/25/2012 1:48:19 PM	I have Hashi's and was on on Levoxyl for 1.5 years with &quot;normal&quot; blood tests but no relief of symptons.  Started NP Thyroid at 1 grain and increased 1/2 grain every 2 week until I was at 3 grains. Blood tests then showed my FT4/FT3 very low so I increased another 1/2 grain.  A week later I'm almost incapacitated again...I feel like I did prior to any hormone replacement.

Started losing weight and feeling much better. Now, I am finding that the consistency is a big problem. I don't know if it is consistency or shelf life, but the last presription that I recieved with an experation date for 2 years from now, seems to have NO effect at all even after having my dosage doubled.  After a year of success, it's like taking baby asprin now instead of thyroid meds. Did they reformulate???

Does anyone else have this problem?  I still feel tired, plus I have gained five pounds in 4 weeks since starting it.

I immediately started gaining weight! I have been on it for 2 months &amp; have gained about 6 lbs. Going back to my doctor to discuss this problem will probably have to go back to naturethroid. Anybody else having this problem on NP thyroid?

Underactive Thyroid	Melissa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/19/2012 8:58:11 PM	Suffered with hypo for 9 years on Levothyroxin.  TSH results were always &quot;normal&quot; but still had awful hypo symptoms for all of those years.  Asked Doc to change me to this... did my own research on it and found out how to properly increase dosage according to my symptoms.  It's been 3 months and there is a HUGE difference in how I feel physically and mentally.  Unfortunately, I have had to be my own doctor throughout this ordeal.  Endo's were no help at all!!!!
Underactive Thyroid	sag, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	55-64	3/19/2012 12:13:08 PM	I started taking NP Thyroid 90 3 weeks ago and have gained 5 lbs.  I thought I would lose some weight if my thyroid was normal.  I haven't felt any better either.  
Underactive Thyroid	pammy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	2/8/2012 2:01:41 AM	I have had a bad EKG and spent money for tests that if my doctor had known side effects should have stopped the drug.  I also have insomnia and so was given more drugs.

He started me on NP Thyroid.  Within a few days, brain fog was clearing and I was feeling so much better.  My skin started getting softer, I wasn't as tired or sad, facial hair (I am female and I was growing whiskers) was disappearing, my eyes were beginning to feel less dry.  After blood work to check T4 levels, my doctor increased my dosage to 90 mg/day.  I go back for more blood work in one month.  I haven't felt this good in many years.  This is definitely the right medicine for me.

I did have some relief of systems just with levo but thru internet research heard of armour wanted to try but not available anymore.. asked doc to switch and pharmacy filled with this instead...will follow up after blood work in couple of weeks
Underactive Thyroid	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/6/2011 2:10:08 PM	After being on Armour for nearly a year, I tried the NP Thyroid.  I am very pleased. It dissolves under your tongue well, and seems to be like what the &quot;old&quot; Armour has been described as.
