I have taken this medication for 3 days before and 2 weeks after the surguries and have had 0 problems, in fact it felt good, like a clean feeling. It is expensive, just a small drop is all you need.

Only problem is I forget to hold corner of eye after drop is put in and I end up with drainage down my throat.  My fault though.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	45-54	4/1/2010 8:46:05 PM	I had cataract surgery 6 months ago due to the treatment and disease of iritis. I had to have the lens behind the new lens removed because of severe cloudy vision. Now I find out that my retnia is also inflammed, the drops do seem to be helping a little. I put one drop in 3 times a day along with a steroid drop. I still have a week to go so we will see how much it helps or hurts. The price is outrageous for a 5ml bottle.

The last week my vision suddenly blurred. Alarmed, I went to my doctor for an emergency visit. Xibrom severely damaged the surface of my eye causing vision loss: I could barely see the large E at the top of the chart. According to my doctor, with time, the damage will heal and my vision will improve. As to how long and how well, he would not speculate. When I returned to his office a week later, there was small improvement: I could read (with some effort) the third line from the top. WebMD warns against prolonged use of this medication. I think that my doctor missed the boat on this one.

I have been using four drops a day between both eyes. It seems that the last drops a night burn like fire. I have not discussed this with the doctor yet.

Within the last three months after using Xibrom for treatment I have experianced severe shortness of breath.  I finally refered to my prescription information from my pharmacy, it listed difficlult breathing as a possible side effect.I was greatful to read comments from other patients listing this same problem.Thank you letting your users tell their stories.

I guess the Xibrom works because I haven't had any inflamation or pain.  It is hard to get only one drop at a time.  My Blue Cross doesn't cover it and 2.5 ml is over $100.  Isn't there something less expensive?

It seems that after using it, i become very short of breath.  My doctor said this is not one of the side effects but it just seems to keep happening.  Or, does it interact with other drugs I am taking.  Hypertension meds, Plavix, aspirin, isosorbide, carbidopa/ levidopa and lescol.
