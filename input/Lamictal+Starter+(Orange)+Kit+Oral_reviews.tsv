Bipolar Depression	Hopeful, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	4/28/2010 1:18:17 PM	I have been on Lamictal going on 4 weeks, I have noticed a positive difference. I am happy more than normal. I am really hoping and praying that this works because I am tired of switching meds and gaining more and more weight... I do have headaches everyday though, but so far its worth it. :)

Bipolar Depression	Sunshine, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	1/20/2010 10:45:32 PM	I am taking Lamictal 150 mg to treat depression. It took almost 4-6 weeks for me to feel the effects. That was such a relief. I was on Zoloft few years ago, and I loved it too. I was so worried when I read the sideeffects of Lamictal especially those related to the rash, so i used to check my whole body for rash everyday. I frove my brother and BF crazy:) after a while i stopped doing that, but today I had a very bad allergic reaction on my face, arms and hands, and when I called the doctor he informed me that there was an interaction between Lamictal and Tylanol. After two hours I was back to normal. The doctor advised me to wait 2-4 hours between both. Best of luck for everyone. I'm so glad I am feeling MUCH better than few months ago..

I now know and understand why and how people function through out the day. I was taking Seroquel and I was always tired and passing out. For once in years I am able to stay up for 16 hour days! It has helped with my moodswings and triggers. I am very satisfied.

I have a sore throat without any other cold symptoms that seems to be a side effect. During the 2nd week I noticed some dizziness and a slight disorientation but that has passed.  Overall I am hopeful that this may be a good drug for me.     
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	5/6/2009 9:31:12 AM	I was just diagnosed with mild bipolar. I was prescribed Zoloft by my PCP. Then my Phsyc. added Lamictal to that. I was on day 9 of the orange starter pack when when I noticed a rash on my arms. Didnt think too much of it. But by that night it had spread to my abdomen and legs. I stopped taking the medicine that night. But by the morning the rash was everywhere and got much worse in the areas that it had started (arms and legs). It is unfortunate. I was feeling better on this medicine. Now Im prescribed Abilify. Havent started it though.

A few months ago a new Dr. asked me to try Lamictal and it's been a slow process but the dose is finally right and I feel like a normal person.

I am doing great, have insurance and is still pricey but hey it keeps me able to function and work. I am so glad the doctor steered me into this medication. No one would ever tell I suffer from BP or mood swings of any kind. I do not take any thing else except for Busphar for my anxiety that I still occansional get.

I may not even have to add a mild antidepressant after all.This just may be the wonder drug! I go back to my Doc. in a couple of weeks for a reveiw on how it's working. I sure hope it continues. I've had enough of these constant ups &amp; downs.Only one downfall I must tell you is I've been having a bit of insomnia.Best of luck to all of you!

Unfortunately I had to discontinue the drug.

I don't think I had depression. I was constantly grumpy so my Dr. had me try Lactimal. This is my sixth day of 25 mg and I feel awesome. The only setback is I'm so wound up after bartending for 12 hours I can't go to sleep. I'm praying I don't get the rash my Dr. warned me about because I LOVE LACTIMAL. I 'll see how I do on higher dosages in a few weeks!

I haven't noticed any other symptoms except I did get  a head cold 2 weeks into it.  The worst problem is getting the pills out of their carboard container!!!!!  This is the first time I've been treated for being bipolar, every other time it was for regular depression and NONE of those meds worked for me over time.

Manic-Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/23/2008 12:26:12 PM	At the end of the orange kit and my racing thoughts have subsided so that I can think clearly. I have experienced insomnia and shortness of breath quite frequently. The agitation has also increased so DR is adding a new med to my list. I will stay on it a little longer to see if the combo of drugs will help the effectiveness. Just be careful about the rash. I did get a rash each time the dose was doubled. Both times happened about 2-4 days following the double dose. It was on both of my forearms and itched like crazy but went away in 2 hours. Pharmacist said that as long as it didn't hurt and no other side effects (fever, etc) then I was OK. Just be careful and always let a pharmacist or your doctor know if you get the rash no matter how small it may be.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/5/2008 12:06:14 PM	Lamictal has worked for me fairly well.  The first 2 months I took it by itself and it made my mood swing uncontrollable but always depressed.  I would begin to cry for no reason.  My doctor put me back on my Celexa 20mg and I've been fine for about 2 years.  I know it is working because every couple of months I decide to just stop taking all my meds!  Lamictal is not the best drug for someone like me because after 5 days without it you have to start all over with 25mg a day for two weeks, 50mg..... until you get back to your level.  My level is 300mg a day so it takes me 6-7 weeks to recover from my mistake.  I experience mania, which I really enjoy, for a few weeks.I have also found that Lamictal and Birth Control pills do not mix.  I only take the Birth Control to stop my periods.  I take active pills continuouly.  I do not know if they are working against pregnancy!!!
