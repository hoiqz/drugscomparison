Other	Rikyt, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	8/18/2012 10:21:41 PM	Used on my shoulders because of rotor cup torn so much it can not be repaired. In pain most of the time. I tried Solonpas patch at night and it has really helped me sleep. Don't leave on to long or on same spot because it will burn the skin,but I left it on for 15 hours. They say 8 maxium. COSTCO has the best price and it's in coupon book for this week.8-18-12

Other	tamside, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	6/5/2012 12:07:58 AM	I have chronic lymes disease and suffer from extreme joint/muscle and nerve pain. I have used many patches, but was lured to this one by the 12 hour claim. It is by far the most effective. 
Backache	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male	65-74	2/13/2012 3:04:48 PM	While the tapes were fairly simple to use, their effectiveness left me with very much to be desired!  I would not purchase this product again for my personal use but I might recommend it to someone in my family if they were not in too much pain!

No side-effects.Do not applyon the exact same spot too often or can irritateskin. I buy them at Costco and the price difference as opposed to the drug chain stores is a big deal. I highly recommend.

These patches work well, usually for at least two hours - sometimes for 8-10. (Just don't apply one on your skin after you've put Capsaicin cream earlier - too hot!)
