Cancer of the Prostate Gland	75 or over Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	1	1	Male		4/24/2012 12:08:53 PM	I was started on Zoladex without any information about it except that it was a shot. About six weeks after the shot the side effects started. My libedo went to zero,I gained weight all in my belly, I had hair loss, but the worst were the hot flashes. Four an hour was common but the absolute worst was that the hot flashes drasdictly affected my Parkinsons. Up to this point I showed few symptoms by taking medications. The symptoms can no longer be controlled with medication. My balance has gotten much worse and I have uncontrolled movement of my hands and very often with my legs. I was set to have the second shot three months after the first,but refused to take it. It is now ten months after the first shot and all of the side effects are as bad as they have been. I think zoladex should be taken off the market 
Endometriosis	Harriet, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/26/2011 4:20:59 PM	I had severe endometriosis and at age 28, underwent lap &amp; laser, then 3 months of Zoladex, then a second lap &amp; laser to get rid of any remaining endo.  Side effects were tough - total menopause at age 28!  However, the treatment worked like a charm and it was worth every minute. I followed a totally organic diet throughout and actually lost 10 lb while on this drug.  I then fell pregnant within 6 weeks of my second lap &amp; laser, and now have 2 beautiful kids and have not had any endo symptoms since.  That was 8 years ago.  I can't rate this drug (nor my first class OBGYN who did the surgeries) highly enough!
Breast Cancer	Dita Sea,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female		6/30/2011 8:14:44 AM	Taking Zoladex + Tamoxifen for breast cancer. So far, have had no relapses in my breast cancer, so I guess its working. Still, side effects are dire, the worst being severe hot flushes, insomnia, mood swings, depression (although only a couple of days a month), extreme fatigue, no sexual desire, and a terribly dry complexion (I seem to have aged five years in only 12 months). Still, I only have one more year to go, so I guess I just have to weather it through!
Breast Cancer	Mamabee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	2/16/2011 9:57:54 AM	Diagnosed with estrogen-positive Breast Cancer in 2003. Did no chemo nor radiotherapy. Changed Lifestyle and diet. Had a relapse in 2010 and first thing my new doctor asked was if I was still having kids. Replied in the negative so he said he needed to stop the periods. Had no objection to this and so he administered first dose of Zoladex. I found out i had also developed fibroids. Started treatment in March 2010. Have seen the change in my condition. First of all, fibroids have shrunk as they no longer press on my bladder. Haven't had any periods and I hope they don't come back. Have hot flushes but they do not last for more than 2 minutes and they are very bearable. Have so much energy, good appetite and sleep well. However I do hope I do not have to continue it for more than a year as every drug has its side effects.

Have had 4 shots so far. Only side effect would be no libido at all. Other than that nothing. Outcome of 0 PSA supersedes the single side effect.

Breast Cancer	angieno1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	10/6/2010 7:51:05 AM	my dr orginally was giving me the Lupron Depot for endometriosis which worked out great for me and after my insurance changed they would not cover it for breast cancer so I had to get the Zoladex and been suffering from fatique/headaches/pain. I would take the Lupron shot over Zoldex. Less irritation easier to handle but Lupron does not list breast cancer under diagnose. That is a shame 
Endometriosis	redrevng2006, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/15/2010 11:57:47 PM	I was on it for 6 months and it worked great. If you have Endometriosis and your doctor wants to put you on this I would recommend it. I have pain 3 weeks out of the month and for 6 months i had no pain at all. It is not the best felling when you are getting the shot in your stomach but i would do it again in a heart beat. Hope this helps anyone who is going to have this treatment.

Side effects for me are the almost unbearable hot flashes, weight gain, back pain and neuropathy in my hands and feet. I'm also diebetic but the burning and tingling has never been this bad.

Frontal Lobe Headaches, worse with bending over. Treatment was to thin the inner lining of the uterus, due to Fibroids and before Uterine Ablation Procedure.
Endometriosis	chellechelle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	11/25/2009 5:40:08 PM	It was so wonderful living pain free while on this injection, having no periods was a bonus too.  The only hassle was finding medical staff experienced in administering the injection and found going to the local hospital quite good.  Also asked for general anes. cos do not like needles, and this one is big!!  The hot flushes were a bit of a pain, but got used to them and prefered them to pain.
Advanced Form of Prostate Cancer	pandmswan, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	4	3	4	Female		10/16/2009 5:05:17 AM	has had one side effect...about 3 weeks after injection has bad mood swings and violent behavior. Dr's have no idea why this is. PSA level started out 6 months ago at 12+ now it's almost less than 1 bur we have these mood swings that are HORRIFIC....
Breast Cancer	juliesl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/10/2009 10:23:00 PM	I could not tolerate Tamoxifin after my cancer treatment, so I have been receiving the injection for 9 months. I find the injection to be painfull for the first several days and the bruising last for several weeks. The first several days I can experience nauseau, hot flashes, and fatigue. I have gained weight, but I could not figure out why so I was glad to see other comments on weight gain.  I have been diaganosed with high blood pressure, but I do not know if it is related to the shot. I cannot say to the effectiveness because I have to receive the injection for 3 to 5 years. I am crossing my fingers. 
Breast Cancer	BizzyBody, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	7/1/2009 12:34:22 PM	lower abdominal aches after injections for a few days than back to normal was on 1 implant for a while than had to increase to 2 implants to stop my menstrual cycle after about a year had to start back up on the implants because cycles started again now on 3 implants every month for the last 4 months don't know how long I'll be on it this time around. But, as long as it keeps my cancer from returning I'll take it as long as needed.

Breast Cancer	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	35-44	4/10/2009 2:01:16 PM	I started Zoladex five yrs ago when I was 37. I am now going to pursue a hysterectomy. The drug was effective at keeping the cancer from returning, but the side effects have really been horrible. Mood swings, depression, hot flashes, insomnia, my blood pressure and cholesterol went wacko, weight gain, vaginal dryness and alternating yeast and bacterial infections. My body does not like this drug, but really didn't have an alternative except hysterectomy.

All day and night, I have to change my clothes two or three times a day. I have had surgery and take other meds for this cancer.

Endometriosis	perkygirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	12/1/2008 10:00:18 AM	I was diagnosed with endometriosis 15 years ago. The pain has been manageable and it hadn't caused too many problems for me until I decided to have a baby. After my surgery, my doctor thought Zoladex might be my best chance of being able to conceive. I have just finished my 6th (and final) month of treatment. My doctor also put me on Effexor 75mg/day to help with the mood swings and hot flashes. That helped alot. I still had hot flashes but not nearly as bad as other people have described. Just as soon as my menstrual cycle returns, we are going to start trying to conceive. That will be the true test of how well it worked.
Endometriosis	kjsross06, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/18/2008 3:58:50 PM	I was diagnosed with endometrosis at the age of 17 and 8 years later, I'm still having trouble. I've had 3 laproscopic surgeries over the years and when the endo. returned, I just didn't want to do another one... so I decided to try the injections. Over the 6 months my mood swings were like nothing I'd ever experienced! I had all the symptoms of menopause- night sweats, decreased sexual desire, hot flashes!, etc. It has been about 9 months since the tx ended and I haven't had any pain. However, the 15 lbs I gained over 6 months is still attached to my butt! 
Endometriosis	19-24 Female 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/26/2008 4:08:27 AM	I have been on the Zoladex for a little over 2 months for treatment of my endometriosis. This is my last option before I have to have a hysterectomy. So far it has been working pretty well. The only side effect I have really had is hot flashes which do get very annoying at times. But I can deal with the hot flashes since the medicine its self is doing what it was given to me to do...keep me pain free the endometriosis. So far this is the only medication I have tried that is keeping 100% pain free. I am very happy with it overall. The only thing I do not like is having to have the shots given in the stomach. After both shots that I have had so far my stomach was very tender at the site of the injection and I was very bloated for a couple of days afterwards. But overall it is working very well for me so far.
Breast Cancer	MoffitCCPatient, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	4/20/2008 2:51:34 PM	Over the past 12 months, I have taken Zoladex and Arimidex.  Even though I have done a good job of restricting calories and exercising, it has been impossible to lose the weight I gained through chemotherapy 2 years ago.  I am going off this drug now, and will only be taking Arimidex, so we'll see if that helps the weight problem at all.  Also, have experienced vaginal dryness,  sensation of warmth at times (but not actual hot flashes) , sweat easily when exercising outdoors,  and some muscle stiffness.
Endometriosis	Endo T, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	25-34	2/17/2008 10:38:37 PM	Hotflashes are horrible with this. Less desire for sex. Helped with the pain in the begining but no longer... im going to be getting a hysterectomy. ALSO this made me gain over 10 lbs!!!!
