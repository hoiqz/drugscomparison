I am just now spiraling downward after tring to withdraw from the  testosterone by 50%.and he and his staff think its rather humorous orfunny.If you are using this drug make sure you have medical help that you can rely on. I have no idea how this will end butI think very badly for me.if you have any ideas please post a response. v

My wife looked into the symptoms of low T and found that I had these symptoms. Daytime fatigue, nighttime sleeplessness and hot flashes were my primary issues. Sex drive issues were never a problem for me. I had my level checked and it was low so my doctor put me on injections about a year ago. I'm an EMT-I so the injections are not a problem. in the past year my strength has went thru the roof, I weigh 190 and can bench press 325. I've added 20 pounds of muscle while my body fat percentage has gone down to 14%. Worked miracles for me.

I experienced all of the negative symptoms while enjoying none of the benefits, uncontrollable vomiting, nausea my voice deepened as if it wasn't deep enough shortness of breath, in short as my Dr. put it the beginnings of congestive heart failure beware it doesn't work for us all!

It's for my husband who had complained about lacking of energy level. He susgested the doctor to test his testosterone level. His level was low. He used Testim cream first, felt better according to him, but it is too pricey. Switched to Testosterone IM for about more than 2 years. He is satisfied now, but for me giving him a shot everyweek is a pain. I hate doing that (I work in medical field). He has been gaining weigh, more likely due to lacks of physical activities and overeating. Don't think he is building up muscle. He has hair loss, but aging (53) probably is a main factor. Has mood swing specially at the end of the week. About the sex drive: N/A or no improvement. Now he is complaining about frequent muscle cramping. I just wonder he is dealing with another side effect or just dehydration.

I know that my energy level went up for a couple of days. I have also noticed that I'm not running out of breath as fast. I haven't noticed any sexual improvements yet but from what I have read that will come in time. My levels were very low and I am on my first six months of treatment. I sure would like some input from others if that is possible.

My energy levels are wonderful.  I have added significant muscle mass and my endurance is off scale.  While I don't love the injections I must admit that the shots have changed my life.  My libido is now like that of a 17 year old and every aspect of sexual activity have improved dramatically.    If you are new to Tes. IM, give it time, do not expect a miracle cure, but do work closely with your doctor to ensure you are taking an adequate dose.  I started at 300 mgs every 10 days and am up to 350 mgs every  10 days and finally my blood levels are in high-normal level and I feel great.  While I do have some minor fluid retention and minor acne, I would fight to stay on the shots. 
Other	luke, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	3	Male	55-64	9/22/2009 7:02:14 PM	verdict still out...used the testosterone cream  for a few weeks, then switched to the intravenous injection in the butt...I had some mood swings a few days later which I did not expect. I began to have more energy using the cream, and starting to come stabilize now after the injection. I am hopeful that the overall process will be beneficial. And I realize my testosterone levels are so low I need to do something.
Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	5	Male	45-54	8/14/2009 4:40:57 PM	Went to doctor complaining of weight gain, sugar problems, lack of sleep, erectile issues.  I've been depressive (Dystamia?) for years and am on med's for that.  I feel better but never great.  Thats about it.He did extensive testing:  My blood sugar was a little high, I was at 35% body fat, cholestoral was highish.Testosterone was just under normal.He said, &quot;I can give you six pills or we can just try testosterone and see what happens&quot;.  I opted for one drug.We started low and using cream/transdermal.  Wasn't getting much improvement.  Went to IM injections.  Slowly upped the dose -I finally feel like a functional human.  I have energy, I sleep better.  I've begun to actually ADD muscle and LOOSE fat - MY BODY FAT IS AT 19.6% after a year and a few months.  The major change was adding T.  I have been working out for three years now.Amazing how simple a solution it was and yet, insurance didn't want to cover it - they did, but we had to fight them.

Can't really say that there is much improvement. Frequency of erections has increased, but not much increase in libido. I receive an injection every 3 weeks. Injection site is sometimes painful.

I was tested and found to have a very low testosterone level.  I felt nothing at first, but after two months I have noticed a significant change in sexual health and general strength. I have notice a bit more aggressivness and sometimes some sleep loss, but these are not significant. What is significant is waking up in the morning!  My father had alzheimer's set in at an early age (late 50's)and low levels of testosterone may have contributed to this. So it is good to feel that perhaps we may be curbing this possibility.I strong like bull now.

I have experienced an amazing transformation in my overall health, what was good is now great! Urological function greatly improved. Prostate returning to normal size. Overall muscle tone improving greatly. Body fat diminishing. Injections easy and painless. Libido returned to better than pre-med. Erection function better than pre-med. Sexual desire and overall function amazing. Recovery of erection between intercourse episodes rapid. Zest for life returned and overall happiness greatly elevated. There's is much more that illustrate numerous positive side-effects from the careful and regular injection. Lady friends very happy with sexual performance and positive outlook. I have been getting complements from female total strangers about my bearing, looks and charm! One lady friend was with me when I recieved such a complement and suggested that my Pheromone levels are probably up as well as my blood Testosterone levels. All in all a wonderful change in a 60 year old man feeling about 45 again!!
