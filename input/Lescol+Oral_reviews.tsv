Primary Prevention of Heart Attack	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/3/2011 11:53:31 AM	I have been on this medication for several years. I have had no side effects. I recently had my physical and the report is showing that I am borderline high, which has never happened before. I will continue watching my diet, exercise and take the Lescol. The doctor does not want to change it at this time. 
High Cholesterol	overallhealthdiminishedbythisdrug, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	1/12/2011 11:45:12 AM	I took this drug to lower cholesterol. I also have high blood preassure which is treated by using an ACE inhibitor called lisinopril. I experienced severe shoulder joint, hip joint, and knee joint pain which I attributed to intense weight training. I also had an accute pain in my colon area ( upper left abdomin) which seemed to lessen when I laid on my side. After several visits complaining to my doctor about this to no resolution. I took myself off this medication to see if it made a difference. Mind you, the drug instructs you to keep taking this medication, and not to stop once started.  I immediately started to get better the same day. There was no mention of the side effects that I experienced. My doctor did not know what was going on either. Even had an MRI which was unremarkable and normal. I believe that my experience is probably very commom. However, almost five years after I still experience some pain in my abdomin. My body is in less harmony than before taking this drug. This drug was slowly killing me. Also, it is implied that side effects will stop once you stop taking this medication.This is not entirely true. Some people may experience total relief and some may still have problems after stopping a drug. If I would have known this before using this drug I would not have taken it.

High Cholesterol	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/4/2010 1:51:56 PM	I've been on this drug now for a little over a year. Before starting, my cholesterol level was 245. Now it is 140. The only side effects I've had is occasional arm pain between the elbow and wrist but the pain would go away after several minutes. 
High Cholesterol	coachdad, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	5/26/2010 10:38:57 AM	Moved from Crestor to Lescol because of some joint pain. Took Lescol 80 XL less than 4 times, after about an hour felt nauseus, and had 1 violent vomitting episode in the middle of the night. 2 days later was in hospital for 2.5 days as acute pancreatitis was diagnosed. Maybe that was in the background for a while with the other statins, but Lescol kicked it in to overdrive. All previous blood tests were normal, but with this WBC went way high. Joint pain was a cakewalk compared to this experience! Guess I need to stop eating eggs benedict now! Good luck to all of you. 
High Cholesterol	jwoood, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female		2/8/2010 9:06:47 AM	I have trouble with all statin drugs.  My doc keeps trying different drugs to see if he can hit on the right one.  After two months, my muscles began cramping to the extent that I had to give up the drug and he changed me to Trilipix.  After reading reviews of Trilipix I will not take that one either.
Slow Progression of Disease of the Arteries of the Heart	HERicci, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male		5/13/2009 11:24:12 PM	Been on this med for about three years. Went on it after Lescol crippled me  as it had everybody I talked to who had been on it. Crestor was next, but it also started to bother my muscles and joints. No such problems at all with Lescol, but it is not as effective as Lipitor but I find it satisfactory. My cholesterolis now maintaining in the acceptable range. I intend to stay on my 40mg/day regimen.
