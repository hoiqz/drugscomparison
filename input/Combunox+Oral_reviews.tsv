I take it 4x day for neuropathy, osteoarthristis and fibro. It helps me be able to function. The quality of my life before Combunox was very low. People who are in chronic pain deserve to live a better life, and Drs are too afraid to prescribe pain meds nowadays. I would reccomend this drug to anyone who lives with pain.The only major sideeffect I have is constipation.

Pain	ladyp, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/29/2007 8:26:56 PM	Combunox has been a life saver for me.  I have serious back problems. I have had surgery (spinal fusion) and now I have lost the disk at L4-L5.  Combunox is very effective and I am happy to have it.  I only use it when the pain is too much to handle which fortunately I have a high tolerance for pain so I rarely use the medication.  Thank  you for this opportunity to review a medication.
