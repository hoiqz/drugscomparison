Atopic Dermatitis	DanielsMom2009, 0-2 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	5	5	2	Male	0-2	4/30/2012 9:37:10 PM	This medication was prescribed for my 2 year old who was diagnosed with Eczema at 2mos. He developed the rash in his genital area and the cream worked for a littler under a year. We didn't use it continuously because he only had outbreaks when the climate changed. This recent outbreak was the worse because the weather went from the 90's to the high 50's over night. I put the cream on it and it cleared the irritation; however, it left my son with bleached skin around his mouth. Didn't use more than usual and am still clueless as to why it discolored his skin this time. As of right now we are discontinuing using this cream and moving on to something else.

Its was extremely itchy.  I used benadryl topical initially.  It works ok but this is a miracle drug in comparison.  It really eliminates the itching.

Skin Condition	HeatherH, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/22/2008 1:18:12 PM	I used mometasone on my face just to see if it would reduce the redness and bumps caused by Rosecia.  It worked in 1 day.  Redness, pustules, spongy texture of skin, itching all were gone after 24 hrs.  I use it 2 times a week to keep my face clear.  It was not prescribed for me but for my husbands rough skin patches on his ear.

I saw about 18 doctors of all sorts, and the last one gave me a rx for this just as an off-the-cuff; and nothing has ever worked better! Now, at the first sign of my problem, I apply the drops &amp; the swelling is under control. After years of pain &amp; frustration, to have this simple solution is so great!
