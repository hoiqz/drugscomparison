After taking the medication for 6 weeks I had gained 6 lbs in weight.  Doctor says the Glyburide has caused this.  Started out taking 1 x 2.5mg tab once a day now take half a tablet per day and weight has stabilised. Need to take more exercise to see full results.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Male	55-64	5/16/2010 1:01:08 PM	I take it becuz I feel I have no other choice...I constantly fight flushing and muscle pains in my calves...Doc says &quot;put up with it or use insulin&quot; (I am light type2) My readings rise when I dont take it, but I feel better overall.  I tried separating the glyburide (5mg) from the Metformin (500) but it just separated the way I get the flushing and pain.  I've been looking for something better for oral use.

I was having lows, so my doctor cut it down to once a day (with dinner).  I still was experiencing severe lows, so he changed the medication to Metformin only (500) once a day (with dinner).  The past week, even though there has been no change in diet and more exercise, my readings have been up from what they were before.  I don't know if just the metformin alone is going to work.  However, I have had no side effects, other than the lows, with the medication.  I have read that many people experience stomach problems, but I have not had any.

They do help lower my sugar, so I am happy with them.

If I would stick to  proper diabetic menu choices levels would drop even more.  A little stomach upset a few minutes after taking even after taking food first, but very tolerable.
