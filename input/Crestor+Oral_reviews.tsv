Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	SeEkas, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	9/4/2012 5:27:18 PM	While I can't comment on the effectiveness or satisfaction yet (I've only been on it for 2 weeks), I CAN comment on the side effects.  I have been experiencing extreme low back pain...from hip to hip and very tender to the touch. The other sore muscle areas on my body are my upper back, my chest, and the beginnings of my forearms.  I already have RA and have tested positive repeatedly for Lupus LAC, I have vascular disease too, but I know how I feel with all those.  The side effects from the Crestor is totally different.  I called my Dr, and she now wants to switch me to Livalo.  I'll try it, but from what I've read up on that drug, it's just as bad!  
Other	TheVic, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	8/31/2012 6:33:44 PM	After reading all you'r reviews I refused to put that drug in my body. My cholesterol total was 246,so I bought and tried Cholest off complete it is a supplement.I half way took it like it recommends,and after 3 weeks I had another fasting blood work and got an at a boy letter from my Doctor LOL she thought I was taking crestor.My new # is 196   I called her office to day to tell the nurse and even she was impressed that I had that big a drop in only 3 weeks WAA HOO thank you all for convincing me I did not want to take a statin  drug.

I have a little back pain so far.But also a little upset stomach and diareha not sure if that is related? Was on Simvastatin for 5 years and got to point couldnt hardly function due to all the muscle pain. I think there is no end to this all. All cause the muscle pain but are needed to help our hearts! Catch 22 and sucks!!
High Cholesterol	JLG, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	8/25/2012 2:19:40 PM	Taking Crestor 2 times and have been experiencing severe body ache and pain since. Did not take it last night and still experiencing sever muscle and body aches. This is Avery dangerous drug. Don't understand why dr. Switched me from Vytorin. It was working fine. Careful everyone this is a bad drug!
High Cholesterol	Spencerfg, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	65-74	8/8/2012 1:26:39 PM	I've been taking this medication for a number of years and it seems to be reasonably effective in reducing cholesterol.  Unfortunately this comes with unacceptable side effects.  I've confirmed this by reducing dosage from 30mg/day to 0 over a period of time and then resuming it.  Lethargy, dizziness, muscle pain, arthritis, and sleeplessness all seem to be related to the drug.  Unfortunately, I did not associate these symptoms with the drug until recently.  I and my caregivers thought I was suffering from depression but treatment with various anti-depressants was ineffective.  I eventually retired from my job because I was having trouble getting through the day.  I can not continue with this medication.
High Cholesterol	CC., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/4/2012 11:43:50 PM	I am on Crestor and have horrible side effects. I had a heart attack in 2008,i was 48 at the time, fit slim and healthy and had never taken any sort of medication in all my 48 years. After having the heart attack i was prescribed Crestor. Everything went downhill from there on. I am experiencing severe leg/calf toe and foot cramping. It started at night but now im having trouble walking, as my legs feel like they are bruised and cannot carry me. My arms feel like jelly. I have no strength and all day/night pain. My hips ache, im fatigued and all this is due to Crestor. This horrible horrible drug which reduces your cholesterol levels instantly, but harms your body.My muscles feel like they are collapsing as i can hardly lift anything. I was on 20mg of Crestor and now am on 5mg but i will be stopping it as my body feels like its shutting down.

High Cholesterol	Chuck, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	2	Male	45-54	7/18/2012 5:48:52 PM	I was prescribed Crestor by my cardiologist after having CABGx3 on 7/28/2011. I had been on Zocor previously and my cholesterol had dropped from 180 to 111. Now the doctors want people to have their cholesterol level around 80, which seems a ridiculous low level to achieve. Since switching to Crestor I have experienced many, many muscle cramps, from my hips, my rib cage muscles, chest muscles, side muscles, feet, shoulder muscles and even under my chin around the larynx area. Talked to my cardiologist about it, who is also taking Crestor he says, but without the side effects I am experiencing. Told me to go off it for a week to let it flush out of my system and see how I felt. I felt much, much better without it. I was able to flex and stress my muscles more without worrying about all the cramping. Went back on it and VOILA! muscle cramps are back. A nurse at the hospital I go to for all my cardiology help told me that Crestor is one of the worst drugs so far as the way it effects your muscles. Said HER doctor had put her on Crestor, but she won't take it. I feel I have no choice as I have inherited atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries) from my fathers side of the family, a definite family history of this disease. I feel I am destined to live with these horrible muscle cramps for the rest of my life. I was told I might be able to use Lipitor, but will have to wait for the generic price to come down as I can not afford what it presently costs. I dread finding out what the long-term effects of this drug are on the body.

High Cholesterol	Jasper1930	1	4	1			7/7/2012 5:51:25 PM	Was placed on Crestor by my MD because simvastatin was not compatible with meds I use. Was using it for a few months and during that period I was getting weaker in my legs and arms. I continued to lose strength. I was very concerned. One day I listened closely to their TV commercial. In it they stated that a rare disease may cause muscle weakness and pain. I had those syptoms. Of all the muscles in the body the most important is the heart. My heart became more irradic and my pacemaker was working hard to correct the problem.     So I stopped taking Crestor on my own. Within one week without it I began to feel stronger, my heart rate returned to normal and I no longer had anxiety. I continued to improve daily and withing two months I was fine. My MD told me not to take it again and I haven't. I hope this has been helpful.

I have been taking Crestor 10 mg. now for almost a year and had none of these symptoms before then.

No aching muscles, no back breaking pain in my lower back - which I've had with other meds for this problem.  I've had some itching and flushing but not bad.  I have had some severe dizzy spells but sinus problems could be an aggravating factor in that side effect.  All in all, I like it.
High Cholesterol	HDMark2, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	5/8/2012 9:58:37 PM	This was no different than other statins I tried. My numbers were not overly high but they wanted me on this due to a 50% blocked artery. Got all the side effects listed previously in only 48 hours!! Pain so bad I could not stand straight. I used simple natural items instead and got the bad numbers down and the good numbers up! 90% of chest tightness gone too. And NO side effects! Found there are currently class action lawsuits listed online against Crestor. I know over 100 people that were/are on statins and I can count on one hand those that had little to no side effects. I was on 3 brands with Crestor being the worse. If your doctor insists you &quot;wait it out&quot;, get a second opinion from a different source. For me the very slight benefits were wasted on the lack of life quality.

I've been taking it for 3 or 4 years (sice it first came out, I think), but I prefer NOT to take Statin drugs and have stopped taking it, with my MD's ok, to see what my bloodwork will look like.

HDL increase was minimal. I do experience muscle weakness and fatique but so far no serious problem. I take other drug for CAD and I hope it is OK. They are amlodipine and metoprolol and Karvea for my highpertension and Plavix,asprin and ezetrol. All this combination of drugs seem to give me no problem. I have stroke 4+ years ago and angina pain and had angioplasty with stenting done one year ago. I hope all will be well with me and with dieting plus moderate exercises I am returning to better health and be able to enjoy a better quality of life style.

This medication has been causing me severe weakness, insomnia, muscle aches all over my body especially arms and legs. Migraines are back, and tight pulling pains in my chest. After reading other reviews on this medication I am discontinuing it until I see the doctor in 2 days. I want my Cholesterol down, but I surely don't want to go through all this pain it causes. I will go back to the Lipitor, at least that didn't make me feel like I am dying. Thanks to the others who put their reviews on this and other medications we all don't have to think we are going crazy having these symptoms

My husband retired and I was forced to obtain an individual insurance policy.  I was turned down by two companies and experienced a $400 monthly rate increase from another because I was taking Crestor.  Two sisters take Cymbastatin and neither had the negative insurance issues.  The expense of this drug without insurance is prohibitive

High Cholesterol	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	45-54	2/25/2012 10:34:43 AM	Never again.  Like many, I developed horrible cramps and muscle pain to the point I couldn't function on a day to day basis.  Plus, it lowered my HDLs down to the risk level.  So, I took myself off the medication and it took weeks before I was nearly back to normal.  Months later, I do wonder if I have some permanent damage.I have learned many things since then.  I was always told by Doctors don't eat after midnight for a cholesterol test. I would snack late into the night, but always stopped at midnight. I always had my blood taken first thing in morning so I could eat breakfast later.  I have since found out one should fast 10 - 12 hours at a minimum, and certain foods will impact the test if eaten within 24 hours.After I did the &quot;no eating after midnight fast&quot;, my total cholesterol was near 300...very high.  Again my PA wanted to put me on another Statin.  I said No.  After reading this website and others, I waited a couple of weeks for a second test.  This time, I just ate fruit, oatmeal and veggie soup then fasted 12 hours.  My total cholesterol dropped to 224 and all of my numbers were near optimal except my LDLs.  Since I don't have a genetic propensity for high cholesterol, I decided to make some lifestyle changes to get where I need to be.  Plus, even with an elevated LDL, other tests suggest my lifestyle makes up for my slightly elevated LDLs.I wonder how many people are being prescribed Crestor due to improper testing.  The upside, it forced me to become even more responsible for my health; don't take doctors/PAs opinion or lab results as the gospel (my mistake), and I have improved my diet and lifestyle because I never want to take crestor or another statin again.I hope my horrible experience with Crestor will help you.

After a couple of years pain in legs and knees became so bad I could barely walk.  Feet were swelling and back became very stiff.  Cut dosage to 5 mg and pain/swelling is decreasing after 4 weeks.  Can acutally see veins in feet again.  Shoes fit looser.  Erictile dysfunction dimishing.  I live overseas so I won't see Dr for another 5 months.  Will know one way or another by then.

I kept telling doctor I thought it was Crestor, he did not believe me so I took myself off of the Crestor and within 2 or 3 days, the pain stopped, I could walk normal again, have very little pain. I am very careful in my diet and walk more. I feel so much better. My husband was starting to have leg pains and stopped taking it and his pain has stopped. I would rather be dead than to have to live with all that pain. Will never take Crestor again.

Thought my muscle and bone pain was just the normal pain from Arimedex.  Now think it is probally a combination of both.  I have tension headaches at least twice a week.  Anxiety and sleep problems.  I am only 49 but feel like 89.  I will followup with Dr. to see if this is really working and worth the pain.
High Cholesterol	saynotodrugs, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	1/26/2012 7:30:50 AM	I received an Rx for 10mg of Crestor which I took with CQ10 in hopes of avoiding problems I knew were associated with statins. On the third day my lower back and right hip was hurting so bad I thought I had strained myself at work. Went off the Crestor and felt better a week later. Decided to try again and not only did the severe pain in lower back and hip return but muscle pain in my thighs and arms. It's been three weeks and I still have severe muscle cramps in the back of my legs, pain on the top of my thighs, and slight muscle pain in my arms. The pain increases with any type of exercise. I am exhausted and depressed (probably from not sleeping well and being so inactived due to the pain) I need to make an appointment for the MD but honestly I do not have confidience that he will not want to put me on a different Statin &quot;since the outcome out weighs the side effects&quot; NOT if it's your life! In the last three years I have missed 6 days of work and it's all been due to 'adverse reactions to drugs'. Wonder how many of this Docs take the same drugs themselves? I feel like I will never be the same.

Since then, nausea and dizziness appeared and over the weeks has worsened greatly.  I have taken myself off of the med as of today once I read the &quot;rare&quot; side effects.  I would not reccomend it to anyone.  Find a natural substance of some type and use that.

In Dec 2010 it was 200.  Two weeks later I was in the emergency room with glucose level of 715.  Took insulin with each meal plus bedtime for 7 months. Lost most of my hearing in the right ear due to type 2 diabetes.  Gradually became so weak I started reviewing the reviews for this drug.  Had the Dr. change me to Lipitor and within 2 days I was totally off insulin and metformin.  Weakness went away at the same time.  Haven't had to use insulin for over 5 months now.  Hearing loss is permanent,  but eyesight is restored.  Cure is definitely worse than the kill.

No record by doc why I went off it, and to Simvastaton(? spelling), but Crestor gave me upper arm muscle pain back then. Past year switched back because of cholestorol triglycerides high. Left leg began began to hurt so bad and had great difficulty walking. Stopped Crestor 6 weeks ago and am walking ok again can sleep and no pain,no nightmares. Go back to Doc in February and will see new test results then.

After 3 months (first time I had follow up test), my cholesterol was lowered to 175 and Trigs down to 326. I see many complaints about side effects and usually if side effects exist, I seem to get them. I was a little sore the first week, but have not had any side effects since on Crestor and highly recommend it.

High Cholesterol	JCCarey, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	10/26/2011 7:12:00 AM	A pricey drug for cholesterol control.  My doctor insisted I take simvastatin which hurt my leg muscles.  Having chronic pain the last thing I need is more pain, so I did not take it.  Finally, he gave me some samples of Crestor and I had no trouble with it.  I finally feel confident I am doing the right thing for my cholesterol. By the way it turns out the doctor was not in the habit of prescribing things that wold not meet the budget of some folks or may not be covered by their insurance.  Something to keep in mind.  I believe he told me the difference is 10/month vs 160/month, making the statins more reasonable for cholesterol control especially if you have no side effects.

I take 10 mg at bedtime. When I first started taking i noticed slight headaches and some nasuea at first but kept taking it. After a year I have not had any issues. I have maintained a low fat healthy diet and excercise regularly as cautioned to by my doctor. My cholesterol profile is excellent now and I intend to keep taking the crestor. I understand people have bad reactions to drugs but not everyone does and judgements should not be made by reading just a few comments. I almost DIDNT take it because of what I read here. Im glad common sense prevailed and I did. Remember this...there are tens of thousdands of scripts written for any given drug every year and in comparison to that there are only a few bad comments here. My sympathies to those that did have trouble. I hope you were able to find a treatment that worked for you.

I have had no side effects nor any sign of side effects from this medication. I have told my friends about Crestor...the ones who are taking Crestor are happy with the results. Anyone else I have told about Crestor has not given me any indication they are or have been unhappy with the medication.

It took 30 days for cramps to subside. I then started taking 5mg Crestor. I have been taking Crestor for 5 years now with out any side effects. It lowered my total cholestrol from 230 to 130. My wife has been taking Crestor 10mg for the past 2 years without any side effects. It lowered her cholestrol also by 100 points.

The various changes to me over the last 10 months include increased general aches and pains that I can't unequivocally relate to Crestor.
A Type of Inherited High Blood Cholesterol Disorder	Rita, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	9/6/2011 1:54:47 PM	I have been taking Crestor for 2 mos.,&amp; my chol. levels have gone down significantly. Before taking this, I lost 30 lbs, and was on Zocor, &amp; my levels went UP! So far, the only side effects I have noticed are trouble sleeping and at times attacks of nausea, and fatigue. After reading the reviews, it is scary &amp; if I even begin to have any muscle/joint pain, I will go off of it. I've been told my type of high cholesterol is hereditary, and diet &amp; exercise do not do a thing to change my levels, which proved true. My Mom is 85 &amp; has had her levels over 350 at times for YEARS! But who cares what your numbers are if you can live to 85 or older. We all have to die of something! I will continue to take Crestor until I experience any more side effects, at which point I will weigh the risks with the benefits I guess!  
High Cholesterol	Rita, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	9/4/2011 8:01:52 AM	Do you have to take Crestor at night for it to be effective? I take all my medicines in the a.m. I am afraid I will forget to take this at night. Since heart attack on July 6, 2011 I have been taking Crestor in a.m. since home from the hospital. Thanks!

Has the anxiety bothered anyone else when they stopped? The druggest said it could take up to 6 weeks to get it out of your system! Great!

High Cholesterol	kathygem, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/23/2011 1:50:45 PM	this medicine was scarey for me to take at first due to all the negative feedback and i have MS and Fibromylgia so was scared I wouldnt be able to tell the difference if I did have side effects doctor first tried 10mg it took my total from 223 to 126 my ldl from 131 to 70 and the rest of my numbers were great but I wanted to be dropped down to 5mg to try so thats where Im at. They said if you are having side effects from the crestor it would happen within the first two weeks and that every statin carries risks but the benefits outweigh them.
