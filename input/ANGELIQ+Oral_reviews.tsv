My hot flashes disappeared, my skin, hair and nails started growing.  I had more energy and my mood improved immensly.  I stopped using it for 4months and everything went down hill.  My hair fell out in chunks and I was so depressed.  Started taking it again and I feel fantastic.

I have been taking it for 21/2 years but do have bleeding every couple of weeks.  I can also sleep! It is important to take it about the same time everyday.

Experienced loss of desire for most everything. Have cut my dose in half by taking every other day and will start a bioidentical menopause cream I found through Daystar.

My doctor thought they were related to a bulging disc in my neck. She and I never associated my headaches with this drug, which did work on the menopausal symptoms for which I was taking it. Four months ago I switched to Combipatch, and I have not had ONE headache since the switch. Now I'm certain my headaches were related to Angeliq.

Now 53. After 6 months on this no more hot flashes, that's about it. Still not sleeping, no desire, gained 10 pounds and still gaining, mood has changed but not neccesarily better. Cannot find a hormone or combination that works for all. After 4 years I feel like I have tried everything.

Started having periods, one lasted a few weeks.  Tried this after having no luck with over the counter options.  Started perimenopause at 47, resorted to HRT at 50, no regrets.  I feel like myself again.

Body temp has gone back to normal again - yeah! No more flashes, sleeping like a baby! Additional benefits of reduced dryness &amp; increased libido. Only negative I have is edema. My ankles &amp; calves are swelling and I now have to wear support hose every day. Otherwise I am very happy with this medication.

Started bleeding after being period free for 3 years.  Dull headaches almost daily.  No decrease in vaginal dryness or increase in libido. Hot flashes were never a problem. So, basically, the drug has been ineffective.  At $50 copay/mthly dosage it is not worth it.

After the second week I came down with an upper respiratory infection/sinusitis, which I haven't in over two years.  I quit it.

The only downside is that my fybroids which were shrinking have started to grow again. Hopefully this will slow down again.

No more hot flashes at night, then a few days later the hot flashes during the day just stopped.   It was wonderful!    No other side effects yet just feeling normal again!

No hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, mood swings, and vaginal dryness, all went away after a few weeks. I work out at least 5-6 days a week and have noticed that loosing weight has gotten to be really difficult, especially in the stomach area. I took my pill &quot;LATE&quot; &quot;ONE&quot; day as opposed to taking it early in the morning and boy did I have problems. Night sweats two nights in a row, I didn't sleep well for two nights and the bleeding was horriable. So I learned that you need to take it at the exact same time everyday to get the results you are looking for.

So changed to Estradiol and although this stopped the hot flashes and &quot;spotting&quot; it gave me really bad headache's. So now have just changed to Premphase - lets see it this works!!

I found that after 2 months, my hot flashes completely disappeared.  However, I've experienced increased appetite and have put on weight in a relatively short period of time.  Now, I'm not sure which I dislike more - hot flashes or weight gain.

Doctor is switching me to Femhrt to try for 2 months.  Experienced daily dull headaches, bloating, joint pain, and the worst symptom - depression.  Things bothered me that normally would never have been any issue.  Felt basically miserable.  Hopefuly the Femhrt will be better, because I am really sick of feeling like this.

Hot flashes were BRUTAL both day and especially at night.  Waking every hour sweating then freezing from being clammy.  Feet swell, irritability, mood swings - horrible life.  Was adamant that I didn't want to take hormones.  Met with my doctor who spent quite a long time discussing the good, bad and ugly of hormones.  Explained that I probably wouldn't have to take them forever.  Finally, she told me that she had already had her tubes tied and if she had to take a hormone replacement this is the one she would take.  Said I could have periods but this should not cause regular monthly cycles.  Have been taking for almost 2 weeks and the change is remarkable.   Still have some hot flashes but not as severe. Don't plan on taking forever, hope to ween off eventually.  If anyone is suffering like I was, PLEASE, PLEASE see your doctor and discuss this treatment.
