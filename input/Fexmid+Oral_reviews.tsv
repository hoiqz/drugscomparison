Once I take it, and lay down, I am OUT. It allows me to sleep with out waking up from pain. I can function the next day, unlike previous muscle relaxers.

Before I got the scrip I took 10mg of vicodin which doesn't help my pain much any I took two 10mg tabs of flexeril and boy that wasn't a good idea my boyfriend found me in the freezer section of the store we were at talking to a pink elephant I saw lol. Definately not a good idea to take it with narcotic pain medicines I'd recommend waiting a couple hours. This medicine helped somewhat but I was still in pain and I was pretty much zombiefied for 6 to 8 hours after I woke up.

It did not make me sleepy, but did make me feel disoriented for about 16 hours.
