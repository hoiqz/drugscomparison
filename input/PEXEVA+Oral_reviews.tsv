Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	Texan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	3/8/2012 10:19:04 AM	I have been taken this med for almost 3 years..I am a hypochondriac also have depression time to time it really works reducing the fear of having a terminal illness. However i am on an extreme diet to loose some weigh afer having a baby it has become really hard for me to get rid of the extra pounds when i almost do not eat during the whole day. this medication also reduce my appetite and makes me really sleepy and almost no energy to do anything!!!! So it works in a way but on the other hand it does not. I tried to stop taking it and i ended up in the ER :( With terrible headache and vomiting like crazy and my tommy hurt a lot too. I hope this help. Every individual is different.
Extreme Apprehension or Fear of Social Interaction	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	9/16/2011 3:50:57 PM	I have been on 20mg for a week now, and I feel completely emotionless and disconnected since taking this medication. After 8 hours, when the pill is getting out of my system, I get really nauseous, headache, and dry mouth. Also, since taking this, I've broken out with a bad rash on my face that looks like a bad sunburn.
Panic Disorder	Nurse Jackie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	9/3/2011 1:09:56 AM	I had been taking Pexeva 30 mg. for several months.  It helped with my agoraphobia and depression better than any other med. I have taken in 29 yrs! I felt like I could do anything...however...the cost was very prohibitive, especially since I currently cannot find a job (with 2 BS degrees!). We have insurance, but my husband &quot;decided&quot; to d/c my med for food. Good choice for our small family: Bad choice for me!  I went off of the med. cold turkey...refused to ask friends for med. money.  Now I'm having p.a.'s, brain &quot;zaps&quot;, memory is shot and alot of anger. (&quot;Yes,everyone,there IS a (D)Recession!) And the first to suffer are the elderly, children and the mentally ill. Quote: &quot;I love my Country - but Fear my Gov't!&quot; By the way, I'm an RN - and there is a glut of nurses on the market. No jobs = no money = no much~needed meds. This is (was) no less than a &quot;Miracle Med&quot;, the ONLY complaint I have is that (30 mg) made me very sleepy (all the time!).  If your physician can get your dosage straight...Pexeva stops your panic attacks cold! (after being in your system 3 wks or so).  Too bad no middle/working class people can afford it...nor those millions w/o jobs. Sad comment on our society.  And yes, really, this is all related to our condition and to &quot;Pexeva&quot; ~~~
Major Depressive Disorder	KeepItHealthy1954,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		6/9/2011 9:03:04 PM	Of all of the drugs that I have taken for my depression, panic attacks, anxiety disorder and agoraphobia. Pexeva has been the best for treating my disorders, not healing them completely but making me comfortable enough where it is tolerable. I have not had any side affects on this drug but when I took others I had terrible side affects. I take Pexeva 30mg 1/2 am. and 1/2 pm. along with Trazadone at night.

I was introduced to pexeva and it has done miracles for me. I started off on an extremely low dose and worked up to 15mg once a day. I have gained weight, which I needed to because I have always been under weight. Also all the symptoms I experienced with my anxiety are gone. I love it and will take it for the rest of my life to not go back to how I was before. Thank you pexeva for changing my whole life!

My &quot;hot flashes&quot; and &quot;night sweats&quot; have continued for over 10 years. No sleep is the worst symptom. Any one taking for that reason?
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Lee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	8/19/2010 3:41:15 PM	This medication didn't help my anxiety. I couldn't sleep, didn't have a regular bowel movement for 6 weeks, it would make me sweat, and I don't normally sweat. On a score of 1 to 10, 10 being the best, I would rate Pexeva -0. And my doctor wanted to keep me on it for another month = without sleep and no bowel movement, I don't think so.

My doctor likes to increase the dose of a drug to maximum dose if its working well. I've been taking 60mg every morning for the majority of my two years. Only recently have I noticed myself getting used to Pexeva. I experiences all the side effects but only two side effects still bother me: loss of hunger and nightly teeth grinding. I weigh 105 pounds and have to make sure I eat regularly, or I will forget. I grind my teeth everynight and it disturbs people sleeping in the next room. Wearing a night guard is all I can do to stop the damage I'm causing myself. Other than that, Pexeva put stability back in my life. It allowed me to live my life, free of depression, anxiety and obsessive tendencies. I wasnt pointlessly angry anymore or stuck running circles in my mind. I still have bad days, thats going to happen regardless of a drug; however, a bad day stays in THAT day and doesnt plague me the entire week.

Major Depressive Disorder	bobby, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	7/4/2010 1:47:54 PM	This drug was not effective at 20mg 1x daily, I experienced abdominal discomfort, headaches, and I notice I cry easily, made me very sensitive, eye started to twitch, muscle spasms, dr. Wanted to increase dose, I stopped taking this med, dr suggested I then break pill in half if I'm going to stop, tried that and felt worse e.g (eye twitch) my brain feels tight as if it were in a vice, this med is pretty new. Would not recommend, then again the choice is yours peoples body are diffrent and react diffrent as u can c some people had good experience, if u do take read reviews, and side effects and wiegh ur options

Major Depressive Disorder	broadwayfairie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	4/6/2010 12:06:46 PM	i've been taking this for a week and a day. i started with half pill. sunday i started full pill 20 mg. i've been feeling a little more anxiety, dazed, and just overall wierd feeling, my hands shake a little and my jaw feels funny almost like i took an ecstacy pill but didn't get the good feelings, just the after effects.....my dr said it would take about 3 weeks to start working and that i may feel worse b4 better......don't see how that's a good thing for someone with anxiety. i pretty much have everything that this pill treats but in small doses as i like to call it..........so i'm trying to get through these weeks hoping it will actually help. i think if i feel funny still by sat, i'll call my dr. i almost feel i'd rather not take it, but i don't know. we'll see what happens. maybe i'll come back in a few weeks with a different report. 
Panic Disorder	AnxiousFree!!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/19/2010 6:49:44 PM	I started taking 1/2 of 20mg and since then have moved up to 30mg. I have only been on this medication for a month and I am finally back to a normal life again! No panic attacks since I first started taking it. Side affects in the first week and increases on dosage include (for me), shakey hands, a little stomach upset, no sex drive and very slight headaches. Eating a little with it helps the stomach. Finally being myself again after 2 years of severe anxiety....I'd say that the Pexeva outweighs the side effects. Try it!
Major Depressive Disorder	kmichalek, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	3/16/2010 1:24:29 PM	My husband has familial depression, he has been on just about every antidepressive there is with no hope. Each medication seems to platue after a while. Pexeva was prescribed and by day 4 he was feeling inner peace and better than ever, however, he began with the dry heaves, badly, so he stopped taking it and changed medications again. Nothing else is working. The pharmasist rec. that he takes prilosec or antacid 30 min prior to Pexeva and eat breakfast at the same time. Crossing our fingers this will work. After more than 10 years, I think this would be his miracle drug for his type of depression.

Recently upped the dose from 20mg to 30mg.  It has helped curb my depression and anxiety.  It's certainly not a magic bullet for me, but it helps.  Side effects included some nausea the first week and the occasional headache, but overall, I'd say the benefit outweighs those.  Give it a shot!

But I must warn you when it comes to the side effects, when I begin the medicine the side effects weren't so bad, maybe alittle but of nausea for the first week and a slight headache. But once I was on it for a good 5 months and if I had missed a day it was hell! Starting with brain shocks(electric pulses) which were constant until I could get my next dose, also the nausea was horrible. Not to mention I gain 50 + pounds since starting it. Completely took away my sex drive, which was very hard for me at 23 yrs of age and newly married. I'am now 25 and we are trying to have a baby so coming off of it was a must, because of the dangers it poses to an unborn baby. After talking to my doctor and slowly coming off of it, it still has been hell! It is taking upwards of 2 months to fully come off and I still feel sick :( So please if you decide to take this medicine, be prepared to deal with some serious side effects.

I'm happy to say it was my last. With the panic attack came constant feeling of anxiety and mild depression. All I could think about was when the next PA would strike. Within a month I felt better. After 3 months like a new person. I have been off of anti-depressants for about 3 months now, but felt the need to share as Pexeva is fairly new and I thought this might be helpful to someone. I helped me so much!

Once the drug started to work, about two weeks I have been able to return to a normal life ( to the thankfulness of friends and family).  The worst side effect was a weight gain and tremors at night and loss of sexual drive but living without the panic over rides all.

I am not sure if its working for my depression as yet, however it is working wonders for my appetite, I have none I have to make myself eat. I also have a constant stomach discomfort my stomach stays upset, and I think my vision is worse and I am sweating excessively but only in my face the sweat just pours off my face. Does anyone else have this. I have been on so many depression meds that had no effect. This one helps with my appetite but the stomach problem is making me nervous, I do not want to get ulcers.

This is the first medication I have been on that I feel mild to no depression, mild to no anixety and mild to no phobia.  My boyfriend says that if I quit taking this medication, he will leave because he cannot handle the old me (and almost left until I started taking this medication).  The only down fall, it is harder to orgasm.  My sex drive has sky rocketted, but my orgasm has depreciated quite a bit.  My friends and family say that I am calmer, more positive and fun to be around.  Like my childhood personality that left so many years ago has come back to life.  All I know, is I love being able to get up every morning with no gray cloud over my head, go out into public with no fear of crowds or people and complete my daily tasks without any hesitation.  Great feeling!!
