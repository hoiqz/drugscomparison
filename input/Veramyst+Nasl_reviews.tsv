Chronic Inflammation of the Nose Not due to Allergies	byte89, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	8/3/2012 1:19:24 PM	This was the only corticoid nasal spray that I could find that didnt have HEADACHE as a side effect. Works great at keeping my nasal passages open at night. I have post nasal drip from it which causes some throat irritation. I've read some other reviews and people say they gained weight from this drug. This is a metered &quot;microgram not milligram spray&quot; and it's not the same type of steroid as say Predinsone which makes you retain water. I work in healthcare and if you are gaining weight, it's from something else you are using in addition too or other lifestyle change. Anyway, the drug works well for me beyond others that gave me a headache within an hour of using them.

I am also very tired during the day and feel very unproductive.  Much prefer going back to just sneezing occasionally.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	kRRT, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	4/4/2012 8:12:49 AM	As a lifelong allergy sufferer and a Respiratory Therapist, I have a positive review of Veramyst. First thing in response to other readers- you're not gaining weight from inhaled steroids. They don't work like anabolic steroids or like oral ones(ex:prednisone)!theres a small chance of water weight gain, but maybe you're eating more due to an improved sense of smell... As far as nosebleeds,headaches, etc,this has happened to me only with the most effective sprays. Ask your MD about reducing the amount of sprays or use if this occurs.also consider saline rinse once a day. Out of all the steroid sprays/inhalers,I truly find fluticasone to be the best for knocking out inflammation, although once its working, it becomes apparent just how strong it is.

I then developed a sinus infection. I am not sure whether it was related or not

Guess being away from my cats so long just made my allergies get worse. I usually take this in the morning and sometimes it helps depending on the severity of my allergies at the time but most of the time it helps.

I have to stop using the Veramyst because of the sores in my nose, swelling of the nasal mucosa and bloody noses.  I will go back to using Nasonex.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	helensss88, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/14/2011 9:28:33 AM	Well, I have tried everything to combat my chronic sinus problems over the years...For the past four years or so, I have been using Veramyst in combo with Claritin daily and have never felt better! Nasonex, Flonase, and other sprays made me nauseous and instantly gave me a headache. They were too potent... or maybe it is the &quot;stream&quot; as opposed to Veramyst's soft &quot;spray&quot;? I use it once daily in the morning (one spray per nostril, I found, works well enough for me), and then again in the afternoon if needed. It tends to over-dry my sinuses occasionally in the winter, so I also use a Neti-pot (HIGHLY RECCOMMEND!) daily, prior to spray. This seems to be the Magic Mix for me. I am thankful, but my insurance always tries to get me to try the others AGAIN. Also - no weight gain whatsoever for me, and no other side effects. Great medicine! My doctor has used this daily for years, as well!
Chronic Inflammation of the Nose Not due to Allergies	Suzz,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female		10/23/2011 9:52:11 AM	This medication was effective in reducing nasal swelling, however, it caused me fairly severe dizziness/vertigo. It was diagnosed that I had a ETD that was causing the vertigo but in the end  started to make my own correlation to dizziness/vertigo spells. They came shortly after and continued about 12 hours after taking the Veramyst doses prescribed. When I raised the vertigo issue, it was felt I should see a neuro otologist for a deeper examination of inner ear disorders (did all tests, MRI) and all they could find were inflamed sinuses.  However, as a result I was placed on a diuretic and prescribed vestibular physical therapy. In the last 2 weeks, I started to experience hives. I raised the matter of the Veramyst a couple times with my ENT who said the mdeication couldn't be doing anything to me.  It was perfectly fine and he took it every day himself.  I stopped this medication 5 days ago and all of these symptoms have gone away. I had been prescribed Veramyst a few years earlier for nasal swelling and now recall I had similar symptoms and stopped taking it.  I had been using this medication for approximately 2 months.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	35-44	7/11/2011 12:43:50 PM	The spray works well but the side effects are too much to continue treatment. Severe dry mouth with bleeding gums, bad taste in mouth, seriously sore throat.

Other	sandy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	4/8/2011 4:47:00 PM	My sister and I were prescribed Veramyst.We both developed heart palpatations after using it for 2 weeks.  I went back to my doctor, and she did an EKG.  That test was negative.  She thought the steroids could be contributing to the problem and I discontinued this medication.  It was a scary experience. That was a week ago,and since then the palpatations have decreased significantly to maybe one a day. My sister's heart flutters have disappeared as well.  I thought it important to post this as my doctor prescribed an antihistamine nasal spray which works well but has no steroids in it.  I am taking OTC Zyrtec now with no side effects so far.

One dose and the symptoms all got several times worse.  My nasal passages got all irritated and constantly felt like I had to sneeze.  I also felt a little dizzy and nauseous, but that could have been the antibiotic.  I'm not taking any more veramyst.
Other	nchatenet, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	10/1/2010 9:48:39 PM	This medication has made me feel normal again. I've only been taking it for about 6 weeks. I've been dealing with itch, burn and run of the nose. This was due in part to allergies, but also other foreign things like dust and smells. I am taking other medications (Patonaise, Singulair, Proventil)   The Singulair helps treat the allergies for 24hrs and the Patonaise is for situations where I may have an allergy attack throughout the day (rare). I take the Proventil occasionally and the Varamist nightly for the Rhinitis.I went in because I had a nose that wouldn't stop running, itching and burning of the nose, eyes and throat. Post nasal drip was out of control and I felt like I was dying. I felt it was time to see an Allergist.Found out I was allergic to the Planet (lol). My dog, my mothers cats (the worst), dust, roach droppings(?), pepper trees and some other stuff.Well, with the treatment I'm on for my allergies, I'd say I feel about 95% better.My only problem with the medication (Veramist) is that I have blurred vision latter in the day &amp; dry eyes.Other than that, I think I'm happy I decided to visit the allergist and change my life around. No more dog, cats or dusty homes! Work no longer bothers me, and I'm not buying tissues every week :-)

I started using this in February and have never felt better. Out of 4 medications my allergist gave me prescriptions for, this is the only one I need to use. So I get maximum results with minimum drug use. Excellent!

I have stopped using the spray.  I also experienced bloody nose when blowing in the mornings.  Not worth the sleepless nights of itching legs. 
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	CMJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	5/1/2010 7:38:25 PM	Horrible side effects... sore throat, fever, joints achy, dizzy, weak, headache, loss of appetitie, loss of smell.  I've been using this spray for about 3 weeks give or take a few days.  I feel like I'm dying. As crazy as it sounds, I would rather have my horrible allergies instead of these feelings.  Needless to say I will alert my ENT to what is happening and I will discontinue usage immediately.  Hopefully, since I've only been using it for a short period of time I hope to bounce back and not have any long term adverse effects from this awful drug.

My allergies were getting worse each year, and clarinex, clarition, and Alavert didn't work. Nasonex was a joke, and the medications that worked were discontinued, but after two days of this and I feel like I could almost venture outside to walk the dog! almost.I've read some comments on weight gain, but I'll take it if it means resuming normal life again during spring!

No side effects, other than being able to breathe again...  The steroid in it stays in the nose and doesn't absorb into your system, so weight gain and growth stunting shouldn't be a problem.  So happy I tried it!!
Chronic Inflammation of the Nose Not due to Allergies	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	9/27/2009 9:47:26 PM	I was prescribed Veramist a little over a week ago. The first couple of days it seemed to work great, with only a little dizziness from getting more oxygen than I was used to. Not long after, I began to become moody and depressed and found it hard to stay awake at work. I am also on Orthotricyclen (an estrogen based birth control)and was told the two wouldn't interact, but I have now started spotting a week before my normal period &amp; have never done so prior to starting Veramyst.

I didn't realize those were side effects from Veramyst till I read these reviews. I also didn't realize this was a cause of headache, which  I experienced every time I used it. Only thing I liked this, it didn't give me sore throat like Flonase did. Now, I've decided to stop this medication.

I was unable to sleep and experienced some nausea. I felt dizzy and disoriented as well. Since this is the only medication that is new on my regime, I felt it was the culprit. I cannot take steriods and this morning I read the drug ingredients which included cortisteroids. I am assuming this was the problem.

I found that I could breathe a lot better but the drip continued and after about 2 days I noticed my throat getting sore and my voice getting hoarse.

My doctor won't be in his office until Monday (this is Saturday) so I'm just waiting it out but now my sinuses are worse than before.

I'd get sinus headaches that wouldn't allow me to perform daily activities. The doctor prescribed nasonex in combination with loratadine (claritin) and that didn't do much for me, he later prescribed veramyst in combination with loratadine(claritin) and it works wonders. I no longer get sinus pressure and my year-round allergies don't act up anymore. I'm completely happy with the results, oh and no increase in appetite!

I have fluid in left ear due to not draining properly and was very stuff. This works very well but is expensive. Slight increase in headaches, mainly in neck and back of head, it seems. Due to expense and fact it is steroid I am hoping my ENT doesn't suggest it long-term. I can tell I still have a slight infection as I have bad taste and smell on left side of nose--on antibiotic it started to go away then returned. I have been with infection for over 3 months but he told me it would be several months' battle due to my nasal spray misuse over the years! I can breathe well and going to follow his instructions, just hope the infection clears and drainage from other side ear will improve. DO NOT USE OTC nasal spray for long time, it is a terrible addiction and you'll eventually pay for it like I am !

However; due to this being a formulary drug I can no longer afford to pay for it.

However, I also suffer from severe GERD and this medication seems to be aggravating my GERD. Has anyone else experienced stomach pain or indigestion? It also seems to be increasing my appetite like others have stated. Not sure about this medication yet. I did not have ant of these problems while taking Flonase. It is a lot easier to use, but the cost is kinda out there!!
Chronic Inflammation of the Nose Not due to Allergies	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	45-54	12/21/2008 2:42:31 AM	I experienced itching all over my body about six hours after taking my first dose. That night I did not fall asleep until 4AM. I discontinued use for one week and tried it again just to be certain that the side effects I had were from the Veramyst and not from some other cause. Once again, roughly six hours after my dose, I experienced itching over my whole body but this time along with pain along the right side of my neck. I haven't attempted sleep yet, but I don't think it is prudent for me to take this medicine any longer.

These are not migranes, but sort of a dull ache. I get them about an hour after I wake up and they just ache all day unless I take tylenol or another over the counter pain medicine. I have been off VeraMyst for one week. I'm hoping the headaches go away soon.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male		12/7/2008 3:00:11 PM	Within a few days it started working well.  I used to take allergy medication such as Claritan every day (although although the added decongestant version worked, which kept me up all night), and I've been able to stop everything except this.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	Mom of Eric, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	1	Female	7-12	11/7/2008 2:56:13 AM	My son is 9 years old and used this last allergy season. it worked excellently, BUT, even since he has stopped using it, he has gone from totally skinny to filled out, to now chunky. He started using it again about 3 weeks ago, and I am just now realizing that it is the steroid that is causing him to chunk out. I read that it could stunt his growth and took him off of it, and was telling my Father about him chunking out recently, and not having over-eaten, or become less-active. He said steroids would definitely do that. I am now wondering if there is any way to reverse the damage it has done to his young body... I took him off of it immediately. I am really bummed because this worked extremely well for him, and he had absolutely no trouble using it, and no nose bleeds.

I believe that my itchy, burning eyes, incessant hunger, and never-ending headache, which others have mentioned, are resulting from this medication, which has done nothing to decrease my nasal congestion.  Nasonex had stopped working like it used to, but at least I had none of these side-effects.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	10/24/2008 8:48:37 AM	I used Veramist for 3 days for a sinus infection and starting having headaches, these turned into a severe migraine that I ended up having to go to the emergency room for.  This was my first and hopefully my last migraine.  I will never use this drug again.

I have never had a history of nose bleeds.  If you check the side effects one of the first mentioned side effects is nose bleeds.

I stopped taking it. Natural homeopathic medicine that works in a similar way as shots is working well for my year-round allergies.

My doctor gave me a sample of this and just after two days i felt much better and now my allergies are gone. I can now go outside and play in the grass without having sneezing attacks. I can even go around my grandmother who smokes without problems. I would recommend this to anyone who has mild to severe allergies. I have very severe allergies and it worked on me.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy		5	5	5			6/29/2008 11:26:48 AM	Have had serious allergy problems for 45 years....nothing worked until I started using Veramyst. It took 2-4 days to achieve maximum effectiveness.  Have had a few nasal sores, treated with Neosporin, and they went away.  First time in many years that I've enjoyed Spring and summer.  It even stopped my chest congestion in the Spring due to tree allergies.

It started working from day one. My eyes don't itch, I can breath through both sides of my knows, and the best part is the mist. You see I'm not swallowing it when I spray. So there is not an aftertaste.
Chronic Inflammation of the Nose Not due to Allergies	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	25-34	6/14/2008 1:10:07 PM	Veramyst provides relief for my persistant, allergic, congestion and post nasal drip that all of the antihistimines I ever tried could never touch; all within 24 hours.  I just wish that it was more affordable.
Other	Defying Gravity, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	5/20/2008 7:39:50 PM	I started using Veramyst, when Flonase was discontinued, for allergies and post-nasal drip. It works very well for me. I was concerned that it would dry out my eyes, but that has not happened. It does not give me the unpleasant aftertaste that I experienced with Flonase.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	3/16/2008 11:48:10 PM	This spray makes me sleepy.  I didn't see any side effects specifically related to sleep, but when I use this, about 2 hours later, I cannot hold my eyes open.  It puts me to sleep like an antihistimine or sleeping pill.  Not good if you use during the day!  I am trying using at night instead of morning.Anyone else experienced extreme sleepiness with use of Veramyst?

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	2/3/2008 5:52:43 PM	I was given Veramyst for allergies after a sinus infection. I was very happy with the medicine, but began having severe headaches. I did a little more research, and tracked my symptoms, and I believe that the headaches are due to the medication.  I currently have such a serious headache that I can't open my left eye without pain, and I wish I could chop the left side of my head off.  I have had 2 other headaches this serious since starting with Veramyst, and many that have been less serious.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	Emily, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	1/5/2008 11:20:24 AM	I have chronic stuffy and inflammed nose because of allergies.  I was recently getting frequent headaches in the facial area, so my doctor gave me this to try.  I have to say, when I have a sinus headache, this medicine clears it up in about ten minutes.  I can breathe through my nose again.  The only thing I do not like is the button you must push to spray the medicine.  Sometimes if you don't hold the bottle or push the button just right, it doesn't spray anything.  So I have to take a lot of test sprays, which wastes expensive medicine.  But I am very satisfied with the way the medicine works.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	35-44	12/9/2007 1:54:41 PM	I was prescribed this medication due to the fact that I suffer from both allergies of the eyes and nasal allergies.  The product I was on before did much better than Veramyst in relieving my congestion and the eye drops that I was taking prior worked faster in relieving my itchy eyes that waiting for the nasal spray to kick in.  I am going back to my previous medications
