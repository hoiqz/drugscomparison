Inflammation of Skin caused by an Allergy	7-12 Female  (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	7-12	8/15/2012 9:42:53 PM	Was prescribed this creme for my children's  mosqito bite skin allergy.  Each bite swelled and itched intensely.  Scratching  the bite usually ended up causing staph or strep infections that then required oral antibiotics.  Applying this locoid creme ASAP after the bite has resolved this problem.  Have been to the urgent care 3X prior for infected bites less than 1 day old.  This creme is expensive, ridiculously so, however for me it was far superior to OTC cortisone cremes. Not only stopped the itch, but prevented or reduced the swelling quicker than any other cream I had tried.  No side effects noted in the children after use. Only marked rapid improvement.

Skin Condition	illinois18, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/22/2012 1:15:07 PM	I have ocd and used to pick on my face when I was under major stress from a relationship and my face was so bad with pimples or rash, it was so embarrassing. My dermatologist tried many meds such as Retin-A but nothing worked except for Locoid LipoCream. It was like a miracle drug for me. Now I have been picking on my legs and have tried many topical meds once again, otc and prescription. I don't know why I have not asked my doctor for this one, but I will when I have my appointment tomorrow. 
Atopic Dermatitis	meeshy21, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/6/2012 12:31:16 AM	I have had eczema my entire life. Since I was 12 I have had it around my mouth causing very embarrassing flakes. When I was 14 my dermatologist prescribed Locoid and it changed my life. I have tried other eczema treatment including Elidel, but Locoid is the only one that works for me. Two days and the eczema symptoms are gone. I use this when I have flare ups to avoid acne from the steroids. It gets the eczema under control so I can maintain it through regular moisturizers. 
Skin Condition	SevereChronicEczema, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/28/2012 3:34:46 AM	Used it for severe chronic eczema. Locoid is the only prescription strength cream that would work immediately and with little effort. One tube of it lasted me over a year with how little I had to use it (because it works that well). The only thing I did not like was (with me at least) with prolonged use, my skin got used to it and it stopped being as effective. I recommend using a very SMALL amount to cover the affected area and only use it once a day. Twice, at most.

Skin Condition	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	9/16/2009 10:46:56 PM	I had an allergic reaction that caused my skin to peel during the healing phase.  My dermatologist prescribe Locoid Lipocream to stop the peeling I had on my face.  The peeling stopped in less than 3 days.  However I began to breakout with tiny red bumps on my entire face.  The breakout is in the patten the cream was applied to my face. Its been a month and the bumps are still on my entire face. They are not filled with pus but my chin is inflammed with larger red bumps that hurt.  This product work to stop my initial problem (peeling of skin) but we now believe the current bumps are a reaction to this cream.
