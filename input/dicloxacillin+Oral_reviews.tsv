Skin Infection	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	19-24	1/20/2010 3:21:22 PM	I had cellulitis.  It worked very well for that.  The pain was gone within a day and the area was healed around day 4.  However, it was about that time when I developed a burning sensation in my throat.  It burned all day and even more a couple hours after taking this drug.  This hurt more then the cellulitis did.  I would not recommend its use to anyone!

Other	Very Healthy MM, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		4/27/2008 1:15:54 PM	It was to be taken after surgery on my eyelid. I took 2 doses and it made me very nauseated. Talking with the doctor later he said it MUST be taken with food..exact opposite of your instructions. Took balance with food and no problems.  You must change these instructions. I will NEVER use this again. Also am wondering just where you &quot;import&quot; the ingredients from considering problems the FDA is having with bad ingredients coming from China,etc.     Marion Matteson
