I strongly recommend it to all my friends.  It is the best at removing male deposits following intercourse and as a results prevents the development of all odors.  Please help me find trichotine.  
Other	45-54 Female 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/8/2009 3:16:26 AM	I wish we could find Trichotine Douche Powder. All the women in my family used it.I used it for normal vaginal hygiene. I felt clean and fresh, no odor, cleared any itchiness.  The best douche product I have ever used! When I could find it on the store shelf, there were usually two or three bottles, I bought them all.  I too special ordered through my pharmacy. I do hope Trichotine Douche Powder becomes available again. Kim in Tx

I'm extremely satisfied with it, but it is getting harder to find.  In the past, I have had my pharmacist special order it for me.  I use it for regular feminine hygiene, not to treat a medical condition.
Other	vikki962, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/25/2009 7:22:12 PM	I have used this product for years and years.  I used to go to the drug store and pick it up, then you could not get it without my pharmacist ordering it.  Now  you can not find it anywhere.  I have tried all web sites.  I can't imagine why they would quit selling it.  But unfortunately most people we talk to say they don't douche.  All I can say is how nasty, not to have personal hygiene.  PLEASE COME BACK WITH IT!
Other	brooksbe, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/19/2009 1:41:37 PM	I use it simply as a douche.  Works great, inexpensive compared to purchasing Eve or other already-packaged products.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	11/5/2008 10:15:45 PM	I have not used this product in quite a while.  I am having trouble locating it.  It is very effective is removing secretions and personal cleansing.  Above all pre-mixed OTC products.   I hope is will soon be available again.
