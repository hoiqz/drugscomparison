It has always been contained to knee and leg. I get severe pain and swelling of knee and leg. Aspirations of knee just show tons of WBC's and no bacterial growth even before the start of Rif.  Last 3 aspir. showed 33,000, 44,000,&amp;55,770 WBCs. Had knee replacement June 2007 and had to be removed secondary to MRA in sept 2007. After three more surgeries using spacer and IV Vancomycin for 4-5 months, had re-implantation of knee. No problems with flare ups until August 2010. At first flare ups were short and far between. As time went on, flareups became more severe and lasted longer and were more frequent. Ex, 8/10, 12/10, 1/11, 4/11, and 5/11, and presently, 12/11. This last one was so severe that Ortho. doc scheduled me for surgery to have knee replacement removed again!!!  Luckily for me, each of those flare ups responded well to above mentioned drug regimen. This last flare up responded so quickly that both the ortho and infectious disease docs were extremely and happily surprised.Needless to say, my surg. was canceled. Side efects that I have experienced this time: yellow/orange urine, foggy head, and blurry eye changes which are quite annoying, and decreased appetite. I do not remember any of the changes with previous treatments except urine color changes.I would love to know in more detail what the eye changes are that are associated with the use of Rifampin especially since I will be on it for at least a month. I am a physician myself,(OB-GYN).

I too had cipro and rifampin. Mine was for a knee infedction to remove scar tissue. The knee was replaced five years ago. I was given 40 days of rifampin. I have finished the cipro. After 24 days of twice a day, i stopped taking it. I simply hate the way I feel, hopefully I didn't make a mistake. As one poster said his infection was in the steel, mine is too. I don't normally gamble, I am in this case. Many side effects, sore tongue, hearburn, many that do subside. In my experience the worst is the tiredness, it says mild, to me it is not. I normally have a lot of energy. The other bad one is a rash in the genital area. It is controlled with a cream, but it is very irritating. If you get the rash, don't let it go. I sincerely thank all that posted, sorry to say it was nice to see I was not alone. Thank you all!!!

Bacterial Infection due to Staphylococcus	 Male  (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male		5/24/2010 5:15:06 PM	I was prescribed 10 days of Rifampin with 10 days of Bactrim.  Due to a spinal-cord injury, I have been on a lot of pain meds for years (Methadone, Dilaudid, Soma, and Klonopin for a related condition).  I asked the Urgent Care doctor who prescribed this whether it would interfere with my pain meds, and she said no.  A couple of days later, with my back pain shooting through the roof despite me taking more than my usual dose, I asked my PCP whether these meds reduce the efficacy of my pain meds.  He said no.  (Like the Urgent Care doctor, without even looking it up/researching it.)  Finally, six days in to the antibiotics, the pain was so horrible that it was unbearable, and I felt for the first time in my life that I couldn't go on living like that. So my wife called my pain-management doctor (who was out of the office), and later that day his staff called back and said there should be no effect on the pain meds.  I decided to stop taking the antibiotics (I know I'm not supposed to do that, but the pain was so intense by that point it was absolute torture), and guess what?  24 hours later, the pain was back to normal and controlled by my regular dose of pain meds. Today, I researched Rifampin on this web site (WebMd).  Lo and behold, it took me about 60 SECONDS! to find this: &quot;This drug can speed up the removal of other drugs from your body by affecting certain liver enzymes. These affected drugs include . . . narcotic pain relievers (e.g., morphine, methadone).&quot;Soooo, the Rifampin does decrease the effect of pain meds (due to the increased liver enzymes getting the meds out of your body). It's right there in black and white.  Question:  Why the hell couldn't three doctors take the time to look this up on the manufacturer's web site or in the PDR?  Lesson learned:  Doctors are as fallible as the rest of us, so trust but verify.  And insist that they actually research the issue before answering your questions.  And above all:  When in doubt, trust your body!

Other	feelintoold, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	45-54	11/12/2009 11:06:17 PM	I was bitten by a Brown Reculus spoder on the forehead. This med. was given to me (3@day for 14 days) doseage, along with one other antibiotic that I had taken in the past without trouble. It gave me diarhea, nausea, severe headaches, and extreme weekness. After finishing doses, I developed what the doctor called serum sickness. It seems that the Rifampin was to hard on my system and my body was getting rid of it through my skin. All the skin on my face, hands, chest, arms, feet, privates, and ankles blistered and peeled away quite deeply. It took me 2 months to heal, and I am still after 5 months having trouble with my fingers peeling so deep they bleed (daily).

Inactive Tuberculosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	2	Female	25-34	4/24/2009 1:06:18 PM	After reading mainly good reviews of this drug, I hoped I would not experience many side effects.  I must admit, I was still slightly apprehensive.  About 5 hours after taking it, I felt as though I had several cups of coffee and had high anxiety.  By the next afternoon (time for the second dose) I was very depressed and crying (unusual for me).  This continued on the third day and I stopped the medication.  A day or two after I stopped the rifampin I developed a rash.  My doctor says he is not convinced the rash is a reaction to the drug.  I'm not so sure.

Other	c4thpower, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	10/20/2008 10:20:18 PM	I took this for a mild skin infection with cyst.  It was horrible.  I am disabled w/osteoporosis and osteoarthritus and ostoenecrosis and am on several pain killers and many other medications.  I had every adverse system in the book including DT's from it taking morphine from my body.  I would never advise anyone to take this unless they were dying and not on any other meds.  DON'T take with doxycycline as they amplify each others effects.  Never! I took it for only 3 days.  It stripped my body if every natural flora that it needs to survive!  It will take weeks to recover.

The bacteria is lodged in the metal hardware, and they have made a colony. The doctors say it will be there until they remove the hardware after the bone heals. (about 9 months).I have had no problems with Rifampin, and so far I don't have any symptoms of the bacteria in my body. It must be working to keep it at bay.

Bacterial Infection due to Staphylococcus	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	11/15/2007 1:45:49 PM	I saw the other review regarding being perscribed for a staff infection (which was my case) and thought I should comment. I did not have any adverse sife effects and I was taking this with Doxycyline as well. It really does depend on the indivdual. Although, I must admit I was a little nervous at first because of reading the side effects but I had the resistent type of staff infection and this was one drug that the infection was sensitive too, so I took the drug and it was pivitol medication in clearing the infection.
