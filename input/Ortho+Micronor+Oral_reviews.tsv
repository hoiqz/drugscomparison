Birth Control	KellyGirl0907, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/3/2012 10:21:09 AM	I was originally using the combination bc pill, but after some chest pains and other problems, my doctor suggested this pill. I love it! No bad side effects, no weight gain, acne, or any of the problems others have listed. It has less side effects for me than with the combination pill. The combination pill would make me sort of moody, and I felt it decreased my sex drive also. None of this with the mini-pill.My period does last about a day longer than usual, but that's fine with me. My periods aren't heavier and I don't get spotting. I Just use a cell phone alarm to remind me to take it each day. 
Birth Control	tigger, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	8/17/2012 1:39:36 PM	I was on this for 45 days. Had to stop because I felt like I was having a stroke. It messed up my heart rate, waves of numbness and tingling thoughout my arms, legs, hands and feet. Random nausea which has not stopped, dizziness, severe calf pain that was hot, varicose veins appearing in less than a month, no period, severe anxiety, severe mood swings. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!! 
Birth Control	Amy101 , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/12/2012 9:49:25 AM	I started this pill last month as I thought it would be better than the combination pill because the less things you put in your system the better. Well let's just say I'm with one girl I saw post she could'nt wait to go on her old bc pill, than God I've still got repeats left on my Triquilar I'll take that any day over this. I never had many side effect but the ones I've had have been enough to make me decide this is NOT the pill for me and the Triquilar agreed with me better. I've been lethargically tired since starting this pill &amp; it's only been since I started it, and I have really bad body aches in my legs all the time, I think I now know what it feels like for an elderly person to try to get around when they're in pain. I also have had really bad cramping with my cycle this month &amp; I have'nt experience cramps like that since I went on the pill at 17 to help with the cramping in the first place.  I have'nt had weight gain or acne as many girls said they've had but I don't want to wait to see if I do either, the side effects I have had have been enough for me. Being a nurse I know that everyone reacts to meds differently and I'm sure that this is a great birth control pill for some ladies but definitely not for me, I am gladly going back to my combination pill today because I can't handle the tiredness and achyness constantly 
Birth Control	shan0812, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	19-24	6/24/2012 11:08:38 AM	I started this pill after my postpartum checkup after having my second child last year...I hated having to take it at the same time, I could never find a good time without forgetting or taking it late because I am very busy with two kids and appointments and school. I had to get this particular pill because I was breastfeeding and the depo caused me to gain weight and make my periods irregular. Before taking this pill I lost all my pregnancy weight and got down to my pre pregnancy weight. After weighing in for my yearly physical a couple of days ago I was 30 pounds over my pregnancy weight and I did notice that I had horrible mood swings. And the doctor just informed me that the same hormone that is in the depo shot is the same one that is in these pills, so it kind of explained to the weight gain and it became clear as to why when I tried to diet I could lose nothing but a pound. It's just not made for my body. So now I am put on Ortho Tri Cyclen and I will see how it goes, but I am very confident. The plus side to Ortho Micronor was that I had one period and it lasted 3 days and was very light. No periods, and I will miss that about this pill, but I will not miss the weight gain and mood swings. Just because it was horrible on my body does not mean it will be on everyone else's. I hope others have a good experience with this pill. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	5	1	Female	25-34	5/20/2012 2:21:12 PM	I have been on it for about 2 weeks now and I don't like it at all. I started taking it right after my period was over and guess what, I have my period again. I am moody, cry at the drop of a hat and get mad for no reason at all. I am stopping because I can't live like this. My poor husband o and my depression is back and in full full swing where I had it under control before.
Other	CarrieAnn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/9/2012 10:32:39 PM	I've been taking Ortho-micronor for a little over 5 years. I'm 43 with an 11-year-old son. My main reason for taking this is to regulate my period and lessen a heavy flow which began around 2004. I researched this pill online and my ob-gyn agreed to let me try it out. I haven't had any of the side effects that previous reviewers have mentioned. The only difference I noticed (after maybe 3 months on it) was an increase in my libido. Once in a while, I'll have in-between spotting or a missed period, but nothing dramatic. My flow is much lighter, also.   I've recently switched to the generic Jolivette because my husband now works for Watson, their manufacturer. Hopefully, I'll have the same positive results.

He says he told me to do the 90 days on, one week off from the beginning, but I do not remember that.  I am very hesitant to stop and restart this pill for fear of pregnancy.  Also, it has never stopped my periods for more than 4 weeks, my blood pressure has always been fine - why do I need to be on this pill??  Dr said it helps prevent blot clots and this is the only reason he gave me.  I have gained about 25 lbs in the last year also.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/9/2012 10:37:23 AM	i started this after birth of third child and since i'm nursing him it is safer. I have not had one period since on it and i know i'm not preg. I like it. I have missed one and still does the job of protecting me.

I do not,like it at all, i have gained 8 pounds, i have no idea when or if im going to have a period i have only had one since i started taking them.Also, i have headaches everyday, and am very moody. I HATE THEM.
Other	MJBake, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	45-54	1/6/2012 8:39:30 PM	This BC was perscribed after many,man years of heavy periods, fatigue due to iron deficiency, clotting and unnecessary weight gain.  I had to switch OBGYN's prior to have it perscried to me. I have felt the side effects as described by others...At the present time with the threat of the alternative, I have not intention of stopping. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	12/18/2011 10:45:58 PM	I haven't really had too many negative side effects on this drug. Haven't experienced any nausea, cramping or mood swings. However, when I first started taking it, I spotted for about a week and then started my period right after for a week and a half with very, very heavy bleeding. I just started my six month and it's doing its job by keeping me from getting pregnant, but it's really messing with my menstrual cycle. I used to take Loestrin 24, but then stopped for a while. One day, at the dr's my blood pressure reading was high and I got put on orthomicronor. Dr. told me it would keep me from getting pregnant and wouldn't mess too much with my blood pressure, but it wouldn't necessarily regulate my period. Since the second month, I've been having periods that lasts for about a week, every week and a half or so. Very annoying.

Birth Control	Nikkia , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	10/26/2011 4:47:47 PM	Hi I'm a 29 year old mother of two and have been on birth control since the age of 13 to help with painful menstrual cycles. For the last 11 years I have had normal periods with out pain lasting up to 3 days but not any more. This is my second month on Ortho Micronor and I hate this pill. My new doctor gave me this pill because my blood pressure was higher than normal on d day of my the visit. Since starting this pill I have had  horrible cramps and irregular bleeding. I've been taking the pill everyday like I suppose to now I've been bleeding since day 7 now I'm on day 13. Today was my last day taking this pill after reading all d bad reviews.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	4	5	Female	19-24	10/23/2011 4:57:51 PM	I am a healthy, active, college student, and I have experienced no negative side effects from this drug. I was scared to start it because so many other users gave it bad reviews, but I've been on it for 3 months and I've had no bad side effects at all, and I'm also not pregnant so the pill seems to be working correctly. Micronor hasn't changed my moods or made me gain weight. The only noticeable change has been my breast size. Within the first month of taking Micronor, my bra size increased from a C to a D. I use condoms with Micronor to be extra safe, since it is not quite as effective at preventing pregnancy as other birth control pills. 
Birth Control	mk, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	9/14/2011 1:17:16 PM	I have been taking Ortho Micronor for about 6 months now. At first I was told that it would lessen or even stop my periods, which I wanted. However,  its done the exact opposite! I've gotten it 4 times in the past 5 weeks, so I'm switching bc today.

At first the bleeding was light and spotty, and then i was bleeding like a regular period for 3 or 4 days. went back to spotting and now i am on my 3rd day of bleeding heavily again. I am very displeased with this BC and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Can't wait until i can start something different.
Birth Control	Mama2, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	7/28/2011 1:56:05 PM	I have used this pill for the last three years. I used it for a few months right after my son was born, because it is safer to take while breastfeeding. I was anxious about taking any kind of hormone pill, but have had a good experience with this one. The only complaint I have is that it causes me to have more acne than I would with out it, but it makes my periods shorter, less painful, and less frequent. One thing that isn't ideal about it is breakthrough bleeding and spotting, but I think that is made up for by the fact that it keeps me from getting pregnant, dying of cramps, and as one other user mentioned, it actually appears to help me stay very very thin. I recommend this method for girls all the time. The lack of estrogen has many benefits, and works for someone who doesn't weigh very much, and who smokes.
Birth Control	michele, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	5/30/2011 10:51:27 PM	i have went through close to ten different brands of the pill. I started micronor about four months ago. When i first started this pill i had break through bleeding then a week later i got my normal period. All through my period life i have NEVER got cramps. But taking micronor i now get cramps that curl me up into fetal position, and i'm constipated so i have to take a fiber supplement now. Not to mention that i miscarried while taking this pill. I take it at the same time every day and i have NEVER missed a pill. It just goes to show it's not 100%. And i've always got headaches here and there, but since being on micronor i have headaches everyday and migranes 1 to 4 times a week. I had a black spot show up in my vision because of this. I wouldn't reccommend micronor!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	5/6/2011 4:00:24 PM	I have been on about 7 different b.control methods in the past 9 yrs and 3 in the past 2 since i had my son in 09.i had to switch pills to this one cuz the one that i was on before this was giving me too much estrogen n was making my body think it was in menopause.ive only been on it a few weeks but i had a reg period for the 1st time in my life and it wasnt nearly as painful as it used to be.i would highly reccomend this pill to anybody that has had cerviacal cancer cuz i had it for 6 long years and was finally cured from it.i set my alarm &amp; it has made me a lot less sick and mood swings are very managable most of the time like i said i have a 2yo litle boy that i have full time.i believe this isnt for every1 but i love it.i have also lost weight but that has to do partly w/ other health problems

I have also been very emotional and crying at almost everything. I had a period that lasted two and a half weeks. I admit it eased the pain of the cramps but in doing so, it made my period longer.

I got my period a week early and bled longer than i ever have and i spotted for nearly a week after. I have just now, out of the blue started my period AGAIN and its only been 2 weeks!! I am infuriated. I have been moodier than ever in my life, I cry at everything and want to bite people's heads off for no reason. I started the pill to help with cramping but had to switch to this one because of possible high blood pressure. I am going to the doctor tomorrow and demanding my old pill because i cannot live like this. 
Other	LAKulin,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	4	4	3	Female		1/22/2011 7:47:59 PM	My two daughters, 18 and 16, are both taking this for cycle regulation/control of flow.  What i find strange is that initially they both gained some weight but then after taking it for awhile, they both lost between 8-10 pounds.  The doctor made fun of me for trying to attribute the weight loss to this pill since they usually are responsible for massive weight gains... I can't really find any other information relative to this weight loss and Micronor other than this site.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	1/18/2011 1:47:30 PM	Actually, this is my second time on this drug.  I was on it the first time several months after giving birth.  I took it for a few months, then had the Mirena placed.  After starting the drug, I dropped a lot of weight.  I recently went on the drug again to try to regulate my periods and once again, I have dropped, so far, 8 lbs in 3-4 months.  Otherwise, I do experience moodiness, but I don't know that it is worse than what I had prior to the drug.  I do still have a period every 24 to 28 days.  I can only attribute the weightloss to this birth control.  There is no other explanation.  I wondered if anyone else experienced this?

Then nothing, no period. No pregnancy, but no period either. I have my partner in charge of alerting me to take the pill, to get him involved in the process.

Headaches every day along with blurred vision so bad i had my prescription adjusted on my glasses. Glad I decided to read these reviews I thought my vision was going bad.

Birth Control	geena, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	19-24	9/3/2010 3:43:50 PM	I haven't been on this pill for very long, just a few weeks, but it's going good so far.  I had trouble with combination pills causing headaches and migraines, but since I've been on this pill I've just had a few minor headaches, which is normal for me.  I haven't had any nausea, another issue I had with combo pills, and my mood has been normal.  I don't know about weight gain since I haven't been on it very long.  My only problem is I can't remember to take it at the same time each day, so I can't rely on it to prevent pregnancy.  But, I'm only planning to be on this temporarily anyway until I can get Implanon.

I had to take it because anything with estrogen could interfere with my SSRI. It's a pretty good pill, I had no side effects for the two months I made it...EXCEPT...Migranes! Horrid migranes that never stop and keep me from playing my violin, singing, watching TV, attending college, and everything I need to do! I'm a busy person, and I HATE HATE HATE migraines. They're horrid. I'm not sure if it's my bc or my SSRI, so don't give up hope! This pill is great most of the time.

Soon I found myself crying for no reason and having crazy mood swings. I get mad at every little thing. My periods are a lot heavier now than they were before I went on this pill. I would only recomend this pill if it was a persons only option. I plan on switching pills the next time I go to my doctor.

After about 5 days on this pill I woke up in the middle of the night with severe cramping &amp; bleeding.  The bleeding was so bad that I couldn't even make it to the bathroom without bleeding thru my tampon &amp; over night pad - I bled all over my bathroom floor.  This continued for 2-3 weeks after 2 ER trips they finally figured out that it was my birth control that was making me lose to much blood.  It made me become anemic after being on it for a week &amp; half.  My doctor told me to &quot;stick with it, its NORMAL!&quot;   I always had extreme neck pain, headaches, cramping, mood swings, tired.  I wouldn't recommend this pill to no body, I was living off of IBUPROFEN,and estradiol along with my birth control which still didn't help. Oh! My bleeding was so bad that I was going thru an &quot;overnight&quot; pad &amp; a &quot;super plus&quot; tampon within an hour sitting down, standing up I would go thru them within 20 mins.  I couldn't play w/ my 2 yr old son- It was HORRIBLE! I hated the experience that I went through on this pill...

It's better than any other BC i've been on no nausea, vomiting, ect. but i worry all the time about getting pregnant cause i don't get my period, i did a test and it came back negative. i have to set an alarm to remind me to take it everyday that's kind of a pain. but overall i like it.

Understandably, the side effects of pregnancy, as stated by another post, and the side effects of this birth control are similar - because the ingredients in this pill trick your endocrine system and the rest of your body into thinking it is pregnant. Hence, no ovulation and thus, no periods. Breast feeding does the same thing. SO when a Gyn tells you to take this BC and breastfeed together, that is because they have a good reason and authority to beleive that, for a majority of women, the combination is like a double barrier of pregnancy protection. Some womens bodies may not be able to handle it, but a majority can. I, myself was a little worried for a second about not having ANY period at all. I figured there would be at least something - but I am going on 8 months post partum with not one period, and after seeing other women having the same effect and the Dr telling me it is normal, I otherwise have no complaints! No side effects, no pregnancy, no nothing! If you are a typical healthy woman with no thyroid/hormonal/reproductive issues, I would DEFINITELY recommend this pill!!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	10/19/2009 11:02:35 AM	I had been taking ortho tri-cycln BC for almost 7 years with no problems and due to a high blood pressure reading, was switched to ortho micronor. It's been 3 months and so far I'm very unsatisfied. At first, I had some mood changes and slight depression which I had anticipated with the switch. Now I've been having VERY SEVERE headaches for days at a time. I'd go to bed with it and wake up to it. The headaches were also accompanied by changes in vision, sometimes to the point where it hurt to watch T.V., read, or look at really anything. After reading some of these other reviews, I don't think I would recommend this pill to anyone.

Birth Control	Jos, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/17/2009 11:21:09 AM	I started taking this when my son was 7 weeks old.  He is now two ad I have been done breastfeeding for almost 5 months.  I opted to keep taking this for my BC method as it has been great for me.  My only &quot;side effect&quot; has been fatigue, but then, I have a 2 year old and a 5 year old, a husband and a full time job, so it may not be the pill's fault.I am trying to decide if I want to switch to the NuvaRing this month for a two month trial.  I am scared of side effects from a combined method and also, the increase in hormones.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it, you know?  That's how I feel about this pill, however, not having to take a pill each day would be a noce change.In short-I have had no wieght gain, in fact, I am underweight and 10 pounds below my pre pregnancy wieght no matter what I eat, and no excercise (no time!), no acne, no bloating, no hair loss.I do have mood swings, but again, I do not get enough sleep and have the usual stresses of a working mom/wife.I also agree with the poster who mentioned that when breastfeeding, no you will not get a period most of the time, also, post partum hair loss is common, and not a pill side effect.I did spot an awful lot in the beginning of taking this pill.  It evened out and I am now very regular with no spotting between cycles.  Don't judge your body's reaction to this pill on the first 1-6 months of use, ESPECIALLY if you have just delivered a baby!  Most changes with your body are a result of the pregnancy and birth!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	9/15/2009 10:14:31 PM	I started taking this pill 6 weeks postpartum because my doc told me it was the best pill to take while breastfeeding.  At 4 months postpartum I haven't had a period yet. I've never used any type of oral contraceptive before so no period may be &quot;normal&quot; for my situation.  I have also noticed ALOT of thick discharge, occational headaches, and dizziness.  These could all be signs of pregnancy but I've taken a test and the results were negative.  I actually miss having a period because if my cycle was normal I wouldn't have to worry about being pregnant every other day! Also, I'm not a HUGE fan of setting an alarm to take a pill at 26 years old!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	6/14/2009 7:13:39 PM	After experiencing terrible side effects from other pills, my doctor put me on ortho-micronor. I have now been taking it for 3 years. I have never experienced any negative side effects from it. I have not gotten a period in over 2 1/2 years, and I don't miss it at all! My GYN assures me everything is normal and healthy with my body. I do not use another form of birth control and have not gotten pregnant.
Birth Control	cleejones, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	35-44	6/3/2009 1:06:05 AM	I have had spotting once a month for the six months that I have been taking it orally. I have had two periods with noteworthy cramping. The first time that I experienced SEVERE cramping was April 28th and the second May 28th. My symptoms were: Stabbing uterine cramps through the vaginal opening along with difficulty breathing/speaking which lasted almost 30 min. and the second May 28th lasted approx. 20 min. Thank goodness my boyfriend got a heat pad for me both times as I was unable to move while writhing in pain.

Birth Control	Ohio girl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	1/31/2009 10:39:18 AM	I was given Ortho Micronor after having my child.  My OBGYN said that it was &quot;safe&quot; to use wile nursing.  Well 3 and a half years later I am still trying to find balance in my hormones. I experienced every negative side effect this drug has to offer: rapid weight gain, swelling, head aches, dizzy spells, tiredness, mood swings, and cramping.  However, non of this took place until after I had been on the medicine for over a year. Once I stopped nursing, the pill messed up my hormone balance.     
Birth Control	13-18 Female 	4	2	4	Female	13-18	1/29/2009 1:32:22 PM	I switched to this birth control because i was on the patch and had horrible side effects. I don't have any side effects. My periods aren't regular but i still have them, but i am not as moody as i was on the patch i don't get the migraines i did with the patch. The only major issue I've found is that it is very hard to take it on time everyday, but so far i am not pregnant. But not every birth control is right for everyone.
Birth Control	momx3, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	1/8/2009 12:26:38 AM	I was on another type of birth control but it was giving me problems, so my doctor put me on this one. I have been on it for 5 months now. I took it every day at the same time, never once missed a pill or took it late. I did not get my period, which I knew was possible, soI took a home pregnancy test as a normal reaction, turns out I was pregnant. Three days later I miscarried. 
Birth Control	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	45-54	10/17/2008 12:00:29 PM	I find it very difficult to take this pill on time every day. I have had severe hot flashes and I'm experincing hot flashes.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	10/2/2008 10:38:45 PM	had a few more headaches, and moody when initially started then it settled down after about 6 wks. Now feel way better; and in conjunction with breastfeeding have had no period, break through bleeding or paid or cramps. 
Birth Control	msmicka28, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	9/6/2008 10:01:53 PM	I have emdometroisis and have been on many forms of birth control.  My doctor put me on this because I also get bad headaches and she thought this type of pill would be better.  I HATE THIS PILL.  2 weeks into it i have break through bleeding that lasted four days and had cramps like a period.  2 weeks after that my real period came and it was heavy and I still have horrible cramps. I have gained at least 5 pounds and it has only been one month.  My doctor says this is normal and I will give these pill one more mounth because I could not get a appointment in time to change before the pack was over.  So maybe it will get better because this pill sucks and I can't wait to go back to my old pills.  i got headaches but at least I was not getting 2 periods at once and my cramps were not this bad and my periods were not this heavey.  So to all the lady's this pill has worked for God bless you because it just does not work for me.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/31/2008 6:02:51 PM	I took this birthcontrol because I was breastfeeding my son. I have never had any of the side effects that are listed. I have been breastfeeding for 13 months now and I have even forgotten to take a pill or 2 and I am not pregnant yet. Because I was breastfeeding and taking the pill I did not get my period for 12 months. I recently started it again because my son is not nursing as much. I am very happy with my experience and will use it after I have another child! By the way, a reviewer on here said she was breastfeeding and taking the pill and didnt get her period which is because of the pill. That is a normal result for breastfeeding/pill combo. Also she lost hair. Within the first 5 months postpardom you will loose hair like crazy. Look it up on the internet because this too is normal also!! Hope this helps any people thinking of taking this pill. I know many people who have successfully taken this BC.

I do not have periods, heavy bleeding or debilitating cramps anymore.  I feel a more even hormonal mood and seem to have less incontinence while taking this pill.  It seems to be a great match for my symptoms.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	5/10/2008 3:27:49 AM	I have taken this pill in the past when I breastfeed my other two children. Now with my infant son taking this and breastfeeding  I have alot of the side affects. Lose of hair, headaches sometimes so severe I feel sick, abdominal pain/cramping, no period, moody. I cannot say do not take this you will never know until you try it. I will say this though be cautious when taking this pill. If I had more choices for breastfeeding and taking the pill I would not use this one again.

Took combined pills and gained 8lbs, plus so many other side effects.  Have had any problems with Micronor.  Feel a lot better since taking it.  
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	3/28/2008 11:16:25 AM	My doctor put me on this pill just after having a baby.The Dr. told me that I could not get pregnant on Ortho Micronor and breastfeeding at the same time. Now my baby is six months old and now I am pregnant again.  I have been taking the pill and I did not miss any pills.  So no this birth control did not work for me.
Birth Control	zanne1981, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	1/3/2008 12:00:35 AM	went two months without period, had all the symptoms of being pregnant, finally started period and it was severe. Severe cramping, extremely heavy bleeding, soaking pads and tampons, together. Doctor never told me of these side effects before I started taking this pill. Had to research and find out that the symptoms of pregnancy were side effects of this pill. Would not recommend this pill to anyone.
