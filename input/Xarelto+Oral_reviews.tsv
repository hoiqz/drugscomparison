Prevent Blood Clot with Fast Irregular Heart Rate	frostyblue, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male		9/10/2012 8:18:05 AM	Have been on Xarelto since Aug. 23, 2012.  Now have red stools and water in toilet is red.  Hemocult is negative for blood in stool. Had A-fib and shock treatment so that part is ok now; but am at a loss in finding a physician who will listen to me.  I am 88 and have read the reviews above and having second thoughts about taking it.  I need to hear from others about the stool problem, unless I am the only one.

I was never on Pradaxa. My cardiologist quit using it because of stomach issues. I was on aspirin and had a lot of stomach problems on it. These have gone away since being on Xarelto...no heartburn.

I have been on Xarelto for about 3 months and heartburn is starting.  Anyone else have heartburn or gastro problems?

Xarelto warns that anyone over 75 has an increased risk of bleeding. I would question the physician who started an 87 year old woman on this drug. Coumadin is a nasty drug but safer  for those over 75. I am on Xarelto and am 65. My doctors are diligent about checking my hemoglobin, creatinine(kidney) every 6 weeks.  I have had no problems. If anything my blood pressure is a bit higher but was too low in the past.

After taking it for 3 1/2 months she complained of severe hip pain and could not walk.  We thought she might have a spontaneous hip fracture related to osteoporosis with no outward signs of bruising.  It turned out that she had a very large spontaneous hematoma in her hip muscle due to Xarelto use.  This has caused a domino of other health problems related to the need to stop her blood pressure meds and beta blocker due to low vital signs.  She needed a blood transfusion with Hemoglobin down to 7.5. She has been hospitalized now for 9 days and may go home in a few more. She has bruising now from buttocks to lower knee and pain and swelling in the entire leg. We almost lost her, but she seems to have just begun to improve. The  convenience of Xarelto does not warrant the risk.

For the first 2 weeks I had no side effects but the longer I stay on it the more I have noticed that I am exhibiting symptoms I have never had. I am having muscle spasms around my eyes and eyelids. I have seen an opthalmologist and all is fine but they continue and are very annoying. I see that a side effect of this drug is muscle spasms. Also, I am itching around my torso, back and scalp.  I have never had this either. And, my joints hurt and I get spells when I feel very weak no matter how much sleep I get. I cannot get up enough energy to exercise as I have done in the past. I guess these are not life-threatening but they do impact quality of life. I am considering a switch to Coumadin. I will not take Pradaxa because of its tendency to cause GI upset as well as chest pain.

Other	Jormungandr, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	4/9/2012 5:07:51 PM	Taking Xarelto instead of Warfarin after DVT and PE. Vastly less awful than Warfarin: consistent dosing, I  don't need to worry about coffee, beer or spices. Seems to be somewhat more effective as well, at least for me. I have not had a CT scan in awhile, but the continual chest pain I had has disappeared and I can sustain somewhat more activity without having to stop to catch my breath.
Other	alisyn3ee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/5/2012 11:11:01 PM	Taking it because I've had a stroke &amp; have afib.I have hypertension along with past strokes,tia mini stroke in 09 &amp; stroke in eyes in 2011 which damaged the optic nerve in my left eye,from taking PRADAXA).Xarelto thus far is working better for me I've been on it since Dec.2011.My Cardiologist told me I must stay on it for my lifetime due to risk factors for another stroke or heart attack due to hypertension.Thus far no side effects.He told me if I start bleeding I must call his office immediately &amp; get to the hospital because there's no antidote to counteract the medication,it stays in your body 24 hours after taking one pill.That's the scary thing about taking this blood thinner.Also I must have blood work every three months to check on my kidneys &amp; liver due to the effect it can have on them.I'm so thankful I have such a caring Cardiologist and electrophysicologist.I had ablation of the atrial flutter June of 2011.Was on Multaq until March 27,2012 Praying my heart stays in normal sinus rhythm.I have an ascending aorta aneursym 3.4cm.in 06 it was 3.7cm.

Other	Ray, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	3/9/2012 3:54:49 PM	I was prescribed Xarelto but haven't started taking it because I read that if you start taking it, then stop, yoiu are at even GREATER risk of a stroke.  Why doesn't WebMd mention this in the Warnings section?
