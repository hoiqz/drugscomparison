Within 10 days of taking this medication, I developed pnuemonia, which was probably in the works to begin with. I was satisifed with the medication, but it does not treat the symptoms of pneumonia.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/14/2008 9:50:24 PM	Had bad sinus infection i took one pill and it was cleared. Does make you feel like you have taken a caffeine pill but if you eat with it you should feel slight side effects. I highly recommend this medication just be sure to eat with it.
Other	GameDemo, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	2	Male	35-44	7/17/2008 2:06:17 PM	I would get regular sinus infections.  I hated taken antibiotics.  Dr. put me on this, worked great.  It would stop sinus infection at sore throat.  But after about 3 months of use as needed, one day I woke up with a retinal vein occlusion (blood on retinal).  I don't smoke, drink, under weight... so I don't know if it caused it but scared the @#$@# out of me.  It worked great but now I am really really nervous about taken it, still hoping RVO. improves.

Stuffy Nose	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	19-24	4/17/2008 9:48:55 AM	I had a very stuffy nose. After the first 24 hours, I was feeling better, but was hesitant to take then next dose. Woke up @ 4am, every monring on this med, feeling anxious, nervosue and sick to my stomache. It did what i needed it to, butthe side effects were horrible. I felt like I was on caffein pills.
Runny Nose	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	4/5/2008 2:08:09 PM	I had almost all of the side effects listed with this drug and I have never be alergic to any drugs before. My heartbeat was really fast my and I felt anxious. My hands were cold and clammy but I was sweaty almost everywhere else and it took me forever to fall asleep. However, I could breathe better through my nose but it was not nearly worth all the other things I went through. I will never take this drug again.
Stuffy Nose	snugglespa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/29/2008 9:18:15 AM	I have been having problems with a stuffy nose at night and could not sleep because I could not breath. I tried nose sprays but got hooked and started to ruin my membranes in my nose. The doctor put me on this medication and the very first night I was amazed at how it cleared my nose right up. I used it for the 18 days I was suppose to and after that I have not had a stuffy nose again. I have not had to spray or use anything else since. I highly recommend it.
Runny Nose	cynthiajames, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/11/2008 7:34:40 PM	I took this med after being diagnosed with a sinus infection- I felt better after the first pill. I finally got sleep after a runny nose kept me up for days. Sudefed doesn't even come close to the effectiveness of this drug. Highly recommend trying this med, especially if you are so fed up with your nose that you don't care that you'll be a little jittery and anxious. Actually the drug gave me the energy to make it through the day. The drug can be a tad bit addictive though, I recently had a cold and pulled out the pseudovent-it cured my cold after one use. I know you aren't supposed to keep meds but when you are sick and miserable you'll do anything to feel better, and it worked!

It works for prescribed condition.
Inflammation of the Nose		4	5	4			2/2/2008 5:23:15 PM	I had to drink a lot of water with this drug, but it worked as it was supposed to. I have a sinus/ear infection and it really helped my head.

Other	Akasha129, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	1/20/2008 9:59:08 AM	I was prescribed this for congestion w/a sinus infection.  I could only tolerate it for about two days. It does dry up your sinuses, but it made my mouth really dry as well, and it made me very anxious and just 'hypersensitive'.  I couldn't sleep the two nights I was on it, so I just stopped taking it, and took plain OTC sudafed instead.  It's not as effect, but the side effects aren't as bad...

Cold Symptoms		4	5	4			1/3/2008 9:44:08 AM	It definitely does what it is supposed to. It has worked pretty well for me. It just gave me a slight dizzy, detached feeling shortly after taking it, which subsided appx. 30 minutes later.
