I seem to retain instead of eliminate digoxin from my system.  While I was taking the medication I had to constantly watch for signs of toxicity.  I was extremely fatigue, had headaches, mood swings and libido issues.  My cardiologist finally took me off digoxin and put me on another medication.  If digoxin works for you I would certainly use it but when it doesn't agree with one it can be a nightmare.

I've had one main side effect in my cognitive functioning, but that's probably something to do with blood or circulation changes (and the affect the med has had on the heart). This side effect has been life altering (especially completing my master's degree program), but the Digoxin keeps me in rhythm.
