Asthma	gpalace85, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/11/2012 1:55:06 AM	I had been taking this inhaler for about 30 years and never had a problem with my asthma. Now they recomend albutoral... sorry but this does not work as effectively as primetine...So why was it taken off the market again??? the real reason???????
Asthma Prevention	QDonDuty, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/1/2012 4:45:50 PM	I find that this drug works very quickly when feeling like an Asthma attack is about to happen and also when I have had an attact 2  inhales and I am breathing normaland can get back to my normal routine.

Where is the mind of the FD.           WHY DON'T THEY BAN MSG...... IT DOES MORE HARM TO PEOPLE. I FORGOT THE NAME OF THE GAME IS MONEY. NOT BENEFIT TO PEOPLE WITH ALLERGIC INDUCED ASTHMA!

Plus i need less during day. Now i fear i will die from attack if i cant get to store in time if i run out of ventoline. Lose much more sleep. This is nuts they took off shelves....
Asthma	cheryl, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/15/2012 12:52:31 PM	I have used &quot;VENTLIN&quot; for over 40 years.  I recently was at my son's without my inhaler when I had an asthma attack.  He gave me his Primatene mist to use... WOW !!WORKED INSTANTLY !!!   I went to the drug store and bought 2 of them.  I found that I didn't need to use the inhaler as much as I did with the Ventilin.  I was constantly sucking on the Ventilin... but, with the Primatene... one shot lasted ALL DAY !!!  Now the gov. has taken it away !! WHAT A RIP OFF !!!!   BRING BACK THE PRIMATENE MIST.... IN IT'S ORIGINAL FORM !!!

Asthma	TyneIrish, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/1/2012 8:45:28 AM	I loved this stuff. I would run out of my prescription in 2 weeks because it wasn't as effective. Not to mention my script was getting expensive with loosing my insurance. This OTC worked really well and really fast. It was nice to be able to get it anytime because the pharmacy around here isn't a 24 hour one and I couldn't always get my script refilled when I NEEDED it. Primatene was a life saver in emergancies and it seemed to keep my asthma under control. I didn't have attacks as often.
Asthma Prevention	mccuney, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	11/20/2011 8:41:13 PM	I am 57 and have been using this medicine sine I was 11 years old. The only time I ever had an ashtma attack was when I was on a prescribed asthman medicine given to me by a pulminary respiratory specialist. Hwe then decided that primetine was better for me had nme return to primetine mist. It is a life saver. A lot of kids and adults are going to lose their life if this is taken off the market. Heaven forbid.

Asthma Attack	Bruce, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male		8/12/2011 12:18:18 PM	I used Primatene Mist for 10 years for occasional asthma attacks.  It was always effective, although I used it infrequently because medical people gave me veiled warnings about it.  It is being withdrawn from the market in December 2011 because the CFC propellant interferes with the ozone layer and causes global warming.  I got a prescription to Albuterol sulfate inhalant.  Albuterol is not as strong as Primatene.  While Primatene takes effect in seconds, causing a brief cough and lingering feelings in the throat, Albuterol takes effect over 10 minutes and has no lingering throat feelings.  Both are effective long enough to get over my asthma attack, especially long enough for me to get a good night's sleep and feel refreshed in the morning.  I am pleased with Albuterol as a replacement for Primatene.

Asthma Attack	Michelle22, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/23/2011 12:26:43 AM	I have been using Primatene Mist for about 3 years.  I have allergy related asthma.  I only use it when I have an attack which is not very often and don't know what I would do with out it!  I can't afford health insurance so being able to purchase this over the counter instead of paying for a doctors visit (which is what i used to do) has helped in so many ways.

There are many other sprays that could be removed from the market without interfering with  one's health.  Government is getting more and more ridiculous!Jack HardinOrlando, FL
Wheezing		5	5	5			10/19/2010 9:14:12 PM	Sometimes I have weezing problems at night along with overall breathing problems and this product really did solve the problem right away. I thought there might be something bad to say about an over-the-counter drug such as this, but nothing has come around and I use it frequently with no problems.
Asthma	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/5/2010 10:44:57 AM	As a Registered Respiratory Therapist, I am shocked beyond belief that WebMD would ever suggest using an OTC inhaler such as Primatene Mist for treating a condition as serious as asthma. If you are having problems breathing, or struggling with your asthma symptoms, you should contact your physician, got to the nearest er, or call 911. Primatene Mist is not something any qualified medical professional would ever recommend to treat or control asthma.

Asthma	ndhill, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	9/23/2009 1:09:44 AM	I take Primatene Mist only during intense exercise. I don't use this inhaler for daily use, but when I do, on a semi-weekly basis. It has always worked wonderfully. I get instant relief from breathing problems. While I probably should seek treatment from a professional, I currently do not have insurance and this $18 OTC inhaler has made ALL the difference for me. I get mine at Walgreens! I love it and sure hope they don't take it away!
Asthma Attack	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/16/2009 11:08:26 PM	Functional backup. The container is a bit bulky, but thank God it exists! It works and to an asthmatic in crises, that's all that matters. Most Pharmacies close and if you need it, you need it NOW! With the cost of prescription meds getting so outrageous, without this great OTC relief, emergency rooms will have to provide the lung opening service...probably at a loss.

I get severe allergic reactions to this Thunderbird-brand inhaler of the otc remedies. In fact, I believe they hold an otc monopoly since there is no other self-prescribed asthma relief. I will stick to the oprescribed medications and hopefully save a lung in doing sp. All I can recommend this product for is emergencies and as a filler to make methamphetimine. ion other words used is sparingly when needed, because in the ling run it will melt you lungs away.
Asthma	8XJ6YU, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/11/2008 6:37:19 PM	I  WAS DX WITH ASTHMA AS A CHILD, I AM NOW 46 YRS OLD. I HAVE FOUND NOTHING THAT HAS CONTROLED MY ASTHMA AS WELL AS THE PRIMATENE INHALER. I WORK AS AN RN IN A HOSPITAL SETTING AND I THINK AS A HEALTH CARE WORKER THAT  IF A PATIENT HAS USED A MEDICATION FOR A LONG TIME AND IT IS WORKING THEN JUST LEAVE THINGS ALONE.    I THINK THIS BANING OF PRIMATENE IS A SHAME AND IT IS MORE ABOUT MONEY THAN IT IS THE CARE OF PEOPLE THAT SUFFER WITH THIS PROBLEM.

Asthma Prevention	TVIS, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	5/16/2008 3:06:07 AM	i use to have bad asthma, so bad that a rescue inhaler would only last 2-3 weeks, when i got this product and started using it, i have NOT experienced a asthma attack in over 5 years like i use to. if i feel short of breath then one puff is enough, 1-2 puffs in the morning and i'm good all day. sometimes i do get the &quot;racy&quot; feeling when i use it.. most the time i don't. i recommend this as a backup and maybe if your up to it like me as a daily use..1 refill will last up to 6 months for me and i don't want to go back to the attacks and scary feeling from not knowing when ill have an attack or not being without my abut.
Asthma	Pattral, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/11/2008 11:10:56 PM	I have used Primatine Mist inhalers for over 35 years and find it a very effective treatment for my asthma, I know it not prefered by doctors but it works for me and I feel it is a safe product that does not have the steriods in it like a lot of the prescription inhalers they have out.I do not have any bad side effects from it, I have tried the Primatine Mist pills and they do give me the shakes and make my heart race badly so I do not take them at all.  I have had doctors prescribe things like Advair. Combivent, Albuteral &amp; Spireva when I go to them for an upper respirorty infection from time to time but all of these are very expensive and I do not ever feel the immidiate relief my Primatine Mist gives me.I was born with astma and after using it all these years my attacks do not come as ofen as they used to.

I try to only use one puff because my heart is more likely to race if I use two. Other than that, I've never had any side-effects.
