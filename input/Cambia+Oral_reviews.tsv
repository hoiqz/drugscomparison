Pain	kellykat2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	3/30/2012 10:05:07 AM	I used this for migraine.  It relieved the pain a little bit, however, later in the evening, I was hospitalized for Ischemic Colitis, which I attribute to the use of this drug. I was extremely sick and hospitalized for a week.Be very careful if you use this drug!!!

My doctor told me to mix it with cranberry juice and it tastes kind of minty. Ive been trying many different things over the past 3 years, and I think this is it. I just had my prescription filled so we'll see how it works.
Other	ashleyhi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	11/28/2011 9:33:51 PM	Given this medication to relive pain from migraines. Works great!! I have relief within 20 minutes of taking. It is a powder you must mix with water and take it like a shot. It tastes horrible, but by far the only pain reliever that actually relieves the pain caused by migraines.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	10/29/2011 12:51:09 PM	Prescribed for migraine. Powder to dissolve in water (tastes like black licorice---yuck!) must consume like a shot. Leaves residual odor on breath that may resemble adult beverage.  Provides absolutely no relief for migraine or cluster headache relief.
Pain	Neal, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/30/2011 7:31:37 PM	fastest migraine headache relief since Imitrex. Prefer not to use a &quot;triptan&quot;
Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	7/11/2011 1:17:28 PM	I've taken Cambia 4 times with very good results every time. After first 2 migraine meds were discont'd and being allergic to Imitrex, finding a good migraine medicine is great! 
Pain	Sarah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/20/2011 5:54:10 PM	This product works great! I found that Triptans, another form of migraine treatment, created too many side effects for me to handle. My doctor told me about CAMBIA and my life has changed! Before taking the drug I read user reviews on this website. Another comment mentioned the risks when taking a NSAID drug. This concerned me but I found that it is not against CAMBIA specifically, it's a general warning about all NSAID. I also found that NSAIDs are well accepted in the treatment of migraines and recommeded by the American Academy of Neurology! Im so glad I did my research! I will continue to use CAMBIA for my migraines!:)
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	4/8/2011 2:41:52 PM	I took Cambia on 2 seperate occasions.  It decreased my migraine pain, but did not take it away.  I still prefer Imitrex over any other medicine for the best Migraine relief.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/24/2011 2:03:00 PM	Worked in 20 minutes.  I felt like a different person!

I tried the drug 2x separate times with the same results.  I won't be using it again.
Other	Joe Hendel, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	10/13/2010 11:13:46 AM	Drug is diclofenac. It is is the most dangerous NSAID concerning heart related deaths. Google the American Heart Association Danish article. Stay away from this drug.
Pain	cb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	9/15/2010 12:42:41 PM	I am just starting on this drug as of 9/2010. I am looking forward to seeing how it works for neck pain due to spinal issues (2 surgeries since 2006).  Migraines and headaches every day since 19 yrs old.I'LL KEEP THIS UPDATED AS HOW THE USAGE IS DOING.
