I did leukapheresis, as my counts were 170's &amp; had a baby on board. After a bout with sepsis in February '06 and 11 days in hospital, my counts (thanks be to God and all glory to His Name) were NORMAL!!! About 2 months after giving birth, my counts began to creep up again &amp; I was put on the Gleevec. 400mg was too strong &amp; 300 was too weak, and so I'm on 350mg/day. I do have bouts of nausea and headaches, occasional diarrhea, once in a blue moon I get cramps in the legs. I've had no swelling or any other adverse reaction to this drug.I find that my nausea can be treated with Wintergreen LifeSavers (traditional peppermints don't work as well for me).

It's been a definite Godsend.  My blood counts went from an enormous and very scary high to a count that put relief and hope back in my life.  I can't say enough good things about this drug.  Some side effects, but nothing like being without taking it.  I had a great deal of problems getting insurance to pay for it. They kept rejecting saying that it was more cost effective to go with &quot;traditional&quot; methods.  I often wonder if others have had to battle the insurance companies in this form or any other to be able to receive this drug.  Since I don't know many others who are actually on this, I can't seem to find any answers on this.  In either case, I'm happy to report that this drug is doing just great and I don't think I could ask for more.  Very grateful to know its available for us.

Have been in full molecular remission since Feb 2007.  Could have bouts of nausea every time I take it, but have been taking Reglan with it and that, along with dr.'s approval of 6 days a week dosing, is not a problem.  Have constant diarreha.   At last visit, doctor said this will be a lifelong medication, but that's fine with me since it should give me a long life that I wouldn't have had without the Gleevec.

Major side effects is CHRONIC TIREDNESS and bouts with diarrhea.  the drug has saved my life.  I just wish I had even just a little more energy which would make me feel like I am really living. Living with extreme tiredness is very frustrating.

So far I am still getting good CT scans, without taking the medicine it would probably  come back within 6 months., it has been over 3 years. I have several side effects, swelling under eyes, shortens of breath, cramps in legs,hands feet or anywhere I have a muscle, but when I go to the cancer center I thank God that I am not taking chemo or radiation. I can deal with the side effects as long as it works. The medicine is very expensive, I could not afford to take it if I did not get assistance. So every day I count my blessing and thank God that I have just one more day to enjoy my family and friends.

Lots of side effects, including watery eyes and weight gain. But the weight gain is because of the amount of food we need to take before the medication to avoid the nausea and the vomiting. Eventually you'll overcome most of the side effects. Thanking God and Dr. Druker every single day.

I was in remission after a year of taking Gleevec. Side effects are mild. Some days I get nauseated, other days I don't. I have found pretzels help with the nausea. 
Type of Leukemia - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	6/29/2010 8:23:38 PM	I have been on gleevec for about 9 1/2 yrs. now.  Praise Jesus - I'm still here! It took 8 months for me to go into remission.  I am allergic to gleevec.  For the first 4 years or so I experienced diahrea instantly every time I took it - along with a feeling of weakness, nausa and tiredness (like low blood sugar).  Fortunately, I do not have these symptoms all the time now.  I developed neuropathy pain within 6 weeks- bone pain and muscle pain.  This is successfully managed with gabapentin.  I gained 60 lbs and now have sleep apnea and am now pre-diabetic.  Swelling around the eyes started early on - still there. I never expected to see age 53 after diagnosis and must say  I am blessed beyond belief!  Certainly, no one can say they enjoy the effects of CML and treatment but I truly am grateful for the time I've been given and how I the Lord has taught me to lean on HIM.  God is sooo good!  Gleevec is the tool the Lord used to keep me here... I praise HIM for it! I hope you do well with it.  God bless you all.. ~P

It seems to help if I take it right before I got to bed at night.

It saved my life. I was no longer tolerating the Interferon Alpha or the Hyadrea (after four debilitating years)and began entering the accelerated phase. With Gleevec there were some side effects, but only with the higher dose (800mg),like nausea,vomiting,tireness,weight gain, swelling, sensitivity to heat, and hair loss. These were minimized by reducing the dose to 600mg at day and dividing it(300mg morning and 300mg at night, taken with food). Most side effects are now gone, although I am still experiencing hair loss and kept the extra weight. Overall, I feel great. Eating a balanced diet and drinking plenty of fluids (water and natural fruit juices)also helps.

He will probably have to take this drug the rest of his life.

I started on Gleevec about 10 months ago. The worst side affect is the pain in my stomach and intestines - with a little diarrhea thrown in for luck! Ha! I also have a lot of trouble with blood vessels bursting in my eyes! Makes me look like a monster sometimes. I've had a little trouble with cramps, but haven't gained any weight. I REALLY wish they could do something about the gassy stomach!!! Blood counts are more or less normal. Sometimes, I get some dizzy spells, but the doctors don't think it's related to the drug. I'm not so sure! I'm an American who lives in England, so don't have to pay what sounds like outrageous money! Come on, Obama! Get that national health service going so I can come home!!

I am in a clinical trial, I began with 800 mg/l and reduced to 600 mg/l to reduce the pain I experienced.  I have all the side effects that are common with Gleevec.  I have found that a GOOD fiber supplyment will help with the dirrahea.  The dirrahea has cause me to have other surgeries.  I still do not have the energy that I once had, I am on pain and antidepressant medications. I am able to continue working, I have learned to take the good days as well as the bad and thank god I am still able to be productive.

Last year, 5 tumors redeveloped in liver plus more cancer in hip bones. PET scan after 1 month of treatment on this drug showed no cancer-only some scar tissue in liver where tumors had been. 6 months later I'm still taking 400 mg daily with few side effects... mild diarrhea, and some hives.

I have been on it for one year now and I did not experience any side effects other then nasuated if I did not eat when taking the drug.  After taking it for 9 months there was no changes but recently my cancer doctor increased the dosage from 400MG to 600MG as remission was only 82% when last checked but  two weeks ago it was .000l only in my blood. I will have a bone marrow next month to get a more accurate reading.  I too have suffered with diarreha on a occasion but with over the counter medicines this can be controlled. Over all I think this drug is a true miracle and well worth any side effects.

Fatigue is the worst side effect.  Muscle cramps a problem but SloMag (slow release magnesium supplement) has helped a lot.  The other (many!) side effects are a nuisance but better than the alternative.

I went into remission fairly quickly and remain so. The worst side effect for me was diarhea, but the side effects of Gleevec are nothing compared to interferon and it has never lowered my red or white counts below the normal range. I was always anemic on the interferon and got infections easily---a serious viral infection caused me brain damage; that's when I got off the interferon and went to the Gleevec trial. I am so grateful for this drug! My life is pretty normal.

It took a bit longer for me to achieve this, but once I did I have stayed there.  Few side effects--nausea if I take it without food, diarrhea, some aching bones, but generally I work full time, take care of my family and raise my boys.  Life is Sweet with this drug--I can't thank Dr Druker enough for inventing it.

It was removed intact in December 2007. I had minor side effects, diarreah, fatigue, gastro-intestinal discomfort. After surgery, I am taking 400 mg. pills for a year to prevent recurrence of tumor. Gleevec has worked well for me up to now. I recommend it for gastro intestinal stromal tumors.

My white count was over 200,000 when I was first diagnosed with CML. Within 3 weeks of taking the medication my white count dropped 90% with the only side effect being diarrhea. I am down to two tablets per day, the diarrhea is occasional and treated well with Immodium and my PH chromosome count is around 1%. If ever there was a miracle drug, this is it.

Been in molecular remission for a few years now. Most of the side effects come and go although I have a HUGE issue with muscle cramps/spams in my extremeties. There are times I can't even sign my name because my fingers cramp so much. Consdiering the alternative, I'll live with the cramping!

I am in remission and doing well. I sort of look like a raccoon sometimes because of side effects effecting my eyes.  Pain, watering etc.  Still some vomiting from time to time but, all in all I am doing great, am able to take hikes, walk the dog and enjoy family and friends.  I feel lucky that I have this medication and wonderful medical support.

Your white blood count will eventually get very low and you might get sick with a cold or worsre so you may have to stay away from the general public so you don't catch any thing worse.  This may be a major concern.
