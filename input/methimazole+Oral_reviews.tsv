Overactive Thyroid Gland	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/1/2012 10:38:03 PM	I was diagnosed as mildly hyperthyroid, but very symptomatic.  Taking 20mg of generic methimazole once a day for 6 weeks did not make my levels improve, so my endo doubled the dose for 4 weeks and I split the dose, taking 20mg twice a day.  My levels improved and are close to normal.  Now down to 20mg morning and 10mg at night, with a re-check scheduled 4 wks out.  Still taking a beta blocker for some of the hyper symptoms, but I can tell I'm getting back in balance.  No noticeable side effects, no interference with any other meds I try to take.  The pills are very powdery, making it almost impossible to avoid tasting either the pill or the residue - which is unfortunate because it tastes like poison; this is totally worth it, but just had to mention.  As an added bonus, this is available pretty cheaply.  Overall, this is convenient and has been effective. The results aren't instant and require constant tweaking, but that is the nature of the thyroid so I can't blame the medicine.

Overactive Thyroid Gland	Diseasefree, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	2/23/2012 12:29:36 AM	I have been diagnosed hyperthyroidism and grave disease 6months ago. My first endo prescribed Mthimazole 10mg 4x daily. After taking it for two weeks, my blood results came out less hyper, my second endo asked me to take 3x daily. After having taking the med for 2 months, my next blood results came out that I am hypo. My endo said I was very low and needed to stop taking the med for one month. I had a blood drawn after one month for not taking any med, my thyroid hormone went up, slightly above the normal range. Now, I am back to the med 10mg once a day. My next blood result is due in another 4weeks, so will see. The major side effects of the med when I was taking 10mg 3x a day were muscle cramp, nails broke easily. I experienced muscle cramp so easily when I turn around or bend down, it really hurts. Once I stopped the med, the cramp was completely gone. I didn't experience constipation as some reviewers mentioned. I guess each individual is different and it could be that I tend to eat more veggie than meat. Veggie is a good source of fiber. I can live w/o meat but can't live w/o veggie. Now I have been taking 10mg a day for 2weeks, I haven't had muscle cramp problem. I guess the higher dosage, the more and servere the side effects are. My thyroid had never been this hyper until last year. I am not sure what caused it and accelerated it, but my endo said it could be caused by a lot of stress and high volume of iodine intake. I have been trying to avoid eating any seafood and any food product that is a sause of iodine, althought it is hard to avoid any iodine intake. I try to bring my own food to work and eat more veggie. Although I don't experience muscle cramp, I am lossing lots of hair, which is freaking me out. My endo recommended me to take Biotin. I have been taken Biotin 1000 mcg daily for 6days, I haven't seen any positive result yet. My endo said it takes at least a month to see some results, so I will wait n see.

Overactive Thyroid Gland	goingbonkers, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	1/14/2012 8:11:13 AM	I am not too happy with the side affects.  The weight gain is not good I should weigh at the most 130 for my height now I am almost at 160.  My hair has stopped growing and my nails are getting weaker. I have that extreme hunger feeling like my blood sugar levels are off.  I am also not sleeping well its trying me bonkers. I seem to be more irritable too. The aches and pain in my arms really is getting to me as well. I don't know that I like the trade off, sure would be nice if there was a better drug or alternative treatment. My doctor up'd my dose to 15mg 3 times a day then just recently dropped me down to 15mg twice a day however can't seem to get it right when sending over the new prescription to the pharmacy, states that I should take 10mg twice a day. I feel more stressed than before too and not getting the right dosing seems to add to it. I am not happy with the side effects at all, I guess I am not alone in the feeling/opinion of it.

My mother is grossly obese so....ive been put back on the methimazole just this week due to levels going way off but i never did notice side effects other than being so tired and getting fat. i wish the people who say &quot;its your body normalizing or gaining back the weight lost due to graves or other illness&quot; would stop saying that.  My wieght has been the SAME withing 5lbs since high school 20 yrs ago.  Yet on mzole i balloon up to 140!

Though my readings were high, very hyper, but my doc put me on just 10mg once a day. After a month, the readings improved dramatically, and most hyper symptoms are gone, i put on some weight but not excessive, my heartbeat still quite high at 90pm. my only major complaint is the unbearable itch on my lower legs which started since week 2. The itch is unbearable, i scratch till i bleed. I am trying to manage the itch with cortisone 1% ointment. but the itch and rash seems to travel all over my legs.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	3	4	3	Female		9/5/2011 9:55:29 PM	I'm writing on behalf of my daughter. She is 26 and has Down Syndrome. She was on Methimazole a few years ago, then we stopped it when she tested normal. Then after a routine blood draw, the doctor said she was hyper again. Back to the meds but this time she is gaining weight. A lot of weight. Almost 25 pounds in about 6 months. She is barely 5 feet tall and wasn't thin to begin with. She is having severe back pain, I think due to the excess weight. I'm considering taking her off the meds until her next check up. (I didn't notice the symptoms this time like I did before. I was shocked when the doc diagnosed her again.) 
Overactive Thyroid Gland	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	8/23/2011 4:21:22 PM	I have been on this medicine for about a 6-8 weeks, and so far haven't had any aggravating side effects.  The only thing I can think of is that it does make me sleepy (not when I take it, but I feel more tired now), and it makes me have weird/strange dreams. I'm hoping it'll help my Hyperthyroidism very soon, as I'm tired of all the discomfort of it. I haven't noticed a huge change yet, and my Dr told me it could take months (are you kidding me!?) to notice the complete effects of it. I have to go back in a month for thyroid testing, to see if it's bringing my levels down. Hopefully I'll get good news.

Went from once a day @ 5mg; up to 10mg; then 10mg 2x/day; then to 15mg 1x/day; then 10mg 2x/day. Now back to 5mg 1x/day. I'm so ready to get off these meds. Waiting a month to see how this new dosage works out - then going to start treatment options to get off these meds permanently. Have not had any side effects, maybe headaches the first week when I initially started. Dosage changes have been smooth transitions. Note: Any weight gain is not from meds, it's your body normalizing. I lost 100 lbs before diagnosed, and have gained 70 lbs back. Frustrating, I know. Hopefully you are able to find the dosage that works for you so your body doesn't switch gears to hypo-thyroidism. As mine recently has done.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	MonicaGA, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	35-44	8/6/2011 6:22:09 PM	I was diagnosed with Graves disease about a month ago. I am so confused though. Instead of losing weight like others with hyperthyroidism, I have gained 50lbs! I am miserable. I hide out in my home because of the weight gain. I diet and exercise and it does work. I am afraid to take meds such as Methimazole because they will increase my weight even more. I don't know what to do. I suffer from depression, anxiety and insomnia. I know it is because of the condition but what and I to do. I REFUSE TO GAIN ANOTHER POUND! 230 IS ENOUGH! Please help!

The only side effect I have experienced is numbness in myhands when I sleep. Although it is annoying, it really doesn't bother my life to any degree. Also I just want to point out to everyone that the weight gain you are experiencing is not because of the medication it is because you are gaining back the weight you lost because of the hyperthyroidism!

The first month was easy with no side effects and then the itching began and has gotten worse.  My Dr. told me to stop taking it for two weeks and another form of treatment will take it's place.  I'm so itchy...I can't stand it! I hope this leaves my system fast...been off for five days...hurry out of me please!

I didn't even know I had it til Dr. ran some blood work and it came back with a high level for thyroid. I've been taking the meds sine last month 10mg 2xday but received a call from Dr a few days to increase it to 3xday because the T3 and T4 levels are still high. Before taking the meds I was always tired, got fatigued easily, had very bad hand trmors, barely slept and was losing weight. All that s controlled but stil get aches and nausea all the time. Other than that, Im feeling way better than before. Thank you all for sharing your thoughts! :-)
Overactive Thyroid Gland	dolor, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	5	2	Female	45-54	6/3/2011 11:41:10 PM	53 yr female Started this med 1 week ago for newly diagnosed Graves. Thyroid Symptoms developed several weeks after death of close family member. 10mg a.m. on mt stomach. On day 6 started itching all over at night while relaxing but not during the day. Itching keeps me awake. I was crying all the time before I started the med and was feeling anxiety and depression. The crying has stopped and the anxiety/depression is much better. I have really intense numbing - tingling in the hands and it has severely interrupted sleep. I'm taking 3mg melatonin to help the sleep. I'm going to try naturalistic medicine m.d. instead of traditional medicine. This blog has validated the itching side effect. It's random from head to toe - never the same spot. Thank you everyone for sharing.

I've been on this Methimazole 5mg twice a day since Jan 11' and all my symptoms (excessive sweating, tachycardia, palp, gained 5lbs, excessive hunger, insomnia, bulging one eye, tremors, muscle weakness, diff concentrating, memory loss, etc) were 95% better except for the palpitations. I was happy until I had rashes in April 11 becuz the Endo told me to take 10mg once a day.  After, he said to go back to 5mg twice a day, and it is better, but now I lost 1/3rd of my hair, gained approx 10-15lbs, panic attacks, diff breathing, very tired and sleepy, and vision changes. Overall, I'm just not feeling like myself. It feels like I'm hypothyroid from reading the various internet sources and seems like I'm trading a set of symptoms for a new set of symptoms! ugh! I have an appt in one week for a second lab results, hopefully good =)  
Overactive Thyroid Gland	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	5/16/2011 10:33:04 AM	I have subclinical hyperthyroid with Graves Disease in remission.  I no longer have any symptoms of Graves, but my bloodwork (TSH, T3, T4) come back indicating that I'm still hyper, so I am on a low dose of this drug.  I can't bring myself to take it.  Whenever I take it for a few days as prescribed, I gain 3-5 lbs.  I'm now 15 lbs heavier than when I started it 8 months ago, and I can't get the weight off (despite being &quot;hyperthyroid.&quot;)  That was the only side effect from the drug, but I prefer not to take it and still feel fine, rather than continue to gain weight.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	MeMe, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	4/26/2011 4:03:17 AM	I was diagnosed with overactive thyroid about 3 months ago. Before methimazole, I was tired all the time, depressed, heart palps, anxious, and had severe tremors! I take 10mg 3X's a day; after only 2 weeks in, I started experienced headaches, but they are all but gone now. After a month I started experiencing lower back and now severe leg pain. I can hardly walk and have difficulty getting out of bed. I contrast these symptoms with my earlier symptoms and I only hope a change in dose will help me. I wouldn't swap back to how I was feeling before, yet I hate these symptoms too. Thanks for all of your reviews. They really are helpful. I'll post later (after my dose is changed).

My labs for thyroid function were abnormal as were an ultrasound and a thyroid scan.  I started on this med and within a few weeks my heart rate, while still elevated, was around 120 and the palpitations stopped.  Other than the fact that my labs are in the high normal range and the the palpitations are gone I wouldn't even know I was taking this med.  No side-effects at all.

I had issues with my weight, hairloss, dry skin, nausea, tiredness, and chronic joint pain. Recently, I quit taking the med. because everything I did began to feel like a chore. Waking up in the a.m. was miserable, then unable to sleep at night. I'm extremely frustated with this disease. On top of everything I don't have health insurance, so getting quality treatment seems next to impossible. Since I've stopped the med. my heart races and I feel my ears burn, which makes me think my blood pressure is high. I feel more energized and activities seem more comfortable. I feel as if I'm at a healthier weight now as well (not as swollen). Still waiting for my appointment.

Diagnosed 1st time about 9 years ago.  Took the med for a year and stopped - no longer had med coverage.  Re-diagnosed 2.5 years ago, been on it since.  I have a benign multinodual goiter and the med has reduced the amount of hormone some but not enough.  I'm on 20mg once a day.  I've been telling the endo since I started taking it that I feel like it wears off and asking if he would be ok with me taking it 12 hours apart.  He said no. *growl*  I think he's going to want to go with the radioactive iodine soon.  If eye surgeons can use lasers to work on eyes, why can't the endo's just zap the nodules?I have had lots of sweats but attribute this to menopause and have had itchy spots for years - since before the medication.  I guess I've been lucky and side effect free (well except for that weight gain thing - expected)

Next day I went to Emergency Med Clinic, only to be told that it was &quot;PROBABLY&quot; due to my thyroid gland!!?? On Monday morning I went to a Dr. I had never seen, only to be told that I was taking to many &quot;BATHS&quot;  After reading other experiences, I am convinced that my itching and coughing are definately related to my medication! METHIMAZOLE,  I am thankful for these reviews!!!!!!

Most ridicalous thing I've ever heard!! My sister which is an RN suggested I look up side affects for TAPAZOL, I honestly believe that this is the reason for my severe itching!!!

Just in my 3rd wk of med. I am having severe itching (sm. hives) on the top of my hands and feet.  After what I have read, I am going to only take the med 2x/day before I experience any other side effects. But, I am very glad I read these reviews, bec the only symptoms I had were occasional heart palpitations and panic attacks and I now think according to symptons that others have that I am taking way too much medecine and am going to  have a serious discussion w/my endo.  Thanks for all your reviews - very helpful.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	AngryDomo, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	7/29/2010 6:36:49 PM	Took Methimazole orally for 3-ish weeks only to wake up in a dead sleep from terrible itching.  I stopped taking the medication, but the itching has continued now for 8 days and shows no signs of getting better.  Antihistimine helps wonders (drowsiness aside), but needs to be taken daily.  Seems to be worse after a shower, but early on a shower helped.  Originally we thought it a common allergy but several product changes later, it still persists.  Best to try something different before this drug.  It seems to have too many problems to be recommended.

Unfortunately, my thyroid wouldn't be tamed by medication alone so I finally got the radioactive iodine treatment. I went back on methimazole afterward because my thyroid still refuses to die, even though it's been over three months since my treatment. I'm still waiting for some relief. 
Overactive Thyroid Gland	Joan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/14/2010 5:05:23 PM	I took this for 3 months for Graves Disease and it worked great! Then I developed an allergy to it. I went for the radioactive iodine and all is well. No more pills.Some of the things I see listed by others seem to be symptoms of thyroid while itching and throat closing are an allergy.If your doctor isn't doing a blood test every so often especially when the medicine is changed its no wonder some of you are having problems.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/30/2010 8:20:12 PM	I was put on this medication for an overactive thyroid. This medication made me ill and when I called the doctor to tell him how sick I was he just told me to cut done on the medication. I did that a couple times and then I got the severe sore throat and temp and went to urgent care. They tested me for strep and then that was negative. Two days later my mother in law took to me urgent care and by that time my white count was wiped out. It was down to 300 and I was hospitalized for 5 days and then taken back 3 days later for another 4. I almost died from this medication and this happened 5 weeks after I took it. That is how long it takes to get in your system and by that time you forget about the side effects.

Very bad taste, made me drowsy and confused and had a swelling in my throat and trouble swallowing. Scared to continue but not willing to go back on PTU, don't know what to do to tame my thyroid. I have Graves disease, both times it got worse after my kids were born.

Initially started at 5mg, then to 10 mg, then to 20mg (which was not good), and now taking 10mg twice a day (works much better). My side effects have been unnoticeable. What with the loose bowels the first week when my drugs were increased, and luckily it's only a week. Right now my labs have been steady and things are going good. Thankfully no more increases.

Was given BC at first and later 5mg of this to counteract overlong menstrual cycles, severe mood swings, restlessness, and migranes. Been on this dosage for about 5 yrs and have noticed I've been getting nausea, palpitations, itchy feet, and steadily increasing weight (about 5lb/5 months). They tried giving me Propanol to help with the migraines but between the two meds it makes me wanna vomit and pass out so don't take it. At one point they tried to give me the 10mg but my T3 and T4 levels jumped alarmingly so I'll be on 5mg for life.

I get severe pain in my legs and in one arm.  Also, I have had rapid weight gain and hair loss.  The medicine makes it harder to get out of bed.  Everyday chores are a task in themselves.  I want off these meds bad.  Dr. won't change them.  Looking for a new doctor.

My concern the most is when the dosage is to high i will get a bad constipation and does realy hard to loose weight.therefore the doctor have to lower dosage. this drug only maintained your thyroid hormone it doesnt cured me from hyper thyroidism, infact my doctor will perform radioactive iodine treatment next month.

I've only been on 20 mg methimazole for about 2 weeks, in preparation for thyroidectomy next month. Not only am I losing a scary amount of hair,-  The itching is so severe- my skin is raw behind my knees, creases of my elbows, under my arms, chest and neck. Lotion does nothing to help. I'd quit taking it completely if it weren't imperative to stop thyroid horomone in time for surgery. What a nightmare!

I thought i was dieing! im off the meds for 2 days- plz let this all go away!!
Overactive Thyroid Gland	laraine47,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		2/8/2010 3:32:05 PM	I took this medication briefly.  Ever since I have been experiencing abnormal (for me) sweating.  I am sweating around my neck and arm pits to the point that I have to change clothes mid-day because my clothes are damp and in the cold weather, makes me feel cold!  I am so uncomfortable I can't stand it.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	2/7/2010 11:00:49 AM	I was recently diagnosed with Graves Disease. I am now taking 5mg. generic form. My weight has stablized. I was down to 97 lbs. My acne has been cured! My hair has stopped falling out. My energy is slower to come back. I wasn't having side effects until recently. I am having a lot of discomfort in my chest. I went to gastro dr. because I know this drug can cause epigastric problems. I am being treated with Protonix 2 X a day but am not feeing any better. It feels like it is getting worse. If I had a fever I would think I had pneumonia. My neck/throat bothers me a little as well. No other side effects other than these. I am going for my first follow up with the endo. dr. tomorrow &amp; will discuss everything with him then. I like him, he spent over an hour with me on my first visit. I am confident that he will get me on the road to remission comfortably!
Overactive Thyroid Gland	gapiper, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	55-64	1/19/2010 5:23:06 PM	Have been taking 30 mg of methimazole for almost 3 months.  About a month ago I started with severe itching on legs and arms and swelling of legs, ankles &amp; feet. In addition, I have gained 25 pounds in less than 2 months.Will be seeing my Endo Dr. tomorrow and certainly will tell him about all these problems.  He says I have to have the thyroid radiated due to heart disease issues.  I am NOT a complainer but I wish I knew what things to say to my doctor in order for him to LISTEN to me!  I have a cardiologist who is only interested in cardio issues.  My general care doc is a so-called lipids expert who only cares about lipids.Why is it that some doctors think they are so much smarter than their patients?  I feel I am fairly smart and don't like being belittled.  Yes, I could change one or more doctors but at age 58 am beginning to think doctors have a very similar superiority complex insofar as patients are concerned.With all the drugs I am taking for stents, cholesterol and now this thyroid thing, I am really concerned about whether or not anyone is overseeing the whole picture.  Again, I am NOT a complainer.  Have been in fairly good health all my life and am now experiencing a few life shaking issues.I don't expect any silver bullet answers but DO appreciate &quot;venting&quot; or whatever you wish to call it on this site.

I took this medication for three weeks the broke out in welts and rashes.  The itching drove me nuts.   I couldnt sleep well either.  Havent lost any more weight on this medcine.  Before medicine lost 30 pounds in one month.  The med did stop the lossing of the weight.  But now they want to give me Iodine radiation.  I also got brochial pneamunion because this medicine has caused my body immune system to weaken.  It seems to me we are being treated like cancer patients with the type of medicines they have for us.  I dont think I am not sure if I am going to do the iodized radation.  I will try to live with what I have.

Although I have been dealing with pretty bad vision and nausea. I have also lost 15 lbs withing these 4 days. I am not happy cause i cannot function or think or barely open a door. I am ready to go to the hospital.
Symptoms arising in Severe Thyrotoxicosis Thyroid Crisis	lindaB, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	11/29/2009 10:11:17 AM	started out on 15mg methimazole per day with propranolol then Dr. increased dosage to 30mg per day. Started with loss of appetite then couldn't taste food at all. Taste is my mouth is so foul that I can't eat at all, I gag everytime I try to eat as taste in mouth is so bad. Can't even drink water, only thing I can drink is diet soda, bubbles in soda help to mute the foul taste somewhat. Haven't been able to eat in over a week.......totally miserable. Have stopped taking Methimazole and will not take again. Endoch has been completely unhelpful and I get the impression that they think I'm lieing, feel like I'm losing my mind. After reading the other reviews I feel that low doses of this drug seem to be okay, but high doses are not suitable, my Dr. said that I cannot go back to a low dosage as I am severely hyper &amp; a low dose will not be effective, but there is no way that I will take the higher dose again. I am dissapointed in this drug and in my endoch care and am going to try and seek some holistic help.

I have been taking 10mg of this medicine and have had a lot of trouble sleeping, I wake up countless times during the night and end up staying awake for about an hour each time. Ive also become very ichy all over my body, lotions are not helping. I misplaces my info on side effects and was wondering if anyone else has had similar side effect?

Last week I went for my 6 month blood work and told my doctor to ck my last script to see if I needed a refill and she stated someone had given me a years supply and that no one should ever be given a years supply because it is a VERY DANGEROUS drug. When I asked about the side effects the only reply I ever get is that they have never heard of them happening before, which seems to be a very popular reply with all the other posts ???

The endo prescribed Methamazole, 5 mg once per day.  I have been taking it for 1 month.  A week ago I developed a severe rash on my heel and swollen lymph nodes in my neck.  I went to a family practitioner who felt that I needed a biopsy.  He referred me to an ENT. In the meantime, I called my endo to find out if the swollen lymph nodes could be a side effect of the drug, and he said no.  The info the pharmacist gave me, however, indicated that swollen lymph nodes can be a side effect.  The ENT also believes that it can be.  I have an appt with the endo this week, and I will take him the drug information.  I would like to hear from others who have had a similar side effect.

I was put on 5mg twice daily and I still feel and look just as bad as I did before taking Methimazole.  My next visit, I will ask for a prescription for brand name Tapazole. I've never had any luck with generic meds.

On 4th day of refill I ended up in hospital for one week. Lost all muscle control and fell as they spasmed. Had no mobility at all. VERY painful. My endo says he never heard of this, but I see by this board, that is common. I was in bad shape and steroids turned me around. I will never take this med again.

I really did not notice side effects until a couple of days ago. My throat feels swollen and it is sometimes hard too swallow. I also have a noticeable &quot;lump&quot; from my right ear drum to the left side of my neck. I am going in to see the doctor tomorrow morning. I have quit taking the drug because I believe it has  created this lump. I did also gain about 10 pounds in this time period.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	leiamolo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	9/17/2009 9:05:23 AM	I was diagnosed with an over active thyroid 8/2009 and the Dr. put me on 10mg to start with, and at the time I think I was having a thyroid episode because I was very dizzy on the medication, and felt nausea. Hyperthyroidism was so new to me at that time, I think the drug put me into a panic attack and I went to the Urgent Care Clinic. I've been off of the drug since and the Endo recommended I start again (mid Sept 2009)upon diagnoses of Graves Disease. The Endo said I was a mild/moderate case, and prescribed 5mg ONCE A DAY. I am working my way up to the &quot;5mg&quot; to avoid any side affects, and I literally take 1.25 every evening, I will up my dosage to 2.5 after a week of being on 1/4th of the pill and so on...I don't have tremors anymore, nor a racing heart. I highly advise to consider acupuncture (excellent for hormones),chiropractic care, and nutrition supplementing at the same time! Prior to starting this drug again, I lowered my own TSH levels by staying committed to alternative care and relaxation methods. If I could do that in once month, I figure gradually building up the immunity to &quot;5mg&quot; will put me into remission this year! I find out in November 2009 if this will work for me. My main advice &quot;be very consistent with treatment and nutrition&quot; the benefit is worth the routine. So far in week 1 of &quot;1.25mg&quot; I only get itchy, I will keep you all posted. Bless yourself!

I've had an approximate 15 lb. weight gain. Also, I caught a cold and was extremely sick for two weeks.One of the side effects is the suppressed immune system. The medicine has helped my TSH levels to be normal and remain stable, though. My advice is to avoid germs, exercise, and monitor your food in-take.

Been on this and beta-blocker for 5 weeks.  Two weeks in had major itching of palms, soles, back, scalp but no rash or hives.  That's gone now. Also two weeks in my molars became sensitive to cold.  Escalated to very sesitive to even tepid, and aching out the wazzoo.  Without ibuprophen, pain is out of this world.  Dr. says she's never heard of this side effect for this med or the beta-blocker. Anyone else have the jaw pain?

I take this medication 4x/day and it seems to help relieve the symtoms dramatically: severe shakiness, itching back, dryness everywhere, severe rapid heartbeat, agitation, extreme fatigue and stiff/lock joints. I have had both my shoulders &quot;lock&quot; on me on different occassions and it was very painful that I had to receive an antiflammatory shot both times and be put on the antiflamm. pills. My thyroid# has not dropped since April 09, but in time I hope this medication reverses this soon.  I understand we can only be on this medication for up to 2 years, but I just read the review where she was on it for 3 years..wow? I do have some weight gain, but that's because I lost the determination to work out the way I used to before my symptoms got so bad.  I'm getting back on track. I do have the hair loss though and I was checking if this was normal with this drug. I also battle acne due to the excessive oily glands due to my overactive thyroid, which is slowly getting back to normal. Thanks for the reviews.

Started taking 20mg daily since November 2008.  By Feb '09 gained 12lbs back &amp; test came back I was below normal now, so decreased dosage to 10 mg daily.  By April '09, feeling some same symtoms come back.  test came back hyper active again.  increased dosage to 15mg daily.  now mainly my scalp and face are itching, but no where else. Saw that others were itchy too but didn't find you saying your scalps itched.  Is anyone feel the itch on scalp?  Those that are gaining lots of weight could be sign of below normal levels like me.  Looks like the dosage is something that could changed with every check up.  check with doctor and have your dosage looked at.

Took something else for 3 mths prior to this one that did not help. Thyroid has decreased is size and I am not as sick, but have always had constipation with this med and still had bulging eyes, hair loss, weight gain, etc. Eyes have receeded some, but now I have double vision.&#160; It's awful. I thought taking this med would stop the other symtoms of Graves but they have not for me. I have had the itchy rash for the last 3 wks.&#160; I, too, wanted to avoid taking out my thyroid, but I am about at my wits end.&#160; Still have heart palpatations, and beginning to cough again, and too many symtoms that will not go away. Now I am wondering if this med is not working for me or what. Going to doc in 9 days and will let you know.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	4/10/2009 8:08:50 PM	I am taking 15mg daily for a couple of months now and have not experienced any side effects from the drug.  I do not have the heart palpitations and become fatigued as I did several months ago.  Also, I am taking 10mg of Atenolol daily.  It may be too early to tell if the drugs will not have any side effects but so far they have helped me.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	Val, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	45-54	3/24/2009 8:04:42 PM	I went to the dr bcuz I was shaking and had heart palpitations. I am already on meds for high blood pressure. Turns out my resting heart rate on avg was 115! Was given Methimazole (3 X per day) along with Propranolol, also 3x per day. I ended up with the paramedics at my door on day 2. I am now on one Methimazole per day, and it seems to help the heart and not so much side effects.  I had to switch back to Atenolol instead of the Propranolol. My doctor had said that my Hyperthyroidism was SEVERE, so that is why he treated so aggressively.  They are following up soon to see exactly why my thyroid took this turn, when 5 yrs ago, I was told I had borderline hypothyroidism. We'll see!  Good luck to anyone beginning this. It's a process to get dosing just right!

Have had hives and horrible itching on back of neck and inner elbows. Look like an IV drug abuser!!! Also, weakness in legs. Can't do many of the exercises I used to do that require alot of leg muscle. Taking 3/10mg pills daily for about a month now for Graves/Hyper. Have had some weight gain as well. No cramping thank God. Headaches if I miss a dosage. Has anyone noticed this drug helping with eye bulging?

Also have gained 20 pounds.  Joint and muscle pain have not been to bad but I do have them.  As of 2 days ago my hands have started tingling.  Not sure if I am going to continue on this drug.  I think surgery and thyroid replacment therapy are a better alternative.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	HCC, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	3/7/2009 11:18:49 AM	After 3 weeks on the medicine - 40 mg. per day - I had terrible itching with huge welts.  I took Claritin plus Benadryl with very little relief and have been off the medicine for 3 days  I had one terrible experience with heartburn/reflux.  I was told to take steroids which make my very hyper.  Before starting this drug, I felt perfect and was on no prescription drugs.  My tsh levels were too low - .04. I got opinions from 2 doctors and they both recommended the Iodine therapy.  I don't want to do the therapy if I feel perfect and take months to get back to feeling good and experimenting with drug dosages.  Thank you for all the reviews - gives me confidence to convince the doctor.  He didn't agree that the medicine was causing the itching and told me to go off for only 6 days.  I don't want to ever take it again!!

I stoped N.P.hc, replaced with Ofloxacin (prescptn.). No more interferance with Methimazole

My doctor had me start out with 10 mg once a day. But 3 weeks into it I started itching everywhere. It's horrible. It's worse on the palm of my hands. At the end of the day they are red and swollen. I just stopped taking the medication and it's been 6 days now and I am still itchy. I also have been extra hungry and can out eat my husband. I hate this medication.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	lordshelper, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	2/17/2009 5:40:22 PM	I'm on my 2nd round of this treatment, went into remission after taking if for about a year, remission lasted for several years, relasp a couple of monhts ago.  Have weird topical skin burning on hands and feet sometimes daily, no other systems that are listed in other posts, no muscle or joint pains, some foot muscle spasms at bed time.  Overall it works for me and I refuse the iodine treatmen, God gave me a thyroid for a reason.  
Overactive Thyroid Gland	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	1/19/2009 12:24:27 AM	In May I was diagnosed with Graves disease and I started taking 10 mg twice a day.  In July I was raised to 15mg twice a day and the Endroconologist wanted me to make an appointment for the radioactive iodine. I refused since I was also trying a healthier approach taking sugar, wheat, yeast, dairy and other foods that I was showing a sensitivity towards out of my diet.  The Endocrinologist told me that losing weight and changing what I eat will not help an autoimmune disease.  In Aug. I started getting pain/spasms in my back. The Endocrinologist said it could not be from the medicine.  Pain worsened making me fall and loose control of my legs for a moment. I lowered my dose back to 10 mg twice a day and pain/spasms disappeared after a few days.  In Oct. I started having pain in my shoulders and neck causing me to be unable to turn my head.  Treatments that normally work for me for muscle pain have not been effective.  I also started experiencing headaches, dizziness, hives, feeling tired, bruising easily, and thinning hair.  After speaking to 3 different Pharmacists all assuring me that what I was experiencing could be a side effect from the medication I decided to slowly lower the dose of medicine that I was taking.  I took my last dose on Christmas Day.  In Jan. my blood work was  in the normal range and my neck and shoulders are almost back to full range of motion and pain free. When I saw the Endocrinologist she said I was right to stop taking the Methimazole with the side effects that I was experiencing and she said I have done remarkable since she first saw me in May.  I still have my thyroid and I am not on any medication now and I feel better then I have in years.  Information on what is working for me can be found at WWW.BetterHealthUSA.com

Overactive Thyroid Gland	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	65-74	8/12/2008 11:42:06 PM	They started me on 10mg twice daily along with a beta blocker. Within 36 hours, after taking 3 pills, the combination caused my blood pressure to drop to 85/40 with a pulse rate of 40.I was taken by ambulance for emergency stabilization.The next day after being off both drugs I was normal and told to only take one dose, 10 mg of methimazole.I now have severe fatigue, muscle spasms, aches in the arms, verdigo and slight nausia.The cure seems to be worse then the condition so I'm opting for radioactive iodine treatment to address the thyroid problem rather then feel like I'm dying from the drug reaction.This is four days into the course of methimazole and while everyone's reaction is different, you have to be sensitive to the reaction of your body to the drug and aware of interactions with other medication.

I found it difficult to get out of bed because I was exhusted when I woke in the morning. My doctor would lower my dose, things would get a bit better but I still couldn't fully participate in my life. I decided to change doctors, he changed my drug and dosage and I am much better now.

I only have minimal side effects which are better than the effects from the hyper-thyroid. I am no longer shaky and anxious unless I dont take the medicine. i do not have the severe night sweats anymore and my appetite has gone down to a normal level. The only side effect that i have really noticed is that if you drink alcohol after you have taken the medication you will start to itch.

I cough like I have bronchitis and I've been on this for 6 wks. The Dr. took me off it 2x and checked my blood to see if there is an infection. Both times were neg. so he put me back on. The coughing went away both times while awaiting the results and came back as soon as I started taking it again. It's a lower dose than most people get but I cough all the time from it. I found that Mucinex works for it, even though it's not advisable to mix them.

I lost about 50lbs due to the Graves Disease, but I have gained 20lbs back and that has been a bummer, but other than that I don't have any major complaints. I have noticed that if I stop taking it I will get very ill; the shakes, nausea, vomiting, chills and a migraine. I don't know, I'm still in the process of finding the right treatment, but this med. has helped the symptoms of the Graves Disease.

In the beginning, it took about a year of trying varying doses to get to the dose that stablized my thyroid. I chose to stay on the med rather than radiation or surgery, so I wouldn't have to take tyroid replacement and experience hypothyroid symptoms. I no longer experience symptoms of hyperthyroid while taking only 5mg once a day and have my thyroid levels checked once a year.
