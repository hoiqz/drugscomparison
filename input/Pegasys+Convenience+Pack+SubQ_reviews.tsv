I ask what was our next step he said there was nothing else he could do and that I would get cirrosis.I would not accept this because 6 weeks later I had the swelling so I made my PCP refure me to an allergist,she also thinks it's not a reaction I contacted the company the makes the pegasys they sent it to my allergist and I'll take my test on the 30th,she also is going to put me in the hospital and do a desentisation. I think anyone who has a reaction should have the allergy testand if a doctor tells you there's nothing he can do go to work yourself the answer is out there
Chronic Hepatitis C	vdevine69, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	2	Female	45-54	7/1/2011 9:33:48 PM	the first week and a half was a piece of cake! Getting into the 3rd week is when I really started get sick from rashes, boles, major headaches, could'nt sleep what so ever. ended up in the hospital with a 103.8 temp. Because your skin dries out so bad (and I was putting mositerizers on all the time) it plugs up you hair particle pore so my body is very infected but not with Hep C. I am now taking a very strong antibiotic and have three days left of taking and its barely starting to work. If you aregetting ready to do this treatment don't just listen to what your doctor or care nurse have to say but do your own research and dig deep because they do not know all the side affects. So be smart and not dumb like me and find out everything your can before you start. Yes, it is a very rough ride and don't be like me and do it alone (its pure &quot;HELL&quot;) its best if you have someone close to you to help you get thou this. Goodn luck to all of you.

The average time for the side effects to ease off is anywhere from 6-12 wks.  Although these side effects are difficult to handle, the end result is worth it....you can take it or end up dying from the alternative.

Chronic Hepatitis C	wildkat, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	1	3	1	Female	55-64	1/24/2011 12:09:31 PM	After experiencing various side effects--hair loss, extreme fatigue, --most of the side effects listed for this drug, I got a ruff surfaced, very itchy rash all over--the Dr. took me off this drug &amp; the Ribasphere I was taking. At this point I think the cure (which I was told probably wouldn't work for me) is worse than the disease! This is the second round of Interfiron for me and neither one did anything but make me extremely sick every day I was on it. It's going to be hard for anyone to talk me into another round of this.
Chronic Hepatitis C	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	7/27/2010 5:46:20 PM	A Doctor at the Borland Groover clinic told me I needed this treatment as it would help lower my viral load, all my hair fell out, the side effects were not fully discussed with me, chtonic fatique set in, depression, went to another doctor same building to be told she would not have put me through the treatment as is was unneccesary for my levels. Get a second opinion before using this drug-it is NOT a miracle by any means and causes more damage than effective.

I have been using Pegasus for three months as a maintainance  program without riboviron  and 135mcg per week .Viral load is now none detectable. Support from Pegasus has been top notch and informative. Hang in there and don't give up. Pace yourself and don't give up. When you think you want to give up, don't. You'll make it through this. You have to.

I've been taking Pegasys and Ribavirin since November. With genotype 1, the odds of the meds working were against me.  Plus, my blood platelets seemed to stay low.  However, I responded well and my viral load has been negative since around February or March.  The side effects have been hard. I endure constant fatigue, weakness, and ache in my shoulders.  Since I've been on it so long, I do have some good days.  However, I never know which days will be good and which will be bad.I know this sounds scary, but I will say this...I don't regret starting the medication.  I only wish I could've started it sooner.  If you are reading this, don't let the side effects scare you away.  I'm almost finished with my treatment, and I don't regret a moment of it.  This year of irritation and side effects is well worth a life not dealing with Hep C.
Chronic Hepatitis C	Solser, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/7/2009 3:05:55 PM	I was shocked to see that I did not go through any side effects at all - but for(1) some food lost it's appeal to me. Been on Pegasys 188cc for 4 months and it is working great for me I was real sick prior to starting this treatment, and I am happy for doing so. I do take vitamins &amp; folic acid also. My only concern is my CBC, my platlets and WBC are still very low but that was always a problem prior to my  treatment. I am trying to stave off a liver transplant and so far it seems to be working!

Chronic Hepatitis C	simpson, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	10/14/2008 7:07:07 PM	After the first month of treatment, side effects kicked in: problems sleeping, eating, bumps on tongue, irritable, high strung, sweats. Now in the 4th month most side effects are not as bad, still have sore mouth and eating problems. 
Chronic Hepatitis C	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	10/7/2008 12:30:34 AM	  The treatment has been lowering my viral load and in the end I will not have Hep 'C'. I did lose a lot of weight and was getting very angry with anyone. Other medications have helped with those problems. This is my 3rd month and I have 4 left.

Chronic Hepatitis C	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	3/24/2008 8:00:00 PM	I am on the home stretch of a 24 week dose. theside effects are awful but I am undectible at this time so it seems to be working. I have had to quit working because the meds make me sick and now I have been bleeding for the last 3 months but it will be worth it if i get a sustained reponse
Chronic Hepatitis C	harleygirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	1	3	Female	45-54	3/9/2008 10:16:00 PM	Combined with Ribavirin, the treatment is extremely difficult to endure.  The side effects are horrible, severe depression, constant body and bone aches, severe anemia (requiring weekly procrit injections) and daily fatigue.  However, if it will clear the Hep c virus it will be worth it.  Only 3 more weeks and I will have completed round 2 of treatment.  First was 24 weeks and virus came back after 30 days of completed treatment.  Put back on for 48 weeks.  The Pegasys is wonderful when compared to the Peg-Intron.  Would I do it again?  Yes, since it is the only treatment for hep C.
Chronic Hepatitis C	albanese54, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	3/2/2008 7:37:42 PM	I have Hepatitis C, Genotype 1, and been on the treatment for seven (7) years. I started with Interferon 3500 dial pen in combination with 1000 mg of Ribavirin seven injections per week for a period of 3 years, then my doctor switched me to Pegaleted Interferon once a week and 1000 mg of Ribavirin daily for 1 year. My viral load start climbing again and he put me on Infergen and 1000 mg Ribavirin daily for 2 years. The viral load dicreased again (Non treasable) for one (1 year). Again he switched me this time to Pegasys pegaleted and 1000 mg of Ribavirin. For 5 months it was pretty stable in the negative, the all at once it started to climb again in the positive. He decided to switch from the 1000 mg Ribavirin to Riba-Pack 1200 mg daily (1 tab of 600 mg in AM and 1 in the PM). After 3 months of this new dosage, I'm in the negative again. It's been 3 months now, and I hope it will stay negative at least for a Year, in this way I could get off the medication.It's been a roller coaster, I have to take Procrit to boost the red blood, Neupogen to bust the white blood and developed Lupus especially at the injection sites, but with all this I'm still on the treatment even so I feel like crap most of the days. It beats the alternative.

Immediately my viral load went to undetectable and stayed that way for the duration of the treatment. The prefilled syringes were a breeze to use. The first year on Pegasys the side effects were not as bad as Peg-Intron. However, by the third year of tx the side effects were almost intolerable.  Have remained undetectable for 15 months post tx.
