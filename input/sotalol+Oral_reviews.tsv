The Pharmacist written warnings say a dangerous reaction could occur causing death. I hope to heck the Doc knows what he is doing. I guess no dead people have written reviews here by way of their living relatives.

Heart Ventricle Rhythm Problem	Nanc, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	4/10/2012 12:37:48 PM	I'm glad to read so many positive reviews, but for the few that may react as I did I'm writing so you know your not alone.  I did not tolerate this drug well at all.  First, my ECG showed a reaction in the hosptital, but it didn't continue so I left on 2 doses of 160 mg morning and night.  I also left with an unbelievable INCREASE in PVC's, fatigue, chest pain, dizziness and lightheaded.  After the first week some of these side effects reduced, but only at rest and were intolerable with minimal exertion. AFter 2 more weeks of the same plus a new chest pressure complaint, the DR. told me to terminate.  To be fair, I did not experience any SVT or VT while on the drug so it was likely effective in that respect.    I have VT post MI for which I wear an ICD.  Unfortunately my SVT's were recently misread and fired my ICD so I will pursue an ablation and target everything they can trigger.
Other	Kansas31, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	45-54	4/9/2012 12:12:05 AM	I have had A-fib sense 2004, it was controlled fairly well with Flecinide until I had the first Ablation.  I have had two L-Atrial Ablations with in the last 16 months (both failed). Not only did they fail, they made my condition much worse. I have tried every drug out there with no success with the exception of Sotalol Oral; it took some time to adjust to it and I'm still dealing with intermittent episodes of A-Fib, low pulse, high blood pressure, low bp, rapped heart rate and erratic heart rhythm. I have been on Sotalol 12 weeks now. I am in the VA Health Care System and it's been a long road to this point to get results that I have gotten. Clearly, I feel this medication is not working as it should. However, prior to the Sotalol I was in and out of the E.R. daily. I guess this is as good as it's going to get for me.

Prevention of Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation	Michael, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	55-64	1/9/2012 2:01:30 PM	Started taking sotalol after it was used to convert me from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.  Dr. prescribed 80 mg twice a day.  It lowered my blood pressure too low and slowed my heart down too much, and I was constantly tired and exhausted and lightheaded.  So the doctor cut my dosage down to 40 mg twice a day.  I have been taking it for two months now with no re-occurrences of atrial fibrillation.  The side code end of paragraph effects have gone away and I feel good.  My heart rate is back up to 58, which has always been my normal heart rate.  Blood pressure is back to normal, and the lightheadedness and fatigue have gone away.  So far, I have been very happy with the results of this drug.  I did notice that the longer I took the drug, the less side effects I experienced.  I hope this helps.

Had two episodes within two weeks, but now only very brief episodes. I just went to New York Presbyterian Hospital Elctrophysiology Center because I was frustrated with all the different dianoses from various doctors.The doctor at N.Y.Presbyterian told me that most AFibs will get progressivly worse over time, and the best long term solution is cardio-oblation. But their are some minimal risks with this invasive procedure. I have had two cardiac oblations in the early 90s when they were still experimental, there were no side effects, but it only lasted about ten years. Please, for your own well-being seek out a cardio doctor who is trained in Electrophysiology, regular cardiologists do not have the expertise in treating AFib. Good luck, Iknow what you are going through.

Until late last year, when I was found to be in AF 50% of the time.  Dr put me on 80 mg of Sotalol twice a day.  Slowed my HR and stopped the AF.  Sometimes I become very very tired, but can handle it.

Besides AF, very healthy, active, not overweight. Lone AF I guess is what it's called when they can't find a reason as to why it's happening...This drug slowed my heart rate down significantly. However, it is a beta-blocker which from what I understand slows the rate but doesn't fix the rhythm. So for someone with atrial fibrillation it does slow the rate but the heart is still is fibrillation. It did make after a while it slowed my heart rate down too much to where I was having bradycardia with hypotension. The side effects I experienced were terrible; nausea, dizziness/lightheaded, low energy, etc. I was taken off the medication and put on Flecainide which has worked ok... 
Heart Ventricle Rhythm Problem	Shuffle, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/26/2010 3:07:19 PM	I was experiencing supraventricular tachacardia and was hoping for a heart catheter ablation electrophysiology study.  My cardiologist prescribed sotolol HDL 80 mg. every 12 hours and sent me home with a heart monitor.  For eleven days, I suffered from greatly increased heart palpitations and sometimes hours of constant turbulence in my chest.  Along with the turbulence, i had chest pressure and burning, shoulder and neck and ear pain, headaches and vision changes which sent me to the emergency room 3 times during my 11 days of taking sotolol.  Finally, my doctor abruptly removed me from this drug and my PCP sent me to a psychiatrist for the anxiety and depression that followed.  I have been seeing 12 different doctors trying to alleviate the side effects.  Recently had a mass removed from my wrist which stopped the months of throbbing veins and arteries.  My heart catheterablation was very successful but I am still being treated for hypothyroidism, high blood pressure (3 meds 5 times a day) and just had cataract surgery and a colonoscopy to investigate the bloody stool problem.  My underarms have throbbed for months and my neck, on the left side, has been hurting and throbbing since I was abruptly removed from the sotolol.  I called the turbulence in with the monitor for eleven days and am mad at myself for taking it for so long.

Other	rick, 35-44 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3		35-44	10/12/2009 3:46:04 PM	This med was used when I developed severe sweating,dizziness and chest pain with sudden elevated blood pressure -I'd previously had an arrythmia which was nearly fatal aged only 22 and oxprenolol stopped working for me over a period of 2 months.I was really surprised that I was not monitored in Hospital when first put on this drug- I was lucky-It worked.I don't get any of the symptoms I had and pulse is not lowered so much as was with oxyprenlol.I do find that my sleep pattern is not as good and that I have gained weight,even though I do exercise-sometimes memory seems affected,but it's short-lived and may be down to lack of oxygen to brain when I had first arrythmia.I have to ensure I eat and drink at the right time and never allow myself to become dehydrated-in conjunction with Seroxat, this med seems to make concentration hard at times,compared to without.The difficult part is knowing that not taking it can cause a further heart rhythm problem plus being on it can also cause another-which does concern me.I'd opt for a pacemaker tommorow if I could- until waiting to get unwell enough to require one when really weak and perhaps have kidney problems from continuous drug use.I'm now 43, I have survived 21 years since my first arrthymia.My severe sweating, and chest pains with balance problems have gone since this drug has been prescribed

If I have a moment of a irregular beat I can increase a one or two extra half of the pill and it gets me back in beat.

Then in Feb. 2009 my A-fib was over 30% of the time and doctors changed my medication to Sotalol. My A-Fib was reduced to about15-17% of the time. I do feel better no side effects that I have noticed.

My cardiologist placed me on amiordorone after not much success with digoxin and toperol.  The amiordorone was not an effective treatment--numerous side effects, including vision problems and sun skin problems among others.  It was then recommended that catherer ablation be performed...it was 60% successful according to the electrophysiologist but not a cure as I had hoped.  At that time in 1998, I was discharged from the hospital and put on Sotalol 120 mgs. twice a day.  My situation had improved with the ablation and sotal HCL.  I am presently on 80mgs. twice a day which seems to be working but I still at times have an episode where the rhythm is very irregular.  It can last for several hours...it feels like the &quot;end is near&quot;.  After the episode is over, things are great again!  Also, at times experience skips or pauses which causes great anxiety.  Bottom line is that with the ablation and sotalol hcl, my condition is MUCH better that it was back in 1999!  PS..just learned that there might be a new medication for atrial fib. being promoted called MULTAQ made by Sanofi-Aventis.  This is the first new drug for atrial fib. in 25 years!  Stay well!

I still have occasional very slight episodes that last only a few seconds.  However, I am trying to decide if the side effects are worth taking this drug.  These have included numbness in my fingers, as well as episodes when I would get very hot and clammy.  Those side effects eased off when we cut the dose in half (now 60 mg 2x per day), but I still have diarrhea, some numbness in my fingers, sometimes a feeling of not being alert, weight gain although I have reduced appetite, sleep difficulties, and my  ankles have now started swelling throughout the day.  I have a new appointment to discuss this with my doctor next week. This is the first medication I have ever taken for AFib.

I haven't had one episode since starting the drug.  My heart rate is usually around 55 to 65 bpm and very regular.  It also happens to also keep my blood pressure down to 120/80 or less.  A great drug.  It took a few weeks when first starting the drug to get over some initial fatigue, but that went away relatively quickly.

I now take 120 in the am and 120 at night and I still swing into A fib for at least 3 or 4 hours a day.  we might try split doses so I take some at 6 hour inter.

It apparently took care of the flutter very well; after 8 or 9 months we reduced to one-half 80 mg pill twice a day.  Experience some flutter occasionally (every 4 or 5 months) but ends with rest.  Interestingly each flutter has come after 2 or 3 glasses of red wine!  I'm limiting my intake of red wine!

Then he tried to do an ablation and my heart would not go into a-fib. He took me off of it suddenly and last night I had some awful heart beats and since it is the weekend I took the sotalol this morning and tonight I am in a-fib but am feeling much better. I think I should have been taken off this slow even though I have only been on it a month.

Prevention of Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation	Dianne, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	9/23/2008 11:16:44 AM	I very nearly died due to this medication and lack of dr. care.  It lowered my blood pressure to dangerously low levels, causing electrical shocks to my brain resembling strokes due to lack of blood to my brain.  The nurse monitoring me kept telling me they wanted to keep it low to keep my heart rate regular.  The Cleveland Clinic where I ended up told me that the severity of the low blood pressure was actually killing my brain, causing the electrical shocks.  Be aware of this medication lowering blood pressure too much.  It caused severe weakness that was debilitating and frighting.  This never got better even though I was on it for three months.

He had a stent replacement in his descending artery. He was doing fine. Then on april 2 he experience A-Fib and was put on this drug. While in the hospital they did an Echocardiogram and found a blood clot in his heart. So far he has done very well with this drug.

He smoked for 34 years and quit after the heart attack. thank goodness for that! God Bless him, he had never been in the hospital until now and he is very lucky to be alive. I thank god everyday he is ok. He is worried the A-Fib will occur again. So far, so good. Thanks for reading and god bless.
