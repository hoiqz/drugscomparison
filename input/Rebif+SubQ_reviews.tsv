Multiple Sclerosis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/15/2012 8:28:45 PM	The injections themselves are easy, the only problem I have is at the injection site. I get very red and hard around the site that usually last about 7 days. I am very fair skin.
Multiple Sclerosis	toylady, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	5/2/2012 12:01:31 AM	I was diagnosed in 1989.  Did not take anything until 1998 and then was on Avonex until 2005.  Had a minor episode and doctor pulled me off that and put me on Rebif.  Didn't like it because it was 3X/wk.  Stayed on Rebif until 2007.  Felt better off the meds.  They I had an episode of optic neurits in Dec. 2009 which was six months after my mom died.  I went back on the Rebif and would have more episodes.  I don't feel it's helping me because of having more episodes. I was doing fine on Avonex.  I inject in my stomach and my legs and have red marks all over from it.  I feel quite depressed being on Rebif too and they want to put you on meds for that and I won't take them.  Also was on Ampyra for walking and that was a disaster so I'm not on that.  I am considering going off the Rebif again.

I do not get flu symptoms BUT-hair loss, my whole body has a rash called livedo reticularis, now I'm getting moles at lighting speed.  No one can/will tell me it's the rebif.  I'm on 22 mcg 'cause the 44 gave me horrid headaches.  I will say I have been stable since my first horrible flare in '05. That is the only good thing.  I really hate rebif but I hate ms more..
Multiple Sclerosis	Artist, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	2/24/2012 3:37:10 PM	I have found this drug to be a disaster for me. after using it for a little less that 2 years, the side effects became so great that even the Rebiff personnel advised me to stop using it. It has been a year and a half since I used the drug and I still have marble size nodules that rupture and through me into vilant flu like symptums. Twice this week. The Rebiff hot line says that they understand and are sorry but can do nothing about it. Certainly you understand that I cannot ever reccomend this drug to anyone. MS is a bad deal, I have had it for 35 years. Avonex worked for me for about 10 years before trying rebif. my heart condition will not allow me to use any of the new pills. So My daughter got me on herble items that she found on-line. I was really skeptal about that but her badgering got me to try the items. the results are almost as good as the approved meds, but with zero side effects for the past one year.

However, I have just spent 4 days in hospital on IVs because of cellulitus in one of my injection sites.  Am seriously considering changing meds because of the severity of the infection.  Be careful with redness/swelling at injection site.  It can be very serious!

Multiple Sclerosis	LoGirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	7/6/2011 1:37:55 PM	I had my first symptoms when I was 3 mos preg, which quite uncommon from what I've learned.  Pregnancy is called the &quot;honeymoon&quot; from MS.  This was early in 2008 and by October, I had an MRI.  I started Rebif September of 2010 after having no further symptoms/relapses.  I have had all the usual red marks, but only on my thighs and that injection seems to hurt tremendously more than in my tummy or hip.  I hardly ever use my thigh anymore.  I take out 3 doses at the start of a week and pre-medicate about 15 minutes before the shot.  I went to Wal-Mart and bought a antiseptic/pain relief spray to apply to the injection site BEFORE.  I think it does kinda numb it.  After injecting, I rub with a cotton ball and usually place a band-aid there.  All this is done before bedtime, however, I do it late at night and am up all night like there's adrenaline in the damn drug!  I'm in no pain or discomfort, but just wired!  I'll eventually go to bed at like 2 in the morning, sleep off whatever may be and wake the next morning still charged even with only 5 1/2 hrs. sleep.  I'm confused on that one, especially after reading 70+ other reviewers comments.  I've noticed my hair is extremely thin and falling out as well as some other reviewers.  I have a referral to a dermatologist, but never even thought it could be the Rebif until I read other comments on here.  I too, think my thryrod is screwed, as I am mostly vegetarian and workout on the treadmill for 30 mins 3-4 times a week and there's no change in my weight.  Have had bloodwork and another MRI since starting and there are no changes.  So....I'm thinking it's good.  Worse case scenario, I go out and get a waist-length blond wig?!!?  BTW, I have 5 boys and am able to keep up with them at 30!

Finally started taking 1 Ibuprofin with injection &amp; sleep through flu-like symtoms (ibuprofin really helped). I find it takes about 12 hours to be able to function, so I take shot 12 hrs before I have to get up, no matter when I go to bed. No major relapse &amp; MRI's look the same. I have husband &amp; 3 kids &amp; need a little more rest than before MS, but am thankful for Rebif, it has worked to keep life good.

I do still get flu like symptoms unless I take it between 8 &amp; 8:30pm.  What has been the worst though is the red marks and bruising at injection sites.  I wish they would go away.  I like this drug and want to continue it so I deal with the bruises.  I have recently dropped down from 44 to 22.  Maybe that will help.

As of now I got very severe muscle aches the first day since I took it in the morning for my training. The second time was not bad since I took Motrin and my inection was at bed time. However I am so irratable I can't stand it! I am hoping this will go away before I lose my job or really make someone offended or mad.

Now my only problems is being able to afford to take my Rebif because of my medical insurance.Which is my biggest problems, and I can't get my spouse to understand that or my insurance pharmacy company..

I prayed before I started treatment and my God is Great.  I will start my Ampyra treatment in a few days and I will pray it already a blessing for me to even receive this med that cost over a $1000.00 a month but like I said God is the provider in my life you just have to have faith.  This is how I've made it so far with a lot of love and pray.

Multiple Sclerosis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	1/31/2011 5:47:20 PM	In 2003, I was diagnosed with MS, optic neuritis being the only physical symptom. Now in 2011, in addition to MS, I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, another autoimmune disease. I believe Rebif is the link.I first took Rebif from 2003 to 2008.While taking Rebif, I was severely depressed but combated that with prozac sufficiently.  However, in 2008 I started to be frequently sick (colds, flu, viral infections), and decided that my immune system must be too suppressed.  Self-diagnosed, I took myself off of Rebif.  I still continued to get annual MRIs for baseline data.  In November of 2010, more lesions appeared and I restarted Rebif. My symptoms were similar to my experience in the past, until the end of December. After approximately 4 weeks on the drug, I started to experience a much different symptom. I began having painful, red, feverish swelling of my joints. I had a hard time walking, and could not sleep because of the pain. I saw my neurologist at the beginning of January 2011, and went to a half dose (22), 3xweek. I was given the first test for rheumatoid arthritis.  I continued that dosage for 1 week until I could no longer stand the pain.  I went off of Rebif. On the 10th of January, I was given the CCP test for rheumatoid arthritis. Both test results were extremely positive. I am now on RA meds. I was told my dad's father had undiagnosed RA. I believe there is some connection with Rebif exacerbating my RA latent genetic tendency, bringing it to the forefront.  There was no other change during this time.  It seems extremely coincidental.
Multiple Sclerosis	kris, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	1/24/2011 12:46:46 AM	I was on rebif for a year. I had awful flu-like syptoms that never went away, got better, and felt no relief from motrin, tylenol, asprin or anything over the counter. Got so i dreaded my shot days because i was absolutely miserable. My MRI showed a few more lessions after the year but small ones. My stomach was the easiest to inject. I had no real bothersome injection site reactions, just red blotches. IAm now on copaxone it burns more, and leaves welts and bruising at the injection site. Other than that I can't even tell I have given myself a shot. HOORAY:)

I took my first shot of Copaxone and it gave me a seizure in the doctors office.  A few months later I tried Rebif and have been very please with the results. No signs of MS since I started Rebif except for the damage that was already done. My MRI's show no new lesions. I take rebif before I go to bed and also take an advil along with it.  Usually I am side effect free besides the occasional headache.  I recommed Rebif and hope people are side effect free like I usually am.

It was very effective in that I had no new lesions and my MRI's always showed good results. However I did have to go on lovastatin and synthroid once I started Rebif. The absolute worst part was the depression that resulted in me attempting the worst, trying to take my own life.  I am now off the Rebif and am waiting to get on Copaxone.  Rebif will mess with your emotions, seriously.  It worked for me and my MS symptoms, but at what cost?

Have become sicker and sicker since starting the drug one year ago. Doc. is not interested in stopping or changing to a new regimen. Constipation, stomach pain, weakness, foggy headed, fatigued to mention a few. I too wonder if MS is the problem or the rebif. I only had one thing suggesting MS, the brain lesions. Other problems were resolved with spinal injections and flomax. So, I will be making a decision soon whether to keep shooting up this &quot;chinese hamster ovary cell&quot; stuff or to take my chances with the disease. 
Multiple Sclerosis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/27/2010 1:45:39 PM	I was diagnosed in 2001 and started with Copaxone which left site reactions.  I then started Avonex which was hard to administer and my health insurance moved it to the formulary list so it was no longer a covered treatment. I began Rebif after having read the reviews for several years.  I have been relatively symptom free since.  I take it at night so the fatigue is not as noticeable and two advil so I don't feel beat up the next morning.  It is a blessing to have this medication available and to be able to use it.

Was not given the option for treatment then. Relapsed in October of 09. Chose to start on Rebif. It took me many months to even begin to recover from the relapse, and of course there was some residual symptoms from the MS. I missed an injection here and there in the beginning, but since have done each injection faithfully. I learned to pre med, and do my injections before bed, and didn't seem to have any real problems with side effects. BUT! I began feeling worse and worse all the time. I just felt awful and it seemed like it started in the pit of my stomach and radiated down my legs and my arms. I had a continuous headache that nothing helped to alleviate. I started to feel extremely weak and physically fatigued, which got worse all the time. Lower back pain, balance and coordination got progressively worse. Thought I was having a flare up, went for IV steroids, no real improvement, kept getting weaker. Kept telling doc, she treated me like I was an idiot. Found a new doc, but have only seen him once so far. I understand you shouldn't, but I did my own experiment. Skipped one dose, felt better. Did next dose, felt sick again. Skipped Friday and felt wonderful after a few days!! I have not done an injection since and continue to improve. I haven't felt this good in a long, long time! I will never do Rebif injections again! It was making me worse than my actual MS! I admit my last MRI showed improvement, but if the treatment is worse than the disease, and there is no quality of life on the drug, is it really worth it? How much worse would I have got if I had not experimented on my own? I was scared to death that my MS was getting much worse and more rapidly! Turns out it was Rebif that made me so sick! Glad it works well for others, but definitly not the choice for me! I questioned everytime I did an injection, what I was really putting in my body! How many people get worse due to the treatment and don't even know it? Scarey!

I went off the medication for 2 years and started it again May 2010.  I tolorate Rebif very well, my only side effect is injection site redness.  I've only had the one MS episode, my residual issues are limb tingling and numbing sensations that worsen from weather changes and/or fatigue.

After 14 months on that, I had an allergic reaction. I was put on Rebif. After about 1 year on Rebif I had the same allergic reaction that I had to the Betaseron. The reaction was itching all over, hives, chills and some shortness of breath. The injection site reactions were bruising with round red splotches and tenderness of the injection sites. I'm not on any medication right now and am waiting to be approved to get on Copaxone. My symptoms before the reaction to Rebif were little to none. I never had the flu like symptoms with Rebif or the Betaseron.

Multiple Sclerosis	 bsweetp, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	6/18/2010 9:18:23 AM	I was diagnosed in February 2010 and started Rebif in March. After 3 months on this medication, I have had only the occassional headache (and I can't guarantee that it's the Rebif), but no other flu-like symptoms. My first blood work came back fine, no elevation of liver enzymes. The injection site reactions are there, I get red splotches and was bruising pretty badly. However, the MS Lifelines nurse suggested changing the injector depth and so far no bruising after doing that. I rotate through my stomach, thighs, lower back and then the next time instead of thighs I do my arms. Seems to work to give each tender area (thighs and arms) a break.The injector is pretty easy to use, however I have to have my husband's help when using it on my arms. I can't seem to do them one handed. Otherwise, pretty easy to use.The medication does sting sometimes, but not everytime, however it's brief. Massaging the spot afterwards helps a great deal. All in all, I recommend this medication. 3x times a week is better than every day in my book. I will have my first MRI later this year to see how the medication is working. I hope it is! So far I don't think I've had any flare ups, although I was put on oral steroids for 5 days, but my Neuro couldn't be positive it wasn't related to just being sick with a cold or virus. Regardless, I do recommend you try this medication, however everyone is different. Best of luck!

I could tell a big improvement about 6 months into treatment. Almost 5 years later, and I am happy with my life and my choice to take Rebif. I have some side effects, usally the morning after my injection but not enough to keep me from going to work everyday.

Was in a clinical trial April 2004. Started Betaseron. Turned out I was on double dose. No side effects at all. After 41/2 years trial ended. I had more lesions on my brain and cervical spine. Dr. put me on Copaxone. Was on for 1 year. Major skin issues on my legs. Major tissue damage. Many indentations. Then I was put on Rebif. Has been about 9 months and feel lousy. My white count is half of what the low normal should be. I have no shin issues. Make sure I massage site after injecting. My last MRI had more in my spine. I really want to get get off of it and see how I feel.
Multiple Sclerosis	LifeizGood, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	1/30/2010 9:54:29 AM	I have been on Rebif since my MS diagnosis in early 2004, but I am going to stop using it now (Jan 2010).  It has been a great medicine for me up until late summer 2009, when I started getting MS symptoms.  Up until then, I only had minor symptoms such as occasional minor numbness and tingling, so while on Rebif my MS was in control for over 5 years.  After the flu-like symptoms when I first started the injections, I have had no problems with the 3X/week injections.  I use the Rebiject, but on occasion have done the manual shot.  I have had NO problems with injection site reactions.  I warm the syringe up to room temp, and rotate between right and left leg, butt, and belly. (Can't bring myself to do the arms.)  I rub the skin after the injection to make the medicine spread/absorb, and to lessen any sting.  The pain is not bad.  Sometimes it feels a little hot when you inject the med, nothing too bad.  I find the abdomen and butt locations hurt least.  But again, the pain is quite minor if any.  I was not thrilled when I was told I needed to self inject, but once you get used to it IT IS NO BIG DEAL.  The benefit of the medication far outweighs any distaste for the delivery mechanism!  I keep track of my injection locations on my kitchen calendar.  So, if your dr. recommends rebif, be assured it is not bad.  I am about to go on copaxone, since my MRI's are showing new lesions, and my balance/walking has deteriorated significantly over the past few months.  For some reason the interferon is no longer working for me.  But it was great while it did!

I have also developed spondylosis of the lower and upper spine. Rebif at first had severe side effects:migrains, severe chills, nasal congestion.Now, after 3 months, these effects are almost gone. Very happy and looking forward to work at home on my computer.
Multiple Sclerosis	living life, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	12/5/2009 6:52:41 PM	I was diagnosed December of 2007.  I was put on Rebif immidiately and have had no further advances of the disease.  Redness at injection site and chills on injection day still continue.  Those looking for an answer with the elevated liver tests, it did almost take a year for mine to come down to normal. So hang in there.  There are many advances every day for this and I keep a positive attitude and don't let my limitaions get to me.  My grandmother had MS and was diagnosed in her 20's and lived a productive healthy life to her 60's before needing to be in a wheel chair, she then still lived on to her 80's. So keep strong and always move forward.

For the most part, I don't mind, other than sometimes disliking 3x/week injections - but if it is going to help me, it's worth it. I started with the titration pack, and after being at 44mcg for about a month, the flu like symptoms really decreased. EXCEPTION being that if I get a vaccine of any kind, and have Rebif that night, I'll throw a high fever. I have managed to wean myself completely off of taking any painkillers after my shots, as Rebif is bad for the liver, and so are painkillers. The nurses check in with me every month or so, and seemed glad to hear that I am able to do so. Unfortunately, despite what they seem to believe, there is no end to the injection site reactions. I use the autoinjector, which definitely helps (the two times I had to do without was horrible!), but that is a personal choice... some find it to be the opposite. Although they suggest using all sites, my legs react too much, and I have small arms, so I have stuck with the abdominal area. Regardless of their suggestions, there is always a red area which lasts from one to two weeks.My largest concern now is the effect on the liver. My blood tests at 3 months showed elevated AST and ALT readings, although the hospital didn't seem concerned. I am trying to eat healthier and take reasonable supplements in hopes it prevents damage, but it terrifies me that the same medicine I may need to function may indeed destroy me!

My dr started me on Rebif right away and I have not had any relapses.  However, since being on the Rebif for 4 years, my Thyroid is all messed up and I have to take daily meds.  These meds have completely messed up my menstral cycle and I go for months without a period.  My blood count is low and am now anemic.  My hair is also falling out and I had extreme lower back pain and stiffness.  So against my dr's orders, I stopped taking the shots 3 weeks ago.  Already, I feel better and my mind seems clearer.  My back pain is easing up and I have more energy.  I can't wait to see how I feel after 6 weeks without the shots.  Good luck to everyone who is on it, I know everyone has a different experience.

Multiple Sclerosis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	8/12/2009 10:27:21 PM	Been on Rebif since diagnosis 9/2007. Occasional injection site flare ups and flu symptoms, but have had no exacerbations since beginning treatment.  Easy to inject yourself, but my husband usually does it for me.  Much better than IV steroids to control exacerbations!!  Thanks Rebif!

Relapses wouldn't quit this year, s the drs switched me to Rebif. Very few side effects (maybe joint pain but that could from unrelated causes -- too much gardening!). Don't know yet if it will reduce relapses in the long term. I can only hope!

Multiple Sclerosis	Doosie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	7/2/2009 1:15:49 PM	Rebif is not the drug for me. I felt like I had the flu 24/7. My dr. still felt I should continue, but I have a job and a family. I can not be sick all the time. I hated the auto-injector &amp; preferred just taking the injections. I can not take NSAID's &amp; tylenol did nothing to help. The nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, &amp; constant headache was not worth any benefit in my opinion. I also felt miserably depressed &amp; did not feel taking an antidepressant was the right choice for me since I was not depressed prior to taking Rebif. I was also very upset with the drug company &amp; their assistance program. After numerous attempts of telling them I did not want a nurse to come out &amp; that I was not responding well. They kept calling &amp; calling despite my requests that they please stop &amp; insisted that tylenol would make the symptoms tolerable for me. After 6 months of this, I changed my #. After the worst year of my life (physically-I got down to 98 lbs at 5'5&quot;, I stopped the Rebif. Interferon is not for me. Now I have no insurance to fund any treatment, but I feel better than I did with Rebif even with relapses!
Multiple Sclerosis	Loz18, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	6/24/2009 11:08:37 PM	I rarely get the flu-like symptoms that are supposedly so common with Rebif.  Every now and then I'll get a low fever, headache and chills, but it passes quickly and it's no big deal.  I use a Rebiject II auto injector, and it's pretty easy.  Once you get used to it, you can do it in less than 5 minutes.  My biggest problem with Rebif has been the injection site reactions.  I used to get huge red welts every time I injected, but it's starting to decrease a little now, after 9 months on it.  I've tried every remedy the MS Lifelines nurses recommended, but what's worked best for me is to apply raw, unfiltered, organic apple cider vinegar to my injection sites once or twice a day.  Sounds crazy, but I see a noticeable improvement since I started the vinegar.  As far as how the Rebif is performing for me, my 6-month MRI showed fewer lesions and I've had no major exacerbations in the past year.  I wish the Rebif could lessen my everyday MS symptoms, but I guess they haven't invented a drug that can do that yet.  For now I'm just happy to slow the progression of the disease and not get any exacerbations.  Before the Rebif, I had 2 major exacerbations in one year.  Hang in there!  Stay positive!  Best of luck to you. 
Multiple Sclerosis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	35-44	6/16/2009 8:50:55 PM	I was diagnosed with MS in February 1999. I waited until I had my 2nd episode, 2 years later to get on meds. Tried Avonex first, flu like reactions were OK, but I couldn't give myself the shots so switched to Rebif about 1 year later. Rebif was working OK for 7 years. I dislike 3x per week shots, have a permanent knot the size of a large pea in one haunch and sore in both haunch sites, flu symptoms not great. Using Tylenol more than 2x per week caused rebound headaches, using ibuprofen more than 2x per week caused acid reflux. I could have lived with all that because I could do it myself, it wasn't everyday and best of all no flareups since I used either meds (over 8 years!). But now I have to decide whether to stay on Rebif, it's has disabled my thyroid. (This site say 3% chance of thyroid damage.) Even if I switch to copaxone my thyroid may not recover. So now I'm very nervous about my liver which has a slightly higher rate of incidents of damage. (This site says 4% chance for liver damage.)
Multiple Sclerosis	aSnowGirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	6/4/2009 8:13:50 PM	I was diagnosed with MS 8 years ago. I am now 33. My first &quot;attack&quot; was 12 years ago. I didn't know what it really was. I just had my first attack in 6 years 3 months ago and my doc started me on Rebif. At first it was fine.  The auto-injector shot was easy enough (I was on Copaxone for a year- that was 6 years ago), no site injections really, just a headache the next morning. Then the dose went up to the .44. The drug burns going in, I bruise at the site, I can't sleep at night, and the next day I'm down with the worst muscle aches- like someone beat me up with a baseball bat. I have always done the shot at bedtime and took 3 Advil.  I am now taking 4 Advil at night and I am still having all of the symptoms the next day. On top of that I am noticing I am losing hair, feeling depressed and having suicidal thoughts. I am wondering if it's worth it to keep taking this drug. I am so not myself on this.

But my doctor was positive that rebif would be the best one for me.  I'm so happy we went that way.  Rebif has saved my life.  I'm able to run after my kids, the only scary thing for me about rebif is when I got pg with my third child I was almost a month along before I knew it and I was taking the rebif.  But lucky for me, nothing happened to him.  But I'm thankful for rebif, gives me more time to play around with my kids.

(diagnosed 02/20/2007) I do experience injection-site reactions. I get red circles and the skin becomes dry (lotion helps!). In the beginning, I'd say for the first 7-10 months, I experienced flu-like symptoms (fever, fatigue, body aches). To beat them I inject at night, take Tylenol, and sleep it off. For me, the side effects are a small price to pay. I've been in remission since April 2007 and there is only marginal differences in my MRIs as far as the number of lesions. Rebif has definitely been beneficial to say the least. For the most part, I lead a normal life. God only knows where I'd be today without it!

I couldn't do it otherwise. I had several spots on my neck &amp; 1 faint one in my brain on my 1st MRI's with contrast. My next set after being on Rebif for 6 months, only showed the ones in my neck. The one in my brain had been coated by the medication &amp; not showing up any longer.

After researching this drug, I hate shots, I decidded this was the best to try. I am thrilled. I only have a small rash around the site. I take Baclofen for spasticity and 3Advil, 1D3, 1 multi- vitamin, COQ10 in the Am and Baclofen and 2 Advil in the PM. I have had very minor relapses and they usually go away. I would recommend this drug. Mary in Virginia
Multiple Sclerosis	teacher425, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	2/5/2009 5:24:36 PM	I started with Copaxone right when I was diagnosed and had several relapses within the time I was using it. Since starting Rebif I have been relapse free and feeling good. Have had some &quot;next morning headaches&quot; but only when I skip taking the Advil before injection. It has only been about 4 months but I think this medication has been a God send. I'll put up with the headaches and the occasional injection site burning because I think it's really making a difference.

I take it before bed, so I sleep through any headaches and side effects that occur.  I also follow the shot with some sort of pain reliever, typically Aleve.  Every once in a while, I feel like I wake up with a Rebif &quot;hangover&quot; but if thats the worse of my problems with the drug, I'll take it!  this drug is working wonderfully for me!

I inject just before going to bed and have have few symptoms.I get migrains, but had those before taking Rebif.I am thankful for Rebif.Twenty years ago, my doctor thought the strange symptoms I was having were MS, but couldn't confirm.  There were no medications then.  I am lucky that my MS isn't worse, and that now I can try to manage it.
Multiple Sclerosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	25-34	1/24/2009 9:24:31 PM	It's been almost a year since I was diagnosed with MS and started Rebif right away.  Rebif was the first and only therapy I have been on.  The first six months was a little rough.  I had flu like symptoms and loss of bladder control on occasion, especially during the night.  Currently these symptoms have decreased.  I've had a few relapses while on Rebif, (walking issues and weakness in hand).  I was given a five day High Dose IV Steriod treatment and made a full recovery.  Before starting Rebif, I was walking with a cane, unable to drive (due to loss of foot control) and unable to freely walk up and down curbs.  I honestly believe Rebif has kept me walking which is my main goal in fighting this disease at 33 years of age!  I haven't been symptom free like some patients I've read about taking this drug, but I can't imagine what shape I'd be in not taking treatments.  Good Luck to all!

I think however that I am experiencing the side effects.. I am retaining water and it is very uncomfortable.  I am taking water pills and thyroid pills and I lost some of the water weight, but I gained 50+ lbs.. so I am not really that enthused..I appreciate not relapsing, but I want to not feel like I am lugging around 10-20 gallons of water!  I lost some of my energy, but I think that is more out of frustration.. So I am thinking of changing to something else, but I am scared that I go on something else and then I sick and become complete unfunctionable..
Multiple Sclerosis	easterlawn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/16/2008 7:39:16 PM	I have been on Rebif for 3 years now and, when I think of the alternative, I think it has been totally worth it.  I do get site reactions from time to time but they have gotten better over the years.  I take all three syringes out of the fridge at the beginning of the week so they are always at the right temperature.  I use the auto injector (great invention!) and I find that if I remove the syringe cap and express the air bubble, replace the cap and then put in the injector and ADJUST the depth according to the fattiness of the site, I have better results.  My arms are very slim to I inject on a 2.  My hip and stomach has more fat so I use a 3.  I also have a hydrocortisone cream prescription that I use if I see some redness and itching at the site and it helps tremendously as does rubbing the spot thoroughly immediately after injecting.  I take the shots at night and usually sleep through the flu-like symptoms.  I am tired the next day but I have that anyway with the MS so I can't say for sure that the Rebif is the prime culprit.  I have been paralyzed and unable to do anything for myself before and, now, I work as a first grade teacher every day and take care of my family all under my own steam.  Anything I can do to keep that going is absolutely worth it!
Multiple Sclerosis	Abimona, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	12/13/2008 9:19:03 PM	I have been on rebif, since september of this year (2008). Upon trying the autoinjector, I found it to be easy and stuck to using this method. Given that I started with the titration package, the dosage was smaller and probably easier to use/ inject an &quot;ingest&quot;. Over the short period using it, the last month seemed a little painful after injecting. Besides this, my hair started coming out when combed and now my scalp is extremely sensitive to te point that it hurts to even touch and bleeds when my index finger is on the scalp. I decided to decrease my 3X weekly dosage to 2Xs and my last injection- I can't be sure, but it resulted in a severe reaction that occured during sleep. I was buring up- my temperature felt like over 200 degrees and even worse my jaw was locked, my fingers became clamped and I began shivering like crazy. Again, I can't be sure if it's the Rebif medication, but this is the only new medication I've been taking and if this is the case, I am not- CAN NOT go back on it.
Multiple Sclerosis		5	3	4			12/7/2008 12:34:05 AM	I have been using rebif for three years now and it has been worth the injection site soreness and runny nose.  I take the shots before I go to bed and always take two advil after each shot.  Since taking rebif there hasnt been any new problems at all with MRI's to back that statement.  Rebif is right for me and works for me the best.

Im always sick. Flu like. Head aches. I feel worse now then before taking Rebif. Considering stopping the shots. Try to lead a better quality of life since there is no guarentee on the meds for the future. If its not broke now, dont fix it. Being on the shots is not worth it. They hinder me from day to day life.

I have been using the auto injector for aabout a year and a half and have had injection site reactions, and flu like symptoms every time.  However, I have recently stopped using the injector pen and have found it SO MUCH BETTER! I  think controlling the rate at which the meds enter in the skin makes a difference to the pain of the injection.It is virtually pain free injections now.  I take two advils in the middle of the night when I wake up fluey, and then I'm fine from then on.  Don't have any other other &quot;side-effects&quot; than that, and I am very appreciative.  All in in all, I think it was a fairly easy drug to deal with.  Don't let the needles bother you, you WILL get past your initial unease about that.  It does get better.  It is worth it.

I have had a headache ever since I have been taken it and no migraine medicine has help.  I have had to stop taking this drug.  I did not have migraines before I had MS.  I just want people to relize if you have headaches and you can't get rid of them it could be the rebif even though it is helping your MS.

Rebif, doesn't create the same site discomforts that I received with Copaxone or the side effects. I wish and pray for a cure for all MS. I hate that it's in my life.Some times I cry when I see the box in my refirgerator, then I remember Annette Funcacella, and the mom of the writer of Harry Potter novels and I thank God again and take my injection. It's not easy  but I know that those ladies and so many other like them would've loved to have had Rebif, Avonex and Copaxone. I just want a cure. I'd like to run free again. I'd like not to get too hot in the summer months and have those symptoms. I pray that that day will come and come soon.

I have been using Rebif for almost a year now, and it has been great, Rebif is the only medicine I have been on so I am very satified with results. I take two tylenols or advils 30 mins. before injections, then I rub injection area for 2 mins and go about my life. Even though sometimes I use an auto injector if that makes any differences, I see great results. Thanks Rebif
Multiple Sclerosis	mavyn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	45-54	7/4/2008 11:03:06 PM	Rebif has been the best option of the three meds.(rebif, copaxone, betaseron) that I have tried in the past 5 years since diagnosis. It is the most effective for managing my symptoms- no more balance issues/eyesight has stabilized (gases test show no more glaucoma like issues!), I feel that in general I have more symptom and health stability while taking it REGULARLY and ON SCHEDULE (very important no matter how much it sucks!) I take 22 mcg. not 44 as I was initially prescribed - the 44 was too strong and the 22 seems to be easier on my system and just as effective. I had to insist on sticking with the 22 mcg dose to my Nuero.- He did not initially agree, but has since.Site injections suck; they all do. I have dimples, slight discoloration (not too awful but stick with the areas that only your family will see on your body) no problems at all with using the butt cheeks, much less sting and site reaction.they improve the ph each year and it gets easier after awhile with the auto-injector.The important thing is to get the stuff warm by holding the needle out of the packaging in your hand prior to injecting and use aloe vera gel immediately after- ALSO my husband massages the injection site with a hot washcloth prior to and right after injection- this has helped immensely.

I do get injection site reatctions but manageable w/ heat or witch hazel.  After 3 years I still have flu like symptoms but I am sure that is from not staying on preferred course of treatment... I find it hard to remember to take them and when I do it is too late at night... leaving my with flu like sypmtoms in the morning still.  I have seen treamendous postive effects when I did follow treatment as written... I have also seen unfaborable MRI results after not followin treatement... Moral of the story.... STAY ON TREATMENT

The needle's much smaller, so I don't mind giving myself the injection.

The main problem is with the injection sites, my skin seems to be depressed in the area of the injection, its quite a large patch that seems to be affected. This has done a fairly good job for me
Multiple Sclerosis	Trish, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	3/17/2008 7:05:12 PM	I have found that using this drug for about 1 year that it has damaged my immune system to where I find myself always getting sick.My DR. says that it isnt the MS but the rebif. So now I am at the point to where I have to decide whether its worth it. I find it difficult to hold down a job when I am always coming down with something. And that didnt even happen when  the MS was at its worst for me.So my advice to those thinking about using it be careful and keep a journal loggging anything different with your overall health.

It sure has helped me and I recommend it. One thing though is that it stings when injected it has a ph of 3.8
Multiple Sclerosis	Melissa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	25-34	2/18/2008 3:33:55 PM	Overall this med. isn't that bad. It does leave bruising after inject. I had my first relapse after taking it for 4 months and that IV was no fun. I like that the rebif is so easy, esspecially for those who don't like needles. 
Multiple Sclerosis	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	2/8/2008 9:47:40 AM	Either created or worsened depression to the point where I had suicidal ideas. After I stopped using it, these thoughts went away. My Neuro is changing my treatment to a non-interferon
Multiple Sclerosis	DukeDraven, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	45-54	2/3/2008 9:38:55 PM	I've been using it for almost two months and I've seen significant improvement during this period. However, I can't honestly say if Rebif is responsible for my improvement or whether the disease is just going into remission. The only way to find out is to go off the drug and I can't take that chance, so I'll give Rebif a passing rating. I have thing about needles, too, but the injector takes away that fear and makes it easy. One word on the inventor: Genius!

REBIF use 2 yrs +. Continue to experience moderate to severe flu-like symptoms -- especially headaches. If I have any other health complication REBIF dosage seems to excerbate the effects of my overall health.  Effectiveness is a major plus and I am supremely thankful that at my age I am still able to live independently.

The flu-like symptoms are still there as well, just not as severe.  No exerbations since begining use!  That's good enough for me!

However there are still days that I still find it difficult to even inject, but I think that is all part and parcel with it.

I feel worse now than I did befor I started taking rebif. This was my first choice and the doctors recommended. But Im considering changing due to the pain level I have.

Of all the MS medicines I have taken, I've had few side effects with Rebif and certainly few relapses (less than 1 per year verses 1 every 3 to 4 months.)
Multiple Sclerosis	Mike, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Male	45-54	10/17/2007 8:18:17 PM	I have used rebif for three weeks now. I still have slight head aches, but have found that pre medication helps greatly. So far I have not had a flar up since I started treatment. My motor skils in my right hand seemed to have inproved. I can once again shave and brush my teeth without having to use two hands. I still get tired easily and can not take heat well. Over all I feel very positive about my treatment.

Multiple Sclerosis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	9/20/2007 10:31:36 AM	The only side effect I have had is a minor skin irritation at the injection site.  The ease of injection and lack of side effects has greatly reduced my anxiety about the drug therapy.
Multiple Sclerosis		1	1	1			9/18/2007 1:10:14 AM	My body produced antibodies against the medicine and became imune to it
