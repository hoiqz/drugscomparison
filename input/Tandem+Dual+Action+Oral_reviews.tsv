Easey to take but have to add a stool softener.  My only complaint is that I have gained 15 pounds because it makes me hungry all the time.

Other		1	4	1			5/7/2008 12:45:44 PM	I have been having problems keeping this medicine down.  I just began taking it a few days ago, and have consistently vomited within 45 minutes of having taken the drug. This may just be my body getting used to the drug. I have consulted my physician to see if there are any alternative drugs that I can take.
