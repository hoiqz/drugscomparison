It has been as effective as prescription Protonix, and almost as effective as nexium

In May of this year, he became ill and test showed that he now has kidney failure due to taking this drug.  He no longer takes it for his heartburn.  He almost died from taking this, plus had to be on dialysis or a transplant list.  Thankfully, the reason for the kidney failure was found and he was taken off the drug in time.  He is still having issues from the kidney failure.

Completely stopped heartburn after first pill. Stopped coughing, stopped the swallowing problem of some foods also. Works great, but a couple weeks after the end of the 14 day treatment it all came back. Doesn't matter what I eat. Debating if I should just keep using it.

I kept taking it because it worked. I had an endoscopy and they said nothing was wrong with me....but I still have constant heartburn day and night for the past 7 years. I am worried about the long term use of this product, but I can't stop it because it helps. I dislike going to doctors so I will continue self-treating.

The next morning after my  first dose I was lightheaded. I took the second dose and the next day I was again lightheaded and near dizzy. I stopped taking it and the lightheaded symptons slowly went away over next couple days.

It happen continually on while on the medication and once I stopped the pain stopped.Let me know if any of you experience this problem.Thanks
Other	ca215, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	3/2/2012 10:40:30 AM	Went to PCP to ask for help with 10-years-ongoing pain both hips ranging from intolerable on &quot;good&quot; days to intractable pain on bad days.Doc claimed, after I told him I had approx two months of vomiting once or twice a week, that what I need is prilosec.Dr began dosage of PREVACID, 15mg @midday, gave me 14 capsules to use over 2 week period after which I'm supposed to go to appointment with him to tell him (quote) &quot;How this works for your pain.&quot;Right. Pain. I do not have the heartburn for which dr said he was offering me the Prevacid.Apparently vomiting = heartburn, in drs' opinion.NO. I tried to explain I do not get heartburn, indigestion, any of his other euphemisms.That is I didn't get those things before starting the Prevacid.If this is supposed to be the precursor to Prilosec and another 14-day course of medicating, I'm not sure I can get through it. And: if I do make it through the total of 4 weeks of Prevacid, then Prilosec, doc wants me to accept Relafen.Please urge your doctor to LOOK at your file. Mine does not do that especially as regards vivid and rapidly-occurring adverse effects due to present health issues and other meds being used at the time of using the Prevacid then move to Prilosec to be followed by the Relafen.Dr doesn't like it if I check on things he wants me to do according to what I think must be his &quot;Let's try THIS on her&quot; school of medical treatment.Of course he doesn't bother to check on other meds being used or health issues that might interact badly and cause further problems than exist now.Effects, after only 3 days: upset stomach, slight nausea, flatulence, burping, belching bile into throat and mouth, headache...and, according to Dr Wonderful (yeah right) the anti-acid med should reduce pain begun 10 years ago after hip- breaking fall and shoddy repair surgery.Dr claims I will be able to reduce dosage of painmasker meds. I don't understand that at all and he would not explain it to me.

Prilosec started helping within 18 hrs, This is my 5th day and I am feeling great. I will continue to take it for the 14 days in order to make sure my stomach has healed. I guess I am just going to have to tolerate the pain of the arthritis and watch what I am given for infections, ect.

The stomach pain was horrible and my blood pressure shot up for about two hours, until the med started wearing off.  I will not take this anymore. I am interested to know if anybody has had such a sudden and horrible reaction. I will try Zantac instead.

Just found out via endoscopy I have acid gonig up into my esophagus - nothing really bad, but my doc put me on prilosec. I immediately asked for the 10mg daily.  Took it and within days became constipated, my stomach and intestines &quot;ache&quot;, my stomach and intestine areas are so bloated that it affected my back - caused great pain -  and I became apathetic to my boyfriend - which is ridiculous and random and came out of nowhere - then I read online that it does change your mood/personality.  I went off of it and symptoms began improving.  My doc &quot;poo poohed&quot; my side efrects and insisted there weren't any.  I'm now going to a different doctor and will never go back on prilosec.

Also helped aleviate some of my stomache pain(going for the wonderful tests to find out the cause next week)but be careful if you take medication for diabetes!!!! Prilosec interferes with the absorption of your meds if taken at the same time. This caused extremely high readings until the pharmacist told me to take a couple of hours apart which is hard to do as you are supposed to take both with food.  Just work with your doctor.

I was still having stomach problems, so my doctor recommended Prilosec. Note; I never had heartburn or acid reflux problems before. The first day of treatment I had diarrhea about an hour after taking the medication. The second day was worse, good thing I had nothing to do because I would have had to drag my toliet around. I stopped after the third day when not only the diarrhea was worse, but I was getting anxious feelings and real jumpy. It was like I drank a pot of coffee. This was only after three days on this stuff, it's obvious this medication was not for me.

After a scopy, the doctor realized I had LPR and most of the other symptoms. I started taking Prilosec and Zantac. It was generally tolerated in the beginning and was effective (as a second scopy revealed 8-9 weeks later). However, 7 weeks into treatment I started having an irregular heartbeat and major fatigue. Irregular heartbeat stopped the day I stopped taking it (I ran out so it happened this way). A doctor put me on AcipHex for now. I've also made all the lifestyle and behaviorial modifications one can make to help the issue: sleeping on a 6-inch wedge, eating healthy and non-acid producing foods, small meals, not eating within 2-3 hours before bedtime, etc.

I visited Doctors at the University of Southern California swallowing center who, after a number of tests considered surgery which I rejected after speaking with the surgeon, and as a last resort prescribed Prilosec. Very soon after beginning its use the condition improved. That was in about 1996 and I have been taking the drug ever since. I have on ocasion stopped only to have the condition return. so far I have not experienced any side effects.

Switched to generic version about a year ago and it seems to work just as well. However, after reviewing some of the comments about weight gain, I'm beginning to wonder if mine is a side effect. I workout daily and have most of my adult life but in recent years have gained about 30 pounds. Until reading some of the comments on here, I assumed it was age and a slowing metabolism but now I'm suspicious of side effects.

I was put on Tagamet and Axid etc. and they did nothing for my acid reflux and heartburn. When prilosec came out, I was then given a prescription for it.  It was the most amazing thing I've ever taken for heartburn in my life. I am pain free, and can eat just about anything out there. I've tried the generic and it doesn't seem as effective. Since the OTC came out, I buy that, as my insurance quit paying for the Rx version. Also, prevacid seems to work the same way, but as there is no OTC for it, I stick with prilosec. Been taking it now for over 5 years, and I have not noticed a single side effect, or weakness, or anything that has been described. Hopefully, I can continue to take the medication without any problems for a very long time, and I hope something isn't building up inside because of it that I don't know about. But right now, it's better than vomiting acid and waking up coughing due to acid in my esophogaus. I don't miss that at all.

Sometimes I forget for a day or two and without fail, I'll get heartburn/indigestion.  I've noticed that since taking omeprazole, I have become predisposed to bladder infections, yeast infections, and bacterial vaginosis.  I believe the pH of both systems is being affected and I'm really surprised that these are rare or unmentioned side affects.  Also just was diagnosed with chronic endometritis, which can occur as a result of untreated asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis.  I had no idea - I'm clean and (I thought) healthy.  Every once in a while I'd get a fishy odor (sorry!) but it would go away.  Now I find out this is not normal and needs antibiotics (and then diflucan).   Tell your doctor and report this to the FDA via medwatch if it affects you too!

I was prescribed 4 Prilosec per day, which I took for 2 weeks and had awful anxiety attacks, pins and needles feelings in my fingers, and heart palpitations. I dropped the dosage down to 2 pills a day, which eliminated most of those side effects, however, I have been losing weight at an alarming rate, and worst of all, the sensation of something being stuck in my throat has not gone away after taking Prilosec for a total of 6 weeks now! I pray there is some better medication than this.

Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	ryanpatrik, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	4/1/2009 9:15:10 AM	I was switched to this from Prevacid because insurance demanded it. Seems to do the same excellent job but I have been gaining some weight. After reading other reviews I wonder if the drug slows metabolism in some way. Other research I found suggested taking the 20mg dose every other day and I am going to try that. If it still works at the very least I will save some money! I guess I will have to eat less and work out more to stop the weight gain, which has been 8-9 pounds in 3 months. I wonder if those of us who are experiencing weight gain are just eating a bit more because we feel better? I am going to try to figure that out over the next few months.
Treatment to Prevent Heartburn	bella, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	3/31/2009 10:28:25 PM	I took Prevacid for years and insurance no longer wanted to pay w/o trying Prilsec OTC.  I tried the generic brand and immediately developed severe constipation, bloating, weight gain, anxiety attack(thought I was dying and went to hospital), abdominal pain,  sluggish, now diagnosed with IBS because none of my doc's believe the Prilosec had anything to do with these symptoms even though that is when the trouble started.  Thousands of dollars later and a colonoscopy and endoscopy and numerous doctors visits and referals to specialists, I have now started back on the Prevacid and all symptoms disappeared within one month.  Recently had a mix up with my mail order pharmacy calling the doc and asking if it was ok to replace the Prevacid again with the Prilosec OTC and unfortunately for me he agreed without looking at my file and then I was without the Prevacid again until this was resolved.  During this two week period I took the generic Prilosec OTC that I had remaining from before and immediately all IBS symptoms returned.  Prevacid is very expensive and I could not afford it w/o insurance.  I hear it will be going to a generic in the future.  It won't be soon enough for me. Maybe then my insurance co will not have as big of a problem paying for it.  This drug absulutely caused me more misery and cost me and the insurance so much more than if they had of went ahead and paid for the Prevacid in the first place.  It may work for some and that's great, but it's definately not for me!

Last fall, I started experiencing many stomach problems. The GI said it was from the NSAID's and told me to take Prevacid each day. I had to stop taking it because it counter-acted all my other medications. He put me on Prilosec. I am always nauseated (so much that I take Dramamine every day to function). I am very bloated and have diarrhea - which the Prilosec is supposed to be helping. I can't seem to mustard up any energy. The Prilosec is better than the Prevacid, however, I feel that the effectiveness of my other medications are lessened.

It burned so bad that I would make myself throw up to get the acid out and that did the trick but it was awful. And I had acid reflux. Couldn't lie completely prone. Tried several of the more popular prescription drugs and nothing worked. Tried Prilosec OTC and it saved my life. Says it doesn't work immediately but it works very fast for me, 30 minutes or so. Don't know why. I've been taking it for about 6 years. My proctologist said if it is working, keep taking it, even tho it says take it for only 14 days. I have put on a lot of weight but did not associate it with Prilosec until I read some reviews here. Had severe leg cramps this summer and became very hydrated. I began taking potassium tabs. I sometimes become extremely lethargic - some here say that is a symptom. Is it? If I skip for a couple of days, the acid returns and it's unbearable. Am trying the generic this time. Seems to be working almost as well.

It helped at first with the heartburn and I was so relieved that I had finally found something to help.  However, about 2 months into treatment I noticed constant bloating in my upper abdomen and a dull ache.  I was also gaining weight even though I had not changed my diet.  I have gained about 15 pounds in the 4 months.  I also have a persistant tickling in the throat that makes me cough a lot.  I have just found out that I have what is known as fatty liver.  I have never had problems with my liver! I also have lower back and shoulder pain.  It seems I have developed all of the symptoms that others seem to have.  I also have felt &quot;panicky&quot; at times and flush in the face.  I am stopping the medicine and will try something else.

After taking for 5 days, I started to have serious trouble breathing. For every 10 secs I have to take a deep breath and it's almost 10days since I stopped taking this medicine but my breathing trouble doesn't go away. I went back to doctor, I asked me to do a check X-ray, EKG, Breath test. I am yet to do Stress test too. Its frustrating what this drug has done to me. It's inconvenient to take deep breath every 10 seconds. Hope this will go away. I am very scared now.Also after stopping to take this drug, I came to know what heart burn is. As before taking this medicine I never had any heart burn except have to clear my throat. I would suggest please observe for side effects very carefully when taking this medicine.

I quit it due to cost.  On Prilosec OTC I had diarrhea and bad stomach pains.  I went on the generic omaprezole and became very constipated.  Now the stomach pains are becoming intolerable and I have gained a lot of weight in spite of watching my diet.  I'm also having other pain which may or may not be from the drug.  I'm probably going to have to go back on Aciphex and cut my spending elsewhere.  Life is miserable enough with heartburn without suffering from the cure.

Whenever I tried to stop, my heartburn was much worse than when I first started the treatment.  I also had a lot of bloating, but did not make the connection.  When I started noticing that my hair was thinning considerably, I went on line to find out the causes of hair loss.  Imagine my surprise to find that acid inhibitors can cause hair loss.  I have also been diagnosed with osteoporosis, also a side affect of these drugs.  I have stopped using the Prilosec OTC and am trying to eat several small 'meals' a day and trying to eliminate the foods and drinks that trigger heartburn.Not easy because they are all my favorites, especially hot chocolate.

In the past 2, it has gotten so bad, I have drool poring out of my mouth like a water fountain and pain so bad I cant bare it. I can not eat anything i enjoy or drink a cup of coffee, and it was everyday. i took this medication and just like that, gone.  It was wonderful...for about a week.  Then side effects you wouldnt think of came in.  i had panic attacks that got worse and worse, and my body turned beat red like I was standing in the cold without a shirt on.  I dont know whats worse, GERD or panic attacks, they both suck.  But for my health, I will stop this medication, bc I would rather change what i eat and be more healthy then have panic attacks everyday and thinking Im dying.  i would recommend this, as long as you can deal with the side affects it gives you, everyone is different.  But don't get me wrong, it is the most affective prescription.

While it works for heartburn, other health problems creep up without you knowing it's from the Prilosec. I really suffered for the last 4 yrs. Went to the doctor many times and er 4 times in 6 weeks. Doctors didn't even know it was from Prilosec. No longer on Prilosec and I feel like a new person. This should be by prescription only.

I am so happy to be able to eat what I'd like without worrying about being up all night due to heartburn. I will get mild symptoms if I eat particularly greasy food or drink too much caffeine or alcohol. Overall I am very pleased with effectiveness and cost.
Treatment to Prevent Heartburn	Mar, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	11/11/2008 8:31:53 PM	Prilosec has been a great discovery for meI suffered from severe heartburn for the last 15 -20 years, however, for me now I have traded severe heatburn for severe diaherra. I have been taking Prilosec for over 2 years now, and the first year was great, but now I am so plagued by diaherrathat I am afraid to go out to eat or go shopping, or do anything where I can't RUN to the bathroom. The stomach cramps come first, hard and bad, and it's getting really bad now. I did try to discontinue using this drug, but found no others that worked to treat my agonizing heatburn, so I am torn between the lesser of two evils.

I took it for over 4 weeks and was constantly sick with upset stomach, couldn't eat, constipation and extreme fatigue.  As soon as I stopped taking it, these symptoms disappeared and I was able to finally eat a meal.

Recently changed to generic label with no problems.

Works great for pretty severe heartburn; however, as soon as I go off my heartburn returns.  The Directions say to use for only 14 days.  Obviously, many of the reviewers have used it much longer than that.  What's the story?

No heartburn and i could still eat and drink some of the things i Love, chocolate and coffee. But as of the last couple of months things have been going on that i now learn can be side effects of this drug. Terrible weight gain. And very bad lower back pain. I'm going to have my back checked out to make sure I haven't pulled something. But I somehow think it's a side effect.

However, I recently changed over to a generic OTC version and it seems to be ineffective, even though it's supposed to contain the sam ingredients!  When I return to Prilosec, the symptoms go away again.  Does anyone else have the same problem?

But, I was told that it blocks the acid that our intestines need to absorb vitamins.  Also, I developed gastritis? from meds. I was having pain mid chest to spine/back so M.D. ordered an upper g.i. series which showed gerd, hiatal hernia, and gastritis(last one scared me).  Now I am doing DGL (licorice root) but am not as comfortable as I was on Prilosec.  Confused and want facts as to cause of gastritis;bottom of esophagus was inflamed (esophagitis).

Did one 14 day session of Prilosec and it worked within 2 days.  Went off at end of 14 days and had another reflux attack 2 days later. Now taking it daily,but have begun to take only 1/2tablet due to stomach bothering me a bit to see how that works. Says not to but I figure it's worth a try. Let me know if something bad can happen by cutting tablet in two!  Otherwise very pleased.  Also taking iron supplement for anemia - not caused by taking this, tho.

Test showed irritation and scarring in the esophagus. Doctor prescribed Prilosec to be taken twice daily while symptoms exist. I have been taking prilosec OTC for two years with no problems. I have reduced the dose to once a day and I take the drug at the same time every morning. The overall results have been very good. No more sleepless nights due to acid reflux. I can eat most anything without having heartburn later.

I would get &quot;heartburn&quot; so bad that I would have to stop walking to let things &quot;settle back down&quot;, and would often prop myself up at night, using my bed pillows to create a &quot;ramp&quot; to keep everything where it was supposed to be!  The pain was so focused and intense, it would almost bring tears to my eyes.  I took unending hand fulls of Tums, Alka Seltzer, and anything else I hoped would work.  Nothing did!   Pirlosec OTC, taken once daily, for me, taking one pill daily has COMPLETELY eliminated any trace of heartburn. HOWEVER- it is supposed to be a 14 day treatment... if I avoid it for even 3 or 4 days (after using it regularly) the &quot;heartburn&quot; beast is BACK... just like it always was!  =-(

Did not like that I had to wait 4 months to take it again, and it doesn't explain why 4 months is the magic number. Changing my diet (LOTS of veggies) helped keep the acid down too, and I think that is the best thing anyone can do. The Prilosec allowed my stomach time to heal it's self if needed.

It got to the point that I was chewing them constantly. I tried Prilosec and I've never gone back to antacids. I take one a day  the first thing in the morning and it works all day for me. Two weeks ago I underwent an endoscopy(because I haven't been able to discontinue the Prilosec) and have been diagnosed with Barret esophagus.

While taking Aciphex I became anemic and Dr. said that was one of the side effects. I went on iron tabs. Been on Prisolec for 6 years and I am anemic again and taking iron again.Does anyone out there also have anemia from taking GERD meds also?I am concerned that it may be something else.

The itch got worse.  Having had a severe case of hives in the past, I was stunned to read on the internet that others had also experienced itching and hives upon taking this very effective drug to relieve heartburn.  However, when I stopped taking Prilosec, the rash disappeared immediately.  I opted instead to lose weight, change my diet and stop eating aftr 7:30 PM each night.  No more heartburn and no drugs!

I was to the point of constant heartburn, I couldn't sleep without a bottle of water beside my bed, and I had to keep liquid with me at work all day long. I would wake up in the middle of the night gasping for breathe it had gotten so bad. I decided to try Prilosec and I haven't had heartburn since. It has been over 6 months. I have to take it every day but I have it approved by my doctor. Nothing works as well as Prilosec... And it's only one pill a day!

It doesn't take effect immediately, so you really begin to feel better in the next 1-2 days.The drug is a bit expensive, but P&amp;G puts out coupons on a pretty regular basis.  I think this is also covered if you have a Health Savings Account set up to may for out-of-pocket medical costs and co-pays.
