This medication has been a life saver for me, and I would highly recommend this to anyone with this disorder.
Panic Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/28/2009 10:43:25 AM	That this med works fast in and helps relieve the attacks quickly.But can be a drug that is addictive.
Panic Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/27/2009 9:21:45 AM	I've used this in the past for panic attacks and it works wonders for me. I have not needed this med in a couple of years :) I am currently breastfeeding and am going thru some tough times right now and feel a panic attack coming on and really feel like I need to take my Niravam to help, but am worried about an interaction while nursing; does anyone have any thoughts on this by chance?!? i just want to be &quot;OK&quot; again without causing ANY problems with my 5 month old.

I t work wonders for my sleep and panic disorder. I use to only take 2mg now 6 mg aren't working. I want to take less of something stronger so eventually i can tap[er off. It is very frustrating when the medicine isn't working/active. I have wondered if my pharmacy is using old medications to sell me. What should I do?

Anxiousness associated with Depression	teriod, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/23/2008 8:57:45 PM	even tho i take antidepressants i sometime have panic attacks or a full blown episode of depression for a day or so. The niravam works quickly &amp; helps me feel &quot;normal&quot; again. it has helped me clear my head &amp; resume a normal life. as one person said, her boss made her feel worse &amp; I would caution telling any boss about this condition because there is still such a stigma (esp with males) that depression &amp; anxiety are only excuses that can be cures by &quot;pulling yourself up by your bootstraps&quot;I think a lot of anxiety is cause by bosses who make themselves feel better by putting down others - they should probably be on medication themselves.
Anxiousness associated with Depression	Bdrgnlady@aol.com, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	8/1/2008 12:37:16 PM	Niravam (1 mg 4x/day PRN) used with Cymbalta(60 mg. 2x/day) has been a life saver for me.  Having several deaths (my husband &amp; mother), and then loosing my home were just the icing on the cake.Thankfully, I have a psychiatrist who knows me well, and respects my knowledge of medication - giving me professional courtesy, as I was a mental health nurse.  We are able to sit and discuss my problems, and I am able to give him appropriate feedback.  My current dosage is extrememlyeffective, and I find that there are days when I do not have to use the full 4 mg. dosage.  This is encouraging, but knowing that the Niravam is there if I do need it iscomforting.Having lived with GAD and Clinical Depression since I was 17, and not knowing what it was until I entered the Mental Health field was a horror.  Thinking I was going to die while driving, having to pull over and catch my breath and wait for my heart to stop pounding at a very young age until I was 30, did not give me very much independence.  Upon learning how dibilitating these conditions were, and then being treated for them, certainly made a difference in my quality of life.Prior to the introduction of Niravam, I was taking alprazalome (generic), which was just ok, and did keep me calmer.  Now that Niravam is on the market, and was given to me immediately, I can't say enough about it.The only problem I'm having are the co-pays for both Niravam and Cymbalta (now $40 each every month), and it is becoming a hardship, as these are not the only high co-pays I have.  Patient assistance programs would certainly be beneficial to persons in my category, disabled, widowed, and on a fixed income.
Anxious	Misty, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/10/2008 10:43:38 PM	Two years ago I was abruptly let go from my job with no warning.  I was unable to sleep; thoughts kept going round and round in my head.  My psychiatrist prescribed Niravam and I had instant relief at night.  During the week I take 1/2 a pill and on weekends I take a whole pill.  I haven't taken Niravam during the day, so I don't know how it would work in stressful situations, but may try it soon as my current job is extremely stressful.
Anxiousness associated with Depression	suki2005, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/21/2008 10:08:37 PM	i've taken aprazolam before in its regular pill form but the Niravam works so much faster.I began a high stress job &amp; my thinking was so muddled I made constant mistakes, my boss making my anxiety worse with threats instead of helping me. I started the niravam &amp; immediately regained my concentration and was able to complete my project - but because my anxiety showed, I was fired.I tried to explain that I was under a doctor's care for depression &amp; anxiety and that I was now on  knew medication that was helping me. He was of those smug types who told me I was just making excuses for my own incompetence.Now unemployed I hope this med will keep me going so I can find a job with a decent boss.

Panic Disorder	tekila123, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/8/2008 3:50:57 PM	This worked wonders for my anxiety and panic attacks!! When I missed a dose I was cranky, had severe sweats, and felt as though my heart were about to jump out of my chest.  I felt immediate relief after taking two under my tounge. Also helps to relax more for better sleep quality. I think this medication helpes more than others I have tried because I get relief {within three minutes}, I assume because it melts and gets into my system faster than other medication I have tried and waited for my body to digest.   
Panic Disorder	Brooks, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	1/7/2008 4:12:04 PM	Medicine was effective at ending a panic attack, but I did have a cloudy feeling the rest of the day. I would take .25 mg durning an attack and start to feel better after about five minutes. I only use this medicine four to five times a year.
