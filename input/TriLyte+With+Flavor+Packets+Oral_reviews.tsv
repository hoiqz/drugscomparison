Emptying of the Bowel	JR, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	2	Female	55-64	4/29/2012 9:58:13 PM	This is the second time I had to drink something like this. Trilyte was the worst but I drank most of it, certainly not all of it. It did the job. I hated the thick consistency the most. The salt burned my throat, my anus and turned my kidneys on overdrive as soon as they hooked me up to an I.V.  I did drink something else with it but it still took all I could to get it down. I had loaded up on fluids all morning, afternoon, and into the evening. I started Trilyte at 8:30 pm instead of 2:00 in the afternoon and bowels ran clear before 2:00 am even though I ate vegetable beef noodle soup at two in the afternoon. No way was I going fast that long. Slept great and took several sips of water in the morning and a few sips of coffee too. Thank goodness I did because my colonoscopy was supposed to be at 11 am but I didn't even get into the procedure room until after one in the afternoon. Doc had to attend to an emergency in the O.R. Wonderful. As you may surmise, I didn't exactly follow what they recommended, I wasn't going in for that procedure half dead. Never was one to follow orders to the letter and I felt well enough to walk out of there minutes after I was done, could have driven myself home but figured smarter to have someone on hand for that. More importantly, the doc and staff were never the wiser and my colon was clean as a whistle. Glad it's over though.
Emptying of the Bowel	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	2/4/2012 9:44:48 PM	I will never drink this stuff again. If my Doc says that I have to drink it for next colonoscopy that comes up, I will not have the procedure. I was told to mix gatorade in the jug of TryLite. It taasted like gatorade with sea salt in it. Not happening. Can't drug companies come up with SOMETHING we can tolerate? I trult believe that some people will stop having colonoscopys if this is the only option.
Emptying of the Bowel	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	1/26/2012 12:37:08 AM	Horrible. Couldn't finish it. Cancelled my much needed colonoscopy. They really need to find a better prep. 
Emptying of the Bowel	ts_quint90, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	25-34	4/3/2011 8:07:54 PM	I can't really accurately rate Trilyte yet, I'm only about 2 liters into it after 3 hours... I've been taking the slow route because it's gross and I have a huge phobia of vomiting. Anyway, I'm alone and don't have anyone else to talk to about it, so I wanted to write this.My doctor apparently advises people to do a split dosage, half one night and the rest in the morning. My exam isn't until 1pm tomorrow too, so that should work for me. Problem is, I haven't had any results yet... just getting bloated and my stomach is way full. So I'm not terribly happy at the moment; think I'm going to wait until something happens until I take any more.However, something AMAZING just happened, unfortunately it took me until this last 10oz of crap to try it. I did a lot of research on tips for drinking the stuff, and even though it said explicitly on the label &quot;do not mix with flavorings other than the ones provided&quot;, a lot of people said they took it with Crystal Lite. I finally tried it, and holy moly... IT TASTES WONDERFUL NOW.So the verdict is still out on if I'm going to get cleared out down there, but once I can make some more room to drink more, I can not foresee having a problem drinking more.Wish my colon luck!
Emptying of the Bowel	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Male	65-74	2/15/2011 5:16:31 PM	As of 2011, patients should expect a more effective, more paletable, faster producing product for Colonoscopies than this stuff. A gallon plus of liquid, without tolerable taste, requiring many hours of usage - please!  It's a joke, drug companies-
Emptying of the Bowel	skimmer81, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	25-34	1/4/2011 7:19:03 PM	After reading dozens of reviews that were very negative, I was pretty nervous having to take this myself.I decided to go with pineapple since I heard the lime and cherry were horrible. I am not much for orange flavored things. I was surprised by how many people had such an aversion to this product. Granted, its not the most pleasant thing I have ever had, but really it wasnt as bad as i had anticipated.I would recommend having a ginger ale chaser to get the salty taste out of your mouth right away. Its a bit thicker than water, and salty....it reminded me of baking soda and water, there isnt a strong flavor, but the saltyness and thickness is what makes it undesireable. Make it cold and chug it down quickly. DO NOT sip it and taste it first...just gulp it down and have the ginger ale ready to go.I was told to take a glass every 10 minutes and to finish a half gallon. I ended up taking a glass every 20 minutes and had no problem. Very mild nausea and I am a sissy when it comes to nausea. No bloating and no discomfort. If you have to do this, I would ask your doctor about taking a glass every 20 minutes since this seemed to make the process incredibly easy on me. Half gallon later I am running clear and ready to go on with my night. 
Emptying of the Bowel	Sugar, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2		55-64	12/27/2010 5:35:11 PM	I am very allergic to artifical sweetners and all the flavor pacs are artifically sweetened.  I had to drink the half gallon straight!  Not a pleasant experience Why do they use artifical sweetners? 
Emptying of the Bowel	Bacall, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	65-74	12/11/2010 11:01:38 PM	I took trilyte 3 years ago, all 4 liters.  After reading the directions, I assumed I could drink one glass every 15 minutes and have it over with.  I had a gag response with each mouthful.  I think the last time I actually gagged was 45 years ago watching my kid brother throw up; so I wouldn't classify myself as a gagger.  I think I first tried a sip of trilyte, then a sip of Sprite.  Well, that didn't help at all.  Then I tried a sip of trilyte with some of that boxed chicken broth in a mug (which I kept replenishing).  That was better for me, but I did not take one mouthful of trilyte, that I did not gag on.  After drinking 2 liters in that way I called the doctor (Never do the prep on a Sunday for a Monday procedure.  When the doctor called back he said &quot;What's the emergency&quot;.  I told him.  He answered that I had to drink it all and said &quot;Everybody drinks it&quot;).  No mercy there.  I began drinking at 1 p.m. Sunday and finished at 2 a.m. Monday--15 hours.  No chills, chest pains, vomiting like some people have reported.  I am vying for one of the other preps now that I will be having my 2nd procedure.  I chose one with a 2 liter offering, but the reviewers all complain about that one, too.  There was less gagging in those reviews but more vomiting.  Will also try very light diet for two days before and as one reviewer's MD recommends, not using the flavoring, but adding Crystal Light right into the mixture instead of all water (she said it makes it less salty).  The words salty and Lemon Pledge were the adjectives used the most to describe the taste.  I am sooo apprehensive. I wanted to give zero stars for Ease of Use and Satisfaction, but the program doesn't allow that. 
Emptying of the Bowel	dj, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	11/1/2010 1:17:51 AM	I had to drink this nasty stuff for a colonoscopy.  After reading other reviews, I decided not to put any of the so-called &quot;flavor&quot; packs into the jug.  I tried the first glass with no flavoring just to see if it was going to be as bad as everyone said it was.   It was!  Then I used a little of the pineapple flavor in the 2nd and 3rd glasses.  After that I tried the other four flavors and decided that the pineapple was the least objectionable, so I went back to that.   It took me four hours to finish the entire 4 liters, and while it wasn't a pleasant experience, I didn't really have any problems with it - no nausea or vomiting like some people had.  I bought a large bag of assorted Life Savers and sucked on one between each glass to get the nasty taste out of my mouth.  I'm not sure how effective this stuff is because my colonoscopy report said that the prep was only &quot;fair&quot; even though I also had to take four Dulcolax tablets before and use two Fleet enemas after - one before bed and another the next morning before going to the hospital.
Emptying of the Bowel	Made Me Ralph, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Male	25-34	9/13/2010 8:02:08 PM	I just drank my first cup on this stuff and I gagged it back up. This is impossible but I took 2 dulcolax tablets at 12pm and it's now about to be 5pm and I already had to use the bathroom twice (once just off the dulcolax alone and 2nd with this nasty drink).How do they expect people to drink 3 litres? I bought 6 bottles of Gatorade and I have bottles of water next to me to drink constantly because I know this will drain me out. I just started drinking it and it's nasty. I'm scared to drink another cup because I don't want to throw up. I'm suppose to finish 3 liters in the next 2 hours....I don't know if that's possible.
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	8/18/2010 11:44:22 AM	Compared to the Citrate of Magnesium prep this is much more tolerable..  The cherry flavor was better than the orange.  What an ordeal.  I was up almost all night with the diarrhea.  Unfortunately, it did not clean me out thoroughly and I have to fast 3 days before prep next time.  
Emptying of the Bowel	purplegirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	8/12/2010 4:30:29 PM	After only 10ounces, I began to gag and became extremely nauseated. Dr reccommended slowing pace down. After 5 hours and I still half to go, but am less nauseated. It took longet to start working but has now started. Would love to hear remedy for nausea while on clear liquid diet. I've tried tea but would be interested in other ideas.

Once my stomach settled dow, I was going to the bathroom and it seemed to clear me out...I went for a third glass.  After the third glass I had severe vomiting... My stomach is sensitive to begin with...not a very good medication for those who have stomach issues...never ever do this again. My doctor also had me take a laxitive an hour prior... I think this also helped me clean out super fast.  I also ate very lightly the day before.  I done after 3 glasses, hope its good enough.
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	5/5/2010 4:04:30 PM	My doctor's office said I could put lemon flavored crystal light in the solution instead of the flavor packets.  This worked much better but still a tad salty!Just finished the first half of the product and will wait about 6 hours to start the second round.  Hopefully no side effects like I've read here.

I have drank half and have only urinated. If I didn't need the colonoscopy I'd quit now, don't know if I can finish it all. I started at 6:15 pm it is now 9:15pm and have had only a small movement. They should invent a tablet form we can take, drinking this much nasty liquid at one time is overwhelming.
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	45-54	1/18/2010 4:46:43 PM	I could only drink about 6-7 glasses,developed chills,nausea,bloating.I could not get warm the entire evening. What an awful way to have to empty your colon, I will not take this again! I'm sure there is a better way to achieve the same result.

In a nutshell.....too much to drink, crappy taste, chills, and minor nausea. The stuff works, but ugh!!!! what a horrible way to clean out a system. Someone needs to invent a special vacuum cleaner with water jets...lol. I've used this product 3 times and it works but I hate it more each time.
Emptying of the Bowel	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	55-64	8/11/2009 10:22:24 PM	Ask your doctor if you can stop the drinks when diarrhea is &quot;clear.&quot;Label says most people need 3 liters, rather than the 4 and mine seemed to be clear after ten 8 oz glasses. I tolerated the first six 8oz every 15 minutes and then skipped one for nausea.  After 3 more drinks I threw up. Waited 30 minutes and managed to drink following 4 glasses every 30 or 40 minutes. A sip of ginger ale took away the taste and calmed the stomach.  I did not drink last two glasses. Next morn I managed to drink two 8oz 5 hours before the procedure. Hang in there - you'll get through it.

I had to gulp it down without taking a breath. I did get the chills and had to dress in sweats in 95 degree weather.  I did have anal irritation but the product did work.

Was effective overnight to empty my colon.  The following morning I was to finish the rest of it.  I got very, very sick, vomiting, sweats, and a horrible feeling.  I did not want to go through this again so I made it to the hospital to have the procedure. It went well but I was sick the rest of the day.  I hope I never have to go through this again so I have to use this horrible medicine.

The little bottle of phosphosoda was so much easier.  Too bad they took it off the market.  I hope by the next time I need this done they will come up with a better prep.  I used the cherry flavoring and the taste was OK.  I did get rash on my face.

Was a better experience than anticipated.  Will use Trilyte again!  Now my wife is going to do it.
Emptying of the Bowel	HB, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	2	2	Female	45-54	1/6/2009 10:02:24 AM	My mother had to take this medication for a regular yearly check up. Something she has done plenty of times in the past. However this time she ran into some serious complications. It is very important to relay any abnormal bowel movements and or pain to your doctor, caregiver and pharmacist. Perhaps the doctor might want to run a CT or MRI of that area prior to taking this medication. As it turns out she had a blockage which was exasperated by the medication and she needed emergency hospitalization and surgery. So it is very important to relay any unusual painful experience to your medical provider as soon as possible.

It is too bad that they can't make a product that works with only 8 or 16 oz.  This product worked but I did not drink all of the product.  I could only keep it down with a sprite chaser immediately.

While taking the third liter I got chills and a headache and had to slow down.  While taking the fourth liter I experenced severe nausea and vomiting. It took me 5 hours to finish the dosage and took another four for the desired and undesired effects to diminish. Make sure you allow lots of time for this medication. The desired effects resulted in a couple of bathroom trips during the night and several the next morning before the procedure.

Coul not maintain the dosage schedule but managed the amount within 8 hours. Free one gallon container is an ecological waste.Am wondering if this stuff is just glorified and over-priced epsom salts?
