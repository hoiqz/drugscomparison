Severe Pain	TheresaJ860, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/23/2012 5:02:15 PM	Woke up with excrutiating lower back pain, Dx'd with sprained ligaments/muscles. ER Dr. gave me shot of Toradol, and the relief was so amazing!  I recv'd a 5 day supply of pills, which were wonderful. I also suffer from Systemic Lupus and degenerative arthritis, which have me living in constant pain. This medication actually gave me such incredible relief, for the entire week it was amazing that all my pain was either gone,or more bareable than it has been in years!  Wish it was available for long term use! Everything else is so disappointing since experiencing the great pain relief from this medication.
Severe Pain	cupcake, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	35-44	11/9/2011 11:33:07 PM	I have suffered from frequent migraines for two years following a car accident.  My family doctor is well aware, and will usually fit me in between patients for a demerol shot.  As my doctor was on vacation, received both vistaril and toradol injections.  The injection was more painful than receiving cortizone, and within an hour, was suffering severe abdominal pain with diarrhea, as well as heavy twitching.  Once finally falling asleep, nightmares, sweating and serious thrashing occured.  The migraine disappeared within 30 minutes, and I walked out with a smile because the pain was gone.  The side effects, however, were bad enough to put these both on my never again list!  I will have to say, however, that it was nice to have headache relief without feeling stoned out of my gourd!

Pain	ruthb51, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	3/3/2011 9:07:58 PM	I went to my ortho dr for wrist pain 4 mos after carpal tunnel surgery. I also have pain from osteoarthritis and nothing helps it.I was given a shot of toradol. Other than some dizziness 2 hrs after the shot(which was told would not happen), there was NO relief.Now 3 days later I want to take something for neck and back pain but don't know if I can take anything until I call the dr since its only been 3 days. Quote from PubMed Health :Ketorolac is used for the short-term relief of moderately severe pain and should not be used for longer than 5 days, for mild pain, or for pain from CHRONIC (long-term) conditions. Chronic like arthritis?

Severe Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	5/12/2010 10:50:33 AM	Received an injection for a migraine at the ER - it did not help the pain and made my heart beat fast. Would have gotten better benefit from taking OTC pain relievers.  ER doc refused to give any other pain reliver - had to go to my regular doc the next day and get a Nubain shot - worked great!
Severe Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	5/7/2010 10:58:40 PM	This medication did not work at all for me. It was no more effective than OTC meds. I would not recommend it to anyone. A total waste of time and money! Doctors should listen to the patients more carefully, afterall it is the patient that is suffering. In my case I suffered before injection as well as after injection.

Pain	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	10/26/2008 6:14:58 AM	I was given an injection of Toradol in the ER following an accidental injury. To be honest, it was difficult to tell how well the medicine worked at relieving my pain, but the injection itself was not painful at all, at no doubt the anti-inflammatory effects of the medicine were beneficial, because I experienced fewer body aches than I would have expected afterwards. I have taken oral Toradol in the past, and it has proven somewhat effective, which is why they decided to give me this in the ER. No side effects noted, but they did make sure to check that I had not taken my last regular dose of anti-inflammatory (Mobic) for almost 24 hours before giving me the injection.

It SHOULD NOT have been used for me.  They knew of liver disease and age.  BEWARE.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	9/19/2008 1:26:45 PM	I was prescribed Toradol IM injections for my very painfil migraines. This is the only medication that gave me relief from all pain from my migraines! Because of the high risk in side effects I was taken off this medication after 4 months, but I was only able to administer 2 injections/week. So far no migraines since, im concerned how I will treat future migraine pain, I guess back to the ER for relief! :(
