Birth Control	TreesAreGreat, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/23/2012 6:50:20 PM	Side effects and everything varies. My experience from taking it for three years was that I didn't experience any side effects. If I did, I didn't notice. I had also lost weight-8 pant sizes! My periods were barely there and until a form of permanent birth control is done, I'll be taking this pill until then. Of course this was with recommended usage. I never missed a day and was never late more than 1.5 hrs I usually take it. If you are forgetful it may not be for you. I always had it with me because you never know! I have read a lot of bad reviews and good so it's better if you try it for yourself.
Endometriosis	Connie9, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/20/2012 10:42:54 AM	I have always had long painful periods, as well as endometriosis. I am not sexually active, but have to be on birth control. I have tried several different kinds, and this one, by far, have been a life save for me! Extremely mild and normal periods. Low mood issues, no breast soreness. The only slight side affect is menstrual headaches, which I can live with.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Crisscross16, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	2/27/2012 10:09:51 AM	I am 45, have not taken b/c for many many years. Just finished the pack. Awful. Stomach hurt all the time. Weird feeling.Break through bleeding. weight gain and the worst feeling for depression. I am a strong person this has reduced me to tears on an hourly basis. My husbands has tried to understand but he backs away not knowing what to do. I will not take these again. 
Birth Control	jszinnerman, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/31/2012 6:54:37 PM	I was on this pill for about 3 to 4 years before I stopped it this past December. I've missed 1 or 2 pills at a time and still never got pregnant. My periods were light to normal flow, and my cramps weren't that bad. The only thing I worry about now is how long it will actually take for me to get pregnant. Overall I believe this pill was the best choice. I was once on the patch and it made me feel like I was going to die! Even after 6 months the symptoms were horrible, that's when I switched to lo ovral. 
Endometriosis		5	5	5			1/25/2012 5:42:37 PM	Warning: Recently this medication has been recalled! http://www.fox6now.com/news/witi-20120104-lo-ovra l-recall,0,566739.story
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Juju4you2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	1/16/2012 2:03:16 AM	I have been taking this medication for around a year and a half.  With the recent recall a lot of the issues I've had lately are being explained.  For the last 8 months I've been dealing with different skin issues such as eczema and other types of dermatitis.  Within the last two months I have had sever eczema on my face which I have never had before. I thought it was all due to stress but couldn't pin-point what I was stressed about.  During this time my face would also become so photosensitive, it felt as though I had a sunburn and was very painful and itchy.  Once I heard about the recall and visited my doctor we figured out it was from this drug since it was the only thing I was taking constantly. I'm very upset since I otherwise did not have problems but this has completely turned me off to this birth control.

Birth Control	123456789, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	11/15/2011 12:28:16 AM	I switched to Lo Ovral after taking Yasmin for nearly a year. On Yasmin I was having terrible mood swings and 2 week depressions every month. It was affecting my relationships with everyone and I finally realized that I was not going crazy and it was just the Yasmin. I've been on Lo Ovral for at least a year now and so far I've had no complaints except that in the past 3 or 4 months ive noticed that I've been breaking out at the same time every month and I don't think the break outs are from any thing else, plus I've been spotting a little bit for the past 2 months. I don't know why it would suddenly start disagreeing with me, but I may try switching to something else.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/13/2011 4:16:38 AM	I started taking this pill because I was having breakthrough bleeding with ortho tri cyclynm I had been on it for about 6 years and didn't have a lot of other side effects. So I had been taking lo ovral for 11 days when I was sitting at my computer at work and I started seeing little spots of light I couldn't focus on anything, then I saw squiggly lines around my eyem turns out it was a classic migrane u get the headache afterm it really scarred me so I looked up the side effects of lo ovral and sure enough that was a possible side effect!!!! Definetly going back on the other pill! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	11/1/2011 8:41:39 PM	I feel like I haven't taken it long enough for my review to be worth anything, but I'd first like to point out to anyone reading this that all women who take bc have to keep in mind that birth control isn't just composed of hormones that suppress the ability to conceive.  There are other &quot;filler&quot; elements, and these can vary from brand to brand.  The side effects of ingesting these fillers can also vary from person to person.  So don't just take someone's word for it; if it doesn't work for someone else, that doesn't mean it's not going to work for you. Trial and error. And ASK YOUR DOCTOR FOR ADVICE. It's what they're there for.I was on Ocella for about a year, then stopped birth control all together for about a year (because I joined the military), and am now resuming contraceptives by taking Lo Ovral 28. So far, I haven't stopped bleeding from my period that was supposed to stop last week, but it's not heavy.  Haven't noticed any weight gain, or unusual mood swings, cramping, headaches, etc.  I just want the bleeding to stop.  However, it's only my first pack so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt before I try to switch back to Ocella.
Birth Control	Candy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	10/3/2011 3:48:21 PM	I took this pill for 6 months and gained 15lbs. Not much change in diet and I tried to lose weight and it was impossible. This pill also raised my blood pressure 160/99. I tried to decrease it through diet and exercise but it did not decrease until I got off of it. This pill also increased my sex drive which isn't always a good thing ladies. 
Birth Control	Angela, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/14/2011 3:37:45 PM	I have been on this pill for over 15 years and I've never had a problem.  The clinic I was going to stopped carrying it and I was switched to Levora and I've had nothing but issues including a VERY decreased sex drive.  I'm coming back to this pill before Levora ruins my relationship.

I am NOT sexually active so i take this just for regularity and pain. i was prescribed this from my gyno for spotting as well. little did i know (thanks pharmacist for telling me) that it has such a high amt of testosterone in it that it turned me into a pizza face. not just normal acne, BUT CYSTIC ACNE. it was sooooo bad and i had gotten pretty miserable  :(

Birth Control	Meg, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	6/26/2011 2:30:54 PM	I began taking Lo/Ovral four years ago. When I started taking BC I took Ortho tricylene...worked great, then I tried Seasonale, only 4 periods a year, but I had a lot of breakthrough bleeding, so my Dr. put me on Lo/Ovral. It has been very effective in that I haven't been pregnant and my period is regular. In the last year, I developed malasma, which I think is awful. I have talked with my dermatologist about the problem and was told it was hormonal. So, when researching malasma, it connected the problem to the pill. So, I researched side effects to the pill...which explains it all...the malasma (hyperpigmentation), headaches and weight gain in the hips and thighs (not places I normally carry weight). I eat less and workout more than I ever have and have gone from a size 4 to a size 8 on this pill.  I am calling my Dr. tomorrow to get switched to something. All of these are attributed to excess estrogen that is being produced due to the pill. I am so glad I researched this...and I do not recommend this to anyone. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/20/2011 1:47:33 PM	I had some issues in the first couple of months, can't even remember now what they were. I haven't had any problems with this pill since. I have been taking it for about 2 years. 
Birth Control	dms05, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	5/31/2011 11:28:24 AM	I've been on this birth control for 2 months. I was previously taking Trinessa and my body wasn't regulating. My periods would come a week before my period pills started and I gave it 7 months to try to straighten out and it didn't. So, I talked to my doctor about this and he switched me to Lo/Ovral. I've only been through 2 pill packs and I'm going to my doctor and getting put on a different birth control. I absolutely hate this pill. I have had nothing but trouble with it. I have migraines every single day since being on this pill. I also have a period just about every week. I started my new pill pack and of course my period came a week before my period pills but it lasted the full 2 weeks and was a regular period... cramps, bloating, etc. I started my new pack and 2 weeks into my new pack a full heavy period was back. I skipped a week on the period (thank god) and then the week of my period pills arrived and I had a period again. Needless to say I'm getting off of this birth control ASAP!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	5/16/2011 3:34:48 PM	Im in the fourth month of taking this after switching from OrthoTri to Ortho then LoOvral because of breakthrough spotting. I haven't had many side effects until now, the first three months i noticed a big differencec and I was no longer spotting, but this fourth month I have gone back to spotting and for someone whose never had acne, the breakouts have been horrible. Ive read reviews and its a split between people with problems and those who are fine. Im not sure if Im going to stick with this or switch again. Although I have headaches and dizziness, the dr said it wasnt because of the pill because I hade those before being on it, and for clarification those have not gotten worse with the pill. I also havent noticed any mood problem. Hopefully the few side effects are because Im still getting used to the new med and will go away.

These problems were never an issue before.

This pill has made the last 2 years of my life a nightmare. Whereas the Levlen had no side effects other than clearing acne, Lo Ovral has given me the following:- Weight gain (10 lbs over 2 years, eating the same as before)- Bloating- Headaches- Stronger Cramping- Mood Swings- Hyperpigmentation- Decreased sex drive- TirednessI've left that clinic and am going to pay out of pocket ($360/year) to get my old pills back. Lo Ovral has been just awful.

I also ate non stop and gained 25 lbs. My breast pain was so bad I went to see a breast specialist 3 times and was told that I was having pain because i had fibro cystic breasts and needed to decrease my salt intake. I did decrease my salt intake and nothing changed. I stopped taking these pills 2 weeks ago and the pain has disappeared! I also noticed that I do not need to eat 8 times a day. I've already lost 5 lbs.

I have PCOS and my Doc recommended this drug for 3 months to regulate my abnormal cycles. I'm very sensitive to any drug, however I've been on this for exactly a month now and haven't noticed any negative side effects! No spotting, no acne, no stomach pain, and I've actually lost weight! The only thing I would say that was negative about Lo-Ovral 28 is that is has made my breasts a little sore. This drug may not work for you, however considering my history of trying bc pills, it should work for anyone! 
Birth Control	Reviewer, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	8/21/2010 10:49:44 PM	I have been on the medication for 1 month now.  I am having an issue with the fact that I haven't really seen a period this month.  As someone who finds security in seeing a period regularly..it makes me a little nervous, but on the up side, I was switched to the medication b/c I was having a lot of breakthrough bleeding and I haven't had much at all this month.

I have never taken any kind of birth control and the first day taking this I had a severe headache, next day severe headache and severe cramping so I stopped for two days. I kept complaining about headaches and cramping. I've had horrible mood swings in those two days, crying, depression, fatigue... Had the biggest argument with my boyfriend since we've dated. I've never felt this sick and crazy in my life! What can I do? I definitely don't want to try any other BC. !

It has been effective and I have not had any strange side effects at all. I did have spotting when I switched to the generic, so I went back on brand name. It is not difficult for me to take 1 small pill a day. Only problem is that is isn't cheap!
Birth Control	KariJane, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	7/18/2010 11:37:45 PM	I got switched to Lo/Ovral from Yaz after taking the Yaz for over a year, and I'm almost completly through my first pack, and I have been sick to my stomach, getting horrible stabbing stomach cramps, getting dizzy while at work, and getting horrible headaches. I have gained over 5 pounds in this past month, and my acne, which was mild, has gotten much worse. And the worst is the emotional side effects. I never had any mood swings while on Yaz, but now I am constantly tired and depressed, and I have become short with my family and friends, and my boyfriend has noticed as well. I have a feelign of hopelessness that I do not like, for I am typically a happy-go-lucky person. I would NOT recomend this drug to anybody. The side effects are too high in number and too severe to ignore.

The only side effects I have experienced is mood changes, and breast tenderness and enlargement. It's also very difficult for me to remember what time I should take the meds. My periods are much lighter, less painful and only lasts about 4-5 days. I have been sexually active without using condoms and have not gotten pregnant so far. I like using Lo-Ovral.

About 2 years ago my periods were irrgeular and heavy and painful. I spoke to my Dr and she recommened that I simpily ensure that I was taking it at the same time everyday. I did that. Well I thought it wasn't working but I trusted her. My son was born 11/14/2009 and my second child is due 12/01/2010

I had migrane headaches with blurry vision, dizziness, severe leg cramps(charley horses). So as you can see, I was very nervous when my dr put me back on birth control for my PCOS. But I have had a much easier time with Loovral. I dont have anything except a mild sinus like headache occasionally. I think it will be a better choice for me.
Painful Periods	akm, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	3/22/2010 4:51:21 PM	I started taking Lo-Ovral a little under two years ago. Before that, I had been taking Ortho-Tricyclen. The reason I went on birth control was due to extremely bad cramping during my period, to the point of not being able to walk or even stand up. The tri-cyclen quit working for my cramps so my doctor switched me to Lo-Ovral. It did wonders for my cramps. I don't feel anything anymore except maybe slight cramping a few times throughout my period. However, My sex drive has absolutely disappeared. I am always tired and have definitely gained some weight. I have acne and my skin has gotten worse and my once thick hair is now thin (I am only 19). I also sweat profusely sometimes for no reason. I would definitely recommend Lo-Ovral for anyone who has cramping and for period regulation, however I experienced a lot of side effects. I would not go on Lo-Ovral just for the sake of being on birth control, only if you really need it for cramps or period regulation.

I switched to Ortho Tri Cyclen a few years ago and after a few months I had my doctor switch me back to Lo Ovral.  I was starting to have horrible mood swings, crampping, ance, sleeplessness, etc...  One of my co-workers was having the same side effects from Ortho Tri Cyclen as well.  Once I switched back to Lo Ovral, I haven't had any problems and I love it.  Periods are light with no crampping, no mood swings (awesome!), not too much weight gain.  Plus side, i have not gotten pregos on Lo Ovral.
Painful Periods	Noperiod, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/14/2010 4:06:59 PM	I have been taking the generic Cryselle since January 2010 and I have not had a period. I started the pill a few days before my period was expected to begin to see if it would help with prementrual cramping and it did. My period never started. I am happy about this because I wanted to find a way to stop my period. However, I do have occasional cramping which last for a few seconds every so often but it is not anything that I cannot handle. This pill works for me because the 3 that I tried before caused me to bleed continuously with severe cramping. I pray it continues to work-ie NO PERIOD
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	2/3/2010 4:03:22 PM	I have been on BC for over 4 years now and have gone through 4 different pills because of my abnormal cycles. Ever since I started using Lo-Ovral my periods have become regular and I have no cramps. I sometimes get a little more emotional a week before my period but it is never a huge change. BC honestly reacts to every body differently but this pill definitely has shown to be the best for what I needed it for! 
Birth Control	Weimowner, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	1/22/2010 12:57:52 PM	I started taking the medication on a Sunday night.  Monday I felt strange, very mad.  Tuesday I felt even more mad and it seems that every little thing sent me over the edge.  By Friday my husband and I had a huge fight over a Q-tip.  It donned on me that it was probably too strong of a horomone.  So I called my doctor and switched to Microgestin.  Hopefully that will be much better.  Feeling mad at the world for no reason at all is a horrible feeling to have.  I don't like feeling on edge.

Birth Control	just me, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/14/2009 10:49:19 PM	I had unpredictable and horrible periods.  I was first on ortho tri which gave me bad mood swings.  Switched to Lo-Ovral and was on it for about 8 years.  Very effective and absolutely none of the side effects typically seen with BC.  Very satisfied while on it.  But, I went off in April and am trying to get pregnant, but I haven't had a period since - that was 8 months ago.  Seeing a MD but I don't know what the problem is, and I'm wondering whether it's a result of BC????  Sister is having same exact problem and was also on Lo-Ovral.  A friend also had trouble getting preg after taking it and had to go through artificial insem.  Anybody else out there have any insight?  Trying to stay positive and looking for answers.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	12/7/2009 11:35:03 AM	I've been taking lo ovral for 2+ years. I loved it at first... Predictable periods, less cramping, lighter flow.. About 6 months ago, however, I started developing horrible acne (I've never had acne) which I am still battling and my moods are out of control to the point where it is effecting my relationships with people. I am switching to ortho tri cyclen and hoping for the best!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	10/1/2009 9:44:44 PM	I started taking this pill a couple of months ago. After about a week of taking the pill I started noticing mood swings for no reason. I have been getting mad at things that would not normally make me mad at all. I have been seriously depressed since taking it. I am throwing the rest of my packs in the trash.

The drug is effective in that it has prevented a pregnancy thus far, but the side effects are beginning to become unbearable.  I have gained even more weight (not water weight), my appetite has increased, and my poor husband has to deal with an emotional wreck.  My periods have become lighter, however, with little to no cramping.  I just can't deal with the weight gain and emotional baggage!
Other	worschtee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/14/2009 12:18:57 AM	I've got nothing but POSOTIVE things to see about Lo Ovral. I had no weight gain, great skin, no more PMS, short and light periods, and only 1 day of minimal cramping. Considering that I used to have extremely irregular 10 day periods that were very heavy and cramped horribley the entire time...I consider Lo Ovral a blessing.As far as my sex drive goes...it's actually heightened it! LIKE.YOU.WOULD.NOT.BELIEVE!!! My husband LOVES that part (as you can imagine) and so do I. The reason I went on Lo Ovral in the first place was because my sex drive was at a horrible low (it began about a year after my son was born) and I asked my gyno if there was anything on the market for women in my situation. She suggested LO because she had had MANY patients tell her that it heightened their sex drive. I was all for it and I've been lovin' it ever since.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/24/2009 11:41:01 PM	I was on Ortho which made me very sick. So, my doctor switched me to Lo Ovral. I feel so much better. I'm no longer experincing the problems that I had with Ortho. I love this medication. Taking it has made me have a lighter period and no cramping.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	sweethearttx, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/30/2009 2:50:48 PM	I have tried several different birth control pills in the last 8 years but have been on this one for about 5 of those.  I had been doing well as long as I took the brand name, no major side effects.  But then all of a sudden, 6-8 months ago, I started having problems.  Breast tenderness, cramping, periods that don't come until Thursday of the placebo week.  PMS starting at the end of week 1 and lasting all the way through my period.  Doctor just switched me to a lower dose estrogen pill (Loestrin 24 Fe) which I'm nervous about trying, but I guess I will give it a shot.
Birth Control	alitat24, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/12/2009 4:35:10 PM	I've been on the pill since I was 15 and I'm 24 now. During that time I've tried about 10 different kinds and by far, this is the best one. I've been on it for 2 years and I now experiece light periods that last about 46 hours. I do have slight cramps for the first few hours, but nothing that a Motrin won't help. I never use condoms and I haven't gotten pregnant. This is a great pill for light periods, if you have cysts and need to be on it, and if you really don't want a kid. Give it a try!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/13/2009 5:36:03 PM	I switched to this pill because I didn't want to get a period every month. It works perfectly, I have 4 periods per year and they are short and light. I love this pill! I haven't had any negative side effects, either.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	4/8/2009 3:13:36 AM	I start using this birth control this month and I was suppose to get my period on sunday. It is now Wednesday and I still don't have my period. I wait until next month to take a test.God I hope I'm not pregnant I just a newly wed.
Birth Control	wrecklacelove, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	13-18	1/25/2009 9:21:13 PM	i have been on the pill for about four months. i dislike using condoms and so the pill seemed like the perfect decision for me. it also helped to regulate my period because im so irregular and used to have terrible cramping, which has completely stopped since i started using it. The only issue is deciding what time to take it at, because so day is different and i don't exactly have any routine set up. however i recommend taking lo ovral, especially since i got it free at teen erie center in ravenswood, chicago.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	13-18	1/10/2009 6:18:50 AM	I've been taking the pill for 3 years now, and have never had any problems before. Recently though, I've been experiencing what feel like pregnancy symptoms. This could be because i'm a college student, and stress has made these symptoms come out. Or maybe the pill isn't working...i have no idea.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	12/11/2008 9:13:10 PM	I was only on this for a month because my insurance wouldn't cover it due to a cheaper generic, Lo-Ogestral which I ended up trying for a few months and caused severe acne to someone who never had it in their life!!!
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	12/1/2008 7:32:53 PM	I switched from Tri-Sprintec which is the generic form of Ortho to Lo Ovral.  I switched because I had heavy bleeding for three weeks on the Sprintec.  I have been taking Ovral for about two weeks and haven't had any side affects aside from some spotting and cramps.  I guess we'll have to see in the next months but so far so good!! 
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	Lesann, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	10/23/2008 11:49:15 PM	I have been on bcps for years to regulate my cycle and alleviate some of my pms symptoms. I was on Ortho-Tri for years with no problems and then I was spotting a lot. My doctor tried to put me on Lo Ovral but I got so incredibly moody that I couldn't stand it. At one point I couldn't function normally at work and had to explain what was going on to my manager and request to not work with customers because I kept snapping angrily at people and couldn't seem to stop. Then I realized it started with the Lo Ovral and once I was off of it I was fine. I went back to Ortho-Tri and just kind of dealt with the spotting. It's been a few years since that and I still haven't been able to find anything to stop the spotting. But I know Lo Ovral did not work for me.
Birth Control	Laci Nikki, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	10/16/2008 9:37:01 AM	I have been on the pill since I was 17 to help with irregular periods and horrible cramping. I started out on Ortho Tri-Cyclen. Which I loved and had no problems with. I was recently put on Lo\Ovral. So for the past 9 months I have taken everyday. And in that time my friends, family, co-workers and boyfriend have noticed that I am moodier, overly emotional and pretty much unbearable when its aboout that time. I thought maybe I was going through depression. Till I found this site and read reviews that mirror my own findings. Thank you all for putting up these reviews. I just threw that stuff in the trash and I am going to the doctor tomorrow.
Birth Control	miss randilyn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	2	Female	19-24	9/4/2008 10:32:19 AM	I started Lo/ovral about 8 months ago. I take my pill at night. The first few weeks i wake up and puke through out the night. I thought it was because it can cause that for up to the first 6 months anyways. I toughed it out for awhile but now i'm switching.
Endometriosis	dingding78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/22/2008 4:40:17 PM	I've been on Lo-ovral since I was 16 (so 14 years except for coming off it to have a baby!) and I've experienced nothing but great side effects.  I have endo and it completely alleviates my painful symptoms.  It also clears my skin up and eliminates hair growth where I don't want it!  I've tried other pills over the years and this is the only side effect free pill I've taken.  Plus, I can take it 3 months in a row with no period...yippee!
Other	Mrs. Heck, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	7/8/2008 9:14:12 PM	I was switched to Lo ovral from ortho tri cyclen because of extreme PMS. I've been taking it now for 4 months and I missed my first period on it, I have extreme nausea and vomiting the days leading up to my period, breaking out badly on my back and i rarely ever have pimples, cramps I did not have with ortho, I still have horrible pms, hair loss, and some depression and thoughts I've never had before. So I am going to be switching to another pill because the nausea and vomiting are unbareable. And I can't have a normal life with work and other activities while having to vomit in the days before my period. I'm very disatified with this pill.

I was doing a method where you take all of your active pills, then skip the inactives-so you don't get a period, and start right in with the next pack. In essence- I was taking 3 packs of pills, then getting a period. This was great until about 6 months ago- i started spotting badly, so I had bleeding for about 3 weeks, then I got disgusted &amp; let myself have a period. This lasted 5 months- I went to the Dr. I got a different pill- ortho cyclen, which is causing same side effects. Not nice! Maybe I'm getting too old to be on the pill-I am 40, and have been on it for 20 yrs- take away 2 pregnancies. Back to the Dr. to find something else.
Other	Summer, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	3/11/2008 11:55:21 AM	I am on lo/ovral and i have not got my period yet and i'm on my last pink pills, i also noticed one side of my breast is leaking fluid like milk.  I took a pregnancy test but it said negative.  Kinda scary so i think i'm going to go check it out at the doctor.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	1/27/2008 2:14:14 PM	i was bleeding almost all month long with another medication (lybrel) and when i changed to lo/ovral the bleeding came undercontrol and my periods did become regular again. I have had some appetite loss but no real other side effects. I would suggest it to others because of the low hormone levels, i think it works great
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	4	4	5	Female	19-24	1/23/2008 9:29:17 PM	I've been taking this for over three years. I've seen no side effects at all. Periods are light and regular. Contradictory to the other reviews, I like Lo Ovral!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	11/29/2007 1:35:40 PM	I had been switched to Lo-Ovral from Ortho Tri-Cyclen for a problem with yeast infections. Up until the switch my periods were always normal and predictable.  Once I was switched I did not get a period again and my doctor did all of these tests and it showed that my prolactin levels were high which caused me to not get my period.  I believe this was all brought on by the medicine.  I will be stopping this medication immediately so hopefully my body will be normal again.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	11/7/2007 6:37:30 PM	When I switched to this pill from Ortho Tri-cyclen due to break through bleeding, I was not informed about melasma being a possible side effect.  I had darkening pigment above my upper lip and forehead, that worsened with exposure to the sun.  I spent a lot of money on skin bleaching and makeup to cover this embarrassing problem.  When I switched to a different product, I did not have these issues any longer.
Birth Control		4	4	3			10/25/2007 10:47:55 PM	I was fine with this method until my breast began to hurt so bad that I could not sleep through the night. Then my period did not stop for a month. My doctor took me off of it, and now I am fine. I have no clue why my body reacted this way, but the method was fine until then
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/22/2007 1:23:39 PM	When I started on this pill I experienced several side effects, including minor hair loss, weight loss, irritability, breast tenderness, headaches, and painful acne on my back.  But I chose to stick it out and most of these side effects tapered off and disappeared after two cycles.  It's been over a year now and I'm happy with my choice to stay on Lo/Ovral.  I still experience very minor hair loss on occasion, mostly in my eyebrows.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	1	Female	35-44	10/3/2007 8:34:23 PM	This birth control gave me constant headaches, bloating all month and minor weight gain.  It definitely increased my appetite.  This all happened in the first pack.  I decided to stick it out another month to see if the side effects would subside but they got worse.  Overall, I was not happy with it. So I am off to find another one.
