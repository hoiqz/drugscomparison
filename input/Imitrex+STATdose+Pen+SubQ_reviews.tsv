Migraine Headache	JDmigraine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/15/2011 5:17:39 PM	I have suffered from migraines for 15 years and have tried everything.  I was given the injections recently and had to use them while at work for the first time.  Easy to use but after about 5 minutes I felt like I was having a heart attack that lasted about 20 minutes.  I had left arm pain and pain into my jaw and almost called an ambulance.  My doctor said it was normal and not to worry.  It did get rid of the migraine but I'm going to save them for worst case senario situations.

But within 30 minutes of taking an injection my migraine was gone and I was up and running doing the things I enjoy. The injection did get red and sore at the sight of injection. Also, a very intense pain made my migraine worse when injected but subsided after 5 minutes. Also had tingling in my arms and fingers. But worth it to relieve my migraine.

They don't stop the frequency but certainly reduce the length once I've recognized the onset of a migrane &amp; greatly reduce &amp; sometime even completely do away with the intensity. I've used these with great sucess for over 10 years. Highly recommend

I hate giving myself the injection and usually feel sick and a little dizzy for a few minutes afterward, but then the pain subsides for several hours. It's too bad my insurance company will only allow me to have 12 doses (6 packs) a month because I get many more migraines than that. Just starting Topamax for the 2nd time, see how that goes...
Cluster Headache	55-64 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	5		55-64	11/5/2010 2:28:04 PM	I have cluster headaches and imitrex injection relieves them within 5 - 10 minutes. I do feel a little dizzy after the injection but it is well worth it.  I don't know how I survived without imitrex.  
Migraine Headache	Denkai, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	25-34	6/2/2010 8:57:07 PM	I was given the Oral version from my doctor and found it to upset my stomach more the relieve any migraine symptoms. after taking the pen at 1/4 the dosage, I had no stomachaches. I did  experience very warm sensations in all of my muscles (burning sensations) but compared to the migraine they were negligible and a welcome relief.

IT GETS RID OF THE HEADACHE INA MATTER OF 5 MIN. THE PILLS TAKE ABOUT 20-30 MINUTES.

I was also investigating a possible coronary artery problem.  My doctor wanted me to stop the Imitrex while we resolved the heart issue, but I told her I was not about to let go of the Imitrex!  I obtained (using a coupon from Imitrex mailing) a free sample of the Stat; next morning I woke up with M so injected in leg.  It stopped the headache, but several hours later I had an angina attack (my first experience) while working outside in the heat!  In hospital immediately, cardiac cath showed major blockages, transferred to major hospital for emergency bypass (six arteries) surgery!Lesson learned: Imitrex is a vaso-constrictor--a bad idea with arterial blockages!  It seemed like the Stat dosage was somehow more powerful (same mg as oral?!)than the oral.  Heed my experience, and don't mess around with a situation like this!
Cluster Headache	mom of 4, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	9/29/2009 8:49:22 AM	I am a mother of 4 and have suffered from cluster headaches for over 10 years. Finally this year I saw a neurologist. He suggested the imitrex shot and it works wonders!!! Instead of waiting in pain for 45 min for the oral imitrex to work, the pain is gone in 5 min. I had more side effects with the oral Imitrex than I do with the stat dose pen.  It is, however, tedious to put together when you can't see, but I have tought my husband and two older children (ages 10 and 9) how to do it for me. Yes, the injection sight can get sore and bruise, but not bad and I am able to take care of all my children (ages 7 months to 10 years).  I recommend this to anyone who needs relief from cluster headaches!

I have tried every thing else and my nerologist suggested this would be the next best thing. WRONG!!!! I took this medication and within 5 minutes i had every single side effect that there was. My husband had to inject me with the epinepherine pen and call 911 immediatley. they rushed me to the ER and it was absolutley awful. i dont recommend this medication to anyone at all.

Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	19-24	5/16/2009 2:39:26 PM	I have frequent migraines which are controlled by daily medication, but my neurologist gave me the injections to use as needed. I had to keep the needle in my skin for over 30 seconds to get all of the medicine in my body though &amp; it hurt. They cause big bruises at the injection site &amp; my whole upper body, esp my face goes numb for a few hours.  But a quick nap after the injection gets rid of my migraine. I only use them for my most important functions like on prom &amp; graduation.

(Zoloft)I had a psychotic break. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. I filled all my meds at the same pharmasist and my doctors knew all the meds I was taking.
