Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/4/2011 8:44:25 AM	Noticed a huge difference after first night of 3 night treatment.  Some leakage, but not enough to make a difference.  Cured after three night dose.  No side effects at all.  Insurance co-pay was less than buying something OTC.  Would recommend.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	4/15/2011 4:22:59 PM	I've had no indications of a yeast infection rather than the chunky discharge. No itching or burning. Before I took Miconazole 3 for my yeast infection and couldn't finished the doses because the burning and itching it gave me was so intense. TERAZOLE, on the other hand, gave me no negative side effect. No itching or burning or discomfort. There was slight leaking but that's to be expected. Unfortunately it DID NOT make my yeast infection go away. It did clear up slightly, but I think I may need to take another 3 doses or something. Serious bummer.

What does a women have to do to get the right medication.  Usually, if you clear up yeast bacteria infection follows, both should be treated simutaneously.  This medication is the worst stuff I've ever used and I am 63 yrs old.  I will never use it again!!!

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	11/21/2009 9:08:20 PM	Twice now I have used the suppositories.  I finally put two and two together after starting the medication last night for the second time in 90 days.  Horrible side effects, thought it was a bad virus the first time it happened. Fever of 102.5, chills, severe vomiting, headache, dizziness and difficulty breathing.  DO NOT recommend.

I was cleared up almost immediately. The product warns about slight leaking, as with all yeast infection creams, however I had little to none.

I used the first dose last night and the burning and itching was worst then the actual infection that I had for two week untreated. Its so messy too. Other types a creams that treat yeast infections never leaked as much as this stuff did. Its a pain to have to fill the applicators your self too. This morning I called my dr to get diflucan pill and try it. Avoid this cream if you can! I am worst then before I started this med. Dare I force myself to finsh the last two doses? NOPE!
