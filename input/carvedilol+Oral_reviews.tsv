It eliminated my chronic constipation, ED, hip pain, and hemorrhoids. I need less sleep, my memory has improved, and I have become much more optimistic and fearless. Negative effects of BPH have diminished. Is this due to improved blood circulation? Am I a unique case, or have others experiences such positive side effects?

I have Diabetic Foot Neuropathy.  Taking this medicine seems to have affected my neuropathy.  Has anyone else experienced this problem.  I had to cut back on the Carvedilol because the 25 mg. made me retain fluid and have severe anxiety attacks. Now I believe this medicine has caused the pain in my feet to be so severe that I'm not able to walk sometimes.

YOU SHOULD KNOW - the first six weeks are rough with the side effects - I had constant leg pain, dizziness, weakness, depression.  However, they went away after awhile.  My doctor is very careful to increase my dose in small increments, started at 3.125mg 2x a day, but now up to 6.5mg 3x a day. Seems like a low dose compared with others I read about, so perhaps that's why I've done so well on it.

Had a spell when for some reason it went up quite a bit and the doctor had me increase from taking 12.5 am and pm to taking a tablet and a half both times.

But I wonder if it was worth it, because I have severe constipation with Carvedilol as well.  At least when taking Verapamil my Bp was coming down-but with Carvedilol, I have had numerous bouts with lightheadedness, tingling arms, hands, legs, feet, major fluid retention around ankles, muscle cramps, legs feel heavy, I have also gained 41 pounds in the last 6 months. I also have erectile dysfunction along with shedding of hair! I want to get off this med ASAP only problem is not having a doctor that is concerned with overall condition due to a lack of insurance! I go to a clinic which services elderly and poor on a sliding scale fee and everytime I remind them of my conditions the doctor suggests that I find a private doctor or obtain private insurance or get a better job that offers insurance so that he can make referrals otherwise he doesn't want to hear it! I wonder how he would feel if this happened to him? I also noticed that most of the reviews left by men on this site have a tendency to complain of side effects-wonder if this is medication is more sensitive to the male body?? Just a thought?

I have myocardial infraction, whose onset was sudden as was a weight gain for 30 pounds in one month. (152 to 184) I had a pacemaker and defibrillator implanted and put on carvedilol at 25mg twice a day with enalapril 2.5 mg twice a day.  I lost ten pounds a month after surgery (3 years ago) and have not been able to lose the rest even with exercise daily.  Never had a weight problem, oh well, this could be from taking other meds as well.  I began feeling better immediately and am still eating healthy. I have none of the side effects and have not gained any weight.  I will stay on it as my cardiologist recommends.  I feel more alive and have more energy than before taking it.  My blood pressure is always in the 120/60 range which is goo.

My EF became normal within six months.Side effects (dizzyness mostly) were not serious and decreased over time.  The first few weeks on this drug were pretty rough but I felt much better in a couple of months.Now that I have a normal EF, I can have a more normal life.  Carvedilol has saved my life.  Once my symptoms improved, the side effects diminished.   There will always be more fatigue and dizzyness than normal because of the combination of heart failure and the medication but side effects do get easier over time.

All similar type medications which caused edema of legs.  All 3 did caused swelling of ankles, left greater than right.

My pulse is now low 40's to high 30's.  The Cardiologist has not commented on this feature.

My doctor, with consultating my cardologist, put me on this drug along with my BP med.  I've been on it for 4 days.  I have noticed some fatigue and muscle weakness.  I'm hoping this will be temporary and will begin to dimnish the longer I take it. 10mg/day 2x/day. However, on the upside, I noticed it is already working.  My pulse is down from RHR of 95 to 68 and I have not noticed any extra heartbeats.

My BP at that time was l70/80 &amp; nothing brought it down. We were desperate, since I am a NID diabetic on oral med and this BP just would not behave. My physician decided to up the dose to l2.5 mgs. 2x per day and other than a few dizzy spells in the beginning, my BP has decided to behave and on my March visit the BP in his office was 120/62 - yes! This med. seems to work and I am crossing my fingers that it continues to help me because as my physician has said many times, high blood pressure is a killer and needs to be controlled. I keep my office visits and am seen every 3-4 months and he continues to monitor blood sugar.

While on the medication however, extreme tiredness occurred, shortness of breath, chest pain (the kind where it feels like someone sucker-punched you), I don't know if it contributed to a raise in my heart rate because I already have that problem, I have had migraines everyday since I started the medicine, and a numb/pain sensation in my arms, hands and legs. Maybe it just doesn't react well with me because I was only taking 3.125 mg a day whereas others can take up to 50 mg.

My BP was sort of normal this AM when first tablet was taken now after taking second one at 5:30 tonight, my BP has gone as h igh as 160/80 with pulse up to 92. This scares me and I plan another visit in the AM to my doctor to get off of this one. He did say this new med would rise the BP and then it would settle down. Just do not care for this Medication and definitely do not recommend it.

Now that I'm adjusted to the meds and taking the full dose I am feeling mostly better with only occasional short breakthrough episodes maybe one every 10-12 days.Before treatment I always felt like I'd just finished running two miles and couldn't catch my breath.  That fatigue was far worse than with these meds.
