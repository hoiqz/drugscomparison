Other	Kayelli, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/20/2012 6:45:31 AM	I started taking this medication for fibroids in 2009 to help offset side effects of bone loss from lupron.  I had headaches as a side effect that often would be severe and my husband calls them &quot;crazy pills&quot; because he says since I started taking them I'm not myself. I stopped taking them when I stopped receiving the lupron treatments. The medication did not work as I had to have a myomectomy anyways. At my postop two days ago, my doctor told me to start taking norethindrone again (without lupron) to try to eliminate the small fibroids they couldn't remove during the myomectomy. Day one of taking it again, i took with a bagel at breakfast and avoided sunlight as directed. About an hour later had the worst all-over headache I've ever had and throwing up anything I took in all day (Gatorade and saltines, plus the breakfast bagel). Even if I had nothing on my stomach, I was dry heaving. I couldn't sleep it off as I was restless from it. I'm afraid to take it again today. I'm only on 5 mg. might try taking half a pill at night instead of in the morning.

Other	Coke Drinker, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/6/2012 10:21:18 AM	I'm a 39 year old overweight virgin and since I'm not having regular sex nor have I had any children in my life so far, I needed some hormones to protect my ovaries from cancer and harmful diseases that can happen to it from &quot;non-use&quot;.  So I started taking this pill and my periods went from 4 days to 1 day to no days and my dr said that not having a period for 6 months is okay, but you should have one twice a year to reduce your uterine lining, which this pill automatically does.  (Where does it go though?)  The only side effect I've experienced is greasy hair and tiredness, but greasy hair is &quot;in&quot; these days (per fashion experts late 2011 predicting for 2012) and my tiredness could come from my anemia and lack of B12.

I can't sleep. I feel weak and tired and my hair and skin look dry.  This is not helping.. I think its a pill to shut you up and make you think their doing something for you. SMH!

Women with severe migraines are NEVER supposed to take an estrogen birth control as it raises the stroke rates significantly. I love this medication. I have stopped having a period all together and do not have any pms symptoms. It is easy to take and has been quite effective as my only contraceptive for 8 months.
Birth Control	loss-luster, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	5/4/2011 3:39:12 PM	I've been taking pills for birth control, unfortunately don't seem to need it since I've lost my drive. Was unable to take other types of b.c. pills. Right now, not sure if my flow is super light or if I've missed two months. Tests have shown negative on possible outcomes, then again it's been too long to be pregnancy. Luckily the significant other is patient with me. I think I might try another method, since this birth control is working &quot;too well&quot; or is not necessary without any need for it.
Birth Control	Destiny , 13-18 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	4/4/2011 11:12:48 PM	For once I have a birth control that does not make me sick! I was on loestrin 24 for a day and was throwing up the next day, all day mind you. This medicine has been the best thing I have even been given. After only a week of being on it, I noticed a HUGE difference! My periods are only about a day or so with very light bleeding. Whereas before taking it I would clot so bad I seriously couldn't leave my house. This medicine has saved me from so much pain!

Other	65-74 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	1		65-74	2/7/2011 10:27:41 PM	I'm over 65 with multiple uterine fibroids which causes heavy bleeding with huge clots.This matter affects my quality of life-can't leave home while bleeding so profusely. Been taking Norethindrone for 9 months and don't see any improvement. Been researching side-effects and seem to be suffering from one of the &quot;rare&quot; ones-hair loss.  Although a process of aging, I have gone from thick, luxurious hair to thick, greasy scalp which could require daily shampooing.  Doctor wants me to have total laproscopic hysterectomy, but I'm reluctant...and afraid.  Always had irregular and heavy periods, but as a senior citizen, this is just unbearable.

My doctor thinks I have PCOS. (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) I am to take 2 pills a day for 10 days. After I am done with that cycle I should start getting periods. I have 2 more days left. Hopefully it works.

I did have surgery 10 days prior and every precaution was taken by the hospital to prevent blod clots.  Being the blood clot in my lung was of moderate size, I believe but sure, it was caused from this medicine.  My surgeon told me to stop taking immeditaly. The PE was very painful and I had to get needles in my stomach.
Other	stinkysmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/3/2010 12:21:08 PM	Just started medication 1 week ago and immediately felt less pain in my uterus area.  I noticed a huge difference in my mornings,  less headaches and dragging.  Have not went thru a period yet, but will rate it again afterwards. I was thrilled to find some relief without pain pills, because I do not like taking pain medication for its harmful side effects.

She had fewer cycles but they were unpredictable time wise. However, she stopped taking the pills 4 wks ago and now has breast mastisis (breast infection). She is (currently) unaware of the severity of the breast mastisis if the antibiotics don't clear this infection immediately...I was wondering if anyone knew if stopping the norethindron and this infection could be at all related. If you have any information, pls let me know. Thank you. LvBngMom247
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/4/2009 2:01:38 PM	I began taking this due to a painful 3-4cm cyst on my left ovary, but also as a means of birth control.  I prefer it to regular BCP's because of the fact I have no period whatsoever!!  On top of that, I have no pain from the cyst and no longer get the unbearable migraines I always got during the first week of regular BCP's.  I have always had acne, but since taking norethindrone I've noticed a significant decrease in the severity and amount of breakouts.  Regular birth control pills made my acne sooo much worse; to the point of large painful nodules under the skin, like cystic acne that I never had prior to taking the pills.  I occasionally get a few small pimples (mainly because of my naturally oily skin) but they are way less noticeable and embarrassing now.  I'm so glad my gynecologist decided to put me on this pill.  I have not had any of the severe side effects mentioned by other women.  I've stayed in the same weight range as before, my skin is behaving better than before,  and my moods are definitely more stable.  All in all, this drug has impacted my life in a very positive way.
Other	enlightened, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	2/8/2009 1:19:13 AM	I am taking this drug for endometriosis. I've expirenced some dizziness and lightheadedness. I also have expirenced pain in my hips and lower back. I've had difficulty sleeping and not sleeping well once I do fall asleep. The endometrial pain seems to have decreased. It's so far been the best drug treatment I've had for endometriosis. The change to this drug seems to have made my mood a bit more stable. I have noticed a slight uptick in anxiety but nothing to panic over. So I rate it a 3 but as far as I know, for endometriosis there is no 5... 
Other	lmt66, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	1/19/2009 9:15:38 AM	Medication was prescribed for Endometriosis to take for 3 months. So far it has helped with the pain/cramps and the bleeding problems I was having. Still waiting on biopsy to see if it actually took took care of the problem. I only continued to take because it was only for 3 months. I instantly gained 10 pounds,loss of energy, shortness of breath when working out, tired, slight swelling of feet &amp; ankles, occasionaly feeling like I could throw up. I have about 10-14 days off of medication before I have to start taking again and that's when I get major side effects; migraine headache for 3 days, extemely light headed and dizzy so that I couldn't even drive, very bad mood swings of anger and sadness and major depression. I would cry and not even know why and all I wanted to do was lay in bed all day.

Since taking this pill, I have gained weight, started bleeding again after not bleeding for a month and a half, and I became a total &quot;basket case&quot; - my emotions were out of control.  I am going back to the doctor to state my case and let her know I have stopped taking the pill.Bleeding is stopping and I am myself once again.  
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	12/30/2008 4:15:10 PM	My doctor gave me this to stop my heavy bleeding as my blood count was way down.  Since taking it (since early-2008), I have turned into an old man; my skin and hair have become thin, greasy scalp and shrinking breasts.  Yuck.  Now my doctor says I have fibroids on my uterus and wants me to have a hysterectomy.  I wish I could have my periods back and just take iron pills.  If I stop taking the pills (which happened by accident once), I bleed like crazy with lumps and all.  My doctor says if that happens again I'll end up in the hospital for a transfusion.  I think she's being dramatic.  I wish I never started these pills.  Good luck all.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	11/19/2007 11:45:24 PM	While using this drug I have lost alot of hair. It is coming out by the handfull. But that is the only side effect I have had. For the most part it has been very effective from me becoming pregnant.
