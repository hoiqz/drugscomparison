I had a badly infected foot from a diabetic ulcer. The medication could not be taken with imodium  because it blocked the antibiotic from working on the C-Dif. This sure works great to make everything much more calm and quiet.

I have my life back again.The Cholestyramine was aweful to taste with the grit so I asked my doc if this came in a pill form. He gave me Colestid, which I have just g0tten today so im hoping it works just as good !!!! I know it will be easier to take. Hope this helps with anyone trying to change to a pill form .

I started having tummy girgles, diarrhea, and bloating. My doc prescribed this and it seems to be working good for me. I take it late morning. I don't mind the orange taste too much, but I hate the grit if you mix it with water. I now mix it in some vegetable broth or hot chocolate and it actually tastes pretty good! You just have to find the right dose for yourself.  I do about 1/2 packet every day. About 1 teaspoon.

(Studies show that many people w/ colitis secrete too much bile which irritates the colon &amp; thereby causes the symptoms.Cholestyramine binds to the bile &amp; prevents the irritation.) My positive response was immediate. I adjust the dose based on symptoms - &amp; usually take about 1 - 1 1/2 teaspoons per day. Am now able to eat whatever I want without pain, whereas before my diet was severly limited. The only downside is scheduling because it binds  to bile, but also to other drugs &amp; supplements &amp; therefore must be taken 2 hours before or 4 hours after other drugs.The only possible side effect I'm aware of is that everything tastes off to me - I'm wondering if other people have had this effect.

Also, it must be taken two hours between doses of other meds. But it IS cutting my fatty diarrhea down significantly, so it is worth the trouble, I guess.
Other	Bonnie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/7/2011 3:54:07 PM	After I had my gall bladder removed, and also having severe IBS,  I was given this med. it is very easy to take as it is in individual packets. My Dr. told me to take it WITH meals, I have found that if I take it every morning and then every OTHER evening with meals it is just the right amount without causing the constipation or the dreaded diarrhea.  I have also been able to tell several friends that suffer with no Gall bladder and/or IBS issues, and they have also found great relief.  I am now wondering if it will also help with the high cholesterol (mine is hereditary). I would love not having to take Crestor.  Any thoughts?  I will have to call my Dr.

The only drawback being that it must be taken, a couple of hours after other medications, or four hours before to prevent absorption by the fiber, of the meds.  This can be inconvenient and takes some adjusting to.  But it is a blessing to be sure.

After a week on this med, my problems disappeared, only negative is now I'm gaining all the weight I lost back due to actually absorbing my food.
Other	mcsmilern, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	9/3/2008 5:40:54 PM	     I have had Crohn's disease for over 13 years.  I am returning to school to become an RN and had been worried about frequent uncontrolled bathroom runs.  Three months ago I ended up with an intestinal blockage and was hospitalized~then discovering I had fistulas growing and must have surgery right away.  After surgery I continued to struggle with &quot;no warning&quot; bathroom emergencies.  I was eating very mild, bland, and easy to digest foods and still really struggling.  After spending a week calling my Dr.'s every day I finally received the Rx for Cholestyramine.  It has been a life saver and I no longer worry about starting the RN program in three weeks.  Control after so many years~What a Blessing!!       I did a little research as to how/why this Med works and found out why there were so many problems after surgery.  Our bile salts are usually reabsorbed at the end of the terminal Ilium (small intestine) with that segment gone the salts continue on into the large colon~~where there is salt there is water sure to follow.  Causing severe/uncontrollable diarrhea.  This Med binds to those bile salts and gives them bulk, giving us tremendous relief!
Other	Staci, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/26/2008 10:21:00 PM	I was in a near fatal accident 5 years ago.  I had such internal bleeding from torn intestine that the doctor had to remove almost all of my intestines. Doing so saved my life, but had left me with chronic diarrhea.  I had almost given up on ever being able to get far from home without starving myself.  I finally got a referral to a GI doctor and he put me on cholestid and I have had such a turn around.  I have went from weighing under 100 pounds back to my preaccident weight of near 130.  This medication had really been a life saver for me, I continued to loose weight and my all time low was 83 pounds what a difference a good doctor and the right medication can make.
