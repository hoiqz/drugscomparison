Cerefolin NAC has helped me overcome these symptoms - I feel like my old self again.

My positive reaction to Cerefolin began very quickly in spite of my skepticism.  The downside is that Cerefolin is quite expensive
Other	Jewels, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/9/2011 8:09:18 PM	I was having great deal of memory problems, with confusion, finding it hard to get through daily task, did not want to communicate with people. I found that at the age of 47 I have had several mini strokes (harden of the arteries). My doctor put me on cerefolin nac. What a miracle drug. I am back to my old self. I never want to return to that place in my life again, it was very frightening. This drug gets a 5 star rating from me. It gave me back my life.

Other	teacher, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/13/2010 10:16:01 AM	I couldn't remember my student's names, special dates, computer logins, and began performing my routine daily habits in odd order or not at all. I became despondent and it scared me.  After only 3 days on this I feel like my old self again.  More energy, able to manage my day with no worries. I thought I was on my way to old age at 52.  A blessing in a blue pill. Has made a real difference in the day to day quality of my life.  It IS a big pill, but so are many vitamin supplements I take.. so no big deal.  No side effects.
Other	CPhTnatural, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/14/2010 5:14:19 AM	I am taking this medication for severe nerve damage to the S1-S2 spinal nerves.  In addition, I suffered a concusion and my memory was affected.  My experience has been extremely positive with drastically lessened nerve pain, increased memory/mental function, and much higher levels of energy.  I would recommend this medication for nerve damage, not only for memory loss.

Started Cerefolin NAC about two months ago and am seeing real results with short term memory and ability to get around without getting lost.  No side effects yet, if I have any I will update post.

It also appears to have lowered my familial high cholesterol dramatically from 215 to 181.  I also take other cholesterol-lowering drugs, but the addition of Cerefolin NAC appears to be responsible for this 34-point drop.
Other	1strength, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	5/17/2009 12:25:40 PM	After a serious head injury left me with no short term memory and at a constant loss of words, I thought I was loosing my memory altogether. After 1 month on this medication I notice a very small difference in my memory. I will continue with this treatmentfor at least six months to see if my memory loss stops and or comes back. Keep a journal daily.

My DR suggested this medication for memory, energy and to off set long term use of Adderall. I've been on C-Nac for 2 mos. I find that I have more energy and my memory has definately improved. That's a big plus!

Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	2/12/2008 8:27:04 AM	I was having serious memory issues after a series of concussions.  Problems included getting lost on short drives near my house and struggling for words and names.  I was very frightened that I was losing my mind quickly.  After about a month on Cerefolin NAC, my recall of words and names was much better.  I have been on Cerefolin NAC for almost 2 years now and have not felt lost in a familiar place while driving one time.  This product has done wonders for me and my peace of mind.Use is very simple, take one tablet daily, so these people rating &quot;ease of use&quot; as a 1 out of 5 are just not being honest.  I question their honesty on their reactions also, as it really had no side effects for me other than helping me.  It is classified as a &quot;medical food&quot; as opposed to a &quot;drug&quot; because it works to treat deficiencies of naturally occuring substances in the body.  It is highly unlikely that this &quot;brain vitamin&quot; caused a &quot;psychotic reaction&quot;  as one reviewer mentioned.
