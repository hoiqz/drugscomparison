Acne	Sandy in NYC, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	6/14/2012 8:21:07 PM	I love this foam. I can leave it on for a few minutes or even overnight. Works wonders on my acne by reducing the size and redness exteremely fast. Doesnt dry out or peel my skin like others Ive tried. I love it! 
Acne Rosacea	mvill, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	5/28/2012 11:18:50 AM	I was recently diagnosed with rosacea and seborric derm. I have been using this medication for about 2 months. I have seen some improvement but not enough. Summer just started and my symptoms seem to be getting worse.  I would say this medication has not worked for me. :(

Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/21/2011 11:27:11 AM	I have literally tried every acne medication out there...even the dreaded acutane...and this has them all beat. It is the easiest, most effective treatment of the acne I've had on my face since I turned 13. I wish I had known about this stuff sooner!
Scaly Oily Skin Problem Primarily On Face and Scalp	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	11/22/2011 7:40:30 PM	I'm a 42 year old female, dealing with breakouts, tiny bumps all over my forehead and temples and very oily skin.  I keep my skin clean and look younger than I really am so I'm very self-consious about my skin.  Totally fed up,I went back to my dermatologist and said &quot; I've got to get rid of this acne/bumps&quot;. She prescribed Clarifoam and I can tell a big difference with the oil on my skin when I wake up, and during the day.  I can also tell the bumps on my forehead are slowly disappearing and there are no new breakouts- Yay !  I use clarifoam in the morning under my makeup, and at night before bed.  So far, so good !

Acne	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	7/8/2008 11:35:05 PM	I have acne as a reaction to the chemo drug Erbitux.  This has helped me with the acne more than anything else I have done in the last year.
