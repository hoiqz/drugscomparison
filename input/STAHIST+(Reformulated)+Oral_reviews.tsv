Runny Nose	uncle richard, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/3/2011 4:35:02 PM	the only drug i can depend on to control allergy symptoms year-round. to minimize side-effects,i only take 1/2 pill as a supplement to other over-the-counter meds i take daily. up until this spring, i used perscription drugs and shot programs, neither of which were helping anymore. my dr and i decided to go off this regimine and try OTC allevert in AM and sudefed in PM, and continue to supplement with STAHIST as needed. my dosage is up to 2 per day as needed. i find this amount of STAHIST maximizes side effects and is not easily tolerable and aggrevates my use of CPAP equipment due to dryness of nose and throat. however, by taking only 1/2 pill as needed, i get almost immediate relief from the runny noise, watering &amp; itching eyes and does not have a negative effect when using my CPAP equipment. when first perscribed years ago, my pharmacist had to look it up and order it. the same was true when we moved to a different community. i never go anywhere without it and makes visits to my daughters home, with her 3 cats, a enjoyable, non-allergy symptom day.for my part, i would urge everyone with allergy/cold symptoms to discuss STAHIST with their dr and at least dry it and lesson dosage and frequency if side effects occur. it has certainly improved my life and allowed me to use CPAP nose cushions instead of the full mask styles.good luck and give it a whirl!

After years of constant sinus headaches and infections, taking allergy shots, trying all the usual prescribed allergy medicines and sprays, Stahist has been nothing short of a miracle for me!  I have dramatically fewer infections a year and the sinus headaches and pain is rare!  The only side effect I've noticed is a dry mouth, but I can live with that!  Love my Stahist!!!
