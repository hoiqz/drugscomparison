Diarrhea	MsMartie, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	6/23/2009 9:04:08 PM	This is my 'wonder' drug. I have IBS, and this drug has rescued me. I could NEVER live without it. I REFUSE to live without it. It lets me have a life. Normally I hate taking meds, but I don't resent taking this one ever. I also love that they're so small and easy to swallow...I have major problems swallowing pills. I have never had a bad side-effect from this, not once in many years. I use it about 3 times a week, but seldom need the second tab. The first one works nearly immediately. It also relieves the severe pain related to 'explosive' diarrhea. The bad tummy cramps are gone within 15 minutes, and that is wonderful. I've never heard a bad thing about this drug from anyone, and don't understand why it isn't prescribed more often for IBS. I tried some my father had been prescribed, then immediately asked my doctor for a prescription. It's been around for a long time, and they've never invented anything better. No need to mess with perfection.
Diarrhea	Kim, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/6/2009 12:15:45 PM	My symptoms of IBS have increased over the years especially after having my kids. It got to the point where I could not travel anywhere because I would have to find a bathroom on the road or risk messing my pants. I can't believe how this little tiny pill has completely helped me.

Within the next month or two I was spending the majority of my days on the toilet.  I couldn't work, get a full nights sleep, go to the store, or anywhere really long.  I was told i have IBS and THIS DRUG GAVE ME MY LIFE BACK!!!!  no one should live their life on a toilet.
Diarrhea	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/6/2008 5:38:17 PM	I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and to make a long story short, I now have diarrhea for the rest of my life due to lack of large intestines.  Lonox was a miracle drug for me.  It really knocked my bathroom time to minimal.  I am truly pleased with the outcome of Lonox.
