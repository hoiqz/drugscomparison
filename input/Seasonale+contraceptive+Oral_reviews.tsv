Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	8/18/2012 4:35:42 PM	I was put on Seasonale because after 15+ years of normal, 5 day periods, I started having random bleeding throughout the month, as well as periods lasting up to 10 days. I went on Seasonale in hopes of regulating my periods again. Im only 30 so menopause isnt even a possibility. The concept of only four periods a year was also very appealing. I have been on Seasonale a little over a month and I am already having break-through bleeding  which has lasted a little over a week. Basically, even though the website says this is not a period, it feels like one, complete with cramps. I am going to finish the pack but Im not sure I will stay on Seasonale since at the high price (which I pay out of pocket) I cannot afford to take something that does not deliver what it promises. I also get extremely nauseated about an hour before I take the pill each day, sometimes to the point that I have to lie down just so I dont throw up. Im extremely disappointed with Seasonale so far.

Overall I liked Seasonale, in the end I had to stop taking it because I have migraines and was told I can't take any bc that contains estrogen anymore, bummer. But, here's my pros and cons list for it:Pros:- my skin was absolutely flawless the entire time I was taking it- i didn't experience any weight gain- it did its job, I never got pregnant- My periods were much lighterCons:- it completely killed my sex drive, I also always felt very dry (tmi? Sorry)- i had spotting about halfway through each pack, that didn't decrease over time for me, like they say it will. It would last a couple days, up to a few weeks- it may have increased my migraines, not sure. I still have migraines, but I had one migraine with intense aura while taking Seasonale, which it why I finally stopped. Haven't had one with aura since.
Birth Control	patient, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	7/30/2012 10:44:33 PM	bedridden for the first two days because of extreme headache, dizziness, nausea, low energy, bloat.  vomitted once a day.  day three was slightly better, was able to work half a day, and the nausea and headaches mostly subsided...not completely tho, over the next two weeks.  i felt like i had a sumo suit on...so incredibly bloated, and foraging for food like i smoked pot too...thankfully i keep my house stocked with fresh veggies and fruits...however i still gained 5 lbs in the first two weeks....hoping this subsides...if not i have to stop these pills and look into IUD further...

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	3	2	Female	19-24	11/20/2011 5:53:23 PM	I have been on this pill for 3 months and have had nothing but problems. I experienced break through bleeding that started about two weeks into the first month and lasted until I started the placebo pills. After I was done the first pack I had a very heavy period with severe cramping. I was constantly nauseous and very emotional throughout the 3 months. To top it all off I  also got diagnosed with anemia while on this pill and have never had a problem with my iron before. I was on a different type of birth control pill about 3 years ago but never had any problems like this!

The last 3 I had been diagnosed with diabetes, &amp; tested for cancer, anemia, and heart problems. I couldn't take a shower without wanting to faint, severe heart pain, and ready for bed by 4pm everyday. By process of elimination, we found out it was Seasonale causing my symptoms. I switched to Microgestin Fe 1/20 with lower estrogen, and and feel like I am 23 years old vs 50. Wish my OBGYN had listened to my pleas for help a lot sooner!!

I didn't get any spotting in the first few packs. The only time I got spotting was when I missed 3 days in a row and that was only for two days, no big deal. When I stop the active pills it takes about 4 days for my period to start. I take my last pill on Thursday night and my period starts on Monday and only lasts about 3-4 days. I love not having my period in the summer at all and not at Christmas or on my birthday. It is the same every year. I would definitely recommend this product. 
Birth Control	SpaceGirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/1/2011 8:55:10 PM	I've been on Seasonale for over five years now. Prior to taking the pill and when I was on Ortho, I had long, heavy, and painful periods. On Seasonale, they only last four days, they're really light, and I only get mild cramps for a day or two. I used to get depressed before I'd have my period, and since I've been on Seasonale, I've never PMSed.  I have never had any spotting problems while on this medication. The only two things I don't like about it are decreased libido (sex drive is almost non-existent!), and this medication seems to have numbed my emotions. I don't feel extreme emotions like I used to, and something has to be big in order to affect me (but I feel normal when I take the one-week placebo pills).
Birth Control	Lynn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	7/28/2011 12:12:07 PM	I went from a regular 1-month pill to this, and everything was great for 3 years. In year 4 I started having breakthrough bleeding and almost constant spotting. Now after a year of those issues, I had a period during the normal white-pill time and it was fine. Then suddenly after starting the new pack I had biblical-flood-like bleeding. Soaking one super ultra tampon per hour for over 48 hours. NEVER had anything like that before. My OB/GYN said this is a known effect of these pills - they work fine for years and suddenly go haywire. Reading the comments here, now I am thinking that my libido issues might be caused by these pills, too. Just threw them away last night, going back to normal 1-month pills after crazy bleeding stops.

Once I started on Seasonale I had stomach pain, green stool, dizziness, nausea, extreme fatique and depression.  It took me 6 months to figure out the pill was the cause, after countless medical tests.  Once I was off it, all these symptoms diminished.

Ortho tri (lost weight but made me break out like crazy) Nova777 (made me feel wierd and moody) Ortho Evra Patch (loved it but after being on it awhile I started to have skin problems and was very moody) and now the Seasonale. In the begining I loved it. Very little cramping, my skin cleared up somewhat from how it had been on the patch and my mood improved. I have now been on it for 2 years and I have to change. I have gained about 30 pounds and I diet and exercise like crazy and cannot lose an ounce. I am also experiencing Melasma on my face and I haven't had that with any of my other forms of BC. I am a very sexual person and since I have been on this pill my sex drive has gone completely away and even when I am in the mood I have severe vaginal dryness. Nothing else in my life has changed and I am not under any unusual stress so my Doc thinks its the pill. I started having the negative side effects about 6 months after starting the seasonale and they have progressively gotten worse.I really enjoy only having the 4 periods per year but the negative side effects are outweighing that at this point.

My periods are short and cramps are gone! Life is good! :)
Birth Control	Nixx, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	8/16/2010 1:57:35 PM	I started Seasonale about a month ago. I'm two weeks into my second month. My doctor prescribed it to help curb my heavy and painful periods because I am iron deficient and its making me worse. I started the breakthrough bleeding and spotting about two weeks ago and now I'm in the midst of my 'normal' period (three weeks in) which is more painful and annoying than ever. Not to happy now but it sounds like you have make it through the first pack at least so I will stick it out and see what happens because shorter, lighter periods only a four times a year sounds heavenly to me!

I was getting Zoladex injections but had to stop when my husband changed jobs and we did not have health benefits.  I have JUST looked up the side effects and realized that the past almost month of my life has been hell because of this pill!!! I have had CRAZY mood swings, severe abdominal pain, constant feeling of fullness in the bladder (without being able to urinate), headaches, trouble sleeping. I have also already gained 5 pounds since taking this medication.  I will be calling my doctor and getting off of this ASAP!!

It works well for me - shorter, lighter periods, minimal PMS symptoms, and fewer headaches! As a side note - I did have some spotting with the first pack. It does take some time to adjust to this medication, so be prepared! Any pill may have an initial adjustment period - give it a few months! 
Birth Control	betterlucknexttime, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	4/24/2010 7:59:35 PM	After one month of use I started to have very back leg pains and a continuous period. I bled for over a month, they don't tell you that &quot;break through bleeding&quot; can be just as heavy as a regular period. I went from having a 3 day period on ortho cyclen, to having a constant period on this drug. I stuck with it because I my doc suggested that my body had to adjust. By the third month it was clear that it was time for me to switch back. Oh and to top it off I developed inflammation of the veins, which is the first step toward clots. I've never had that issue before taking this med. 
Other	Knancy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	4/8/2010 7:17:20 PM	Thank you to all the reviewers for taking the time to describe your experiences.  I started my first pack 3 weeks ago and have not stopped bleeding or cramping.  My doctor warned me that this might happen the first few months, but I didn't expect this.  Sounds like this is a pretty normal reaction. I'll give it a few more months.  I am also being treated for Hypothyroidism, so I'll be getting a test in a few months to see if this drug is reducing the effectiveness of my Levothyroxine.
Other	Kari, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	3/12/2010 3:16:13 PM	When I first went on this pill I had breakthrough bleeding constantly.  It took about four months to not get a period, BUT if I miss one pill or take one a little to late I start getting period feelings, so you have to take it every day at the same time.  I broke out in the first few months horribly on this pill, it definitely did not clear my skin.  I also feel like I've gained some weight.  I haven't changed anything with my lifestyle and the pill was the only factor I could think of for the extra 10 lbs I've put on.  I also felt I've been more emotional since on this pill.  I'm going off of it after this pack just to see if those things improve.  I'll check back after a few months to compare.
Birth Control	Katie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	2/13/2010 12:03:16 AM	I switched to this from Ortho-Cyclen because I liked the idea of only having four periods a year. At first I liked it. But by the second month of the pack, I was ready to switch back. While it is nice not to have to deal with your period every month, being on this pill made me an emotional trainwreck. As soon as I finish this pack, I am DONE with it.

Birth Control	pmichellew, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	9/7/2009 12:56:28 AM	I have had a horrible experience on this pill. I wanted to try it because having 4 periods a year sounded appealing.  I was on it for 1 year and I always spotted about 1.5 months into the pack.  I would spot for about 6 weeks, then use the placebos and have a super heavy period for 1-2 days and then it would dissipate. The spotting was too much not to wear anything, but not enough to really mitigate a tampon.  Unfortunately...a problem.  THEN...my sex drive went into the toilet.  My husband and I enjoyED a very frequent sex life, however about 5 months into using it, we both noticed my libido was non-existent, I didn't want anything to do with it.  However, I had also lost weight and wasn't sure what to blame the decreased sex drive on.  I have since changed pills and recently noticed my sex drive almost back to normal.  Those were my two biggest issues with the pill; they were big enough issues to make me change. I am so far very happy with the change.  PS-My sister in law recently changed to seasonale too and her libido is gone as well.
Other	Teef, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	9/5/2009 9:21:10 PM	I noticed absolutely no difference since I started Seasonale and reading about breakouts and weight gain that people are mentioning surprises me. Sadly the breakthrough bleeding has begun (stared about the second week of the third month) but I figure since I was lax about taking it and missed a day by eight hours that it's mostly my fault. With the breakthrough bleeding has come cramps but they are MUCH better then I would normally have during my normal period that would have me bed ridden with out painkillers - at least these cramps I can bear without the help of pain killers. When I told my mother that I was starting to feel cramps again she laughed saying how much she had enjoyed the peace in the last two months where I wasn't moaning about the pain. In light of past performance, I am going to slog through this month and hope that it gets better.   
Other	virgodragon23, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/24/2009 6:15:43 PM	I started on this medication after a few months of being on Yaz. I originally started Yaz to help regulate my irregular periods, but since I'd had irregular periods for years, I had never had a full-strength menstrual cramp. I finally started having them while on Yaz, and I had about four before I realized that I needed to switch my medication. One time during a cramp, I screamed so loud that someone nearby thought that I was having a mental breakdown. I eventually lost the medication, and thus had no choice but to go back to my OBGYN provider and get my prescription refilled. It was then that I started taking Seasonique, and after 3 months I switched to Seasonale, and have been taking it since. I've had no menstrual cramps whatsoever since then.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/1/2009 3:14:10 PM	I experienced nothing but problems when starting on Seasonale.  I experienced extreme fatigue as well as extended, painful bleeding lasting up to 6 weeks, and that does not even count the spotting which would last for a week before the heaving bleeding as well as a week after, always beginning the second month of pills.  Once the bleeding and spotting was finally over, It was time to begin the placebo pills and have my actual period.  While this pill make work for some, it's definitely not for me.

I started taking this drug after quiting the shot (depo prover) because I had gained 15 pounds in 5 years on the shot.  Well, I should have stayed on the shot because in the first three months (1 package of the pills) I gained just over 20 pounds.  I am a very healthy person, I do not eat red meat, I exercise regulary so gaining the weight was a huge issue for me.  I went to my doctor thinking something was wrong with my digestive functions but he said it had to be the switch to the pills.  I am finishing my 3rd pack and stopping for good.  I am working extra hard to lose the 20+ pounds I have put on (a lot in the breasts) and hope to be back to my regular size in a couple of months.

I have been using Seasonale for 5 years and I have not had a problem with it until now. I had some cosmetic surgery done and four days later I had multiple pulmonary embolis. This was the scariest thing I have ever been through. Thank God I will be okay because this was such a dangerous side effect from taking this drug. I will have to be on blood thinners for the next 6 months and have my blood monitored 2-3 times a week. I guess that is a small inconveinence that I will endure until I am better. I can never take oral contraceptives again and I am only 23. I am lucky to be alive!!

I have been bleeding for well over a month now, with some clotting as well. I am hoping that when I start my new pack the bleeding will subside. It's getting to be somewhat aggravating. I did experience some of the other side effects, upset stomach, and some vomitting, but that eventually went away. I ate tums constantly to calm my stomach.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	19-24	1/13/2009 8:55:00 PM	I have always suffered from severe emotional breakdowns before my periods. (Before everyone was being diagnosed with PMDD) I've lost it at several jobs &amp; gotten into horrible fights with friends &amp; family for years. Deppo was not an option for me b/c it can increase mood swings in young women. This is when I pleaded with my doctor to help me get control of my life. She put me on sesonale &amp; my life has been great. Instead of having WW3 12 times a year, now it's only 4 times. I never get breakthrough bleeding. Waring though... my doctor accidentaly gave me seasonique instead of seasonal &amp; I've felt pre-menstrual crazy the last 3 weeks. I would say if this works for you....do not consider changing b/c the active ingredient amounts in the two types of pills is different &amp; I can definatly feel it.

I'm so much happier with it my skins starting to clear up, I have less cramping, and my husband loves it.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	8/1/2008 10:35:05 AM	Has anyone had problems with acne while on this drug??? I have noticed I have been getting horrendous break outs since being on it. That seems to be the only problem I have had. If it gets worse or does not clear up, I will stop taking it.

Im going to ride it out and see if things turn around and if by the next doc visit Im not happy it looks like dear aunt flow will be here once a month
Birth Control	 Female 	5	5	5	Female		6/25/2008 11:27:06 AM	I have been taking Seasonale for about 4 years now and love it!  As others have mentioned, I did have some breakthrough bleeding on the first 3 month pack, but have not had any problems since.  My body does tell me when it's about time to have my period, towards the end of the 3 months....I can definitely feel that it's ready to have a period.  I am in my early 40's, in good health and don't have any children.  I highly recommend trying this oral contraceptive if you want to have only 4 periods a year and much lighter periods.

I'm looking to stop my period.  Already have 2 kids just have great pain with periods.  This was supposed to help but it just made things worse.  Also came down with several infections bronchitis sinus and ear infections also lack of energy.  I would not recommened this pill to anyone!

No doctors have been able to explain this. we would greatly like some answers. why has no public information been distributed on the matter? i recommend u take anything but this medication. i know we all sorely regret this. trust me, its worse than any period u have ever had. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	3/25/2008 7:44:48 PM	I decided to go on this just so I would have less periods to deal with.  The first pill pack was alright, I spotted for a month before my period, but I plan to be on this pill for at least 5 years, so a month of spotting was nothing.  Now I'm on the second pill pack, and it's great.  It's so freeing to not be on my period every month.  I was afraid that when I got my period it would be terrible, but it was actually shorter than normal and I didn't have any cramps, whereas when I was just on the regular pill I still got cramps.  I would definitely suggest this.
Other	Jeannie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	3/3/2008 2:10:06 AM	I'm a walking case of some of the worst side effects of taking Seasonale/Quasense.  Been taking it for almost 2 years now.  First 6 months, I had continuous spotting and severe cramps.  I still cramp often and I bleed for the entire month during the 3rd month but my period only lasts 3 days so I guess that's the trade-off.  Biggest complaint though is that I've developed some bad hyper-pigmentation and high blood pressure. Been using a Rx bleaching cream and it doesn't help.  Starting to take meds to control my blood pressure too.  For now, I'm willing to trade all the side effects for having my period 4 times a year, but I don't know how long I can continue with this.

Seasonale is my answer!  Had spotting first pack, and when I start a new med that has &quot;interactions&quot; with birth control.  No other side effects.  Love this birth control!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	4	4	Female	19-24	2/12/2008 9:39:24 PM	I love the idea of this pill, but if im late even by 10 minutes on a couple within one month, i get a very long period.  Once i had one for 4 months (very light but still).  I have a prolonged one now going on 4 weeks.  It is a hassle to stop the pill and introduce it again to your system so i can get rid of a horribly long breakthrough period.

Had a period for about 2 months but after that smooth sailing however I did gain alot of weight and there is alot of water weight but it reduce my painful periods and Im switching back soon!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	2/6/2008 12:39:31 AM	I was on Seasonale for four years and it worked great for me until last August when I experienced very bad breakthrough bleeding for over two weeks, until my doctor told me to stop the pill. My doctor had me switch to another pill, which is working out fine so far.  I guess my body had enough of Seasonale after four years.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	2/2/2008 4:36:24 PM	I have had success with this birth control pill. I like only having 4 lighter than normal periods a year. I have however, experienced some breakthrough bleeding especially during the third month, leading up to my actual period. I have also experienced some bleeding after sexual intercourse, which may or may not be related to the pill. Overall I love it though.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	1/21/2008 10:54:57 PM	I love Seasonale, I was on Depo Provera for many years, but had to go off due to risk of osteoporosis. This is the second best thing to having no period, only 4 light ones a year. However, the 2 times I have been late taking a pill, (by like 6 hrs) I got my period the next day! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/9/2008 2:59:01 AM	From the first pill on; I was in love with it. I never experienced any spotting or random bleeding while taking it. It is just very important to take it at the same exact time each day, one day I had taken it a few hours too late and consequently started my period a month too soon. I still experience horrible cramps but I have not had one break out of acne or pimples. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/4/2008 9:58:58 AM	I had a hard time in my first few packs but now I've been on Seasonale for over 2 years and just had my Dr. visit.  I told her that my periods have almost stopped and she (as well as I) was very happy.  Before Seasonale I had a week of severe cramps followed by a heavy week of bleeding...never anything light.  Now it's almost a little scary because I barely have a period (2 days) with 2 days of occasional cramping (2-3 times a day).  LOVE this BC!!!!
Other	SDSweetie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/3/2008 8:35:51 PM	I have had a list of problems longer, more painful, and debillitating than just about anybody could imagine.  I am starting year 5 on Seasonale and I will not change ever again! I have used it since it came available on the market and love it.  It reduces my pain and misery each month and who wouldn't love 9 less weeks of bleeding a year!!! My periods are lighter and shorter and no where near as painful.  I reccomend this to everyone I know! Peersonally I will only take brand name because of reactions I had to other types of birth control, but now its even more affordable for most because there is a generic available now!  So if your thinking about taking it, do it!!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	12/26/2007 4:36:09 PM	I used Seasonale for 4 months and then quit. For the entire time I was on it, I had very heavy breakthrough bleeding w/serious clotting for about 3 weeks out of the month. With all of the cramps and breast-tenderness that came along with it, I felt like I was having my period most of the time. I guess it was effective since I didn't get pregnant while on it - but this could have been since I only had sex once since I felt so horrible. After stopping the medication, my periods went back to normal after only one month (thank god).
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/19/2007 2:31:13 PM	This medicine is great. I have had little problems, I started taking the medication for cysts and it has solved that but I do  not sleep well now and I have migraines more often than before. I have had break through bleeding more than with other birth control and I have gained an unwanted 10 pounds. But even with a couple side effects the pill really works well.
Birth Control	amhudson04, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/29/2007 11:24:35 PM	I have only been on this medication for 5 weeks and I feel like an absolute mess!  I don't feel like getting out of bed, my moods are high and low( meaning I am grumpy and mean to sad and on the verge of tears)I have no motivation to do anything (except sleep), VERY irratable (I feel sorry for my husband and daughter).  I called my gyno today and told her how I've been feeling and she said to stop immediately and I set up an appointment for to see her in a few days to do a hormone check (blood test) and go from there as far as what method to proceed with. I also have another friend who has been on seasonique for a year and has been experiencing the same feelings, and she just recently stopped as well.  So beware of how you feel before you start taking this drug and how you feel while you are taking this drug, you will probably notice a HUGE difference!

I'VE NOTICED WITH THE LAST TWO CYCLES MY MOODS A WEEK BEFORE WHERE VERY INTENSE. THIS MONTH I FEEL TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL CRYING LOOSING MY TEMPER AND NOT WANTING TO BE AROUND MY CHILDREN.I ALSO CANNOT SLEEP AT NIGHT. I AM UP FROM 2AM-5AM EVERYNIGHT. I CALLED MY DOCTOR AND SHE SAID IMMEDIATELY STOP TAKING IT AND SHE CALLED IN MEDICATION TO COUNTERACT MY MOODS. AS FAR AS CONTROLLING MY CYSTS IT DID AN EXCELLENT JOB. I DO HAVE WEIGHT GAIN AND THE LAST FEW WEEKS NO APPEIATE AT ALL.I'VE HAVE BEEN OFF MEDICATION FOR 4 DAYS AND I AM STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE BETTER.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/22/2007 12:40:28 PM	I was using this for a preventive medication for endometriosis. The longer I toke it the less spotting, PAIN, bloating,MIGRAINES, nauseousness, and less mood swings there were. It also greatly reduced my heavy flow  during my period down to a very manageable flow. I was on it for little under 4 years.

I had no spotting or bleeding in between periods.  It's fantastic to only have 1 period every 3 months.  My periods are also lighter and shorter due to the medication.  It's worked well for me and I am completely satisfied. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/25/2007 4:49:21 PM	I was on Seasonale for about 3 and a half years.  While I will admit it took a couple packs (3 months each) before my body fully adjusted to it, once it did, I loved it.  Couple things to note - I had quite a bit of random spotting during those first couple packs.  Nothing heavy, just a little annoying.  Like I said though - once my body adjusted to the pills that stopped and I loved them.  I had virtually no PMS symtoms and a very light period.  The only thing I had to watch though is if I missed one day and didn't take it ASAP the next day, I was much more likely to spot when on Seasonal than I was when on 28-day cycle pills.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/21/2007 5:17:11 AM	I previously was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo, and was having major mood swings/PMS.  After consulting with my PA, we decided to try something with the same dosage of estrogen throughout my cycle, and the seasonale was very appealing with only 4 periods a year.  I can still tell when I'm supposed to be having a period because I get a little more emotional, but overall the moodswings are all but gone!  It does nothing for acne, which was a benefit of the Ortho, but it's worth it to me.  Initially I would spot the week before my period was supposed to start and then have a period the entire week, but I've been on it for about 18 months now and I usually only have a 4 day period, with no spotting beforehand.  The side effects say that you may spot when you would normally cycle, but I have never had this problem.  Overall I am thrilled with the change that I've made and I recommend this product if you are tired of monthly periods and the PMS that comes with them!
