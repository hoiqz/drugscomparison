I NOW TAKE HYDROCODONE ALL I WANT TO DO NOW IS SLEEP. DEALING WITH PAIN IS NO WAY TO LIVE. NOW I CAN NO LONGER FUNCTION IN LIFE. THE DARVOCET WORKED MUCH BETTER FOR THE PAIN AND NO SIDE EFFECTS. NOW I FEEL LIKE I'M ON DRUGS WITH LESS PAIN RELIEF. BRING BACK THE DARVOCET SO I CAN HAVE SOME TYPE OF LIFE. THIS DECISION HAS ALSO CAUSED DEPRESSION BECAUSE LIFE IS HARD ENOUGH. WHEN YOU SUFFER WITH  CHRONIC PAIN FROM INJURIES THAT CANNOT BE FIXED. IF ONLY IT WAS THAT SIMPLE. I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO SUFFERS FROM BACK,NECK,KNEE,SHOULDER,AND HIP PAIN. WE ALL NEED HELP IN GETTING OUR PAIN MEDS RIGHT. I KNOW I REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT SIDEFFECTS AT LEAST I WAS ABLE TO LIVE SOMEWHAT COMFORTABLE AND COULD THINK CLEARLY AND STAY AWAKE. NOW I FEEL ISOLATED FROM MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.LIFE USING OTHER PAIN MEDS IS REALLY COSTING ME MY NORMAL LIFE. I WAS HIT BY A DRUNK DRIVER IN 1989 THATS WHEN MY PAIN RELIEF JOURNEY STARTED. I ALSO HAVE HAD MANY OTHER TREATMENTS THEY HAVE HELPED BUT I STILL NEED PAIN MEDS TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF. I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AND THEY DON'T HAVE IT EITHER. PLEASE GIVE US BACK OUR DAROCET.

I have PPC and am on my second tx of chemo. I have 6 bulging discs in my lower back. Darvocet-N 100 is the only med that works for me without nausea, abdominal discomfort or in the case of Codiene, a form of anaphylactic shock. I am trying to cope with the meds I am taking, but it is difficult.

This is the ONLY medication that has ever been effective for my long-term chronic, severe interstitial cystitis without causing oversedation or G.I. symptoms. I have been through cardiac diagnostics and am negative for problems. There is no substitute chemically for Darvocet that I am aware of. Please enlighten me if this is incorrect. Is there anywhere on earth that I can obtain Darvocet, or is there a global ban?I am desperate for effective, non-sedating pain relief.

I also took it during my cancer treatments radiation and chemo.  It was the best thing that could have happened to me since I did experience so much pain during and after my surgeries and treatments.  I never had any issues with addiction and it allow me to function pretty much pain free most to the time.  Its so bad that they removed it from the market since I still have chronic pain and now I suffer with it.

It was the one painkiller that took away the pain without making me high.  I wonder why those of us who have had no problems can't still take the drug?

They are fools and cowtow to drug companies.

When I was young for cramps and now for Chronic pain &amp; FMS. I don't know what happened to the little lab rats, that made the FDA suddenly decide to take the only drug of its kind off the market, but they should have studied me.I have NEVER been addicted to this drug, I never take more then I NEED &amp; now it isn't available. So, I'm taking Oxycodone. And its Not Working! When my pain is bad and pain opiads are needed I could rely on and know that Darvon would help. Now, I don't have that and my quality of life is spiraling downward. I can't enjoy things like I used to because the pain gets in the way and stays there.................. The FDA can do fine work, THE REMOVAL OF DARVON AND DARVECT FROM THE MARKET WASN'T ONE OF THEM!!!What are people like me supposed to do? Don't want to get addicted to a drug because I have to take it more often! HELP

Shots in my spine and darvocet are the only treatments that keeps me going.  Darvocet has been on the market as long as I can remember and I'm a retired nurse now someone wants it off the market for people that really need it.    Remenber of all the other B.S. we hear on T.V. like Celebrax for example.  I believe there is a reason for this removal of darvocet other than what we are hearing about the side effects that are killing people.
Pain	teenangel, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	3/29/2011 6:30:52 PM	For approximately forty years off and on I have taken this drug and was on it when it was discontinued a few months ago. I have never had side effects from it. I relied on this drug as it was the only pain med on the market that I could take without problems. You see I have a high allergy reaction to most pain meds and now I will have to do without any kind to ease the arthritic condition that I suffer with constantly. Thanks to the ones that abused it, I now have to suffer and also many others like myself because of not being able to be treated effectively for pain. How do we get it back on the market? Several comments in the review columns were made about other pain meds and the side effects that were on them. Did they take them off the market because they might hurt someone? Give us a break!  Let us choose our meds, as we know our bodies better than anyone else. Shame on the people who decided for us that this med was no longer safe.

I had tried hydrocodone, to no success.  This medication was the only medicine that took the pain completely away without hurting my stomach (I have ulcers as well) and without making me nauseated.  I was able to function with this, and they took it off the market?  I had no ill side effects at all from it, compared to the hydrocodone which made me all messed up.  BRING IT BACK!!!!

Have become involved with legal filing against the FDA to return Darvocet to doctor/ physician use.

Pain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/28/2011 12:37:38 AM	I've taken Darvocet N 100 years, for back pain and arthritis in my hips and knees.  This is the only medication I've taken that is effective, w/o side-effects.  NSAIDS cause me some stomach problems (ulcers).  The other narcotics like Percocet, and hydrocodone cause me lots of trouble, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, and hallucinations.  I really don't understand why it can't be an individual decision for people like many of us here that are long time users.  The other narcotics are addicting, and I'm sure have caused many more deaths due to OD, and illegal sales (drug dealing and such) than Darvocet ever could.  The FDA needs to stop and think about the people they are hurting.  Why don't they take the other drugs off the market also, and just let everyone suffer?  If someone starts an on-line petition I'm sure there would be many of us to sign it, HAPPILY!!!!

The medication has been very effective. I understand that the reason the FDA removed Darvocet from the market is that it may cause rapid heart beat for new users. why couldn't the FDA leave this decision to the personal physician since Darvocet is so effective for many people. If anyone has a contact at the FDA to request an apeal for reconsideration, please respond with a aa posting. Let's all write to FDA to let them know the medication is effective. Even my neurosurgeon commented that he does not agree with FDA's decision.

I have so many adverse reactions to meds that I am grateful to one I can take.  Because of a serious medical problem I need pain meds and other meds.  Has anyone looked at the side effects of all the other drugs being given to patients. Is there one that does not have any? Take some of the newer drugs and look at the reactions.Go back to using the older drugs and maybe people will get better.  Darvocet does not have the serious side effects as several other drugs and I can't understand why taking a good med off the market helps!!! I have never had any problems with this med as I have with so many others.  they come up with newer better drugs for patients, give them to people and side effects are horrible.including death. I say put Darvocet back on the market and let people deside if they want to take it. I was told no one could have bad side effects from the Hepatitis B vaccine,, guess what I did. Does anyone want to listen to that. O NO, people! come on, we need to start listening to our body.

Due to other health problems, i can NOT take any stronger narcotic NOR DO THEY HELP. If not for this drug, i could NOT keep a job or function. I may have even  considered suicide for my unrelenting morning pain!!! No side effects. My doctors say this is a 40  year old drug and JUST AS SAFE AS ANY OTHER PAIN MED OUT THERE!!!!  less addictive and easier on the stomach. FDA...PLEASE RE-THINK THIS DECISION! AS I AM  NOT ALONE!!!

I WOULD USUALLY TAKE JUST 1 OR 2 TABS. A DAY AS NEEDED. I AM APPALLED THE FDA HAS REMOVED SUCH AN EFFECTIVE DRUG FROM THE MARKET.  MY DR. HAS PRESCRIBED ULTRAM, BUT THE REVIEWS ARE SO BAD THAT I'M NOT SURE IT'S EVEN WORTH PICKING UP AT THE PHARMACY.

Most of these conditions have been ongoing for a long period of time, and Darvocet is the only medication I have ever been able to take that helps and has no side effects, I have been taking it for 15 years.  My doctor offered Ultram, which is awful, and did not help.  What are we to do????  This is an awful problem and I know I am not alone!!!

I am allergic to codeine and the &quot;codone&quot; meds as they only make my migraines worse instead of helping...I have been prescribed 4 different pain meds for the breakthrough pain since darvocet was banned and so far NONE of them have worked.  The FDA is also failing to address the fact that all warning with Darvocet say not to stop the medication abruptly.  Since stopping the med, I have had rapid heart beat and very hard heart beats at different intervals.  I agree with those who say take the ones who are abusing the medication off of it and stop punishing those of us who use it correctly and depend on the medication to relieve pain and leave us functional at the same time!

I can't take other pain relievers due to ulcerative colitis. My doctor is stumped... doesn't know what to do for me. Our next step is moving on to more addictive meds, and that can't be good. If this drug &quot;alone&quot; was causing arythmia, I would surely have it. If the problem is those taking this with alcohol and over-taking them, take them off of the meds, but don't make us all suffer for the problems of an idiotic few. The FDA may as well remove every drug on the market, because too much of anything will kill you. I'm unhappy and have had a headache since November 20th!

I had rather take it instead of hydrocodone, percoet or other such medications.  I have been told by health care professionals that it &quot;is a gloryfied asprin&quot; but I have found relief from some pain.  I am sorry to see it no longer available.

I have taken it for years, but have never taken more than 2/day, mostly one per day.  Because of a sensitive stomach, other pain relievers caused upset stomach.  I have quit taking it, but wonder if it is safe to take if one avoids alcohol and only takes one/day?  I was prescribed Tremadol as an alternate, and not only is it ineffective, it causes headaches.

I have been on stronger pills but after 2 hours the pain returned and I was tempted to take more however,I did not. More people die from tobacco and alchahol take that off the shelves. I for one will be glad to sign a waiver so the drug company and Dr. will not be held responsible if something happens. Pick on all the Oxy-cotin drug abusers and leave the people truly walking around in pain be. Bring back Darvocet I will be glad to be the first to sign the waiver

I am allergic to every pain medication that I can take at home other than Demerol and I find it way too strong. Darvocet is the perfect pain reliever for me. It helps my bladder pain, my fibromyalgia, chronic illnesses too many to list and coming home after 24 surgeries to heal. More people have died from taking the Oxy drugs, and vicodin, than darvocet. Take the hard stuff off the market and leave us that have a higher tolerance to pain something we can take without being a zombie!

Where were they the first 30 years and what am I to do?  I can't take Ibuprofen or aspirin because of stormach conditions, and heart blood thinners.

However, in February of this year I experienced a lengthy and very disturbing heart irregularity that made me quite ill. I was checked out at the time and my EKG and other tests showed no abnormalities.  However since then, I have noticed increasing irregular heart rhythms, which I attributed to age and perhaps too much caffeine.  Now I know better.  I stopped taking it four days ago after the news of it's being discontinued, and have had very few noticeable heart rhythm disturbances. activity since.

Certainly hope they can get things figured out with Darvocet and get it or something similar back out there for those of us who depended on the med!
Pain	Bootsgrandma, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	11/22/2010 12:04:42 PM	(This saddens me.  This medication was very helpful over the years with my headaches and arthritis.)Darvocet and Darvon have been pulled from the market at the request of the Food and Drug Administration, which claims the drugs can cause deadly abnormal heart rhythms. The FDA ordered manufacturer Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals to end sales on both the popular painkillers, which contain the drug propoxyphene.The health agency said it arrived at the decision after the release of a study that suggested that the prescription drugs can cause changes to the electrical activity of the heart.&quot;This last study, the cardiac study, was sort of the final piece of the puzzle that told us what the complete picture was,&quot; Dr. Gerald Dal Pan, director of FDA's office of surveillance and epidemiology, told CBS News.The 50-year-old Darvon has aroused safety concerns for decades.The FDA also halted marketing for low-cost drugs containing propoxyphene from generic manufacturers.The popular opioid narcotic propoxyphene is administered to treat mild to moderate pain. According to CBS News, 10 million people in the U.S. were prescribed Darvon in 2009.

IT HELPS! I can function and deal with the pain I am in without having to take something more strong.I have been on it for over 6 years with no problems, thank God. Now they want to take it away from  people who really benefit from it and make us try something new that may hurt us or not work!! They have NO right! If they have the right to voluntarily take it off the market then why don't we have the right to continue to voluntarily take it???? It is our bodies, our lives and should be OUR choice if we continue to take. The choice should NOT be made for us!!! This is a MISTAKE!

On my second night, I took by 1 pill at bedtime. The next afternoon around 1:30 my son was trying to wake me up but couldn't. I was sedated by this drug to the point it put my child in danger. It took me over 45 minutes to be able to speak to my son and over an hour to be able to pick my head up off the bed. I wouldn't recommend this medication to anyone. It has a very strong sedative in it. I have spoken to several doctors about it and none of them prescribe it because it has very harmful side affects.

My teeth were still hurting until my Dr. change it to Percocet 10/650.  Only needed a few day use and the pain eased. Male age 51. LUPUS. SLE. (15 years) FIBRO. DVT's. severe back problems depression and RA. Presodone (10mg daily 15 years) cause teeth cracking in good teeth as a side effect after long term use off the Steroiod.  My Preosodne was reduce and IMRAN (125mg Daily) RA RX was the other option.With LUPUS, SLE life is all about pain.  I have exceptional DR.'s, just no cures.  God help us.

I like the med, but it makes my body feel drunk. Some of the side effects are annoying like the nausea, but tolerable. I take it for knee pain. I was not told it was a narcotic when I was prescribed the med. Make sure you read all the info about it and listen to your body it may take several days to get used to it.

This bad boy needs to come out, however my appt with the oral surgeon to have so done is not for 3 more weeks. So, dealing with the pain and on Keflex as an antibiotic to alleviate the infection - this medication has helped more than words can express. The only side effect that I suffer from it is drowsiness, I cannot for the life of me seem to keep my eyes open So I have to cut them in half to be able to take at work and function (I work with numbers all day - so being alert is a must). Other than that, I went into my dentist office in tears from the pain and left with a sigh of relief.

I cannot use this for pain any longer. Be careful as the side effects may not manifest until using it several times as directed. You may think it is something you ate and blow it off like I did-that was a mistake and I suffered even more because I did not pay attention to my body with the first wave of stomach pain. Continuing to take the medication caused the side effect to be more severe.

Two Darvon-N tablets with 400 to 600 mg. of ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours is very effective in relieving even some of my most severe my pain.  Side effects are minimal so I can perform most of my daily activities including working in the Health Care field.

I've been trying to save my pills only for the most severe migraine attacks but it is definately a wonderful pain reliever.

Pain	odabee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	12/26/2009 1:38:53 PM	I have been having pretty severe pain around my ankle. It was first thought to be a sprain but turned out not to be the case. I was subscribed Motrin 600 at first but it bothered my stomach after a couple days of use so now I'm on Davocet N 100's every 4-6 hours until I see an orthopedic surgeon.  It turned out not to be a sprain so the diagnosis is still unknown.  This medicine helps take some of the pain away as long I make sure not to skip a dose.  I still have some discomfort but at least it's not the driving, unrelenting pain I had been having.  I hope I find out what's causing this pain around my whole ankle.  I also have burning but the davocet seems to control that for the most part.  NO side effects from taking it or stomach upset. I wonder why I wasn't subscribed vicodin?

Sometimes I must take it for my back pain.  I have multiple  sclerosis and I can have pain all through my joints and limbs.  I do not suffer from headaches and can not remember having any severe enough to take an aspirin.  I never drink alcohol or have smoked cigarets - they made me slightly ill and nausaus.  I have never had any tpype of reaction to the drug other than it does efectively stop the pain. I do not get sleepy from darvocett but it is a very effective pain remover and the MOST pills I have ever taken have been 3 or 4 tablets a day.

Recently, the pain has subsided a great deal, but I ended up taking Morphine in the end from the pain and Darvocet does not even begin to compare to the pain relief if you are really suffering. Some people say morphine makes them high, but I was on 150mg daily and even morphine didn't take all the pain away, just made it tolerable, so you can imagine that I seriously contemplated suicide when I was given Darvocet and told it should help the pain. Darvocet is glorified acetominaphine. If you are really in so much pain, you are immobile and can barely hold a fork without screaming with tears from the pain, please take this experience to your doctor and maybe you will not need to go through another few days of horrendous pain. Just as to make sure we are on the same field though, vicodin did not help me at all either and just made me vomit. I went up to the ladder of pain killers and finally ended with Morphine, which as I said before was a necessary evil at the time, but did give me back some independence so that my pain was tolerable.Finally, as soon as my joint pain started subsiding, I gradually lowered the morphine dose each week and had no trouble with addiction. If you are like me and are in ridiculous pain, it is a wonderful medicine, but I feel I was able to come off of it so easily becasue the antibiotics were working and I just didn't feel like my body needed it anymore. If you have an addictive personality though, really talk to your doctor about that. Oh- and make sure you find a good colon therapist.Thanks for listening and hope this was somewhat helpful,Leslie

I most recently am taking this drug for a ruptured cyst on my ovary and it is only dulling the pain. They tried me on hydromorphone but it caused facial swelling so i was taken off that and put back on the darvocet. i guess it's better than nothing. oh, it makes me VERY hyper...jittery almost..anyone else have this symptom??

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	8/20/2009 5:10:47 PM	i take 2(100/650) every six hrs for arthitis pain. i have sjogren's syndrome and have tried all the otc, non-narcotic and steriod treatments out there. i have been on this med for almost 2 yrs. at first it helped and i could get thru my day easier. i am 27 and have a small child. so i am constantly on the go. in the past few months i am taking it with 800mg advil and not much relief. i can no longer work a normal job and getting out of bed in the morning is a trial even half an hour after taking this. i have had no negative side effects and it never made me feel &quot;high&quot; but i think i have built up a tolerance to it and need to try something different.

I am scheduled for an arthroscopic surgery in a week, and have been prescribed PROPO-N/APAP 100 to help with pain managment. I had to double the dose, because one tablet every 6-8 hours is not enough for this lady. Darvocet is ok in what would be called a double dose of 200 mg every 4 hours. I cannot get a good night's sleep if I only take a single dose, and I can hardly walk with crutches. Good thing my operation is on the tenth of August.

I have not had any side effects and I was taking one every 4 to 6 hours.  It has been the most effect for what I have which tylenol would not help for.  I have not even been addicted to it and am now taking one in the late afternoon and one at bedtime.

Pain	mikesmom, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	7/19/2009 11:13:41 PM	Please do not take this medication for granted. It is an opiate just like heroin.  Due to many surgeries years ago, my tolerance to this drug forced me to take more and more of it. Within a few years, I was completely addicted to it, taking daily amounts that wouldn't be believed even if I were to tell it. In my case, large amounts of this drug gave me energy to burn, which I liked raising a family and career. But like most drugs that are abused over time, they began to have very negative effects on my entire body.  This went on for 20 years, and took a major toll on my life. Finally a doctor wanted to put me on methadone.  I was horrified. That is for heroin addicts. He explained that Darvocet is an opiate just like heroin and methadone stops the cravings the same way.  So I started the methadone and haven't looked at another Darvocet or other type of pain pill since.  It's been a win-win situation because the methadone relieves my pain without me getting high and since I am now 60, I will probably use nothing but the methadone for my chronic pain for the rest of my life. The addiction rate of Darvocet has really climbed in recent years, so I don't think you will ever see it go over-the-counter.  And, believe me, that's a good thing!

I have severe endometriosis and am scheduled to have a partial hystrectomy. Don't let your doctor prescribe this! It doesn't work if you have moderate to severe pain. It may be ok for a minor heachache or something. Advil does work better or excedrin. I've had good luck with Ultram (which I wish I was prescibed)- it works great and it's non-narcotic.

Took it for a tooth removal and minor gum surgery, and it did nothing. I swear some advil worked better! Im a 34 yr old female. I think dentists precribe this because they are scared of giving Percocet, or anything that would work. I wound up going to my Dr. and he gave me Percocet 350/500, as he said the dentist should have prescribed it for the severe pain. I seriously think this medicine is bad and it makes you feel pretty yucky and groggy overall with little to NO relief. No thanks.

Although it doesn't take away one hundred percent of the pain, it does work well for my pain control. I would rather take it than some of the other pain meds as it doesn't make me sleepy or feel &quot;drunk&quot;. I am suprized to hear all the contoversy about it causing so many deaths...I have to wonder if it was really darvocet? I hope they don't take it of the market, as it has really helped my career life since I don't have to miss work due to pain anymore. Before Darvocet I went through jobs like a teacher goes through chalk! Since this medication I've been able to actually build a career and stay in one place! I think the main stratagy with Darvocet or any medication is to take it as directed, follow all your doctors orders, and to see him/her regularly.

Darvocet is the only thing available to me and I have taken it off and on for several years.  I can't imagine what I will do if they take it off the market.  I would like to know th ages and medical conditions of the 85 people who died in Florida (which I understand is one of the reasons it is considered a very dangerous drug).  I think it is a disgrace that a few small studies (very people involved) of particular drugs determines the future of these drugs without any consideration of the millions of people who benefit from the drugs, but who are never consulted.  FDA please do not take this drug off the market!

This is the only med I tried and it has worked well for me with no noticeable side effects.  Addiction hasn't been a problem either... I've actually reduced my doseage and frequentcy  in taking it.

It takes a great majority of the pain away. I experienced no side affects. The only time i feel pain is when I move around but the pain is considerably less than when I move around off of the pain killer. I like the drug overall.

It does seem to take the edge of off the pain but I have to be sure I stay on 2 pills every 4 hrs.  Or the severe pain comes right back. During the day I feel a little lightheaded. I also have a terrible taste on my tongue but it its worth it to keep the pain away.
Pain	Karen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/21/2009 9:34:39 AM	I had no idea this drug was dangerous.  I thought Darvocet was just a stronger version of aspirin; BUT, I was in intense pain and wanted relief.  Darvocet alleviated the pain within 15 minutes w/o causing me to be &quot;goofy&quot;.  I felt no other effects except that the pain was GONE and that's all I cared about.  I consider it to be a miracle drug but understand that it is addictive and therefore would not use it other than in extreme cases.

Moved to a room recieved most of the same drugs with the addition of darvocet. was given script of darvocet to take home. find that darvocet works well for pain. Though the others including my favorite Lortab works somewhat better its the euphoria feeling that we like more than the pain relieving effects. Not to insult anyone but think about this in an open and honest self evaluation. Thanks

After a day of taking the meds, I noticed a raised rash all over my face and it itched.  My nose got it the worst.  The back of my throat itched terribly.  I have seasonal allergies and take Zyrtec and thought it was my allergies.  I came to WebMD and read the allergic reactions and that is what I am having.  I have stopped taking it and thrown it away.  It didnt really help with the pain, neither.  It made me sleepy, yet paranoid to fall asleep.  I do not recommend it to anyone at all.  Especially if you have sensitivity to things.

This drug has exacerbated my pain. It causes constipation when taken at strength over an extended period, for me 4-5 tabs a day for 6 weeks. It was reliable for mitigating the top 70% of my pain, but I would have trouble remembering when my last dose was, so I would err on the side of caution. If you let the med level drop in your system, you can expect a 3-6 hour delay in recovering your pain relief. I am now dealing with a blocked/ impacted bowel, most likely cause by this drug.This drug helped manage my pain, but in the end, no pun intended, it has made things worse.

Pain	Bone Pain, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	2/2/2009 7:46:48 PM	I take this medicine for bone pain due to osteomyelititis.  It only works when my pain is minimal (5 or below).  Anything above that and it does not work.  I have taken 2 at once before and sometimes that helps, but I don't think I'm supposed to take that much.  Ultram/Tramadol worked better for me, and didn't have the extra Tylenol.  Unfortunately my body didn't react well to that though.  5mg of Hydrocodone has proven much more effective for bouts of moderate to severe pain.  However, if your pain is minimal then this is probably a good one to try because it does not affect your mind like hydrocodone does (in my opinion).  I wish it worked better... :(

I take the Darvocet N-100 tabs one at a time, usually one per day, sometimes two days in a row.  I find this med to be very effective for me used for that purpose.  But I often have to use it two days in a row.  That seems to end the symptoms.I also had nose surgery recently, and I developed a monster sinus headache a few days later.  By coincidence, I found out that the Darvocet N-100 stopped the sinus headaches very well for me.  This is an effective med for me, and is without side effects.

I have carpel tunnel and arthritis in both hands as well as nerve damage from a fall down some steps. This medication works well for me. It doesn't remove all the pain, but does makes it tolerable. It also doesn't leave me feeling all doped up like other pain meds can. I don't want to walk around in a stupor, I would rather put up with a little of the pain and know what I'm doing. It is best to eat something before you take it though, as it can make you naustious on an empty stomach. Overall, it helps me with my pain enough to continue to take it, and I only take 2 times a day, unless I'm having a really bad pain day, and then 3 times.

Pain	Kitty, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/25/2008 8:40:31 PM	I was first prescribed Darvocet 15+ years ago for menstrual cramps as I had high blood pressure and my doctor felt that the Aleve that I was taking might increase my blood pressure.  I only took it when absolutely necessary.  Today, several years later I continue to take Darvocet on a regular basis, as needed.  It works great for me and I have no side effects from it unless some other pain relievers I have taken. I believe the key to it's effectiveness today for me is due to the fact that I only take it when I am hurting pretty bad, usually I will try to get by on regular Tylenol from the store first, then if it doesn't help I will take a Darvocet later.  I also do not take it every day.

Scheduled to undergo Lumbar Fusion surgery. My doctor prescribed Darvocet-N 100. Loss effectiveness after one month. Expirienced fatigue and shortness of breath. Switched to Vicodin. Although Vicodin works much better for me, I have expirienced some side effects: problems with urination and itching.  I should undergo surgery in 3-4 weeks. I wish it could happen sooner.  I would like to stop using these pain medications.

Quickly developed tolerance and prescribed dose became ineffective for pain relief.  Side effects were bad, with kidney problems and frequent bladder infections which I never had before taking this med.  Also, don't take Tylenol while on Darvocet- I discovered Darvocet has tylenol in it too and you can hurt your liver taking too much tylenol. I found Ibuprofen much more effective for my pain with no side effects so stopped taking Darvocet anymore. Besides the Darvocet pills were huge, bulky pills difficult to swallow.  I stopped going to the neurologist after my back got better and save lots of money by using ibuprofen instead.

Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	35-44	10/11/2008 12:42:56 PM	I was prescribed this medication due to I had Basil Cell Cancer removed from my nose and after that I had to undergo plastic surgery due to the hole that was left after the cancer removal. I had no idea why I was feeling so light headiness and I would have awful mood swings. I had listed that I was on Lamictal for Bipolar when completing the information for the plastic surgeon so therefore did not even imagine that he would prescribe something that could cause more problems. I initially thought that my mood swings were due to me stopping smoking during all of this however I came to Web MD and read the info and stopped taking this for pain and have started feeling somewhat more stable. I am still in pain but overall the pain is better than the mood swings, depression, and light headedness..

I am somewhat concerned, however because it seems I am beginning to build up a tolerance to it. I do not have an addictive personality, don't drink, etc., and other migraine products do not work for me. I would like to see more pain relief products out there that can help those of us who also have stomach ulcers, etc. and  cannot take ibuprofen containing products.

Pain	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	7/25/2008 9:16:10 AM	This is the least effective of the narcotic pain medications I've been prescribed. It has helped with moderate pain, but does not have the strength of Vicodin or Lortab, and, truthfully, the triptan drugs have been much more effective in treating my migraines. No appreciable side effects except for the first time I took it. So I would say it's useful for mild to moderate pain, but for anything worse, I would need something stronger.

It is unconscionable that dr's and dentists perscribe this without going over the side effects or doing anything aporoaching a thorough review of patient history. This is really shocking and shows how greed gets in the way of human decency.

The darvocet changed my life. I was finally able to sleep all night and wake up with no pain. It did after a time give me a mild headache however. I also tended to drop off asleep if I sat down while using it. So, I couldn't drive if I took darvocet. There were no other problems with it. After years of painful nights trying to sleep, I fell in love with darvocet. Sleep loss causes so many health problems....but now, I sleep all night and wake up feeling wonderful! One side effect that was a happy one. I am allergic to everything in the environment and as a result of that, I cough all the time...winter,spring,summer and fall...I can't get rid of the cough. Since I started taking darvocet, the cough is gone! (:

Pain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	55-64	5/10/2008 9:31:48 PM	Generic pill also contains 650 mg acetaminophen.  Had total knee replacement six weeks ago.  Was prescribed Norco but I broke out in a rash all over and horrible itching, so got this instead.  I guess it works.  I took it every six hours during physical therapy because I was afraid it would be painful, but no pain at all.  Doctor tells me I have a high pain tolerance.  Physical therapy is over so I stopped taking it two days ago and my &quot;general malaise&quot; returned (sore neck and shoulders, achey) but have no knee pain or discomfort at all.  I decided to go back on twice a day (9am and 9pm) and it seems to have helped the malaise.  But then, I think ibuprofen might do just as well.  Honestly, I don't really know if it ever worked for me since I've had practically no pain and I didn't stop it to test it.  Especially if I really DO have a high pain tolerance, like the Dr and my husband and the physical therapists say.

Based on my pain level, I couldn't tell whether I had taken a dose or not.  I actually had far better pain relief with Tylenol than I did with the Darvocet.  A waste of money.

Pain	cblpn2005, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	25-34	4/14/2008 5:21:05 PM	I have back pain, and my MD has given me prescriptions for Darvocet, Lortab and Ultram (not all at once though). Darvocet is very ineffective, as I can't tell I've taken anything. Lortab and even Ultram seem to work more effectively.  
Pain	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	25-34	4/12/2008 10:29:43 PM	I took Darvocet (the generic version)to take the edge off of my pain after a spinal fusion. I started out with another pain reliever that worked but made me sick. This works for me but I only use it at night as it knocks me out. It kindof numbs my legs a little and takes the edge off. I would not recommend it during the day though.

Pain	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female		3/25/2008 11:33:01 PM	I took this at night when I couldn't sleep because of pain when ibprofen was not working. It worked quickly and knocked me out so I could sleep. I have not had it at any other time other than night so I don't know how it is otherwise.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	3/24/2008 10:43:19 PM	I am taking this as needed and I usually take one at a time because 2 make me sleepy.  I have to take it ahead of the pain for it to be effective.  If I wait too long it doesn't do much.  I took it with Skelaxin and no food and vomited all night, so be careful.  I blamed the Skelaxin since that was new to me.  (the directions say to take Skelaxin on empty stomach)

It is very effective in relieving pain for me. I recommend always taking with food to avoid stomach upset.  Sometimes I have to take 2 when my pain is severe to get relief.  I also recommend (when taking 2 at a time) drinking lots of water and eating lots of fiber to avoid constipation.  Overall, it works great for me.

After two diskectomies, I still throw my back out every year or so.  The standard course of action is Skelaxin and Darvocet. After a week or so the pain is gone. Darvocet works for me. Vicoden is too good.  I can't funtion on it.  Non prescription pain killers are not effective. Side effects are head ache and stiff neck.

After the drain (w NO anesthetic!!! cruel) and the worst pain of my life, they gave me darvocet which was a waste of money and didnt touch the nerve damage and excruciating pain. For people with higher tolerance to meds from chronic pain, who need medicine to help, this is not the answer, it may help to dull acute pain, but it is worthless for those who suffer from chronic pain. the docs are scared to prescribe what they know works anymore, for fear of lawsuits. So sad. For those it works for, great, but it is too weak for chronic pain sufferers.

Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	2/7/2008 9:49:33 PM	I took this for my moderate migraines (Vicodin for the severe) and it works well. Made me a bit spacey after the first few doses, but it stopped after a while. The only problem is the stigma with narcotics. I'm in my 20s, and I was pulled over while I had my meds on me, and had to go through a few hours of verification of RX garbage.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	2/7/2008 3:39:38 PM	I am sensitive to narcotics; therefore, I have to cut the darvocet into 1/4 ths. This also decreases its effectiveness.

Pain	bluemtnsman, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	55-64	2/6/2008 12:06:33 PM	This was prescribed for pain relief after a Procedure for Prolapsed Hemmarhoids (PPH).  The first two days worth did aid in sleep and a very large reduction in pain.  After two days ( approx.12 doses ) the effectiveness appeared to be somewhat reduced.  After using as needed for a week the effectiveness appeared to be very minumial.One of the major side effects associated with this medication is constipation.  Constipation as a side effect would seem to make this contra-indicated when used after hemmarhoid surgery.  And yes, after a week of use as prescribed, I noticed some moderate constipation in spite of maintaining a very high fiber diet.
Pain	katkam2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	2/4/2008 11:59:52 PM	I have osteoarthritis in my lower back along with a bulging disc.  Also frequent headaches. Takes the edge off the pain, but makes my thinking quite foggy.  DOES NOT work for kidney stones! I prefer Vicodin for pain, but it can be very addictive since it usually takes away all of my pain. And Percocet just makes me mean.  Overall Darvocet is not much better than Advil or Aleve.

This has helped me tremendously!  I also took Darvocet up to 4 times a day after foot surgery (had a bone shortened) and it made my recovery pain very tolerable.  I have also taken Darvocet in the past for injuries; after a car accident causing severe brusing of my chest and whiplash and again after being mauled by a large dog.  The pain from both of these injuries was adequately relieved by the Darvocet.

It was like taking nothing.  I'm very hard to medicate for pain anyway as are both my parents.  Maybe it's a genetic thing.  I was very unhappy with the lack of effectiveness of this medication.

I am taking it now for a shoulder injury (rotator cuff tear). It does help somewhat for pain but at times is no more effective than over the counter pain relievers. The only way it masks the pain for me is to yake it every four hours.

Pain	LuLuGreen, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	11/26/2007 11:07:34 PM	I was prescribed this when I broke my pelvis in a car accident. Taking this in the morning with a light snack was the only thing that made moving (on crutches)possible without extreme pain. I liked that it didn't upset my stomach like most other pain meds do, and it didn't make me feel drugged or dopey. It just helped with the pain.

Pain	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	5	Male	65-74	10/30/2007 6:02:39 PM	Used as pain relief on two occasions. First, following surgery for colon cancer; and, secondly, severe pain from spasm and strain of lower back incurred from yard work. On both occasions, a pill or two was all that was required ... one each day for two days. Mother nature did the rest. I have a fairly high tolerance for pain and heal fast. It does not make the pain completely go away, but I was able to function normally with a small amount of discomfort until I healed.

Pain	jennxcook, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	13-18	10/29/2007 3:57:51 PM	I had back surgery for scoliosis in 2005. They placed 2 titanium rods &amp; 16 bolts to straighten my spine. I was told my back pain would cease but after a year or so it came back. And worse if I might add. They first prescribed me Vicadin but i refused t take it. I've been taking darvocets for 5 months now. It works to ease my pain back although sometimes it gives me a high feeling. I find myself craving them every once in a while. But I still recommend them for teenagers with severe back pain.

I have fibromyalgia and arthritis, and She said that this would stop the pain from becoming unbearable.  It is easier to prevent pain from getting worse than to wait til it is unbearable and then try to aleviate it.  I am finding by taking one every morning, there are even some days I do not have to take more, and I have cut down by half the amount I take in a month!  Truly amazing.

Pain		3	4	2			10/12/2007 7:35:58 PM	For chronic pain, it is better than something over the counter, but not as effective as Vicodin or Norco. You have to take more of the Darvocet to obtain any pain relief and therefore put your liver at risk.  The generic is horrible and barely works at all!

Pain		1	5	1			10/11/2007 11:52:58 AM	I switched to this after being on Vicodin for years, the doctors just would not give me the Vicodin in the quantities I needed. Now I have to take more Darvoset to get half the results, but you are at the mercy of the doctors, what can you do?
