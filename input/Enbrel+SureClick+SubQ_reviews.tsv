Rheumatoid Arthritis	amt, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	9/10/2012 3:04:41 PM	I've had RA for 13yrs. I was on methotrexate,plaquenil and prednisone(when needed). Had to be taken off of plaquenil as it started messing up my vision. Been on enbrel for 5 wks. 1st shot gain 7 lbs of fluid overnight. The fluid went away the 2nd day. Still gain 3 lbs of fluid a week but goes away the 2nd or 3rd day after the shot. However, I have gained weight very fast in the 5 weeks I've been on it. I have missed more work since taking this. Have headaches daily, worse in the afternoon. I am more fatigue, shortness of breath, blood pressure shoots up then bottoms out. Seem to have more problems remembering things. I can't see any improvement at all. The sureclick is an easy way to give yourself the shot. So far I'm not impressed with this.

The second issue is the headaches, dry nose and red, itchy spot on my injection area. This drug works, but I will tell you, the headache is crippling too. If it weren't for the severity of my RA, I would seek additional drug. Weight losss is more difficult on this drug.

Seems I have good days and bad days still.  My bad days are usually right before my short is due a day or two before.  I don't know what i think right now if its helping I have Lupus SLE.  And Fibro.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	kemorris, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	5/29/2012 11:33:21 PM	I was diagnosed with RA 2 years ago at age 68. I was started on Enbrel sure-click injections which I gave myself in my thigh weekly. I had no reaction to this injection, no pain, no swelling, no redness. It does help to let it warm for 45 min. before injecting, if it's cold it stings like a wasp sting.  During the treatment with this drug my Dr. also had me on low doses of Prednisone and on Methotrexate.  It took 5 months for the Enbrel shots to start taking effect but when they did I knew it immediately. It was like turning on a light switch. The downside was with the Methotrexate. This drug left me feeling absolutely breathless. I couldn't walk up or down stairs (or even to the mail box) without having to sit down and catch my breath.  I would find myself just sitting in the car driving to work and taking deep breaths so that I felt like I had enough air in my lungs.  I told the Dr. I did not want to take Methotrexate anymore because of the difficulty I had with breathing. Once that drug was stopped I felt really great taking low doses of Prednisone (5 mg daily) and the weekly Enbrel injections.  If Medicare paid for most of the cost of the Enbrel injections I would probably still be taking it.  I am now taking infusion drugs (first Remicade, and had to discontinue due to an allergic reaction) now trying Actemra (have only had 1 infusion so far) but honestly can't feel like it's doing much. I had to start taking 25 mg of Prednisone to get the swelling and inflammation under control that arose during the period I was off any drugs due to the allergic reaction to Remicade.  I am now on 20mg Prednisone daily and am virtually pain free. However...everyone knows this is an awful drug to take too, all things that help either in the short run or long run are taking a final toll on my longevity.  But I guess everyone has to decide for themselves what the trade offs are worth.

It was very hard for me to get out of bed, get up from sitting down on chairs, sofas, etc. But I'm losing alot of my hair! Has anyone else had this happen to them. I don't want to lose my hair so I'm really considering stopping this medication! So good luck to all! Hope this doesn't happen to you!

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	12/2/2011 11:49:13 AM	I have been on Enbrel for 1 year, diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis. I was on MTX 30mg/wk and had tried Plaquinil and had many cortizone injections. After my first injection within 3 days I could not believe how well I felt. Before I could barely get out of bed.  I now take the injection (sureclick) twice a month, no MTX or cortizone.  I feel really good and have had no flares. I do sometimes have a raised red mark at the site of injection. I need to try the ice before injecting. Hope I continue to feel good.

The medication is highly acidic and burns terribly when injected but only for a few seconds.  The burning is well worth it for me!

I spent 2 years of my life in bed suffering and it took another 2 years for the doctor to finally Rx Enbrel and a month later I was a differant person.

I have had moderate Psoriasis since I was 8 and progressed to severe in my teens(I am 50 now)In my lifetime I have used ever topical that ever came out. Most did little to nothing and some did really well at first then became less effective after little use. I have been in many studies and have been poked, prodded, cut on and paraded. I am sure that if you look at the current college dermatologist text books you will see a picture of me. After reading the side effect of Enbrel I was scared to use it. My last visit to my Dr. before starting Enbrel, I was more that 90% covered and the sides of my chest would split and bleed each time I raised my arms. I began using the sureclick injections twice a week. In the third week the splits in my side cleared up and the Plaques began to shrink. Around 7 to 10 weeks the Plaques had disappeared and red spots were less noticeable. Around 12 to 14 weeks the red spots disappeared. I still have a few spots and scares that the psoriasis left but it is nothing like I have ever experienced. I feel like a normal person for the first time in my adult life. I have not had any problems from using Enbrel yet and I would like to stand up and be counted and as a Enbrel success story. Enbrel has given me a much happier life and I am truly thankful. My hope is that other people that can get the same results that i have had.

I was doing both shots on different days and would only get about 2 days from each shot.  Dr had me doing both shots the same day and has been a little better.  Will see if it gets better if not they will change me to something else.  Also had to go back on prenisone everyday.

I use the Sure Clic pen and it's very easy to use. The joint pain in my hands is under control and I live a very active life. Work out at gym &amp; golf 4 times /week.

I move easily in the mornings without difficulty and exercise regularly.  The sureclick is difficult to self inject at first because of the joint inflammation, but once controlled it gets easier.

I quit Enbrel 6.5 months ago my breathing is better but the weight won't come off. I also worked out at a club after the first 15 lbs put on and I still gained. I gained until the day I quit using it. Would I do it again? No but It does force me to look elsewhere other than western medicine. Best of Luck to you.

My condition was improoved a lot after the first week of Enbrel. However, it didn't get rid of my imflamation on one foot. My experience is enbrel + Methtraxate is powerful. I am trying to have a baby, so I just take Enbrel along now and it controls the symptom pretty well that I can live my normal life without feeling too much pain. I found excercise also improve the joint stiffness and pain a lot. I even thought I cured my RA with excercise daily. However, I had a flare up which make me realized that I still need my medication to control the disease. All in all, big thumb up for the enbrel.

I have been taking it for about 4 years not and could not get out of bed without it. I do get the copay asst which has helped so much. I am 30 now and to be able to play with my kids is worth it.

It was slow at noticing any improvement to start with but would not want to live without it know. Injection site sometimes will get red and swell, let it sit out and get room temperture to not burn and sting when injection goes in. It is a miracle drug for me with Ankylosing Spondylitis.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Susan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	3/22/2010 9:13:52 PM	I have had RA for 10 years in which I have been controlled with methotrexate, plaquenil, and sulfasalzine.  I have used prednisone when having a flare.  I started a year ago with much more fatigue and feet pain, burning and aching daily.  Also I have trouble with my hands aching but not as much as my feet.  I started Enbrel in Oct. and I have two shots remaining to complete 6 months of treatment.  I am only able to work every other day and it seems I have many more bad days than good days. I am very disappointed this drug did not work for me.  I talked to the doctor about switching to something else.  He mentioned Simponi but not sure what we will do next. If any one out there has gone from Enbrel to another drug that did work for them I would appreciate the name of it.

One year ago RA started acting up, tried methotrexate, but I was so tired, I could not think... Lost out on a great job because of this.

I am 24 and got diagnosed with RA when I was 4. I started taking Enbrel when it first came out about six years ago. Although I have permanent damage done to my joints from my disease in the early year Enbrel has stopped the progression. I have few achy days and nobody even notices that I have RA unless I tell them. When I was younger my range of motion was very poor and noticeable to everyone.  If you are on the fence about taking Enbrel jump off and start shooting up some drugs that actually work to get your life back.

I started the Enbrel SQ on Mothers Day and my relief just started this week June 21'st. I still have some pain in my hands and I still can't close my hands all the way. I still have some pain in my shoulders and knees. But I'm really happy about my improvement. Of course I was told (when I asked) by my doctor that this drug will not help my back pain and it hasn't. I'm thankful that at last a medication has helped me feel better.

I've tried plaquenil and a breif time on methotrexate having no positive results from those. I started on Enbrel about 3 months ago and its been amazing. No flare ups and practically no joint pain at all. My only problem with Enbrel is that I spend the whole day dizzy and light-headed after the injection and I also have injection site reactions that seem to go away if I put a cold pack on the area for about 10 minutes.

Not very eff-hard to perform every day act.  Started Enbrel Sureclick 2 mo ago.  Within 2 wks great improve-can walk, move, work and live again (I didn't think it was poss).

Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	3/30/2009 1:29:27 PM	I've been on this for about a year now (a year of Humira prior to that).  It has eliminated my joint inflamation though it hasn't done much at getting rid of my psoriasis.  I am worried about the cost of the drug; I don't know what I'll do if I lose my job or lose healthcare.  Especially since I couldn't do anything without lots of pain prior to starting on Humira/Enbrel.
Plaque Psoriasis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	3/4/2009 3:26:33 PM	I was on the medication for about 6 months. It helped clear up many of my original lesions, but found new ones sprout up elsewhere. After having been off the drug for 7 months, I have lesions in places I've never had them before, still get itchy patches around old injection sites, and have occasional lymph node swelling assoicated with minor infections (sinus infections and ear infections)

It was a miracle drug for me. I started injections 5 years ago and changed to sure click a year ago.  I stil have flare ups from time to time but it has be very helpful to my life.

This stuff works!!!  No stiffness or pain. If I stop taking it for more than 2 weeks I can barely move.  While using it I have no physical limitations.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	tfiscus41, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	1/28/2009 6:37:53 PM	I have been on Enbrel for 3 months and can feel the difference by 75%, and getting better. But the price scares me to death. I am low income and get the Embrel quick assist for one year but then whatdo you do. I hate to get use to something then have to lose it. Its a very very costly drug. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Allie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	4	Female	35-44	1/23/2009 12:58:29 PM	Diagnosed RA for 1.5 yrs, pain for 5.5.  Enbrel didn't work for me, but after writing a scathing review on the Humira pen, decided I should write here about how great the Enbrel pen is.  The inventor of the 2nd (finished!) click is a genius (Humira doesn't have it).  I would have rated the pen a 5/5 but since it didn't relieve pain, that's not really fair!  ;-)I felt much more confident injecting $400 (or $800 with Humira) of drug into my body with the Enbrel pen.Be sure to take the Enbrel out to sit 30 min. before injecting, and ice your leg for 5+ min before you inject.  Spread the skin out flat (with Humira you have to grab it and plump it up - another peeve of mine!). And ice afterwards, too.  If this drug works for you the pain would be so worth it!There is an assistance program to help people with the cost of biologics.  Talk to your local Arthritis Foundation chapter for help.  I'm lucky that I haven't paid a penny for Enbrel or Humira - my copay is covered in full for the first 6 months of either drug by the respective drug companies (up to $275/mo, I think it is).  Be sure to ask your rheumie for the discount card (looks like a credit card) you give to your pharmacist - available to all just for asking.Good luck, and may everyone reading this have a pain free (and psoriasis free!) day!

I of course have tried all the topicals, otc and rx. Most worked at least a bit for 6 to 9 months before the effectiveness faded. Unbelievable results on this drug. With a needle phobia the size of Montana, the SureClick is irreplacable. Now for the effects, WOW. In two weeks a full stage lower in all areas. Now at 10 weeks, 80% reduction in area, and at worst stage 2. Thank You.

Now my head doesnt itch and my psoriasis is clearing up. The only down side is that my legs have bruised from the injections but that's a small very small price to pay for the relief.

I am on my husband's insurance which his employer seems to change every six months and not one of them would approve this type of drug for me.  We finally got a managed health plan who approved this drug and though I was afraid to take it at first, I soon found out what a wonderful drug it is.  I am able to get out of bed every morning, the stiffness has gone from a couple of hours to about 15 minutes or so and I feel so much better!  I still have a flare up every once in awhile (not as often as before Enbrel) and take Prednisone for that.  I am so thankful that my rheumatologist put me on Enbrel, it has literally been a life-saver.
Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	frustrated patient, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	65-74	8/30/2008 2:54:06 PM	I was diagnosed 39 yrs.ago with psoriatic arthritis and lived on naprosyn for approx. 13 yrs. refusing prednisone and methodtrexate due to side effects.  I have had many operations on my feet due to severe damage to joints &amp; also hands.  I started Enbrel in 2002 and was amazed how it stopped future damage and gave me back movement and cleared psoraisis somewhat. In late 06 early 07 had an infection and continued taking Enbrel.  After 4 different antibiotics, very low blood pressure and weakness and development of a rash reaction to the antibiotics realized I should have stopped Enbrel during this time. Ever since I have a pustile type rash over my legs, feet and hands,now starting on my back. Dr.&amp; Dermatologist said it was due to Enbrel, switched me to Humira.  After 2 injec.severe swelling in ankles, one side effect of Humira is onset of Congestive Heart failure.  Dr.refused to refill Enbrel prescrip.and wants me to take Methotrexate in addition to Enbrel.  Has anyone using Enbrel experienced this same pustile rash and if so what worked to you?
Plaque Psoriasis	lbrylski, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	19-24	7/17/2008 9:48:30 AM	I started enbrel about three weeks ago. I am using it to rid myself of my embarassing psoriasis. I also have psoriatic arthoritis. I have been on approx. 10 different topocal creams. None of them gave me any relief. Enbrel already after a few shots has helped me immensley. I cant wait to see the full results. THANK YOU ENBREL!! I did feel sick at first. kind of like morning sickness. the injection doesn't hurt but the medicine going in does burn quite a bit.

I could barely walk up-right until I started taking Enbrel, I saw significant improvement in my overall health within weeks. The injection site is always swollen, red and itchy but the small discomfort is well worth it!

I had to use a cane to get around, but no longer have to. Just days after using Enbrel I felt a thousand times better. The ease of using the Sureclick is so easy. Doctors had me on Hydrocodone, Methotrexate, Celebrex, to name a few, and none really relieved the pain like Enbrel does. Thanks a million to those R &amp; D people who worked on this drug.

I started with the injections and it was terrable I would get the itching,redness,swelling. Now I get the sure click and thank GOD it is fantastic, no reactions at the sight, not painfull to inject like the needle was. My husband jumped so high because he was releaved that the sure click was so easy.  I have many other diseases, uveitis,ostepoina,ra,and now I have been able to even lower my use of steroids graduly and am lower than I have ever been able to get on steroids in 6 yrs so I would say this is a FANTASTIC DRUG. If your insurance dosn't pay for it then call 1-888-4PPA, they can help get it paid for or help pay for some of it. Good luck and thank you for this fantastic medication!!!!!

I could barely move my fingers, hands, arms and walking was painful.  I had many nodules in my fingers, arms and feet.  I take Enbrel along with 17.5 mg Methotrexate.  I am able to work full time.  Many nodules have disappeared.  Still have some stiffness, but no swelling and pain has been reduced by 80%.  Noticed improvement after a few weeks.  Have been on Enbrel for just over a year now.  I highly recommend this medicine.

I started using the injections before the sureclick came out and was very pleased with how well Enbrel worked for me.  After I switched to the pen I started to have horrible injection site reactions.  The site would swell, itch and become hot for a week.  If I gave the shot in my stomach you could see the swelling through my shirt.  My doctor then switched me back to the syringes but it kept happening so I had to switch medicines.  I was very upset b/c nothing has worked quite the same since then.

Although other medications helped, my doctor highly recommended Enbrel and he was right!  I've been on it now for 8 months and feel better than I ever have.  The sureclick is so easy to use and the company has a great support system. I felt signficant reductions of my RA symptoms in just a few short weeks.  I had to fight my insurance company to pay for this but I tell people that I'm so glad I did because I have a new lease on life and can now keep up with my 5 year old daughter!

I was a bit leary about doing the sureclick the first time, but like someone else stated, it's a piece of cake! I would've never been able to do the syringe thing because  of the immobility in my hands and fingers. Thanks Enbrel!

My doctor  had tried everything else.  Enbrel has come a long way and it is getting better and better.  People who start using Enbrel and begin with the Sureclick, have no idea what others and the company have gone through to improve the drug and the way it is to be given.  This company is the most supportive company I have ever dealt with when it comes to prescriptions.  They are there 24/7 and believe me, I have used their services literally HUNDREDS of times since the drug first came out.  It does not solve all of my Psoriatic Arthritis problems, but it is doing more than any other drug has.  They (the company) help in more ways than I wish to get into here, but lets just say that I will owe them forever for all that they have done for me.

Two years ago my right hand began and forearm began bothering me terribly.  I had PT for bracitis (sp?) for several months and that helped considerably.  A bit later, I had a lot of swelling and pain in the same area (hand esp).  After seeing a rheumatologist, and several tests, I began Enbrel shots along with a sulfa based drug.  I get sick to my stomach if I take too many of the Sulfa drugs.  I have had great results with Enbrel!  It has helped me so much, I couldn't believe it.  I could see and feel so much improvement after one shot.  I am able to exercise again and feel so much better.  However, not sure if it is the lack of exercise in the last year, but I have gained about 10 pounds.  Of course I don;t like that part of it, but am working on it.  I am wondering however, if Enbrel has a side effect that causes weight gain.  Any help from anyone on this idea is welcome.  Sally
