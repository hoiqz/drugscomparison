Reduced the dosage but did not help.  Still had no control for the diarrhea.

Works so well I only need to take 1 pill a day.  Bowel movements are normal for the first time in years.  I can eat things I havent eaten in years.  Can't say enough about this drug.  Do have dry mouth but who cares.

Nothing has worked even slightly like Pamine Forte. It definitely causes dry mouth, scratchy throat, but it is so worth it because it helps ease my symptoms during a flare up so that it's possible for me to be in public, have a semi-normal life! Works in about 20 minutes or so, taking 2.5 mg - 5 mg at a time. Life saver!
