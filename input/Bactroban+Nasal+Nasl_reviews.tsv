Other	Nadia Estelle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/2/2011 12:37:43 PM	I developed a serious bacterial infection and this drug was one of the many drugs prescribed to me. The side effects were mild and the drug was easy to administer. Upon taking the medicine I would chew a piece of gum to keep me from gagging or chocking on the awful taste.
Other	complicated, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	3/15/2011 6:19:14 PM	I have recurrent nose infection. I have not filled this Rx as it calls for mixing the ointment with water and salt and irragating your nose.  Too complicated and ointment and water does not mix.  Any suggestions.

On the third day of taking this med, I fainted, was dizzy and vomited. I do not know if this was from the medicine or from the MRSA. Any thoughts?

I HAVE ALLERGIES AND NASAL PASSAGES ARE VERY DRY.  ALLERGIST DID NOT TELL ME DRYNESS IS CAUSED BY BACTERIA.  IS THIS PRESCRIBED AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE TO KEEP ME FROM GETTING A BACTERIAL INFECTION? OTHER SITES STATE IT IS USED FOR IMPETAGO RASH????  PHARMACIST TELLS ME THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BACTROBAN NASAL THAT THERE IS ONLY THE CREAM OINTMENT.

The directions made it sound complicated to use the easiest way to use the ointment is wash hands and put medicine on tip of finger and rub it in the inside of nose and then wash your hands again.

Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Bacteria in Nose		3	4	3			6/25/2009 1:53:30 PM	this medication is easy to use, it does its job, and you dont have to sallow some huge pill that you gag on everytime you try to take it. but since being on it my nose runs like a racehorse and it causes the worst tasting nasal drip ever. but its still better than having to choke down a pill.
