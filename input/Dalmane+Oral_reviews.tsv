I still wake up periodically but am usually able to go right back to sleep after a couple of minutes. I find that it does cause some crazy off the wall dreams but I can't sleep without it. I used to have to have the tv on every night to fall asleep but since taking this medication it doesn't matter if the tv is on or not. Most nights I can fall asleep within 10 minutes of taking this drug.

Dalmane works for me, no hangover but i do wake up sometimes depressed to dispair. It passes after i get up and move around. I wonder if it is the Dalmane ?

Before Dalmane, I was a wreck. I could maybe eek out 2 or 3 hours of restless sleep per night. I was disabled.My doctor had had me on everything from Klonopin to Valium, and ALL the TCA's. We even tried some older drugs like Miltown, and Seconal; nothing seemed to work! I've tried well in excess of 30 Rx sleep aids over the years.  Lunesta worked quite well, but only at 12mg, four times the recommended dose! Needless to say, that would break the bank. Then we tried Dalmane. I have been taking 30mg to 60mg, an hour before bedtime for the last 5 years (combined recently) with 22.5mg of Remeron. I sleep 8-9 hours every night, without fail!  Any hangover is minor and actually gives me a welcome sense of calm throughout the day. It's CHEAP, too!

The bitter taste in your mouth doesn't seem to go away. Second night on 60 mg, I only got 5 hours of sleep....not impressed, maybe tonight will be better. My Dr told me to give it about a week.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	shugababy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/8/2009 5:15:57 PM	I have been taking this med for a week. It is exactly what I have been looking for. I have tried Ambien, and Ambien CR. Both are too strong. I would cook, eat, and drive. I had no memory of anything until the next morning. One night I loaded my son in the car a drove off. I bumped another car at a red light near my home. I made a uturn and haven't taken that medication since. This medication is great. It softly puts me to sleep. Even when I wake up to check on my son or go to the bathroom, I go right back to sleep. This med is great. This one is a keeper.

Every once in a while it will not work, but without it I would probably be up 3 days at a time: with it, I have maybe 1 bad day a month.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	stevecayman, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	3/15/2008 7:25:44 AM	Normally 30 mgs will work for me in combination with 5mg of Xanax.  About three weeks ago I lived with my sister to aid in the care of her dying husband.  What I saw and what I had to do in conjunction with his care was far and away beyond what the &quot;normal&quot; person might be able to handle so I then took 45mg of Dalmane and was able to sleep through the night except at the times when my assistance was needed, but then was able to return to sleep.  At this writing I am going through the greeving process and told my psychiatrist what I had done and he wanted to eliminate both meds.  No, I do not have an addiction problem nor am I prone to it.  What I did was a temporary measure during an overly stressful time and able to return to my usual dosage.  Now he wants me to add Serroquel to my drug regimen, but the negatives severely outweigh the positives for me.  Under the right conditions, Dalmane is a very effective sleep aid without the harmful, ineffective benefits of other sleep aids on the market.  Find yourself another psychiatrist who doesn't or won't understand caregiving and grief.  Dalmane remains my best choice as I have tried all other sleep aids to date.

It won't go away with brushing, mouthwash, chewing gums, or breath mints... anyone else experienced this?
