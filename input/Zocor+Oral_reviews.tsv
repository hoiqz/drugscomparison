Suffered muscle pain from the start, gave it about 6 months without a change. Went off it and the pain was gone within 2 weeks. Costco pharmacist advised me they have more complaints about Zocor than anyting else. Dr. put me on Pravastatin, all is well after 1 year. Gerds disappeared also, coincidentally?

Also, upset stomach and weakness and tiredness. Went to a foot dr and he would not treat me, said it was zocor and to stop it NOW.  Funny, I was just increased from  20 to 40 mg after I told them the symptoms. It plainly says with liver problems( gallbladder removed, so liver works harder) not to take can cause problems. Also, says if older people more succeptable to complications. I fit that scale too.

Don't know if it has anything to do with this med, but just don't like how I'm feeling. Can't sleep the whole night lucky if I get 4 hrs due to the joint pain and abdm pain. Seeing my Dr in a couple of days to discuss changing this med. to something else. Can't continue with the pain any longer. This med has done it's job but it's creating havoc on my body and mind for the worse.  I know I'm a senior, but at 62 I can't stand what I'm going thru right now.

High Cholesterol	Ron, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	2/8/2012 4:15:33 PM	I have been taking this medication for almost 2 years now. There have never been any side effects that I can report. My total Chol is now 160 (down from 207). I am typically NOT someone that takes pills for anything. The Zocor and an occasional allergy tablet are all I take so I was extremely against taking this medication, especially after I read some of the reviews and side effects. OMG, it's enough to scare you away from the meds completely. My Dr (excellent man, by the way) assured me that we would monitor the results closely and watch the liver panel numbers. So far, so good, like I said. (Trig - 120, HDL 42 and LDL 96) I am exercising 3-4 days a week and I only eliminated soda, french fries and mayo from my diet. I eat lean meats (worth the extra money) and never eat creamy sauces. I eat a lot of fruit (2-3 servings a day) and eat veggies every day. This is just waht worked for me. I wish you well if you are considering the medication. With a few small changes to diet, I believe the Zocor has served me well so far.

Talked to friend who experienced all the pain and muscle weaknes described by the majority of these posts.  Will NOT take this drug under any cirsumstances now.  Will work on diet and exercise and look to more holistic meds.  The cure seems worse than the disease.

Tried 3 other statins which resulted in muscle pain within weeks of starting. I started 10 mg of zocor along with a heart-healthy diet and exercise about 7 weeks ago. My cholesterol went from 320 to 178, triglycerides from 336 to 147, and HDL 205 to 103. My doc was suprised since it is a low dose - I think the diet and exercise were key as well. Anyway, best numbers I have ever had!!

I DO NOT recommend this drug for anyone with a history of depression due to the risk of suicide.

I was taking 40 mg a day.  I began to have pain in my arms and legs and I was very weak.  My Dr. did not seem to think it was caused by zocor.  I quit taking it after doing research on my own.  I am still having problems and I have been off of it for almost three months.  IMO, it is a very bad drug and I advise do not take it.
High Cholesterol	goodgirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	12/20/2011 2:30:57 PM	I was on Zocor for about 2 years with no problems then one night I woke up with extreme stomach pain and called my doc the next day. He saw me, did blood work and an ultrasound of my stomach and put me in the hospital. My liver enzymes were in the 700s due to taking Zocor and he took me off of it immediately and I was in the hospital for 2 days really sick. Currently I am on no cholesterol meds and am scared to go back on anything so I try to watch what I eat and try to exercise as much as possible. Zocor is the only cholesterol med I have ever tried.

I have no side effects. I take it in the morning as I forget to take it at night. I do honestly think it is due to being 64 years of age. I play tennis 3-4 X a week and golf once. My cholesterol is under control. By the way, I have no hair loss and am told that I look 10 years younger than I am. SO????

During that time my leg muscles became weaker over time until one day I fell and couldn't get up.  My legs felt like Jello - it was extremely scary.  I immediately stopped taking it.  Now, a year later, I have slowly gained back some of the strength I lost, but still not back to normal.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Stop taking it immediately, if you start noticing any muscle weakness.

I'm a newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic. What this medication did for my cholestrol was great. What it did for my ability to multitask, make high level decisions was horrible! I was on this medication for 4 months. I spent 2 anxious degrading months not sure if I had early signs of a debilitating disease. My doctor had me stop taking it. It's been nearly three weeks and my memory is returning and I'm more able to function than I have been in the last several months. My situation is rare, but there is nothing advising this potential side effect for this medication anywhere!

Felt like the flu or something. Blood pressure went through the roof. Screw this junk. I`m NOT taking any more. If I lived a few years longer having to feel like this, I would rather feel normal and die sooner.

It worked Great. Our Insurance CO. decided we should be on as many generic drugs as we could, so my DR. put me on Pravastatin. In 6 months my total # went from 154 to 218. My Liver function also raised some. About that time My Husband Retired, and we lost our Medical Insurance. I diiscovered that Generic for Zocor had just been added to Kroger's $4.00 list. My Dr. switched me to it, and as of last week when I had Fasting Bloodwork, my Chol. total # is back down to 152, and my 3 levels are right where they should be. I get 3 Months supply of 20MG Simvastatin for $10.00. No Insurance at Krogers Pharmacy. If you have no Insurance, and are not old enough for Medicare, TRY IT.

Went to Dr. and put on Prilosec and Zantac. Did not help. Went to gastroenterologist kept on 2 Prilosec per day. Little relief. Scheduled for colonoscopy and scope. Meanwhile I am miserable and going to work feeling sick. Gave up coffee, soda, gum - tried everything!! Finally, doing my own research online I read that heartburn cn be a side effect of this drug. Went off med on my own and within 4 days all symptoms vanished. I lost 3 months of my good health to this stuff and wasted time at dr.'s offices. I feel fine now thanks to myself.

Colon problems and muscle pain increased to unbearable levels but doctors always had some other excuse. Recently found out that Merck had cut the recommended dose in half for people using my high blood pressure medicine. Told my doctor and he blew it off as &quot;defensive medicine&quot;. I stopped Zocor on my own, and within 2 days my symptoms started improving. I'm not taking Zocor again, and not going back to that doctor again.

High Amount of Triglyceride in the Blood	Daryl Lee, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	45-54	6/8/2011 11:48:18 PM	I am a WM, 47, 205lbs, in good physical condition.  The first round of tests, last year, my Tri's were at 1600, Dr put me on Tricor.  Muscle aches, neck and back pain, loss of erections DURING sex, horrifying episodes of ED. I had NEVER had issue in that area... need I say more.  Numerous visits to the chiropractor (who incidentally figured out the muscle and bone issues might be the statins fault).  3 month Re-test showed the Tri's had dropped to 1200 after 30 days of the statin (refusing to take it after the 30 days) and 1000mg sustained release Niacins at night.  I told the doc that if it effects the sex life, I would rather go out smiling than embarrassed. 9 months later; re-tested and found to be progressing at 960.  I did not expect a dramatic decrease, but it was a marked improvement.  Dr wanted to do the statin thing again.  After 2 days, I am getting the same ED side effects. I guess the night sweats from the niacin will be better than not being able to enjoy a healthy sex life and the body aches.  
A Type of Inherited High Blood Cholesterol Disorder	Sick and Tired of being lied to, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	6/2/2011 12:29:57 PM	I started Zocor because I tried Pravachol and Lipitor and they both make me dizzy.  So I took the Zocor for three days and tried to deal with a constant burning headache and enormous fatigue.  I decided to stop taking it, to see it that was what was causing the headache.  It took two days to go away and then after the two days I tried breaking the 40mg tab in half and taking a 20 mg dose at bedtime to see if maybe that would be ok.  I got a headache within two hours of laying down to sleep and I still have a headache this morning at 11:25.  I have been putting taking statins for 15 years to see how the general public would react to them.  I am not convinced.  I will not take them again.  My husband has been on 3 different statin drugs for 14 years now and is having horrible side effects.  He cannot swim or walk the dog without intense muscle cramps that last for hours.  Facial twitches, heart palpitations.  These are NO GOOD people!  They are killing us.  NOT saving lives.

I was on Crestor for years with good results, but like many others had to try the generic for the insurance company.  I was told by my pharmacist that if I tried Zocor and it was not effective or problematic, that my doctor could then put me back on Crestor and the insurance company would pay for it.  Those of you that had to change for insurance and are experiencing problems, check with your pharmacist to see if you can now be put back on your original medication.

My dosage was increased to 40mg of which i took 30mg. Wow! my cholesterol really went down and hdl went up. I started to have significant side effects especially in muscles. I was simply significantly slower at the gym. My heart rate was unresponsive to the effort. I burped constantly and had a night time dry cough. I tossed and turned at night.  I had pains in my hips. I started Coenzyme Q10 200mg that helped alot, but i developed breathing problems. I couldn't sing anymore. I have stopped and wow do i feel better. I'm alive once more.  I sleep now.  My heart rate is responsive to exercise. I'm not so anxious.  30mg of ZOCOR is toxic to me. I still want to take the statin to reduce my ldl; but i have to stop and detoxify my body every so often.

My cholesterol was 190-200 most of my life which is borderline.  However, I suffered a blocked artery, so my cardiologist insisted my cholesterol was too high.  After 3 months of simvastin, my cholesterol is 130.  But, this drug which is beginning to affect my leg muscles.  I feel a constant pulling behind my legs and what feels like poor circulation.  I also take a blood thinner which gives me a new bruise everyday.  I also take metoprolol to help my heart work better, but it has made me gain weight even though I work out daily (1 hour on eliptacle) and diet.  Thanks to this site, I will be stopping the simvastin.  It is not worth what appears to be permanent damage to my muscles.

The last two to three years have been filled with debilitating muscle pain, difficulty walking, driving and sleeping and depression. My Doctors suggested these difficulties were R/T my reaching the age of fifty, that they were a part of aging. It has been almost two months now since I asked my Doc to discontinue Zocor for a trial period. I have noticed that my legs and knees don't hurt like they used to . I am also sleeping better, not waking up with leg pain . I can drive home without having to stop and stretch my legs multiple times between work and home . I won't take Zocor again.

Stopped taking Zocor the 1st of Nov. felt much better, started it again Jan 4th, just to see if it was causing my symptoms.  My cholesteral went back up after stopping the drug.  After this past week, I am back to feeling terrible, body aches, etc. - I believe this drug is poison and I will not take it again. This a.m. I could hardly get out of bed, didn't sleep all night.  I will have to find other ways to lower the cholesteral as I have proven that Zocor is what caused my physical problems!

In March 2010, he increased the dose to 40mg.  In 3 days, I was having severe lower extremity muscle pain and weakness, extreme fatigue and loss of energy. I reported this to my PCP in June and was abruptly taken off of it.  Within 3 days, my symptoms were improving although I continue to have muscle fatigue and some weakness.  I am hoping that my symptoms will subside  completely as I am a professional firefighter with a large urban department and this has severely affected my ability to do my job safely and competently.  My PCP has recommended high-EPA fish oil for my cholesterol and CoQ10 for the muscle pain, and for the most part it is helping.  I will NEVER take another statin drug.

I never had any real side affects, except some fatique and heaviness in legs once in awhile. I had no choice but to try the generic for Zocor and the generic made me very sick.  Terrible stomach pains, to the point that I couldn;t leave the house for 4 days. Tried Crestor and it did a fantastic job of lowering cholesterol (down to 84), but after 5 months on it started experincing horrible pains in legs, hips, ankles, thighs. So much didn't want it to be the Crestor as it was working so well.  Went to Dr. and of course he didn't believe it was the Crestor, so I stopped taking it on my own and within 3 wks. all adverse symptoms had disappeared.  Also tried the Zetia and Vytorin, but they too made me sick within a couple of days.  Zocor is the only cholesterol med that has worked for me without all the terrible side effects and my insurance will no longer pay for it.  I've been on a strict diet for years, but not long after stopping medication my numbers go way back up. That tells me that my situation is mainly hereditary.  Don't know what I will do now.

However, I started developing bruises and found out my platelets had dropped from 325,000 to 75,000.  Statins can cause a rare blood disorder called TTP.  Quit taking Zocor and brusies went away and platelets went back up to 317,000.  I will never use this drug or any statins again.

High Cholesterol	JaneAusten, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	7/30/2010 10:06:15 PM	My husband Doctor had my husband use Crestor, Lipitor and Zocor at one time which only raised his cholesterol, and blood pressure the side affects were a lot of muscle pain, itching and the BIG ONE! Amnesia! I found him wondering outside one night looking for burglars the next day he did not remember a thing. Another night he woke up from a nape and did not know were he was, and i knew it was the pills the Doctor gave him. So i took it a pond myself to take him off the cholesterol pills and put him on a strict diet, and exercise that worked! He lowered his cholesterol and blood pressure but he still is on the blood pressure pills but he has no side affects for that. My advice to anyone suffering from these cholesterol pills watch your diet and please do exercise and your heath will get better.

I have been reading of a possible link between this problem and zocor.Since I have other reasons for the loss of libido(hysterectomy with ovary removal) I didn't think the Zocor could also be contributing until I read it in the paper.

I am terrible at taking medication. I go on it for a week then forget or just hit it a couple days the next week. No matter where I put these silly pills on the night stand, on the counter, in the bathroom, I just can't seem to take them on a regular basis. Too bad there isn't an implant or once a month shot to replace the pills and what may be happening to a liver as they pass through the system. I pretty much have stopped drinking all together, walk my dogs sometimes twice a day 20 minutes each time, mow my own yard, wash the cars and have cut way back on red meats or 4 legged animals. I eat alot of baked or bbq chicken and fish and alot more fruit and veg, cut back on potatoes and dairy but I still have a 260 cholesterol! oh well, its been fun being here and we all have to go sometime.

Then I started experiencing sever muscle and joint pain in my lower legs, ankles and knees. The doctor switched me to Zocor and I had the same problem. I went off the drug for 3 weeks to determine if the pain was caused from the drug. In a matter of 2 weeks the pain subsided. The doctor now has me taking 5mg 3 times a week, but the pain remains. I am thinking of searching for an alternative method, as some of the postings written concerned me with people having continued pain and problems even after discontinuing the drug.

High Cholesterol	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	25-34	5/16/2010 2:13:53 PM	After having tried Crestor and Lipitor, both of which made me sick within days, my statin obsessed doctor decided I needed to try yet another one, followed with a threat of a heart attack before I'm 40.  Now, I agreed because my dad had tired several statins which made him ill, but eventually found one which worked for him.  Well, at first I thought  Zocar was working.  In three weeks my cholesterol dropped about 50 points, although this was not enough for my doctor who wanted me to go from 20mg to 80mg.  I basically told him no way.  Not long after I started having pain in my abdomen, back, and sides.  I went to my GP, I see a specialist for the cholesterol,  and he sent me to have a CT scan to look for cancer.  It showed nothing out of the ordinary, along with tests for kidney disease and colon cancer.  I kept asking him, and the doctor who prescribed the Zocar, if it could be the cause, but both dismised the possibility and told me I needed to take more or die of a heart attack.  I have finally decided to stop taking it, regardless of who much they complain.  So far, nothing has changed, but Im hoping the problems will eventually improve because I can barely function due to the pain.

High Cholesterol	Linn  RN	1	1	1			5/9/2010 12:16:11 AM	There are several non-RX options for cholesterol issues. Suggest checking complementary medicine sites or working with a Naturopathic doctor or Master Herbalist (your MD won't like it because he doesn't understand it). I like the the Life Extension Foundation site for research &amp; info on health issues.  www.lef.org Please report these side effects to FDA MedWatch www.accessdata.fda.gov. This is not a consumer friendly site but it how the FDA  tracks adverse effects of medications.

I am going to get a blood test soon and seeing my doctor. I have stopped this medication.

I was placed on 20mg of Zocor fall of 2005. Cholesterol went from a persistent 300 to an amazing 150 within 3 months--and has stayed there for 4 years with no fatigue, body aches or digestive issues whatsoever. As an added bonus, Sams Club sells a 90 day supply for an amazing $12.00. However, I do believe a personal side effect is itchy scalp. Given what I have read from others here, I have to say my experence is very positive.

I quit taking it 3 weeks ago and I'm still in a lot of pain.  Going to doctor to see if the side effects can be reversed somehow.  Do not take more then 40 mg. of zocor a day, this is when the side effects started after the dosage was raised.

Cholesteral numbers are much better but not quite normal.  Have lost weight gradually but need help with getting rid of belly fat.  Have suffered from fatigue and get less exercise because of muscle pain Have been complaining about leg pain since taking medication.  Am told that I need to exercise as tendons too tight.  When I am also given antibiotics, have severe pain in muscles all over body and cannot rest.  I finally read on internet about Zocor side effects of cramps and fatigue.  Have stopped this medication.  It's only been 2 days without the medication and cramping is improving.  I believe I will be able to get better exercise without this medication.

Treatment to Prevent a Heart Attack	Young Heart Attack Patient, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	25-34	2/17/2010 3:37:29 PM	Had a heart attack at age 34, but otherwise am extrordinarly healthy. Cholesterol levels were not abnormally high to begin with, just my luck in having a blood clot in a main atery. I took Simvastatin for 8 months after the attack with just minor sore muscle discomfort, but then started to have constant muscle aches and pains in the chest. The drug did lower my cholesterol over the time I was taking it. I stopped taking the drug, and after about two months, the pain stopped. Began taking again to confirm whether the drug was to blame, and chest aches began again within two weeks. I've stopped taking again, and the pain went away. I haven't given up on statin drugs yet, and I am switching over to another type, but I think I can live without Simvastatin.

One evening I could not raise my left foot up-no muscle control-could not roll my foot when walking-foot slapped the ground. Stopped Zocor immediately and after about 30dys was back to normal-was not permanent.  Dr sent me for some tests and found nothing to cause this problem except Zocor as the culprit. It may be good for some but not me.  I had no other muscle problems except the left foot and that was in 2006.

High Cholesterol	Stevefar, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	65-74	2/4/2010 2:12:00 PM	I always had acceptable cholesterol in the  160/170 range.  Recently it increased to 212. Since both my brothers have high cholesterol the doctor prescribed 10 mg of simvastatin. I took for 3 weeks with no side effects.  But at that time I became so sore and weak that I could not even roll over in bed.  My legs were all but paralyzed.  My wife called 911 and rushed me to the hospital where I was diagnosed with rhabdomyoloysis.  I spent 2 days in the hospital with the only treatment being a constant saline drip.  THIS DRUG IS DANGEROUS FOR SOME PEOPLE.  I am now using non-drug treatments: strict diet, oatmeal, flax seed, CoQ10 and niacin.  I am determined to lower my cholesterol without using any prescription drugs.

I may have permanent muscle damage. Don't take this medicine!

I started taking this medication in November and ceased taking it roughly a week and half ago. I have had too many side effects with regards to this medication. Dizziness, headaches,muscle aches, pins &amp; needles,abdominal pain, nausea, increased anxiety, darker urine then normal....I could go on. I am a little miffed my MD chose the medication route first instead of a 3-6 month diet regimen. Looking into natural remedies such as Red Yeast Rice but it also includes a statin so don't know how I'll fair. My MD finally got a hold of me yesterday,need to go Monday for blood testing for liver function....JOY! :)
High Cholesterol	Rabb, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	1/5/2010 3:11:54 PM	Reduced Total from 275 to 210 in two months. My HDL to LDL ratio was very good to start with and the simvastatin slightly improved the ratio so at 210 I am good with high HDL and LDL below 100, particularly with low risk factors. Triglycerides were not a problem initially but were halved in the two months. I have had no side affects of any kind that I can tell. Just pop a pill once a day. Liver function test each of first two months was normal/no change so no effect there so far.

Total choletesterol dropped over 100 points, but HDL dropped, too.  Always felt like I had the flu, so I quit taking it.  Current cholesterol ratio is almost the same as when I was taking the med.

I didn't know it was related to the Zocor, so I stopped eating everything known to cause gas - but it persisted.  I stopped taking the zocor, and within days my stomach cramps and gas problems abated.Now I can drink milk, eat wheat - no gas! This med sure is effective in lowering  cholesterol levels, though ------------
A Type of Inherited High Blood Cholesterol Disorder	irishmedic716, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	2	Male	25-34	1/2/2010 9:30:38 AM	So I was put on this medication back in November, stopped taking almost immediately after less then a month of use.First, my MD didn't follow the rule of thumb and do a 3-6 month diet regimen initially which did irritate me. Secondly she told me to take Fish Oil after 1 test and then only a week later put me on Zocor with out allowing the Fish Oil to have time to work in my system. Oh and she never did tell me my exact score even though I asked multiple times. Since stopping the medication I have increased  tension styled headaches (which I never experienced before), dizziness and increased anxiety. I don't know if these are related to my exsisting anxiety/stress but I have never been one to have good reactions to medications (case in point Accutane &amp; Retin-A). Also I do not take medications for any anxiety/stress issues. I work in the medical field as a Paramedic so I am not one for being medicated @ all. The only medications I take are OTC, (1) daily vitamin, 1000mg Fish Oil 3 times daily, and Ginko 2 times daily, and occassionally Tylenol/ASA. Also have just recently began working out again and watching all my oral intake now.Calling the MD Monday to see just what to do. Felt better before ever being put on this medication.

I took generic Zocor for 2 months and did everything I could to improve my cholesterol numbers.  I ran or walked 2 miles nearly every day and walked up stairs when I could have taken an elevator.  I ate more fruit and vegetables in 2 months than I would normally eat in a whole year and ate absolutely no junk foods and very little alcohol or red meat. I lost 20 lbs and  I didn't experience any side effects except for one thing that I can't fully blame on the Zocor...YET.  I get gout periodically and one month after starting the Zocor my gout flared up.  It will normally go away in a few days with help from some prednisone, but this time it kept hurting for over a month. I took indocine, prednisone, vicodin, tylenol 3, aleve and ibuprofen to stop the pain and keep me on my feet and working. I finally hobbled into my doctors office for the 2 month blood work follow-up and was very satisfied with the numbers. Everything came back to target range but I stopped taking the zocor after two months because I think it may have caused my gout to flare up worse than ever before. I have found some other websites that mention a connection between gout and statin drugs, just not this one. My doctor thinks I have arthritis and not gout and referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, but I haven't seen him yet because I still think it's gout.  My pain is subsiding, although I am still taking a lot of pain medication.  I just wonder if anyone else has had this problem which may or may not be the Zocor. I am still trying to figure that one out. I rely on these reviews a lot for everything like cars, electronics and medications and encourage everyone to give their opinions and experiences.

I stopped taking this medication after almost continuous headaches. After getting a good night's sleep (no, no alcohol before bedtime) I woke up with one of the worst headaches I'd ever had. In addition, I had been feeling like the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz for about a month! Stopped taking it. UGH!

Next came horrific stomach and digestive issues which I suppose would help me drop some weight since I'm afraid to eat almost anything at this point.  Some muscles cramping beginning in week 2.  Called my Dr this morning to see if I'm taking too much or maybe just the wrong drug...haven't even gotten a call back.I'm trying to make at least 30 days on this but I'm not sure I can and still make it to work too.

I changed my drastically for 90 days prior to being put on it. Oatmeal (plain with nothing in it for breakfast and lunch and sometimes for dinner), salads for dinner sometimes when oatmeal got old. Both my good and bad cholesterol went up, diet did not work. Was on the medicine 30 days, the results were amazing dropped my score from a 327 to 182.I am now having muscle pains in both arms and lower back pain. The pharmacists informed friday that I need to contact my doctor, that this may be a result from the meds.I am pleased with the results, but am now concerned about the side effects.

Watching my diet is a major key and exercise will also help.

I would much rather let nature take its course than spend the rest of my life in pain.  I am sure that if I continue to take this drug that I will end up in a nursing home a lot sooner than without it.  Maybe that is the whole scheme in the medical profession these days.
High Cholesterol	megan-lee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	11/16/2009 2:18:06 PM	I have only been on this med for a little more than 2 weeks, but after reading these reviews I wonder if I am doing the right thing by staying on it.  My levels are not that high, and could probably be corrected by diet and exercise.  Gaining weight is not an option for me, since I have been trying to keep it down.  Pain is not an option either--who wants to be in pain all the time!  Next time I see my Dr. we are going to discuss these issues all of you have brought up.  I did know before taking this drug that these side affects could be possible. I am some-what surprised that most of you did not read up on it before starting and are not pro-active in your own health by making sure your Dr. knew that your pain and weight gain showed up after starting the medication.  I am going to try to do better and would suggest that all of you do the same.  Good Luck to you all.
Increased Triglycerides and Cholesterol	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	45-54	11/16/2009 9:48:50 AM	Using zocor for 90-days. Ldl increased 15 points, hdl increased 5 points, triglycerides decreased 200 points. But I told them why triglycerides were so high to start with and doctor discounted my input. Muscle aches in the back of both legs get so bad I have to discontinue taking this drug. And since this is the only drug I take, I am no longer taking it. Changing today to pravachol to see if it works with less side effects.

The side effects make me feel aweful every single day. I have such head pressure, blurred vision, burning in the stomach/chest area. Have seen every doctor known to man kind. Been tested for Lupos, Lymes, even had MRI of Brain. Everything fine. I decided to stop taking Zocor to see if I would feel better and I did. Energy back, hands/feet stop aching,etc. After 2 weeks of feeling well, thought I would test the drug again to see if it was Zocor, so I took it again and the 2nd day all the side effects that went away came back! Very curious as to why all the Doctors that I saw did not think of it. Matter of fact, they thought otherwise !! We have to listen to our bodies and do our own research, not always going w/ others &quot;opinions&quot; One drug may work for some and not for ohers!
High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	4	3	1	Female	55-64	10/27/2009 10:34:59 AM	I was at my wit's end trying to figure out why I feel like 80 instead of 60. My hips, back, knees, shoulders, feet....everything hurts! I usually can't sleep solidly for more than an hour or two, then I am tossing and turning trying to find a postition in which I am not in pain. My one knee is so bad that I'm starting to have trouble walking. I was beginning to think that I had something like reumatoid arthritis, but now I'm pretty sure that taking Simvistatin is the cause. My symptoms greatly increased recently and I just realized that increase coincided with an increase in my medication (my doc doubled the dose I was taking). I am going to begin an aggressive weight loss program and get myself off these meds. I am 62 and if I continue with this medication, I probably won't be able to walk before long. I'm so happy I discovered this site. I hope it's not too late to reverse the effects.

Had minor heart attack 9-11 this year.  Prescribed drug; discharged from Hospital--took drug 5 days...woke up HARDLY ABLE TO WALK.  Every movement painful, kidneys, back, hips--AND I AM IN EXCELLENT SHAPE--I WAS DOING PILATES IN MY HOSPITAL BED....Called Doctor on-call.  He told me half dosage; (ha ha).  Also told me this is a CHEAP GENERIC statin...that's why they prescribe it --'cause it's CHEAP.  More expensive ones (supposedly) don't have side effects.  Conclusion--the pain from taking this drug was almost equal to the heart attack; seriously threatening my quality of life.  I'm off it for two days...pain SLOWLY diminishing...DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG--DEMAND SOMETHING BETTER WITH NO PAINFUL SIDE-EFFECTS!

High Cholesterol	pennywinkle, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	9/17/2009 7:16:35 PM	My doctor started me on zocor a few months ago. She started me on 20 mg. My cholsterol is still high so she just raised my dose to 40mg a few days ago. Ive had high cholestrol fo quite a while. I started on lovastatin (didnt work) then tried pravastatin (had a allergic reaction). Its too soon to say how well the zocor will work for me. I have had a lot of fatigue and sorness but I have other health issues so I dont know what the cause is. I will give it time and the benefit of the doubt. sometimes it takes some time to get past the side effects.

My cholesterol has been lowered to 149 from 239 total. I have been told that the COQ-10 helps so you will not end up with joint or muscle problems. It has worked out so far. I will probably add fish oil allso.
High Cholesterol	Barbara, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	2	Female	45-54	9/14/2009 3:49:02 PM	Have been taking Zocor for a little over 3 weeks now.  Forearms, biceps, shoulders and back of neck are getting very uncomfortable - to the point of being painful to the touch.  No weakness in these muscles yet though.  Most people are reporting being very tired on Zocor but I am the opposite - basically feel like I have more energy.  Has not affected my sleep yet either.  However, I am getting concerned about the muscle pain.  I have called my doctor to see if he wants me to continue a little while longer or not.  But, if symptoms get worse - I will get off the drug myself.

Last week I noticed my legs ached. My joints were throbbing so bad. I could barely move. I stopped taking the drug three days ago.. I still feel lousy, but it takes awhile for it to get out of your system. I called and talked to my dr's nurse. She said Zocor was the drug that causes leg/joint pain more than any other.  My dr wants me off the drug for 30 days and then on 20 mg after that. I don't know if I want to go there anymore. This feeling of being sick from something that is suppose to be helping just doesn't make sense to me. There has to be something else out there. I do not like the side effects at all.

High Cholesterol	woffordfan, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	9/4/2009 8:34:05 PM	Started on Zocor generic-Simvastatin-two months ago. My Colesterol came down within a month. Just last week, I started having pains in my legs-from top to bottom in my groin to my ankles. Like others who have posted, I feel like a 90 year old. I can hardly walk. Looking back I haven't been able to get a full nights sleep either. When I went to my Dr. yesterday about my not sleeping, I mentioned my leg pain. He said it very well could be a side effect of the drug--so he told me about a new vitamin that certain enzymes in it, that will help alleviate the pain--due to &quot;deposits&quot; in my joints! Also said the drug manufacturers of these statin drugs, were going to add these enzymes to the drugs soon because of the painful side effects.  I'll be a cold day in hell before a take another pill for the side effects of another drug.  I did not take Simvastatin this morning and I already feel better. I will stick to oatmeal in the morning with blueberries and walnuts and watch my diet and exercise before I take another cholesterol drug. Maybe this drug is OK for others, but not for me.

It reduced me from a VERY strong vibrant person to a skeleton barely able to walk in only 8 weeks. Should be de-authorized by the FDA, in my opinion. The package says 2% of patiens have this problem. Male bovine feces. It's much higher than that. I am an ex-Zocor user, and lawsuit plaintiff as of today!

When I stopped taking Zocor, the symptoms from having high B6 went away.  My doctor does not believe there is a connection between taking Zocor and my high B6 levels.  I had to start taking Zocor again because of VERY high cholesterol levels.  The symptoms came back (tingling and prickling on body, arms and legs; sores in my mouth; not sleeping well, breathlessness).  Has anyone else experienced these symptoms?

I stopped taking the drug and after a week the above symptoms started to back off somewhat. I called my doctor and hoping to hear that the symptoms will totally disappear soon.

Within a few weeks experienced pain, weekness in arms and hands. Dr. advised drug would not affect small muscles, only large ones (?) Didn't make sense so stopped drug.  When my father was 80, they discovered that he had over 400 cholestrol count, so Doctors do not know all they SHOULD know about how cholestrol works. After 10 years of stopping Zocor, still suffer from muscle cramps, weakness, sleeplessness, dark urine if I exercise.  The medical community needs to realize how dangerous this drug is.  They also need to find a cure for the disease they caused by prescribing this drug.

High Cholesterol	smh765, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	5/28/2009 11:54:31 AM	I had a stroke 5/10/09 and they put me on zocor (&amp; plavix) in hospital to bring my LDL's down. It's now 5/28/09 and 2 days ago i broke out in a HORRIBLE rash/hives all over my torso. It has moved to the back of my skull and feels tight and swollen, like i'm holding water there. Dr told me to stop taking for now to be sure it's the zocor doing this, not the plavix. They want you to lose weight to help in lowering the cholesterol, but sounds like MOST people cant hardly move in order to exercise to do that! Hope it's the zocor that caused this, i don't need add'l problems with joints/hips/legs/knees right now. Funny thing is, eating oatmeal daily was working because between 2/09 and my admittance into hospital, my numbers came down. I'm ticked as well because i had come into a routine of exercising more often to lose the weight and lower my numbers.

The effects were just like having APS.

I had immediate relief within two days.  Now I am wondering how long it will take to be able walk, swim and exercise without muscle pain. My cholesterol numbers are not too far from acceptable, and my diet is good. What else can I do?

The reason for the switch was cost.I stared taking 20mg of simvastatin in December. After about a month on this drug I developed Raynauds syndrome in my hands.This after sitting with out gloves in my deer stand for a week.My hands turned dead white in 45 degree weather. The next symptom was leg and muscle pain. I ignored this for a while because it seemed to subsided after my work outs. I am 77 years old and work out six days a week on the treadmill and weight lifting. The leg pain progressed to my hips and shoulders to the point where I could not reach for things on a high shelf of even tie my own shoes. I reviewed what was different in my life in the last 3 months and the Zorcor was the only new thing that was different. I stopped taking this med and felt better 48 hours later as the symptoms subsided a bit. I am now off for about 8o hours and getting stronger. I will not resume taking this drug.

It was quite effective to lower my cholesterol level from 230 to 150 in about 3 months period. However, recently, I noticed it was unsuccessful in making the second pregnancy with my girlfriend. Then I began to look into the side-efect of Zocor in full details. I found the adverse effect of infertility, and even testes necrosis in animals trials. That explained why we were unsuccessful in making babies for the the past six months. I also noticed the pain, and weakness in walking up steps on my left leg, even just a flight of stairs to my bedroom. Another concern was hair loss has been increasing. I would also say I felt tiredness, and reduction in sleep too. I have stopped the use of Zocor for 10 days , and yeterday I could walk upstair for 200 steps without any pain or weakness in both legs. I have read over 50 comments mentioned here, and I just hope to post this to let other people know about it.I am thinking to ask my doctor to do tests to check my health, as some people mentioned here the side-effects might even be irreversible. That was quite scary.     Please be careful in watching for the side-effects. If you want to have babies, be sure to check this out too! I think the manufacturer should advise the patients about the possible problems of &quot; infertility&quot;. I have also filed a report to FDA too.

After taking it for the above time period, I began to have VERY dry, flaky skin. Then, my hair started coming out at 4-5 times the normal 100 strands per day. I lost 25-35% of my hair over a 4 month period. It took a while to track down which medication caused these side effects, but on the list that came with the meds there they were at #5 and #6 of the side effects. I've been off Zocor for 4-5 months now. My hair loss has slowed, some in growing back in and my face is a lot less dry and flaky. No muscle aches or pains that I can pin-point to Zocor, but since I have Fibromyalgia, it is difficult to tell.
Increased Triglycerides and Cholesterol	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/23/2009 1:01:49 AM	I am currently taking zocor 10mg and it has greatly reduced my LDL and trigycerides. However, I originally was taking zocor 20mg and it made me feel like I was 90 years old. Initially, my doctor did not think 10mg was strong enough but it was my only option because 20mg made me feel terrible.Bottom line, for you folks experiencing muscle pain, etc. try a lowered dose because will probably still be effective. At least it was for me. If the lowered dose still results in pain then stop taking it and find an alternative.Supplement it with omega 3 fatty acide pills such as fish oil and flawseed.

I am moving like an ancient person. I have been on it for several months so I do not know if it is helping my cholesterol but I can not spend the rest of my life feeling this way. And it is getting worse. Whenever I stand I have to pause for a moment to get going. I feel like the scarecrow in the  Wizard of Oz. This is horrible. I am going to work harder to lose more weight and eat better. I am only 54 years old and this medication is really really hurting me. I am going to take a break and see what happens with my muscle aches.I even get shooting pains when I am driving. I do work out and in the garden but this is really bad. So I do get stiff and sore. But this is horrible.

I started on this drug for high cholesterol, and after 2 weeks was sitting in a meeting when I had to urinate so bad, I had to leave the meeting during an important discussion.  2 minutes later, the same urgent feeling.  The next day, excrucuiting pain in the area below the navel.  I went to the doctor, put me on kidney meds.  Nothing happened.  Went to the gyno, no problems there.  I am talking pain like knives in the abs.  I was miserable and went again to the doc who put me on codiene for the pain.  I was going to schedule an MRI when I finally went to a gastro guy who surveyed my meds and said:  &quot;Get offf the Zocor.  It is eating you alive&quot;.  I went off the Zocor and within 2 days the pain started to subside.  2 more days and there were occasional deep twinges.  One week and I was normal again.  Do what my genius gastro guy said if you are experiencing super, deep, mind-blinding intestional pain.  Get off the Zocor.  I now list it as a med I am allergic to!
High Cholesterol	GeeGee, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	65-74	3/9/2009 10:06:27 PM	After taking Zocor for approx. 2 years I started to develope symptoms of muscle cramps and excruciating pain in my shoulders and upper back, to the point that I couldn't even lift my arms. Most mornings I could hardly get out of the bed. My arms and shoulders felt like they weighed a ton.   I have seen several Doctors, that seem to just blow me off. I wonder why the doctors will not believe their patients.The very first doctor at the emergency room advised me to stop taking the Zocor, that was about 5 months ago.  I am still suffering with excrutiating pains in my upper shoulders and arms. I have recently started to have pains in my thighs and pelvic, and hip bones. I have asked my current doctor to run test to see if the medicine has caused any damages to my liver, and she says that all of my tests have come back negative. I have even asked to be tested for lupus, I have not heard from the doctor as of yet.I am normally very active 65 year old female, bowling, walking for miles at a time, exercising 3 to 3 times a week.. After not having the zocor in my system for more 5 months now, one would think that the affects would have worn off by now. My muscles in my arms and upper shoulders are completely gone and I have no strenghth to lift my arms.  Is there a doctor out there that can do something to help reverse the effects that this medicine is having on people.  I am diabetic, but my diabetes is under control.I am now taking coQ10 to help regain some of my muscles back. If anyone knows of any other remedy please post it.    I have been looking online for the last couple of months for some one to help get me back on the road to good health to no avail.These Statin Drugs should be taken off the market I believe they do more harm than good. The pharmaceutical Companies only care about the dollar, not our health.If you are just starting to take this med. please stop now.!!! The long term affect might be devastating

I am not a lazy person and I am 65 yrs old but this fatique and feeling cold has just come on me since I have been on this medication.

High Cholesterol	Mrs K, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/8/2009 6:44:26 PM	Against my better judgement, I filled the prescription for zocor, at my new doctor's insistance (zocor 40mg).  This was the third doctor who insisted that I go on zocor or risk heart attack (total cholesterol=250).  After less than one month, I experienced the following symptoms:*Dehydration:  Eyes, nose, mouth dry, dark yellow urine, headache, constipation*Muscles: Tingling in left upper arm; pain across shoulders &amp; up the neck; pain &amp; cramping in right calf first &amp; later left calf (after 15 days on zocor, no longer able to do &quot;mile-a-day&quot; walk - too painful); chest pain @ night (left side); Heart muscle &quot;cramped up&quot; like someone was squeezing the heart real hard &amp; then letting go; *Sleeplessness - worried that I would die in my sleep (worried about the chest pain)Before one month was up I quit the zocor.  I noticed relief from many of the symptoms very soon after quitting the zocor (within 2 days).  It has been about two weeks &amp; I am now back to my &quot;mile-a-day&quot; walk again.  I still have the chest pain at night, which worries me.  I did not have this before I started on zocor.  Prior to going on zocor, I had tried red yeast rice capsules, but my doctor told me that the FDA made manufacturers remove the active ingredient that helps with lowering cholesterol, so red yeast rice is no longer effective for high cholesterol.  I am now trying plant sterol tablets to see if they help (two 900mg tablets - 2 times a day).I wish I had never taken zocor.  I hope the FDA takes this medication off the market.  I also hope I will not suffer any long-term ill effects from having taken zocor.

High Cholesterol	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	25-34	2/3/2009 3:08:56 PM	I have been on generic Zocor for 5 days and I already have the muscular pain and headache... not sure if there is anything else out there for cholesterol that does not have these side effects.  My father-in-law takes Lipitor, and he says that medication has similar side effects (and more $$$).
High Cholesterol	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more	2	5	1	Male	55-64	1/31/2009 1:30:37 PM	My father had high cholesterol.  His doctor prescribed Zocor after Lipitor didn't work for him, and he was on it for several years.  His cholesterol went down to normal but despite taking his medication as prescribed, being very active and watching what he ate, he died 4 years ago of a blocked coronary artery anyway.  I am not a doctor myself, but I do not like this medication as it didn't seem to do what I thought it was supposed to.

My body did hurt for the first week or so of taking the drug but I have not noticed it at all since (I have been on it for ~6 months now).  Great drug for me and hopefully my Cholesterol is down even lower next time I get labs done.

It lowered my cholesterolfrom 240 to 170 without any apparant side effects. Then, I gradually started to have more severe intestinal pain, constipation and fluctuating cramping which doubled me over. These symptoms started quickly and progressed from perodic to chronic. I stopped taking zocor for a few days and the symptoms began to subside. I started taking it again and within a week, the symptoms returned. I repeated this sequence with the same result. I switched to Lipitor . The same symptoms appeared within 6 months. I've switched to pravachol for the last month with no adverse symptoms--so far.

Accidentally ran out of the Lipitor Rx and didn't take for 1 month, pain in back and hips started going away - thought it was just a coincidence. Re-filled Rx and within a couple of weeks pain in back and hips came back. Stopped taking it immediately and guess what - pain went away and started feeling great - not a coincidence this time. Asked Dr. to put me on something else becasue of the symptoms experienced so have been on Zocor 40mg. for approx 2 months. Started noticing back pain and hip joint pain again after about 6 weeks of use. Was hopeful Zocor would work for me without the Lipitor-noted side effects but it's not. It is effective at lowering choletsrol but there has to be a better way than to live in pain popping aspirin or other OTC pain meds. for a med you are already taking. Don't know where to go next except to stop eating!

I hurt so bad, I spent all day laying on a heating pad trying to relieve the muscle &amp; joint pain to no avail.  This went on for years, until I took matters into my own hands.  Looked up the side effects, and discontinued the drug on the basis of a little mention of joint and muscle pain. In about three months I felt better.  But I have never been the same.  There was muscle damage.  Thanks a lot!

I have read all of your reviews and I am very very angry that this medication is approved by the FDA! I have only taken this for 8 weeks and I feel like I'm 100 years old. I've gained 20 lbs. My back, legs and arms ache. I am absolutely exhaused every single day yet I have difficulty sleeping at night. I've told my dr. about these symptoms but he didn't believe it was from this drug. HE IS DEAD WRONG! I can't wait until I talk with him. Boy, am I going to let him have it. I hope I didn't do any permanent damage to my body. I am outraged! For the people who use this medication and it's working for them, I wish you luck. As for myself, I'm going with natural herbs and will manage my diet more efficiently.

I also gained close to 20 lbs and couldn't figure out why. This medication is new to me so I can only assume this is the reason. And after reading some of your comments, I've made up my mind to take myself off of this medication. My doctor keeps saying my weight gain isn't caused by Zocor. I beg to differ.

I have had good results bringing my overall Cholesterol from 250 to 170 in a couple of months.  I have experienced minimal muscle soreness, which I think is a result of keeping myself hydrated and maintaining some excercise.  The only side affect I have had is frequent urination in the night.  I do have some concern about the long term affects on the liver.  
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	65-74	12/10/2008 12:24:37 AM	First 2 years no side effects except sleep interruptions and some depression. Then suddenly legs so heavy could barely walk, eyes effected. ER twice and Dr. &amp; neurologist involved. No conclusions. Still on Zocor. (Am a &quot;controlled&quot; Type II diabetic with neuropathy, and normally controlled high BP.) After some months, symptoms Subsided for some unknown reason. About a year later collapsed with weak legs and severe gastic symptoms. Help needed to walk(wheel chair &amp; walker) and drive for some months. Neurologist and internist stumped after many, many tests. Lots of blood work, all normal. Also experienced on-going high heat sensations in feet, thighs, back and face. Back and legs often in severe pain. Felt like head was imploding, dizzy, BP spiked for 3 months, eyes fuzzy and constant head fog. Dr. took me off gen. Zocor, and 3-4 months later debilitating side effects lifted almost completely. MOved to new city, &amp; 4 months later, new Dr. put me back on Zocor, and after 2 months, all symptoms are back full blast, except can still walk around house and short distances.  Am hopeful I can recover again, and this isn't permanent this time. Very depressed, and sorry to have gone back to Zocor. Have been off Zocor this time for 3 weeks, but no improvement yet. So many doctors had been involved over these short few years, thought someone would find answer. Now, believe Zocor is responsible, and reading other's experiences even further confirms for me. Has anyone had the &quot;head imploding&quot; sensation as side effect? Wish I'd stopped this med. several years ago after initial severe symptoms. Please watch for changes, even if they don't hit immediately, or even during first year or so. Can change  one's life quickly.

Only thing I can say is that after 3 days, I have had chest pain / pressure, tiredness, lethargy and just felt off. I'm in good shape at 42 and just spent 3 hours and an ER making sure I wasn't having a mild heart attack. Thankfully, I was not. But i'm done with this before I've even started. I'd rather have high cholestrol!!
High Cholesterol	terri, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	12/1/2008 10:47:28 AM	I am 53 years old. I discovered my cholesterol was high at a routine physical. I have taken Zocor for about 6 months. 3 weeks ago I started have burning in my right foot which then went into my leg and now is in both feet and legs and to my knees. I was in the emergancy room twice and also to an orthopedic MD. I gave each doctor a full list of the meds I am on. No one said anything about the possible relationship of peripherial neuropathy due to zocor. I starte researching statins on line and was shocked to see the side effects of which neuropathy was one. I was put on Neurotin for the pain. I am scheduled for an EMG this week. I stopped the Zocor on my own a week ago and think the neuropathy is improving.

Chest pain, aching in arms, jaws &amp; back, shortness of breath &amp; extreme fatigue. Went to ER with heart attack symptoms. Severe aching in joints with flu like symptoms.  Symptoms of Periperal Neuropathy when I went to ER but didn't know what it was.  Has since been confirmed by a Neurologist. Periperal Neuropathy cannot be cured so now I just have to live with the pain &amp; limitations it places on me.  If you take this drug, listen to your body &amp; with the first symptoms of side effects, run, don't walk away from it.  This is some bad stuff. By the way, I only took 20 mg once a day for 6 weeks.  It took over 3 months to overcome the fatigue and some of the aching.

With vytorin my total cholesterol was 135 and  6 months later after taking zocor 20 mg the total was 219.  He has now doubled the dosage to 40 mg per day.

I was at one time on 2 drugs plus super highly refined Fish Oils and did that for 9 months, guess what? nothing! Crestor and Lipitor don't even scratch the surface. By the way, I am a Vegetarian on a low Sodium diet. I and the doctor still in search of the Magic Pill. Crestor did drop me fast, down to 215 and tri down to 855 but the cramps near the Heart were hell! The cramping in all of the muscles from legs to the chest were terrible! when I complained, I found out I took it a bit too long, almost cost me my life. So, if there is a Magic Pill out there that will bring me down from my 500 C and 3000 tri, I'd like to find it.Now the plan is Zocor and Tricor together Max dose! I haven't tried Pravacol yet.

The drug isn't worth it to me.  My HDL was over 90, even though my cholesterol was 300.  I have brought it down by walking and diet before.  I would rather walk 15 miles a day than feel like I feel now.  I'm stopping it tonight.

I have chronic lower back pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, constipation and I am also having trouble sleeping. I did not have these before taking this medicine. I have asked my Dr. about this and he seems to think that my problem is stress related. My stress level has not changed in the last 2 months. I was taking a Lopid 2x's a day that worked fine but the Dr suggested trying this 1x a day. I am seeing him next week and taking myself off of the Zocor to see if symptoms improve.

LDL went from 129 to 65. HDL from 95 to 104. No pain or side effects have been felt. I do work out at the gym with weights and treadmill 4 to 5 times a week and have for many years and have not felt any weakness or any decrease in the weights I use. Triglycerides at 32. I've read a lot of negative feedback here but so far I don't have any problems with the medication. But good luck to us all anyway.
Treatment to Prevent a Heart Attack	Paula857, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	3	3	Female	45-54	8/26/2008 8:07:49 AM	I recently started zocor after lipitor gave too many bad side effects.  The side effects returned, but not as many or severe.  I noticed slight swelling in hands &amp; feet and fatigue. Since Im on my feet at work, I could not deal with that, so I started taking one every other day (I'm on 40mg) and it seems to be more tolerable. I will discuss with my Doctor and see if this is an appropriate course of therapy.  I have heart disease in family history and suffered a heart attack end of June 2008.

Red rash on breast with joint pain in legs, hip and arm. Very tired and was to the point I could hardly step up to get in the pickup truck.  Decided to quit the drug on my own and WOW, Rash disappeared and my energy level is back.  Will let Doctor know, but not sure any Statins are for me.

I am very tired all the time.   At night, I have noticed that I move my legs more than normal before falling to sleep.  I also have been experiencing being sleepy and tired all the time.   I'm not sure if it is the drug of something else.  I've read several commments regarding the tiredness and leg problems so I'm going to call my Dr. and discuss it.  No other side affects noticed at this time.

After numerous tests my vascular surgeon found that the plaque in my aorta had flaked off, causing the emboli. Inow take Zocor 40 mg. daily and have had some nighttime periperal neuropathy but compared with the scare of the emboli, it's nothing. My LDL has decreased from 133 to 70, and my cholesterol went from 208 to 147. So I'd say that I'm lucky to have this drug, and hopefully live a long, healthy life!
High Cholesterol	Betty, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	6/15/2008 1:08:59 PM	One year ago I took this drug for five weeks, during which time had I noticed odd symptoms and increasing back ache which then progressed to leg pain and neck pain. Doc said to stay with it.  I stopped taking the med when I was floored by &quot;Flu like symptoms&quot; and with what I though was severe constipation. Over the year I've had severe attacks of pain including being hospitalized for &quot;something&quot; in my bowel.  Today,one year later I'm two weeks into recovering from a Laproscopic proceedure which removed my Sigmoid Colon. Doc says he'd never seen anyhting like it, it was twisted, hard and had attached it'self to other organs and ready to abcess. I blame this medication, more research needs to be done

I found it difficult to maintain my walking schedule or do any of the chores around the house.  I had blurred vision for about 2 months.  I think it has cleared up, or I've become used to it.  I won't know until I've had my eyes checked.  Some other systems include sleeplessness, nausea and dizziness.

Side effects too much to continue taking drug.

Recently, extreme fatigue developed.  I could sleep all the time and not feel rested. My legs ache mostly at night and are weaker than in the past. I take pain medications almost every day for the leg discomfort.  I have also developed dryness in my nose and throat.  The dryness is not relieved by drinking water or using nasal sprays.  I see dryness listed as a side effect, but I have not noticed in anyone eles review.  Additionally, I am developing small bumps on my skin. I believe after reading the previous reviews, that my symptoms are coming from this drug.

After 60 days on simvistatin (generic Zocor), my LDL is 113 and HDL is 50 (total 163).  Triglycerides much lower too.  No side effects other than slight dizziness when standing up (only occasionally and very minor).  I had already been exercising for over 10 years (weights and cardio) so am in very good health otherwise. I've heard that many side effects are increased if you already have other health problems or if you have not been physically active prior to taking it.  In my case, it's been a great help and has been incredibly effective in lowering my cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

Every three months I would have to have lab work performed to see if it interferring with liver functions. Was doing ok but my doctor has increased my doseage. Went back to have blood work done and my cholesterol has risen. I have carefully been watching what I eat...cut out many of my favorite foods. So what the heck is going on. Seems the higher the dosage the higher my cholesterol. And my weight is going up as well. Has any body else had any of these problems?

High Cholesterol	huskerkate, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	55-64	5/12/2008 11:13:41 AM	The medication was effective in lowering my cholesterol.  However, IT WAS MORE EFFECTIVE IN GIVING ME PERMANENT PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY!  It has been a couple of years since I took Zocor for about 3 mo.  I then figured out what was causing the needle/pin/burning in my feet, mostly at night.  I took myself off and saw an immediate decrease.  My dr. did not really believe me, I could tell,  and put me on lipitor.  Almost immediately the above symptoms came screaming back.  I stopped after three days.  I no longer take any statin, but the neuropathy is still there, just less...but enough to ruin most nights sleep.  Sometimes, I just have to get up and walk.  I have tried every neuropathy foot cream, they are not much help.  I could take another prescription: Lyrica and did for a short time.  But, I am frightened of any drug now.  I stopped it for fear of adding to problems.  The only thing that helps much is 600 mg. of alpha lipoic acid.  I am furious that doctors don't know and don't seem to think it matters because all have been sold a bill of goods re: cholesterol.  Is it worth it?  I don't think so.  At 240 reading, who knows?  Maybe that is normal for me.  No heart attack history in my family.  But now, I fear I will never have another decent night's sleep the rest of my life.  I am a 64 year old female with no other significant health issues.

Although it lowered my cholesteral, this pain is not worth it! I am concerned that this drug is causing this issue after reading reviews.  I am taking myself off of it immediately!

After starting Zocor, she has difficulty getting around. She has severe lower back pain and leg and foot cramping that makes driving impossible.  Upon telling her doctor, she was told to keep taking the drug and given anti-imflammatory and muscle relaxers(that make her feel even worse).  What is with doctors not wanting people to go off this drug?  The possibility of irreversible damage scares her and me.  Her doctor did not even do blood tests.  What is incredible, is that she had no problems at all when she was started on this drug and has gone downhill ever since.  I wonder how long it takes for symptoms to go away-if they will.

It did lower my cholesterol but I now have peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage) from it and can't move my left ankle and foot.  It also affected my left arm and caused it to be paralyzed for periods of weeks to months and has affected my hand.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  I now take Omega-3 capsules and flush-free Niacin along with diet changes.

His doctor recently put him on Zocor instead.  This is causing multiple bad side effects.  Two weeks ago he started this med.  Since then, he has become increasingly depressed and tired.  One day he slept 18 hours!  I think the increased depression is not well recorded as a side effect, but it should be!

I stopped taking zocor a few days ago.  I have experience muscle craps in my feet daily and lower back pain.  I also don't sleep well.  Decided to go off the medicine and will call my doctor in the morning.  Nothing is worth the side effects I've had.  Hopefully I didn't do any permanent damage to my body due to this drug!
Primary Prevention of Heart Attack	Heartbroken daughter, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		4/18/2008 3:16:51 PM	I'm writing this for my mom.  She is in the hospital due to the side effects from this drug.  A Kidney specialist has now been called in on the case. She is now being treated for Rhabdomyolysis: A condition in which skeletal muscle cells break down, releasing myoglobin (the oxygen-carrying pigment in muscle) together with enzymes and electrolytes from inside the muscle cells. The risks with rhabdomyolysis include muscle breakdown and kidney failure since myoglobin is toxic to the kidneys. My mother, age 76 went from driving, going to church, going to the mall, going to her grandson's Tennis matches to having be lifted in and out of bed, walk with a walker, severe leg cramps, no mobility hardly at all now.  I went to see her yesterday and she can't hardly feed herself.  It's heartbreaking to see her suffer like this.  I'm sharing this so you will be informed and hopefully not suffer like my mom.

After just 2 weeks (my age 59 female) I felt like I was 100 years old!  My knees were so terrible with pain that I would cry when I tried to walk.  Could hardly get up and down out of a chair.  I could not believe that the medication was doing this to my knees and hips.  I went to the doctor yesterday and he ordered blood work immediately to see if any damage to liver and muscle tissue in just that amount of time.  Have not heard the results yet.  I stopped taking the medication yesterday after seeing the dr. and I am already starting to feel better......

High Cholesterol	Don't remember, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	3/22/2008 11:47:58 AM	I have been on Zocor for 6 wks. and I thought I was losing my mind, I started hurting in my hips and joints so bad I could not hardly stand up, I called my Dr. and she said I probably strained my hip and knees, I went to her and same thing, called 3 times crying with pain and she said go to the emergengy room, actuly I think she was tired of me and just thought I wanted pain pills. She put me on this and I guess didn't know the side effects. I have been on wed md for 4 weeks looking up everything trying and trying to find out what is wrong with me and Last nite I took my pill and thought to myself, let me look up the side effects of this because that is the only thing I had not tried and there was all these comments and I knew thats what it was--she will get a piece of my mind Monday for all the pain and suffering I have been through and thanks to this site I don't think I am dying with some diease. My husband has been on this for 7 yrs and can't hardly walk but he has memory loss after a stroke and heart att. and the Dr.s can't understand why he can't walk--I cannot believe he has hurt this long--6 wks almost killed me but he won't complain about anything so, so he has just hurt and I know thats what is wrong with him now--I am not taking anymore of this drug and I hope I can walk in a little while--I woldn't recommend this drug to anyone--Betty

Went to dr, and we agreed to stay off zocor for 3 months then  re-do blood work. discuss options then. I'm thinking &quot;garlic&quot; or something along those lines.

Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	courtlandpr, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	65-74	2/24/2008 12:43:07 AM	After being on the drug for 2 years my Cholesterol numbers decreased but the side effects became intolerable.  I experienced huge loss of hair, profuse sweating every 1 to 2 hours, extreme muscle aches in hips, knees, and shoulders. also  Insomnia.  I quit taking Zocor and my hair grew back, joint pain lessened, and sweating became negligble.  My doctor prescribed Lipitor but I see that it has the same side effects.  So I am leary about taking it.

High Cholesterol	pegela, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	55-64	2/14/2008 6:29:32 PM	3 months on 20 mg Simvastatin and my LDL went from 171 to 107 but my HDL went down from 72 to 65!  Triglicerides were good before and after.  Side effects are back/chest pain and heartburn which my Dr said was not due to the drug but couldn't find another cause; trouble sleeping, constant colds, flu-like symptoms and/or bronchitis.  Also, I had been losing weight 1-2 lbs per week during the previous 3 months and since starting drug have not lost anything on the same diet, even though I started exercising more.  Will try to get off the drug as it is frustrating to feel under the weather all the time.
High Cholesterol	TonyD, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	55-64	2/8/2008 11:16:02 AM	Male, 62. The drug has done what it is designed to do. However I appear to be having side effects which I did not know were associated with this drug. Poor sleep, aching joints, terrible heart burn which usually occures at bed time.  Blood work normal, including liver function. Will address these issues with my doctor. THANKS WEBMD for the valuable information!
High Cholesterol	patietinneed, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	2/7/2008 10:08:33 AM	I stopped taking Zocor in December, 2006 and my health problems as worsten.  My right leg is so heavy to the point that I need help walking.  I have severe pain in my lower butts constantly.  My urine has stopped to the point I needed a catheter.  Now the side effects from Zocor is muscle weakness.  I took Zocor for 10 years, will Zocor expense out of my blood system?  Is there a doctor can prescribe to me to help get Zocor out of my system, so my muscle can start rebuilding themselves?  I had read all about Zocor and the side effects, but it does not include solution to the side effect of muscle breakdown.

Which is good.  Other LDL and HDL's fell in line as well.  Bust the MAJOR issue as I have read from others, is the pain in my left shoulder.  I can lift it up, but i have pain, now my dr wants to send me for an xray.  I have seen a chiropractor, accupuncture, and other therpy, but it seems that it is the medicine.  I have much less side effects then the others, but this is the only one and it bothers me as I need to lift my 2yr daughter and do stuff around the house.  The meds are good, but I am concerned abouth the side effects.  Overall Sex is good becuase I am on lexapro which almosts acts the same way, for me I am lucky.  
High Cholesterol	corky, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	1/25/2008 8:57:17 AM	Doctors put me on Zocor after a taku-tsubo type heart attack.  I have no build up of plaque in my arteries (proved by a catherization).  Heart attack type is more stress related.  Side effects of Zocor are awful for me.  Tired, aching hip joints, mild depression and unusual focus problems with my eyes.  My eyes don't follow in tandem but just rotate outward if I try to look up.  Very scary.  I started cutting the pills in half and will stop soon.  Cholesterol was 250 but good cholesterol is high.  % ratio not too bad.  Will definitely find a more natural way to lower it.  Don't like the way I feel on this drug.

Although I started having breathing problems (Vocal Cord Dysfunction) I don't know if it is tied to this drug as condition surfaced years after I started with Zocor--I always suspect it. Lowered cholesterol from 225 to 116-139. Tryglycerides under 100 as well.

High Amount of Triglyceride in the Blood	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	1/16/2008 8:03:07 PM	Did blood work on me and was told that my triglycerides are at 3054, not joking and not a typo.  They are very high and just started taking.  I am only 28 and I am 14times more likely to have a heart attack and stroke.  Not to mention being diabetic and already having osteoarthritis in my hip.  Feel like I am 70 in a 28 year old body.  Sure hope this med works to drop my cholesterol.  But, all the reviews about the side effects makes me worry....
High Cholesterol	MaryR, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/16/2008 1:48:18 PM	Zocor, 10mg, lowered my cholesterol from 253 to 160. I do follow a very healthy diet of vegetables, fruit, good fats etc. and my blood work amazes the doctors since I am 67. However, the only test that is borderline is my liver function. I'm told that's not a problem. I personally feel more research needs to be done in this area, relating to this drug and what problems it might present in future health.

Zocorlowered my cholesterol from 206 to 167. TheHDL, LDL, &amp; triglycerides also are givinggood numbers. However, it also virtually stopped me from having erection capabilityfor sex. As a result, I'm stopping the Zocoras I prefer good sex to lower cholesterol,since I wasn't that high before anyway. Hasanyone else had this problem? Seems to becured (erections) since stopping Zocor. Why?

My doctor claimed he had never heard of this which scared me because every PDR and the pharmacys' info said it was possible.  &quot;I&quot; started cutting them in half; the migranes stopped but now my muscles &amp; joints feel like I'm 100 yrs old.  Sometimes I couldn't even raise my arm.  I've stopped taking it and have been researching meds to try instead.  My next visit, I will inform &quot;him&quot; of a different med after I see what my numbers are after taking Zocor for 2 months!

High Cholesterol	Angela, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	12/15/2007 10:23:26 AM	I began taking this drug and within 24 hours experienced, blurred vision, extreme tiredness, low grade headache, muscle ache all over my body, low grade fever, flu like symptoms.  I was so tired I was sleeping over 10 hours a day.  I am a jogger/runner, I workout with weights and do a cardio workout daily.  By taking this drug I have gone from being extremely active to a couch potato.  I went to the doctor 3 days later with the same symptoms and she said to continue with the drug.  The doctor stated that all cholesteral medicines have the same side affects and just to keep taking it.  I went to another doctor who promptly took me off the drug because of these dangersous side affects and we are researching other methods to reduce my cholesteral.  At this point I do not know the extent of damage there is to my liver from this medicine.  Don't beleive all doctors, get a second opinion.
High Cholesterol	MaggieMinn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	12/11/2007 3:06:35 PM	This medication has helped my LDL (from 132 to 91!) and Triglycerides (from 180 to 142), but hasn't raised my HDL too much (from 38 to 43), so my Dr. is putting me on Niaspan to try to get the HDL up (little scared about that because of the side effects). However, I'm pleased with the Zocor results. It's easy to use as all you have to do is take the pill before bedtime. The only side effect I seem to be having is some constipation, but I'm not 100% sure it's from the Zocor.

I was one of the &quot;rare&quot; side effects.  I felt so bad that I wished I would die.
