Migraine Headache	mseipper, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/7/2012 7:56:00 PM	I have suffered from migraines for about 8 years and this is the first medication that always relieves the awful pain and general sick feeling. I only wish I could afford to have more pill/year as I have way more migraines than the pills my doctor can give me inexpensively. The only side effect I experience is an annoying jaw pain, but it is well worth it.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/3/2012 4:27:19 PM	I Love IT....even if the side effect is a little stomach ache or nausea...it's worth it...My migraines are so bad that nothing else helped me before, but after taking Treximet, after 15 minutes, I'm in heaven.Doesn't make me sleepy or anything like that. It's just great!!!

I've tried all the drugs available... Treximet is the ONLY one that works for me.  Does make me sleepy (and have a dry mouth) but being migraine free is worth those 2 small side effects.  WONDERFUL MEDICATION!!

It was not until I was in my late teens that I was diagnosed with migraine.  I have tried what seems like everything form Cafergot,Inderal, Migranal, Buspar (Major Side effects) Topomax.What strated to really work for me was Imitrex.  I took this for years. About 2 years ago I noticed I needed more for pain management and talkied to my Dr.  He prescribed Treximet.  1 pill starts working in about an hour and lsats all day and night.  I am so thankful to have this drug that I don't mind paying the $300 out of pocket when I lost my health insurance!
Migraine Headache	Lisa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	3/3/2012 10:18:58 AM	I have had Migraines for over 30 years they are getting worse as the years go by. Treximet works better than anything I have taken but I get very dizzy, so sick to my stomach I can not get out of bed for 2to 3 hours after taking it. I also gain 5lbs every time I take it, I lose the weight 2 to 3 days later. I have to be in alot of pain to take treximet because of the side effects but it works

Migraine Headache	9cardswin, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	12/31/2011 2:28:13 AM	Horrible MGs for last two years sometimes lasting 3 days. Was perscribed Treximet a few days ago and took one today about two hours into a very bad episode. Laid down and could feel the painf leaving within 1 hour. I was able to get up and function at 80 % or so with only a little bit of nausea. I will continue to take this drug if I can these results. I have been seeking treatment for these headaches for 3 years now- MRI's , Cscans, et. without a DR. suggesting something to take. A new MD this week really took the time to speak with me and listen, then suggested I try. I am greatful to him for that. God bless Dr. Sanchez At Trinidad Medical Center in Carmichael, CA

I do feel sleepy shortly after taking Trex, so I can't drive or do things with my kids. But overall, a very positive effective med.
Migraine Headache	erita, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/13/2011 10:50:03 PM	When I let my migraines get to a certain point it literally is a point of no return or if I wake up with one.  My doctor gave me a couple of samples of Treximet and I have had 5 in the last 2 months and they were gone within 30 min of taking Treximet.  Normally, I would have been stuck with the migraine for about 24 hours.  My side effects are a burning 'hot' sensation in my upper body including head and a slight upset stomach all worth it considering a migraine is way worse for me.  In fact, I literally feel the medicine working... 
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/27/2011 9:44:00 PM	I have found the only experienced  disadvantage with taking Treximet are the side effects before the migraine relief.  But without a doubt, hands down, I would rather be inconvenienced by a few minutes of discomfort, than endure the usual hours to days of migraine pain without taking Treximet.
Migraine Headache	Sarah, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/8/2011 11:29:04 PM	Treximet has been a life saver that gave me fast relief from severe and frequent migraines.  Mild drowsiness that passed quickly was the only side effect I experienced and minor compared to the relief I got.  I always have it on hand.  Another problem is that my insurance dropped coverage for it and it is EXPENSIVE!  I try to get free samples from my doctor.  
Migraine Headache	Michelle, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	8/3/2011 1:57:28 AM	Started taking Treximet about 3 months ago. It is the only think that will take away my headaches. Though, when I take it without eating I feel nauseous and dizzy.
Migraine Headache	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	8/2/2011 10:48:38 AM	Treximet totally relieves my headaches 99% of the time. It's the only drug that gives me relief. It takes about 45 minutes to work. Side effects are drowsiness, and slight nausa. Very expensive. I've been taking it for about 2 years.

Flush feeling, numbness in my mouth, tightness on my jaw, shoulder pain, chest pain, raised my blood pressure so high I had to go to the emergency room. I want to cure my migraines not get a heart attack.

Nothing has ever worked better.  Imitrex (injection, usually followed by oral the following morning) is the only other drug that will touch my migraines; but I have never had recurring pain after taking Treximet.
Migraine Headache	Carrie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	5/2/2011 2:04:54 PM	Made me very tired for the whole day and within four hours I had two large blisters inside my bottom lip and one inside my cheek.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	4/19/2011 5:24:23 PM	First and last time taking Trexemet. I m desperate for migrane relief unfortunately I also have fibromyalgia so when my body pain n aches and burning became severe I thought it was the fibromyalgia, but the hot sweats and then a grab in my chest that must have lasted for at least 2hrs. My ribs felt like they were tightening around me n it was hard to catch my breath. in so much pain i was in tears trying to breathe. I felt helpless, I took 2 stool softeners and an aspirin just in case. 2 days later chest doesnt feel right, neck is very stiff and I have an appt. to get my heart checked.  My doctor knows I m on zoloft, Treximet doesnt do well with certain antidepressants.  U never know which side effects will get u.  Doctor says there is nothing else to try for my migranes as they r all similar to Trexemet so i get to wait again, I M TIRED.

I also have side effects like tachycardia, feeling hot, achey joints and tightness in the throat.  But it's worth it for the headache relief.
Migraine Headache	conn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	3/19/2011 3:16:39 PM	 I received three samples from my doctor.  I got a migraine this morning at about 6:45 a.m.  I get auras before my migraines start so I took the Treximet as soon as the aura started, hoping that it would knock the migraine out before the pain started.  The pain did come, but not in the usual &quot;one sided&quot; way.  I had pain in the front of my head from one temple to the other.  I didn't have anything in my stomach before taking the pill so I decided to eat something.  Half way through my breakfast I felt sweaty and then nauseated.  I also started feeling very drowsy so I laid down and slept for 2 hours.  After I woke up my migraine was gone; however, I still felt very &quot;out of it&quot;.  I think that Excedrin Migraine works better than Treximet.  I won't be using Treximet again.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	1/28/2011 12:03:46 PM	I get migraines that last for 3 days every couple of weeks. I started taking Treximet about 9 months ago and was taking about 3 every month. It was great for the first couple of months - relief within 45 minutes and minor side effects that went away within 30 minutes - jaw/neck sensations. About 4 months ago, I started having new side effects - severe chest pains, heavy, painful, tingling arms, trouble breathing and felt very hot and starting sweating, even palms sweated. Very Scary!! My doctor said it was just a side effect and I should continue taking it but told me I should make sure someone is around when I take it - Really?? I had never experienced anything like that before. I had that happen after taking Treximet on 3 separate occasions. I probably shouldn't have continued to take it but when you're in the middle of a migraine it seems worth it. But it's really not. I continued to have that reaction after having not taken Treximet in about a month. It's happened about 5 times since being off the Treximet but seems to be getting less frequent and severe the longer I am off the Treximet.

This is by far my favorite medication prescribed.  I don't get drowsy, I can get back to my life with this one and it helps so much with the neck and shoulder stress. The downside is the super sensitivity.  My arms and legs ache terribly after a while.  I seem to be having more recurring headaches lately.  Treximet always gets rid of it though.

I am so happy to have such quick relief of my headache, neck pain and muscle tension in my shoulder. In the first 1/2 hour my headache and neck pinching/pain was gone. And within another 15 to 20 minutes all tension was gone in shoulder muscles around my neck as well. My only side effect is dry mouth and that only lasted for about 3 hours after taking it. I feel amazing and am so excited to be pain free so fast!!! 
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	11/17/2010 11:14:38 AM	This is the best I have found for my terrible migraines. Costly but well worth it, considering it totally eliminates them w/in 30-45 minutes. I do get a little fuzzy feeling in the head w/in 5-10 minutes of taking it.. And I have noticed a slight thickness in my throat during that same time.. but as I said w/in 45 minutes, everything is completely gone for me.

My doctor had prescribed me many different migraine medicines and this is the only one that worked for me.  It sometimes makes me a little sleepy, but when I have a migraine all I can do is lay down in the dark anyway. 
Migraine Headache	kimstc, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	11/2/2010 12:24:16 AM	Today was my first day taking Treximet. I have had server chronic migraines sense I was two years old and I have taken pretty much ever medication used for migraine treatment. At first I was very impressed with this one. The only side effect I had was that it knocked me out, which was a relief because my head was throbbing so bad. When I woke up about 4 hours later I had no migraine for about 15 minutes but then it came right back. I did take furicet and 4 advil when it came back which finally got it to go away, although I have no idea if you are supposed to mix treximet with those medications but a few hours had passed and I was desperate. I think the next time I will try taking 2 to see if that works. So far the best medication I have been on is maxalt plus 4 advil, but it seems my body is getting used to it after so many years.

It takes care of my headache and I never have to take more than one, like I do with Relpax and Frova sometimes,  but I have the most side effects with it.  I end up feeling nauseous, dizzy, tired (but I can't sleep on it) and just &quot;thick&quot; inside.  I'd rather have the side effects than a migraine though, so when I run out of my other medicine (my insurance limits my amount of Relpax to 4 a month), I take the Treximet (which for some reason my insurance lets me have 9 of those a month).  My doctor and I are in the process though of finding another drug to replace Treximet that doesn't have all the side effects.  I was on Imitrex years ago and might try that, since it seems from reading others' posts that has less side effects (I switched from that years ago when I switched doctors).
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	10/5/2010 9:57:54 AM	I was taking this for over a year.  I changed to another drug that addresses everyday headaches, and now I hate Treximet (whether that is the cause, I still don't know).  While it still is usually effective in getting rid of the migraine within 45 minutes, I am so nauseous I can't keep the pill down long enough to work.  Add in the hot flashes and dizziness and this cure has turned to be worse than the original migraine.
Migraine Headache	Red Robin, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	9/30/2010 4:20:55 PM	     I am SHOCKED no one mentioned weight gain or swelling! Now I learned through this site another symptom, the burning/tightness in my chest in all-likely-hood is also caused by the Treximet. I to was a total fan as it worked on my migraines where nothing else would but at what cost? I have gained over 40 LBS (I've always been 'thin'), I at random get 'elephant' legs (the last time was durning my son's wedding) &amp; the latest - my blood results showed I have Kidney Disease. No, my doctor Never suggested it could possibly be the Treximet, I am doing this research on my own. 
Migraine Headache	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	9/3/2010 7:22:02 PM	It works! Now I take Topamax and 0 Migraines in 2 months but when I take Treximet and go to work, my job is physical, it really makes me sweat. I don't know what it is about it but it makes me hot and sweat but it does get rid  of that nasty headache.

My doctor tells patients to try taking 1/2 and see if that will work.  That works just the same; at least for me, unless it is really bad.
Migraine Headache	ABubbs, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	35-44	8/29/2010 2:09:52 AM	its fast acting on my migraines (I get relief within an hour, usually within 30 minutes) but I always get a rebound headache. ALWAYS. I've tried all the triptans that are out there, and imitrex works the best. Since treximet has imitrex in it, it must be the naproxen that is causing the rebound, so if you're sensitive to naproxen, be warned. I used to just take ibuprofen with my imitrex, and that worked great for me. Treximet *is* expensive, but Glaxo Smith Kline has an assistance program called &quot;Bridges to Access&quot; you can apply to that is actually really easy to qualify for. I get my Treximet for free that way. 
Migraine Headache	shay, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	8/18/2010 3:40:38 PM	Migraines for years, nothing worked.  Imitrix made my chest and throat tight, fiornal/codeine caused massive rebound headaches.  Only time would ease the pain.  Tried Treximet 2 months ago.  It takes away the migraine after an hour or so, but my neck and arms usually ache for the rest of the day.  Also keeps me awake.  But it DOES help me get rid of my migraine.

I should never have been prescribed this medication because of severe reactions (of which my doctor is aware) to Imitrex, but I also should have read the warnings before taking the drug.  Yeah, my headache went away but at a horrible price.  Oh, and my diligent pharmacist filled the script even though I'm on two different drugs that should have raised red flags!
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/4/2010 10:34:37 AM	LOVE IT. I only need to take 1 tablet at the onset of a migraine -- gone in 45 minutes. Only side effect i've ever had was tightening in the throat, especially if you drink alcohol within 24 hrs of taking it.. but this is definitely outweighed by the benefits.

I felt as if the pain receptors were tripled or more! lukewarm water felt like a scalding pot of water,and my throat felt like i had my tonsils removed once more, and my poor muscles...lets just say it hurt to move. bad thing, my headache was gone, but i couldn't sleep and this pain lasts a day or so..and muscles hurt/sore for the next few days. I took the pill on a saturday and its now tuesday and my muscles are sore as heck! and i have a lingering small itsy headache thats nagging, but not painful.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/18/2010 11:40:25 PM	I get frequent migraines, sometimes lasting for days or a week.  I do not get auras and occasionally have nausea.  As with most of these types of medicines, it works best if taken at the first sign of migraine (rather than waiting til it hurts).  When the medicine kicks in, especially if I have waited until I am in pain, my heart races and I feel weird.  But this is worth it to get the migraine to go away.  I have tried a lot of preventative and abortive medicine, this is only one of two medicines that help (the other being Axert).

It worked well but did make me groggy. However, 2 nights ago I took it for a migraine. The next day, my left arm was numb and tingly. The next morning,I went to the dr thinking I was having a stroke. The dr said it can be a side effect of the Treximet. I will not be taking this again.

This drug has been WONDERFUL! I take one dose, migraine is gone with a few  hours. I no longer have to suffer through days of extreme pain and nausea. This is truly a wonder drug!!
Migraine Headache	Ken Moss, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	3/23/2010 2:13:04 AM	This is a godsend.  I have suffered with migraine headaches bad enough to render my body limp like a stroke.  It's happened twice that bad and I get migraines at least 6 times a month, generally when the weather changes.  It has always removed the migraine pain (although I still can feel the pulsating in my head) within an hour.  My first stroke like headache got me to the ER and they gave me all kinds of stuff over the next few months, but nothing worked.  My friend had the same issues, just not as extreme.  I tried out a treximet he had and I could not believe it worked so well.  I write software for a living and have gone home many days because of these migraines.  The dosage needs to be increased passed 9 pills per month.  When it rains a lot here in texas I have periods of about 15 migraines a month.  The weather seems to always trigger these crazy things.  I've also stopped having blind spells since taking this.  I'm glad this drug is on the market even though its really expensive.   
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/7/2010 10:59:11 AM	I have suffered from severe migraines for a long time and not much helped to relieve them. My doctor gave me a sample of this Treximet and think it works great! At the first sign of a migraine I take one and lay down for a bit since it does make me feel a little dizzy. Within an hour the migraine is gone and I am able to continue with my day instead of being bedridden from the pain.
Migraine Headache	JeannieY, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	3/1/2010 12:10:25 AM	I got 3 samples of 2-pills each from my doctor since the Frova I was taking made me dizzy, sleepy, and nauseas.  When I took the Treximet within the first tingling of a migraine, it worked great.  Just slightly sleepy but no dizziness or nausea.  Don't know if my body will develop a tolerance to it though since it did to Maxalt.  Relpax and Imitrex never worked for me.
Migraine Headache	EvieGirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	2/19/2010 6:26:25 PM	I have had a constant headache for 5 days. I went to the doctor was just diagnosed with migraines. He provided me with 3 diff samples of medicines (Treximet, Maxalt and Relpax)I decided to try Treximet first, upon takin the first pill in the doctor's office, by the time I made it to my vehicle I felt like someone dashed me with gas and threw a match on me! My whole body felt like it was on fire, I became very nauseated and experienced a hot flash like no other. I felt worse before I felt better but after 5 days I finally have no head pain. Right now my body hurts like hell with the feeling of having flue like body aches or having been in a fight. All said and done I would rather these side effects than the migraine anyday! This is just pill one and I will go through the rest of the brands before deciding which one &quot;works for me&quot;. 
Migraine Headache	35-44 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5		35-44	2/17/2010 12:55:01 PM	I take it upon onset of the headache and for the 1st hour I feel worse and then the migraine totally disappears.

Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	1/31/2010 12:37:24 AM	I've had migraines for 30 years and have tried many different treatments, preventative and for relief.  The best medicine was Relpax, but unfortunately I developed an &quot;immunity&quot; to it and it wouldn't relieve the symptoms as well.  Treximet, if taken early, is pretty effective.  To save money (and pills), I usually cut the pills in half and try to get by that way.  I don't really notice any bad side effects, and the migraines usually are relieved within an hour. I would recommend Relpax first though...most of my teacher friends use it and are extremely satisfied.

Migraine Headache	Amanda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	35-44	1/28/2010 12:21:46 PM	Desperate to get rid of my migraine so I tried this new miracle drug. For me it didn't work. I took 1 pill with food and it didn't make me drowsy in fact, it kept me up all night! Hot, sweaty, extreme stomach pain and still a migraine. I'm terrified to take the second one but still desperate to rid my never ending migraine....

Migraine Headache	cindy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	1/22/2010 4:53:30 PM	This medication has been effective for me, but it has the EXACT SAME EFFECT as an Imitrex and an Aleve - it's the same ingredients.  I had my doctor revert me to the old prescription as my insurance covers the generics for free, and I didn't want to keep paying through the nose for this pricy drug when I could have the same effect for virtually no cost.  The side effects vary with what dose of Imitrex I use - 50 or 100mg.  It's usually ok with 50, bad with 100.
Migraine Headache	grindste, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/19/2010 10:40:21 AM	Horrible reaction. Took it for the second time three days ago, and my chest still hurts off and on. When I first took it, my chest hurt and felt tight, and my head felt so funny. And when the medication initially wore off, my migraine was still there. Will never, ever take this again. 
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	1/17/2010 12:18:24 AM	Took my migraine away pretty quickly which was great but all of a sudden i started feeling short of breath and a burning sensation in my throat and chest. Soon the burning sensation turned into a tightness feeling. My whole body got really hot and I began to get really panicy about what was happening to me! I felt absolutely horrible. These sideaffects are not worth it to me. Although it doesnt take the entire migraine away, Id rather use a relpax. 
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	1/12/2010 2:44:25 PM	Made me woozy and sweaty. Felt horrible for about an hour, then headache went away.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/6/2010 2:17:43 PM	Treximet is the only medication that has always worked and gets rid of my migraine within an hour. Nothing else every really worked every time like Treximet does. For it to work the most effective, take it at the onset of the migraine. Only side effect I have had is tiredness.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	1/4/2010 11:17:24 PM	Because migraine medication is so expensive my doctor gave me some samples of Treximet to try. I have taken it a few times and I HATE it. It intensifies my migraine and makes it unbearable. My body feels like it is on fire. The pain starts in my neck and continues up. It's an AWFUL feeling! I would rather suffer through the migraine pain!

Though the cost is high it is worth not having to go through three days of hell.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	12/16/2009 9:38:19 PM	Ive had migraines for a few years and this was the first medication that doctors prescribed that worked for me. Although it worked it made me feel kind of out of it and dazed and it made me slightly nauseous and dizzy the first time I took it. Also, its pretty expensive unfortunately.

Migraine Headache	DJ, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	11/24/2009 12:04:25 AM	The only reason there is 1 star marked is that it is required. I started taking this medicine for migraines. After starting it my skin would crack and bleed, just bending my fingers would hurt.  The medicine did noting for my migraine. It made my neck, and chest feel heavy and hurt. I already was nausea from the migraine, needless to say it didn't help that either.  I will never take this medicine again.  There has to be something better that the insurance will approve.
Migraine Headache	Dee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/19/2009 12:43:00 PM	I took Treximet (first time) this morning and I feel worse now than I did at the onset of my migraine!  My chest started hurting, I felt nauseated, and even my throat is hurting!  Also, I felt out of it mentally! Id rather endure a migraine than to take this Treximet again!

Treximet worked for me!  I had no side effects and felt great the next morning ready to go.  I will continue to take this medicine as needed.  
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	11/2/2009 11:28:00 AM	Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Makes me feel flushed and out of touch with reality, like my head is one place, my body somewhere else, and my brain somewhere far far away. Overall I would reccomend it, but there has to be something better out there!

Within 20 min. of taking it, I felt like throwing up, my throat burned, my neck hurt, my jaw hurt, and now my skin is terribly sore to touch all over.  I also have red and white blotches all over my body.  I am left with a small headache, and no migraine, but feel awful and will NEVER take Treximet again!!!!   EVER...I would have rather continued on with my migraine than feel like this.  
Migraine Headache	BuffyAZ, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	1		35-44	9/17/2009 1:41:47 PM	I started experiencing black spots in my vision but thought I just needed reading glasses.  I found out that temporary/permanent blindness is a side effect for treximet users.  I found this out due to another patient's bout with temporary blindness.  I will never take it again! Beware!
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	9/14/2009 6:32:15 PM	Treximet makes my neck/jaw/chest/arms feel VERY tight and VERY heavy, and the pain radiates up from my neck into my head, making the migraine much WORSE, not better. I took one and will never take another again. Switching back to maxalt ASAP.
Other	mro3, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	9/8/2009 1:29:12 PM	I have had migraine headaches everyday for the last two months, after countless painkillers my neurologist put my on this, so far it is the only thing that begins to even dull the pain. I have been taking it for about over month now and haven't had a complaint yet.

I have to stop using it for now.  Any explanation for my rash - just on the tops of my feet?  
Migraine Headache	smugggirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/27/2009 5:51:09 PM	I've been taking this medicine for about 6 months now. It works everytime. I get panic attacks and drowsiness with my migraines. The Treximet stops the pain within an hour usually but it sometimes takes up to 3 hrs for my other symtoms to go away. I had one time where the medicine didn't help my nausea but I'll take 1 time in 6mos vs 6 times per month with no migraine relief. This medicine works. Thank God for helping relieve me of the pain. I'm starting to feel like I'm getting my life back. I can tend to my kids and husband now and I'm not as depressed anymore because I'm not in pain all the time anymore.

I've tried taking it even before it turns into a full blown migraine when just a baby headache. So, I am off to find something that does something. So, far only muscle relaxers and sleep help.

Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/11/2009 11:41:21 PM	Took the pill three hours later I felt great.  No &quot;hangover after effects nothing.  Just headache gone.  Felt refreshed.
Migraine Headache	Irish Lass, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	55-64	8/10/2009 2:35:42 PM	The 1st 2 times I tried Treximet, it worked like a miracle. The 3rd time, it gave me relief, but not complete. Still, it really helped. For all of you who have TROUBLE OPENING THE CONTAINER, put one finger on the dot and another finger opposite it on the back of the container, then squeeze. It pops right open. That's not what the directions say, however! The first time, I used my teeth, like someone else mentioned!

My headaches are very consistant everyday and I was hoping this drug would work, but by the time the side effects wore off, my headache was back again.  I will not be trying this drug again anytime soon.  Beware.

My doctor prescribed Treximet and it works every time. I do feel tingling in my head and stiffness in the neck and throat a little, but it is well worth it! Green Tea also helps ease headaches!!
Migraine Headache	keriberri, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/28/2009 1:40:04 PM	As a migraine sufferer for over 20 years, I've tried everything on the market it seems.  I really like Treximet.  Side effects for me are drowsiness and some tightness in my jaw.  But I'd much rather have that than a migraine ANY day.  If you are a true migraine sufferer, you know what I mean.  I realize people react differently to different medications, so some people may not be able to take this medication, but if you are a person who normally has to lie down in a dark room for the day like me, I hope this drug helps you like it has helped me.  Response time has been anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on when I can take it, and if I can lie down after I take it then it seems to work faster.  It is more expensive, but I have taken advantage of the coupon offer.
Migraine Headache	fallentxangel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	25-34	6/16/2009 3:12:23 PM	I hadn't had migraines since I was in college about 12 yrs ago.. then they started again this year around Feb. I had had a couple between then and June. Then, starting on June 7th, I had pretty much been having a continuous headache of one sort or the other. The ER gave me a shot of toradol and some vicodin that barely had me functioning. Not good when your husband is deployed and you're in charge of the kids. I saw my doc, who gave me midrin. Worked, but then it stopped working after 45 minutes. It wasn't enough.Finally, I ended up in the base ER again with a splitting migraine, sharp stabbing pains behind my eye, severe nausea.. it was horrible. He gave me a treximet prescription. I took it as soon as I got it. By the time we got back to the house (about 30 minutes away) the headache was nearly gone. I was finally able to take care of my kids and house!I woke up with a small headache today, but 3 motrin took care of that. No side effects that I saw. Only complaint is I couldn't open the package. Finally used my teeth. Not a good thing when your head is killing you.

The only problem I find is the container is very hard to open which doesn't help when you are already suffering from a migraine which affects you sight with spots and shooting stars and black spots. I think they could improve the container.

I will still use Treximet but with the understanding that I will still have a headache but not a full blown migraine.

I've tried different meds. My Axert stopped working on my migraines so my doctor called this one in for me.  I took one pill and it did not work.  I had a full meal, however I still got extremely nauseaous, dizzy and had a horrible burning sensation in my throat and neck.  My chest became tight. My head and neck felt like it was in a vice grip. I felt very 'loopy' and was unable to work. The feelings lasted for about 2 hours.  The migraine did not go away at all, so I had to suffer for the rest of the day because I was too scared to take another pill. The problem is I paid $230.00 for 9 pills that I am stuck with.  Several days ago, I had a migraine again and went back to using the axert.  I'd rather suffer the migraine than use this med again. I guess everyone has different symptoms, but this was very scary to me.  I really felt like all my muscles in my body was contracting. Good luck to everyone who does not have these side effects.  Be careful.

It is the only medication I have used that has actually worked. It completely relieved my migraine. I had strange, sharp jaw pain as well but it was very minor. I don't have the pain at all if I eat before taking the med. I recommend this to migraine sufferers!
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/19/2009 11:09:47 PM	I have suffered from migraine headaches for 25 years.  I have tried everything that has been produced.....nothing has worked with the exception of injections at the ER. This medication is fantastic.  I usually take it and go to sleep. Although it does not make me drowsy.  I have not suffered from any side effects at all.  Even if I did, I would still take this medication because the side effects are nothing compared to the feeling that my head is going to explode. 
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	3/16/2009 3:21:35 AM	took this drug for migranes, and had terrible jaw pain, and ear pain. It did take away my migrane, but I felt nauseous and dizzy. 
Migraine Headache	pandagirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/15/2009 11:56:58 PM	Treximet is the only migraine rescue medicine that can help me! I am so thankful for it. I never leave the house without it. I would recommend it to anyone who is suffering from severe migraines. I have never ever suffered from any side effects.
Migraine Headache	Gil, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/14/2009 1:09:14 PM	My wife has had multiple issues that we have both had to deal with and so I have had to be very careful with drug interactions and when I received a new prescription for he, I would have to research first any interactions of her current drugs, compared now to her newly prescribed drugs before giving her the new drug.  For my wife's migrains, nothing has worked prior to our Doctor giving us a sample of Treximet. This drug for us is a miracle drug as within 30 minutes, migrain is gone.  That is without any side affects either.  She will usually be relieved of her pain for 2-3 days also.  Problem now is there is not enough information on this drug for civilians who run the insurance companies to really know what is going on as this is a fairly new drug on the market. So when we asked for a prescription increase with a letter from us and our doctor, it was denied.  The prescription is for 9 pills per 30 days.  Does that make sense when the directions stated, 1-2 pills per 24 hours or as needed?  So out comes the writing pen for an appeal drug as for us, this was a wonder drug that has helped tremendously with headache pain relief for my wife.
Migraine Headache	Concerned Patient, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	3/10/2009 4:12:51 PM	I had been having sever migraine headaches for 3 weeks. I finally broke down and went to the doctor. He presented to me Treximet as the new miracle cure. I took the med and within 30 minutes i had severe pain in my back between my shoulder blades, pain in my left arm and jaw pain; this subsided in about 30 minutes. I thought that the side effects were over, but... then i lost feeling in the left side of my face and a feeling of whip lash in my neck. I am an RN and i was terrifed that i was having an allergic reaction, heart attack, or stroke. The side effects were deffinetly not worth it. I still had a headache the next day.
Migraine Headache	AngelicaSimone, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	13-18	3/1/2009 11:03:25 PM	Well this drug is effective at relieving my migraines, but at what cost?  I got the pills as a sample.  Upon taking it, i got a weird heavy sensation in my limbs and a burning in the back of my throat.  Now, after my second time using it, the headache is gone but i am so tired and my body aches all over from this.  I would recommend this to someone to try, but beware the side-effects.  Definitely not for me.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/24/2009 9:36:42 AM	This medication is WONDERFUL!  Takes away my migraine within 45 minutes.  I have had no side effects from taking this.  I have tried numerous migraine meds with little to no success.  I will never be without Treximet.  I just wish they offered more coupons because this is on the non-preferred list for my insurance.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	2/23/2009 12:44:05 AM	I have had migraines for the past fifteen years and nothing has ever taken the migraine away completely until now. The side effects werent the greatest (tightness in the chest, nausea, burning in the throat, etc.) but in about 45 minutes the migraine was gone! I have been on several medications including preventatives and emergency room only injections that would take the edge off to make it more of a &quot;functionable migraine&quot; but nothing ever has taken it away completely. I would have to live with migraines for days before it would subside on its own. I would reccomend this medication only if you were to read all of the side effects first. Everyone is different and just because some people have had horrible side effects you might not, try talking to your doctor about what worries you about it first. Try it for yourself. My side effects only lasted for a few hours. My doctor gave me samples and a medication guide and told me to read it first before taking it. It was the first medicine to work completely for me. I will take it again for my next migraine!
Migraine Headache	reilly, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/21/2009 11:11:14 AM	I have suffered from migraines for the past five years.  I also suffer from chronic neck pain due to an accident.  I was very nervous about taking this medicine due to the side effects.  When I finally took the first sample dose I was amazed!  Not only did it work on the migraine but also completely alleviated my neck pain (something other drugs could not do).  I obviously can't take it for chronic pain but it is wonderful to have the migraine gone and the neck pain relieved.   Side effects were mild, mostly a feeling of fatigue.
Migraine Headache	charley, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	2/18/2009 9:56:18 AM	I took one dose of this medicine and the side effects  were terrible...racing heart, chest pain, jaw pain, dizziness, extreme drowsiness.  It knocked me out for 6 hours.  It got rid of my migraine but the side effects were so bad I will never consider this as a solution again. 
Migraine Headache	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	13-18	2/15/2009 10:58:47 PM	My daughter tried this for the first time a few nights ago while she was at work.  She called me in a panic because her chest hurt, had shortness of breath and jaw pain.  I did a search on this medication and found this to be a common side effect...would have been nice if the doctor/pharmacist had mentioned it.  The sad part is that it actually worked.  She says she would much rather suffer with the headache then take this medicine again.
Migraine Headache		3	4	1			2/6/2009 8:24:10 AM	This med helped my migraine, but the side effects were not worth it. I had nausea and abdominal pain for 5 days that required me to take another med to help that. 
Migraine Headache	jdavis0221, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	2/4/2009 6:58:00 PM	After taking this medication and feeling worse than before I did I took the time to (finally) read up on the side effects and realized I wasn't crazy. My neck and shoulders got tight, my whole head felt like it was in a vist and I had this horrible pressure in my ears. Needless to say it did not make my headache go away!
Migraine Headache	sarah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/2/2009 4:38:11 AM	I've tried Maxalt and Imitrex and neither really worked, but Treximet worked wonders. I consider it a &quot;wonder drug&quot; for me. About 20 minutes of taking it I get a heavy, dizzy &quot;looped&quot; feeling. I feel that way for maybe 15 minutes then the dizziness fades and my headache fades with it. I know everyone reacts differently, but for me- it's wonderful!
Migraine Headache	S. Davis, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	1/28/2009 1:56:49 AM	When I first took this medication, I had a migraine so bad, I felt like I needed to be in somebody's hospital.  To my surprise, It worked!!  I've been having migraines for about 15 years and nothing I've ever tried worked as fast as the treximet.  Don't get me wrong, the side effects are horrible but in my opinion, they are worth it.  I'd rather feel like a sumo wrestler got me in the headlock any day than to continue feeling the pain of a migraine.  After taking it a couple of times, I've gotten use to the sweating, upset stomach and the feeling as if someone is standing on top of my head.  It helps to lie down and try to sleep while the medicine is working. I wake up feeling like a new person!!
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/26/2009 5:43:44 PM	this medication had me sweating, neck muscles got tight. this is not a good thing for migraines!
Migraine Headache	releived from texas, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	1/26/2009 11:53:26 AM	I will never take this medicine again, I took the migraine away but left me with horrible nausea, irritable stomach and chest pain for 2 days. I would beware to anybody that has not tried this medicine before, please read the side effects.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/22/2009 12:11:46 PM	This drug made my head feel like some one had taken a vice grip and was sqeezing my head out of my nose. It made my nose feel like it wanted to bleed.
Migraine Headache	punky, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	1/19/2009 6:30:46 PM	I have been on several different types of medications. I get very tired with taken just one of these I have to take it at night so that I can go to sleep I usually take it at dinner time so that I can take my other migraine medication a couple of hours later and be in bed by 9 and asleep a short time later. I still have the headaches but and find that it makes you extremely tired so be careful. I am not sure if they are getting better because I have never had a day without one in the last two years.
Migraine Headache	jaro, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/13/2009 10:48:20 AM	I've taken this pill only a couple of times, but it has worked on my migraine.  I'm a little afraid of the side effects stated on the warning label but what medication doesn't.  
Migraine Headache	lasweet11, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	1/8/2009 9:44:32 AM	Upon an onset of a headache, which I suffer from, my doctor gave me a sample of Treximet. Within 15 minutes, my hands began to tingle &amp; my ankles became very sore. By the time I arrived at work, my body was in so much pain. My muscles had contracted, my chest became very tight &amp; hurt. I was taken to the hospital ER. I was told I was having an adverse reaction to the Treximet. My symptoms had gotten worse. My blood pressure shot up &amp; my body felt like I had been beat. I have never had an experience like this &amp; hope I never do again. Its been 2 days since I took Treximet &amp; I still am in so much muscle pain. And by the way, I never did get rid of my headache. Please do research on this medication before taking it. Its not for everyone. 
Migraine Headache	tea, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	1/7/2009 7:49:54 PM	I have suffered for too many years. This med did help me. I started with an imitrex and it did not touch the pain. Several hours later I remembered these samples and finally gave in and took one. I hated having to try something else and was surprised that it worked so quick since I was already several hours into the migraine. I did however have side effects that resulted in my finding this sight. I was not sure if it was just me or because I mixed the imitrex with the treximet. I can see that the side effects do vary from person to person but mine were not as severe but they were there. I would still take this over going to the hospital for shots which is humiliating and much more expensive. So good luck to all my fellow sufferers and do what works for you. Its worth a try!
Migraine Headache	ouchmyhead, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	12/29/2008 1:19:31 AM	My insurance saved me $123.00 on this medication. I paid $87.00 for 9 pills and the first two worked. After that I no longer got relief.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	12/28/2008 4:38:18 PM	After suffering these headaches for over 30 years, I was very happy to try Treximet. I must say, it did get rid of the migraine, but the side effects will stop me from ever taking it again. I also suffered severe burning up the back of my head, all the way to the top of my head. Almost like a panick attack like feeling also. My chest ached so bad, I almost had my husband call 911. A week later, a &quot;pock&quot; like rash started on my feet and gradually went up my legs all the way to my back. Severe itching and scars are still present[1 month later]. I would not recommend this med to my worst enemy. I would rather suffer with the migraine than ever take this again.
Migraine Headache	angaler, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	12/24/2008 5:24:07 AM	I had been having the migraine three days before I was able to get to my doctor.He give me the samples of Treximet it made me sleep for about 1 1/2.I woke up to a dull headache,abdomial pain,tightness of the chest &amp; nausea.I really lost my mind on the price.This was a horrible drug for me and now I'm stuck with the pricey pills. Move on DON'T TRY THIS DRUG!!!!!Angaler
Migraine Headache	teach4, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	35-44	12/21/2008 1:08:56 AM	I have suffered from migraines for years. Imitrex stopped working for me so I asked my doctor for a new kind of migraine med. She gave me Treximet. I had the worst reaction! I got very dizzy, shortness of breath, and almost a trip to the hospital. I will NEVER take the medicine again. It scared me too bad. I was afraid to go to bed.
Migraine Headache	AA23, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/18/2008 2:38:58 PM	The only bad thing is trying to figure out how to open the packaging when you have a migraine!
Migraine Headache	Zolijen, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3		35-44	12/7/2008 9:34:59 AM	I developed migraines about six months ago and went to the doctor in October.  I was given a sample of Treximet to see how it would work.  When I took it, it did get rid of the headache, but I got a horrible burning sensation covering my head and down my neck.  The headache did go away after two hours, but the burning was unbearable.  The doctor told me it must be the natural progression of my migraine since the medicine can take up to two hours to work.  I made the mistake of believing him and filled my prescription (OMG the price!) and I am now stuck with these expensive pills, which I hate to take and sometimes let the migraine run its course rather than take the Treximet.  I have broken down a twice and taken the Treximet, and then regret it.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	11/25/2008 11:04:00 PM	Is slower acting that Imitrex (can take up to an hour to kick in), but seems to last longer than Imitrex. It's not always effective for me, and it's a pretty big pill to swallow. I had a drug interaction that niether the my pharmacist nor my doctor  expected. I took a treximet within and hour of taking a zyrtec (used for allergies). The drug combo induced somnolescense (extreme drowsiness). I passed out and woke up 2.5 hours later. My panic didn't even keep me awake - a very scary experience. Barring that experience, treximet works reasonably well for me. 
Migraine Headache	dinkums, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/24/2008 9:57:10 PM	I have suffered with migraines for a few years now.  NOTHING WORKED!!!  It was getting so bad that I couldn't drive when I had a migraine.  Treximet has been a God Send!  It has alleviated the migraine every time I have taken it.  No more packing my head in ice and laying down in a dark room!!
Migraine Headache	aryal, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	11/18/2008 1:26:17 PM	This is the 2nd dose of this medication. I took it about 10 minutes after I felt the migraine coming on. It isn't as effective as I wish it was. The Maxalt was way more effective but the cost was ridiculous even with insurance. It has been about an hour now since I took the medicine and I still have the headache. I would have to say that I am not pleased. No sir, I am NOT a happy camper.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	4	3	Female	19-24	11/10/2008 8:36:31 PM	The pills take the pain away, but it sometimes takes over an hour to even start kicking in, and then it takes the symptoms away one by one over the course of several hours. Then about 20-30min after taking it my heart starts racing, I get really loopy &amp; tired, and once or twice I got a strange pain across the front of my chest and back across my back and shoulders. A few times I've even started trembling to the point my voice was shaking. I'm beginning to wonder if it's worth it. I take naproxen sodium on its own sometimes and it has virtually no effect, so I wonder if the triptan is doing all of the work.
Migraine Headache	LLK, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	11/10/2008 3:58:49 AM	Took the Treximet as soon as I was able to after my Migraine began.  Got severely 'loopy' feeling immediately after I took it.  That went away in about an hour and the headache was also gone.  But the next day, I started getting blisters on my legs that would itch severely and when I scratched would turn into open, stinging, burning, aching Sores.  This continued up both legs to my buttocks and up my back.  My Doctor put me on Septra DS and although taking awhile, it seems to be clearing things up.  Although the Medication works on the Migraine, I would never want to have this Rash again.  I am in my 3rd week with it, and still at times will get a new Blister.  And the Scars the Rash is leaving are horrible and ugly.  This Medication is definitely not for me.
Migraine Headache	Paula, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/7/2008 11:36:23 AM	About a 1/2 hour after I took treximet, my chest seemed a little tight &amp; seemed to burn, as did my neck.  Throughout the day, these symptoms did not go away and my migraine continued.  I just did not feel right.  I felt anxious as well as tired.  In my experience, I would rather have a migraine than take treximet again.
Migraine Headache	KRAZYKAT, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	11/7/2008 2:51:00 AM	Take it as a rescue med, but when I tried it, it was very slow to work.  Then basically didn't work.
Migraine Headache	Grateful in Oklahoma, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/6/2008 7:00:48 PM	I have had Migraines for years. And have taken everything under the sun for them. I normally take a handful of pain pills and go to the bedroom and hope that I don't get sick before they start to work a little, or at least knock me out for awhile. But when my doctor gave me this.. I was soo grateful!I could feel it working in about 30 minutes. I did feel really funny. I got a real big rush feeling and had to keep my eyes closed for awhile so I wouldn't get dizzy. I feel asleep and 2hrs later woke up feeling like a brand new person!! The only thing was I felt like I had a mouth full of salt for about three days. BUT NO HEADACHE! I will always used this for my headaches!!! Thank you very much for giving my life back!!!

I used to have success with zomig, but after about 5 years of relief with that drug, the medication suddenly stopped working. While imitrex and naproxin sodium alone didn't work, the combination of the two has brought great results for me.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/29/2008 12:35:14 PM	I used Imitrex injections for the last 15 years. My migraine would return and break through. My doctor gave me a sample and I could not believe the relief. Better than the shot for sure. The extra punch for the inflammation has been my cure. One tablet and my life is back to normal.

Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	10/27/2008 5:34:31 PM	I have had migraines since as long as I can remember and it has gotten worse as a result of having Lyme Disease. After trying various pain killers and several different migraine medications on top of a daily preventative she gave me this. The first couple times I used it, I thought it was a gift from God but now I can barely take it. I would rather deal with the migraine than the nausea and severe neck pain that keeps my headache from going away. I am a full-time student with a job on campus that does not allow me to rest after taking the medicine so it does not help me at all. I would rather take Imitrex shots than this pill.

Yes, the immense pain from the migraine was gone in about an hour, but the nausea was horrible and took several hours to abate.

Migraine Headache	lydiaq, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	9/28/2008 11:10:28 AM	I've been suffering from migraines for about 7 years.  This medication works and when taken at the first signs of a migraine mu headache is usually gone within the hour.  The only downside for me is the heavy feeling in my chest, very similiar to an anxiety attack and I get a tingling sensation in my limbs.  For me... it is best to lay down for about an hour after taking the medication.  All in all, I recommend it to any other migraine sufferer.
Migraine Headache	sks, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/23/2008 5:20:15 PM	I take this at the first sign of a migraine and within an hour the migraine eases off and is usually gone within a couple of hours.  I have not missed any work since I started taking this.  Also, I have not had any side effects.  Prior to this I was missing work a couple of times a month.

Migraine Headache	nanaof1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	35-44	9/17/2008 10:30:55 PM	I was not satisfied at all with this medication. After suffering for about 48hrs with a migraine, I called my dr. who gave me samples of this after axert, didn't even touch it. However, about 30 to 45 minutes after taking this drug I thought I was dying. I had the worse abdominal cramps, along with nausea, and diarrhea. I would not recommend this drug to my worse enemy. I'll stick with Frova. 
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	9/6/2008 12:56:24 AM	My doctor gave me a sample to try for my migranes. It worked, but it left me feeling nauseated, and dizzy. It also gave me a ringing in my ears, and a dull ache in my jaw and neck area. The only time I was satisfied with this medication was when I took it, and then went to sleep, because I would wake up without a migrane and without any of the awful side effects. 
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	8/14/2008 4:45:42 PM	It made me sick to my stomach, gave me chest pains, and my heart was racing at 96 bpm after I had been lying down for an hour.  I had pain in my sinuses and my neck.  I even began hallucinating.  I know different people have different reactions to different drugs but this was terrible.  Yes it got rid of the migraine, but I'd rather have the headache!
Migraine Headache	sand, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	8/12/2008 3:10:45 PM	Takes the migraine away but brings horrible nausea and pain at the neck and jaw area that last for hours. 
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	25-34	8/9/2008 9:54:16 AM	I read some of the reviews, because I wanted to see if anyone was experiencing what I did.  Which was very common I noticed. I took the treximet @10:0o in the morning after my doc gave it to me to relieve the migraine I was experiencing for two days. About 30 mins later.  I started to feel a burning @ the bk of my neck and then really nausated, for @ least two hours. It stopped and I was left without a headache, but worned and exhausted from the side effects.  I refused to take the pills again. There has to be something out there better than that.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/7/2008 5:39:17 PM	This worked so far.  I have a laundry list of pills I tried before and so far this is the best.  The only downfall is the price.
Migraine Headache	Kcisko, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	8/2/2008 5:19:36 AM	After 2 weeks of having a headache I was given the treximet, I took it and within an hour headache was gone, slept for about 7 hours and then woke up with the worse case of irritable diarrhea I have ever experienced in my life, I would take the Migraine over this discomfort anyday, I honestly feel like I am dying from this stomach pain and nausea.
Migraine Headache	cjr5077, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/23/2008 8:20:59 PM	I have been suffering from headaches and migraines for almost four years.  I have tried butalbital, midrin, imitrex and now treximet.  By far it is the best.  It works quickly and much fewer side effects than the imitrex.  It did leave me feeling sleepy, but that is much better than the pain anyday. 
Migraine Headache	LSlater0811, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/22/2008 3:30:58 PM	Works wonders for my migraine headaches. Take the pill and half hour later I have relief.  No other migraine medication has worked so far.  This is a five star.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/21/2008 3:22:50 PM	My doctor gave me samples at 930 am and I took them right away, around noon I felt tingling from my head all the way down to my fingers. I also slept for about 4 hours. My head was still a bit irritated but it took the migraine away. Naproxen at 500mg will kill any pain.  
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	7/21/2008 10:00:43 AM	I had been having severe headaches almost constantly for a coouple of weeks and the nurse practitioner gave me a same of the treximet to take the next time time I got one.  I endured about 7-8 more before I took this medicine.  About 25 minutes after I took the medication, my ears and base of my skull starting burning.  The &quot;fire&quot; crept on up the back of my head, across the top and around the front until my whole head felt on fire and huge.  I felt like I couldn't walk or anything because my head was much too large and heavy for my body.  I got nauseated and thought I was going to pass out.  I had to go to bed with a cold washcloth on my head and lay perfectly still.  This lasted about an hour.  It was over 3 hours from the time I took the medication until I felt nearly normal again.  It did eliminate the headache but it certainly was not worth the consequences.  I never want to go through anything like that again.
Migraine Headache	betteroffblu, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/19/2008 12:47:44 AM	My neurologist gave me some samples to try out since imetrex and zomig did not work. When my migraines get really bad I would have to go get a shot of demeral and toradol at not even that would do much. I tried treximel today for the first time and all I can say is WOW! it worked. I took less than a hour and it my migraine was gone. I was also lucky enough to not get any side effects except for energy...I have headaches every day and I can honestly say I went a day with out a migraine.

Migraine Headache	Britt26, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	6/25/2008 12:01:04 AM	I can't believe it! I finally found a migraine treatment that works! It did make me sleep for 7 1/2 hours, but I'd take that over suffering from another food allergy induced migraine any day!
Migraine Headache	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	6/5/2008 9:34:16 PM	I get daily migraines - this drug works wonderfully - less side effects (tightness, etc.) than imitrex.  I would highly recommend asking if you can try this if you suffer from migraines of any sort.
Migraine Headache	kimknicker, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/4/2008 8:36:52 PM	It took away the pain of my migraine however my neck and shoulders are very stiff and there is a slight tightness in my chest, i guess you have to out weigh the side affects to if it is worth taking. I'd rather have the side effects than the headache
