I also used it prior to the surgery to remove the tumor since being put to sleep always made me sick.  I did not get sick at all after surgery and it made the chemo tolerable.  The nausea was one of my minor side effects.

I would ususally have my treatment on Wed, go to work on Thu and rest on Fri,Sat,Sun and return to work on Mon.  I could not have done that without Emend.  I never had any nausea or vomiting episode. I had the Zofran as a backup but never used it.

I have had several surgeries because of two mastectomies and breast reconstruction. I literally would throw up for hours because of the anesthesia despite Zofran and other meds. I took Emend on my last surgery and for the very first time I only had a wave of nausea that the Zofran took care of.

I was given Emend shortly before my infusion and took another one when I got up this morning.  Other than VERY mild queezy feelings every now and then ... Emend is working wonderfully!!

The second chemo I took charge of his meds and refused to give them to hspital it made all the difference in the world.  No sickness the home health nurse who dropped off the IV fluids even noticed the difference.  Emend made my job so much easier it is hard enough on him dealing with cancer it makes it worse if he is sick.  Thank the makers of emend not only did you help him you helped me.

Emend seems very effective compared to the medications that target the stomach, rather than the brain.

Two rounds to go yet. It must be really working well (no nausea, etc.)because I still have the back-up of Zofran (which gave me a headache) and Ativan (haven't needed that one either).  I have no complaints.  About other things, yes, but I can't pin anything on Emend, that's for sure!  Other good things I found are the Weight Watchers yogurt with prebiiotics and probiotics, and Gatorade.

I wound up in the hospital for 4 days on day 7 of my chemo due to severely difficult bowel movements; extreme loss of body water; incomplete/infrequent bowel movements; feel like throwing up; stomach cramps; loss of appetite; head pain; throwing up; heartburn; taste problems; low amount of potassium in blood; gas; pelvic pain; not feeling well  all of which are known side affects of EMEND and not disclosed with dispensation of the drug. I found the information afterwards on the internet. I was hospitalized for DAYS with extreme intestinal blockage and in EXTREME pain. I will NEVER take this drug again; I questioned whether I would even continue my cancer treatment if this is what I would have to go through.
