Overweight	raven, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/1/2012 12:55:28 PM	I love this pill! I worked at Walgreens and got the pill because it was on sale and I needed something for energy. I was worried because I have anxiety and these pills usually make me jittery. This was the first pill to not do that. It suppressed my appetite so much I had to force myself to eat and would forget to eat. I walked of course but that is all I did and I lost 45 pounds in a couple of months. I didn't have any side effects and I'm usually the person that gets all of them. The only warning is don't take the full amount. These pills are strong and I only start off with half. After two weeks I took a whole. I never got up to two a day and I was happy because it made the bottle last longer. I think the price is fine because I can get 60 for $40 dollars online. Have nothing bad to say about it!

I cut the dosage in half and it helped a lot. After one day, urination returned to normal. I found that half a dose made it much easier to limit my intake of calories. In one week I have lost six pounds.

I've been dieting for a couple months with no results. My calories intake is around 1500. I exercise for 30 minutes a day and do 200 crunches before bed. I drink 8 or more glasses of water a day. Since taking these pills 8 have lost 4.6 lbs. I have only been taking them for a week. I only take one pill in the more because thats all I seem to need. I sleep at night just fine. Only side effect is it makes me a bit jittery but I find if I eat, follwed by exercise when I start to feel that way it goes.

I take the drug in the am before my coffee and I feel the urge to go but only a very weak stream will come out or none at all...I also have this side effect with other cold meds...but have never seen this side effect listed anywhere.

I started the pills and in 3 weeks lost 15 lbs in addition with exercising and being on a strict 1200 calorie diet. I was off the pills and only gained back 3 pounds because I didn't stick with my diet. The only side-effects that occurred with me were insomnia (the duration of taking the pills) and dry mouth. I just started taking the pills again and have already lost 3 lbs in 3 days. I have to remind myself to eat though because I never feel hungry.

I eat a honey bun at 8 am and take one pill at 830 am, drink plenty of fluids and eat a small meal with my husband around 6 pm. I love this pill and would recommend to anyone who wants to drop a few pounds quick. no side effects except dry mouth. It gives you so much more energy! I am on my third week now and I have went to taking them only on Mondays, Weds, and Fridays. I can now feel comfortable in a swim suit..My goal is to lose about 15 more lbs...

Overweight	happy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/17/2011 9:38:54 AM	I started the medicine at 148.6 pounds (5'4&quot; 45 year old female) just slightly over recommended BMI.  I have been taking it for 7 weeks and lost 13.4 lbs.  The first few weeks my appetite was significantly reduced.  After that, the fact that I was in the habit of eating less and very healthy foods I was able to keep my diet at reduced calorie level.  I think it also increased my metabolism.  I will continue taking it for the FDA recommended 12 weeks or less.  I also started walking 3 miles a day after the first week on the medicine.  The first week I had a little insomnia, jitters but second week was fine.  Dry mouth on and off occasionally and slight headaches on and off occasionally.  Overall very happy with results.  It was just what I needed to get me started.

You do have to watch what you eat and do some working out but most of the weight I have lost is because of not longing to eat all the time. In fact there are times I have to remind myself to eat. For someone who was addicted to food this has been the best thing I have ever put in my mouth.

Her weight loss is very evident but she has taken this medication before only to gain everything back and more when she stopped taking it. I have attempted to explain that Fastin&#174; alone is not a &quot;magic bullet&quot; for weight loss, I was a physician assistant for 17 years and have had much experience with treating obesity, it has been explained to her that behavior modification along with watching what you eat and when you eat it, as well as portion size would do the same thing as the Fastin&#174;. She will not listen and I have since found out that she uses 3 different doctors so she can stay on the Fastin&#174; longer than is recommended.I have to say that in my experience as a Physician Assistant Fastin&#174; is not the &quot;answer&quot; to obesity. It might make you feel like you are making progress because the scale tips to a lighter and lighter weight each week, however ... in the end you WILL gain the weight back with at least 20% more on top of it if you don't change your eating habits.

I will ask for a new prescription when I am aloud to take it again because it works very well.  During the first few days I didn't have an appetite and started to get dizzy because I wasn't eating after that all went well.

I have tried many times to diet and excercise, having once been successful with the Adkins Diet, I failed to maintain my weight loss after going off it.  - also harmful with excessive fat/caloric intake!  This has been a godsend; I went to my doctor and received a high cholesterol report coupled with attending a few individuals funeral that were my age - 55 years set my alarm off.  Pounds at this age, jump on and love your body so much, they don't want to leave!  I realized the quality of my life (which ws filled with the 'good life' rich foods and beverage as I'm a Chef ...... was slowly aging me.  I had to change if I was going to enjoy my coming retirement and year to come.  Feeling depressed, overweight, experiencing problems due to excessive weight on my knee (had a muscle lateral release surgery a few years ago;  feeling uncoordinated and aging, my doctor said she would help!  I have never taken diet pills, so this has a surprisingly big help to control my appetite.  I have been taking a 1/2 dose pill of a 37.5 MG pill only each morning for this.  I committed to getting on my Eclipetiglide machine for 1/2 hour of speed walking (arms and legs), drink lots of water and decided to restrict my food to only sereal, soup and salad (what I call the 'S'diet- oh and little sex too help).  It's easy to stick to and filling; high in fiber, fresh vegetable/fruits/grains; low in fats, meats.... and had that ever worked.  Funny, because my husband started doing the same thing, without the pill and has lost 20 pounds in 6 weeks, as I also! When we eat out, we split a meal- controls portion &amp; Yipee, I have 15 more to go and am feeling so my better.  When I reach my goal, I am going to reward myself with a closet redo and clean out my fat, fatter and too skinny clothes and strive to maintain my target weight. Highly recommend this supplement, along with taking control of other aspects of health in your life.

It must come from your dr.  I have been on and off phentermine (generic for fastin) for about 3 months now and have lost 26.3 lbs!  The only real side effect of this medicine is a dry mouth, but since drinking lots of water is so important to weight loss, this isn't a bad thing!  Not am I only drinking water now (impressive for a former Dr Pepper addict) I am eating healthy and exercising regularly.  These are things that are key to losing the weight.  I am making very important life changes that will make keeping the weight I lose off permanently.  Give your dr a call and ask him about the rx version.  Some drs wont give it to you, but if you check out some weight loss clinics, you can probably find a dr who will if you really want it.

It has no phentermine, it has something else. Has anyone purchased this, and how did it work for you. People here seem to have gotten theirs from the Dr. I want to know if this knock-off is crap or what. I'll check back daily. I wanted to start tomorrow, but noticed the ingredients were way different. Only 1 other person said this knock-off was garbage. I need to hear from a few other people. Good luck everyone.

You have to force yourself to eat.  The energy it gives you is GREAT.  But once you get off it (at least for me) you get your old habbits back.  My doc will only give it to me 3 months at a time, so I don't take it every day.  I found that eat a light break fast early in the morning &amp; taking fastin right at 1030 am, I don't have to eat anything else the rest of the day!  Makes you drink lots of water.  Would recommend to anyone!
Overweight	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	5/1/2009 12:34:10 AM	I love this pill.  Since taking it my heartbeat has doubled, but that doesn't bother me as much anymore.  I also had troubles going to sleep at night becuase my blood was pounding through my body.  But every since I started taking it, I can wake up in the morning and not have to have four cups of coffee.  I don't have sleeping troubles anymore because I don't bother going to sleep at night.  For the last week I have been averaging three hours a night of sleep, and yet when I wake up I am fully awake... I feel completely rested.  It also surpresses my appetite.  I have to force myself to eat because I am never hungry, which I love not being hungry.  I also have lost about 10 pounds and I have been on Fastin for a week and half.

This medicine is everything that I could hope for as far as aiding me in losing the weight so far.  I have been on it for 6 days and have lost 7.7 lbs.  My energy level is wonderful, I actually WANT to exercise.  My appetite is under control, I don't feel like I have to eat all the time. I still fight a little bit of the bad habit of snacking and eating things that aren't good for you, but seeing the results I am getting so fast make eating better and trying to get healthier a lot easier.  My confidence level is growing with every pound I drop.  I hope this continues to work this same way.  If it doesn't I will come back on here and let you know.

It has something called Nuphedine not Phentermine so it doesn't work.  Made by Hi Tech Pharmacuticals...don't WASTE your money on this PILL it's like 89.00 and with shipping comes to about 100.00 it's a joke.  It can make you a bit jittery but it doesn't suppress appetite or provide energy.  It's just like you had a too many cups of coffee with the jitters it sucks.

I have been on fastin for 1 month and have lost 29 lbs. I have been eating fresh fruit and vegetable adding up to about 600 calories a day. I also work out, 5 times a week,1 hour a day on my bowflex. My doctor said take fastin for 2 months and then 1 off, then 1 back on. I hoping to lose another 20 lbs. I highly recommend talking to your doctor about fastin before wasting all your money on diet pill scams. I have notice on these reviews the fastin that has worked for people have been prescribed by a doctor. Good luck !!!!!!!!

I took this about 10yrs ago for about a year and I lost over 100lbs.  I have never been able to lose weight by any other method until I tried this one.  I LOVE IT, I had energy I went from sitting on my rear most of the day to exercising daily (my house stayed clean) I was no longer depressed, I felt good about myself and had a positive outlook on life.  I have regained weight over the years.  Today, I'm an overweight depressed divorced mother of one son 6yr old.  I cry all the time because of my weight and the feeling of not being able to do with my son.  I feel like I have let him down since my weight gain, and no it just didn't happen over night but I'm 5'2&quot; and every pound shows on me.  If you are lucky and want to lose weight and able to get this medication DO IT you will NOT regret it.  If I could find a doctor around here that prescribed it I would in a heartbeat, but I can't find one....SO my life will stay as it is right now!!!   GOOD LUCK TO ANY OF YOU THAT WANT TO TRY IT OR HAVE TRIED IT WITH SUCCESS!!!
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/9/2009 4:29:57 PM	I started this medication at the beginning of November 2008 and have lost 30 lbs. to date. I was given a three month prescription and have taken it for a month and then been off of it for a month until I run out. I was still able to keep my portion control during my off months and lost just as much weight as I did the first month on. I work out 3-5 times a week doing a structured weight lifting schedule, abs, and at least 30 minutes of cardio. A year before I decided to take the medicine, I was working out consistently with a trainer and wasn't seeing a lot of weight loss, but did see some inches lost. This has given me a good jump start and I still have about 40 pounds to lose before I hit my healthy weight. The only side effect I had was the dry mouth but drinking water or chewing gum helps immensely with that.

I had upped my exercise routine and adjusted my eating habits even more to try and lose but nothing was working.

I had never weighed as much as I did until after I had her. When I went to my doctor I had asked her about over the counter pills for weight loss. She said if I was worried about my weight she would prescribe me something. So she prescribed fastin. Said that I could take it for a total of 6 months and to make an appt. once a month so she could monitor how I was doing on it and to make sure my blood pressure was alright and that I could continue to take it. Which everyhthing was fine so I continued to take it for a total of 5 months. I lost a total of 50 pounds! I was so amazed with this product. It's the best around and it works.

Overweight	CAROL, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	4	5	Female	55-64	12/1/2008 1:01:38 AM	I started taking this RX in September,15th and today November 30th,I weigh 21 lbs less and feel great, I can actually run up the stairs where before I had to hang on to the railing just to walk upstairs,the only thing is that my doctor won't prescribe anymore, because this drug can be addicting. Will use it again in four months,  have to give the body a break.

I successfully lost 60lbs on the drug but I experienced a horrific car accident that left me bed bound for 3 months. After that along with losing my job the depression was so severe that I've gained 30 lbs back.  Before the accident I had successfully kept my weight steady for over 2 years, after my recovery I decided to return to the &quot;miracle pill&quot; only to find that its much harder this time around.  My body has already become accustomed to eating alot let 1000-1500 calories so my metabolism has unfortunately also adjusted itself accordingly.  With the pill I'm eating about 900 cals a day and if I'm lucky I'll lose 1-2 lbs a week.  So far its been 3 weeks and I've only lost 6 lbs.  I'm extremely frustrated and not quite sure how to feel... disappointment maybe?  Its obvious I relied WAY too much on this little magic pill.

I struggle day after day with having no energy whatsoever, but have read the reviews from people who have taken this drug to help them become better focused and alert.  I am told that I may have narcolepsy(??).  All I want to do is sleep!  I have no motivation to exercise or to do anything.  Sure hopes this helps me and will keep you posted.
Overweight		5	5	5			8/18/2008 1:06:10 PM	this is my 2nd review.  My doctor has me on fastin for a 3 month cycle.  I'm completing my second month and I have lost over 20 lbs.  I'm sure I could lose a lot more if I exercised the way I should, so I've started a new workout plan starting yesterday.  I'm starting to ween off the pill and it's been an easy transition since I've changed my eating habits. I feel great, and my pants sizes just keep dropping. when I started, I wore a size 18 in jeans, I just bought a pair of skinny jeans last week...size 14!  My goal is to be 165 by halloween...I'm 196 right now.  I hope I can do it!

There were two parts to the program, I only took the Fastin and didn't take the second part of it (Pondimin??). My weight loss was incredible and I have kept most of it off for 7 years now.  It's too bad Fastin was discontinued.  I think it was the Pondimin, not the Fastin, that was the real gremlin.I understand it will be available again in a year or two.  It is the best diet aid ever.

A few years ago I took phentermine 37.5 and that gave me awsome energy and just made me feel wondrful plus I had lost 30 pounds in 2 months Im going to go back to that, fastin and phentermine are not the same thing.

Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/23/2008 1:35:34 PM	this is the best drug ever invented!!  i gained over 30 pounds because i was taking prednisone for my rheumatiod arthritis so my doctor allowed me try this.  it interacts with my other medicines a little and can make me feel dizzy and get blurred vision at times, but it really does help control your hunger and give you lots of energy!!

Overweight	lady, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/10/2008 11:53:16 AM	I've lost 24 pounds in 3 1/2 weeks.  It truly gives me more energy and enthusiasm, plus my back and legs feel much better, thus minimizing my Arthritis.  I have 40 pounds more to lose, and would LOVE to be able to keep taking Fastin, but according to what I've read on this website, I'll likely have to stop taking it pretty soon.  It works GREAT for me!  (I started taking it on April 14th--it's now May 10th).

Overweight	Pretty_Girl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/29/2008 3:28:32 PM	I gained 30 pounds after having a baby and taking the depo shot.  I tried exercising and fad diets but nothing worked.  I have been taking phentermine for 4 weeks now and lost 15 pounds.  I must admit that the first three weeks; I was taking the med with breakfast instead of 1 hour before.  Plus, I only have time to workout three times a week at the most, but I am very excited about the way I feel and the way I look.  15 more pounds to go!!!

I am not sure what the dosage is, but it says 345 mg total.  Is this the 37.5mg pill?  Te bottle also says I should take 1-2 in the morning and 1 after lunch, but I thought I was only supposed to take 1 a day?
