Schizophrenia	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	9/8/2012 2:12:40 PM	I have been taking Fanapt for a week and half.  The side effects at first were horrible; dizziness, headache, fatigue, dry eyes and mouth, congestion, insomnia, etc.  I was switching from Latuda to the Fanapt and there was a little while when I was first on it that my symptoms came back (hallucinations and delusions mostly).  Now I'm to the point where I could handle the side effects I still have (dry eyes, mouth, congestion) except that my legs keep swelling pretty big.  I'm using Flonase for the congestion, which really helps.  My symptoms are under control but I have a feeling that when I see my psychiatrist they will want me to switch to something else.

I am asking my doc to take me off of it.  It hasn't helped with my depression.  What's worse is that I've developed urinary incontinence which isn't listed in the side effects; however, when I researched it further, I learned it does cause incontinence in 10% of all cases.  I also am having moderate memory loss.  Maybe it will work for someone else, but it hasn't worked for me.

I am not seeing any benefits with this drug. I still see things and people (I call Gremlins) but mostly at night, so I do not go out at night which limits me from some family and friends outings.
Other	Appalachian Girl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/26/2012 9:41:24 PM	I am using a trial pack to see if this med will help with the treatment of bi-polar disorder; and it is probably a little early to tell as far as the ratings go. Day 1 (1mg): I was light headed, dizzy, my heart pounded out of my chest and I had shortness of breath; I kept having to take frequent deep breaths as though to catch up.  Day 2 (2mg): I experienced all of the above x2, plus I woke up disoriented, staggering somewhat, my whole body felt like lead, very fatigued,I couldn't see well, because my eyes felt like they were swelled or like I could not open them all the way. I was very fatigued my friends said I looked &quot;flushed.&quot; Day 3 (4mg): I took the morning dosage and felt like I was carrying lead shoes, had a large lead anvil setting on my chest, I literally felt like I was struggling to breathe. I thought I was going to die.  I have tried to drink caffiene throughout this trial..which has helped some, but each day I feel like I am pushing the button.  I am going to contact my dr about the dosage in the am. For the most part, I think I did feel better mentally-more calm and evened-out, if I didn't have the anxiety of thinking I was going to die! It is so frustrating finding the right &quot;cocktail&quot; of drugs that suites one's needs. I am keeping my fingers crossed.

Am taking 4mg twice a day and it really has helped me in the long run. Have been on it for almost two years. The down side is the expense. I am going off it as my copay for it is 230$ a month. The other thing is lack of sex drive.. poor results there. Have had blurred vision with it and very dry mouth.
Additional Medications to Treat Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	10/12/2011 4:44:02 PM	I was taking this medication for bipolar disorder.  While taking the titration pack, I couldn't take anything over 2mg. At 2mg on the second day I was awake for 38 hours.  I went back to 1mg.  At this dosage my legs became twitchy, my nose became congested and diahrrea became an issue during the day.  At night I had to sleep sitting up in a recliner due to extreme acid reflux. This medication wasn't for me.

The headache has went away, though Im still somewhat stuffy like I said, Its NOT bad. I LOVE that this medicine doesnt make me pass out, like some other meds have...or made me super jittery....I was very sleepy at first but then it &quot;evened&quot; out. I am still having some paranoia...but Its only the end of the first week and Im only on 2mg. Hope this was helpful, I know what its like to search for good meds!! Good luck to you!

When I first started taking it, I got very dizzy often, but that wore off. Soon afterwards, my doctor increased my dose. When the side effects abated, he increased it again, and then again. The worst side effects wear off after a little while each time. I have a dry mouth and nasal congestion still, but I'm very pleased with the results. Before I started FanApt, my husband thought I needed hospitalization. I continue to improve with each dosage increase, and I'm pleased with my ability to sleep, my activity level, and my improved mood.

I have not tolerated many other meds due to extreme side effects. Finished titration pack up to 6mg wth some side effects of dizziness and having alot of difficulty sleeping. Increased dose of 10mg caused increased anxiety and agitation,thus went back down to 6mg. Mania is controlled however and I'm happy with that. Taking other meds for sleep but then I feel drugged all day. Also still depressed. Hope I find the right combination of meds to treat all my symptoms of bipolar disorder.

My Mom was diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder a long time ago and has been on a lot of different meds. She's older now, so most don't work as well. This was is great, not hearing voices, has energy, can make decisions and it's easier for her to walk. She was on Haldol before (among other meds) and had all kinds of problems. The most pressing was she had trouble moving. Now, she's getting stronger every day and doesn't sleep as much.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/23/2010 5:26:45 AM	I started my first dose @2mg at night.  Did not help much with sleep.  I also take 4mg of xanax @ night.  Second dose was 4mg at night. Again not much sleep. Third dose was 6mg at night, same situation regarding sleep.  The following afternoon I was running errands and happened to be at the chechout at a local supermarket.  I had been there for what seemed forever, I get very impatient. I started not to feel well.  The feeling got worse and I ended up fainting. I ended up with quite a bump on the back of my head and general body aches from the awkward position I fell in. Needless to say I stopped taking this medication after 3 doses.

Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/21/2010 9:04:22 PM	I am taking this med for symptoms of schizo-affective disorder.  I transitioned off of 45 mg of Zyprexa onto 12 mg of Fanapt per day.  At first I was way over medicated and felt sluggish and out of it for a couple of weeks.  But as I went down on the dosage of Zyprexa (which over 7 years had caused about 100 lbs of weight gain) I felt that my hallucinations and racing thoughts were under control on just the Fanapt.  I like taking the Fanapt as my constant hunger has disappeared.  I have lost over 30 lbs. in the 10 weeks I have been taking Fanapt.  I would highly recommend this medication as a replacement for Zyprexa - all the positive control of Zyprexa without the hunger!

My parents say my eyes look like I haven't slept for days,and I do hurt family members feelings with things I say while on this drug, my mom tried me on half a pill and I still feel bad, like I can't wake up. I am on 8 mg.pill.  My mom has taken away my meds and wants to see how I do  over the weekend until I can talk to my Doctor. I do not reccommed this Drug at all!

The effect this medication has had on my life has been amazing! Previously I was on high doses of two other drugs leaving me apathetic and not caring. Three weeks in and I am off one drug and cut way back on the second and I am alive again! As drugs wore off I have had to really take responsibility for my action in the past, most of which I was unaware of. Side effects and amens aside this drug is well worth taking!

Schizophrenia	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	4/25/2010 5:27:55 PM	Don't take this drug unless you hvae plenty of muscle relaxers and can sit or lay down all day. This medicine has just turned me into according to my family when they see me, it looks like you are drunk. This medicine has totally messed with my sleep cycle in thatI am awake during the night and day time with very little sleep. If your body is sensitive to EPS (extrapyramidal syndrome) then please do not take this drug, it only makes it worse. And as for the whole bit about about being able to think clearer, don't believe it, it just made me more confused and I also feel very slow with my speech and verbal responses.
