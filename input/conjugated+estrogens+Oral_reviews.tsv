After 6 weeks, I began having severe bumps &amp; pimples from Rosacea.  I took this level for 6 months then I switched to .3  On this lower dosage, my &quot;change of life&quot; symptoms were only somewhat relieved, the Rosacea acne improved to a moderate status, however the hair on my head is now rather thin.  Is my severe Rosacea &amp; hair thinning from natural aging or a medication side effect?  I went to my doctor yesterday and I am going to try a different medication.

I toughed it out for eight months, but finally started the prempro and I could'nt be more pleased. So far almost all the symptoms are gone, this in just the first month. Thankful--I now feel like my old self.

I was not informed of how hard it would be to stop using premarin.  The hot flashes, night sweats and gloom and doom thoughts returned, and were horrible.  If I had known that I would have opted for the Phyto-estrogen cream.  It is natural and much easier to ease off of.  Be warned Premarin has dire effects on the body.
