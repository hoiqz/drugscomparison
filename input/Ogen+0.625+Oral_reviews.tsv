Long after menopause, I started having dreanching night sweats. My doctor prescribed this tiny amount of ogen -Instantly the night sweats disappeared. Since I see no difference at all between generic &amp; name brand, I take the generic. Great benifits, no side effects and inexpencive.

Other generics caused gastrointestinal problems.  Ogen is a wonderful drug which caused me no side effects; in fact, it helped my elevated blood pressure.

I also had the uterus removed along with the ovaries and this medication has been wonderful.  I was told that this medication was no longer being made and I wonder why, and also what can I take that is the equivalent.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/2/2010 3:00:02 PM	I have been on this medication for over 25 years after a complete historectomy with no complications. I have tried the generic several times and always have side effects- sleeplessness, forgetfullness, edgy, etc. I just want to know why Ogen was discontinued? Anybody know?
Other	MLB, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/9/2010 8:46:09 PM	NO NO don't discontinue OGEN!! After  a hellatious search for a med for low estrogen (primary interest-cognitive symptoms)came upon Ogen. The only one that worked for me. Higher dose (1.25) did not result in high serum estrogen (metabolizes fast). I could work, remember, feel positive and focus. I was saved! AND then Ogen was discontinued. I am truely lost, the generic...every side effect and some I never had before. AND wrong dosage and absorption. LOST!! Going to compound pharmacy and hope.

I had absolutely &quot;NO&quot; side effects with it.  Whereas with Premarin I had weight gain, water retention, &quot;VERY&quot; tender/sore breasts, mood swings, etc.  I am not trying the 0.325 oral of premarin to see if it will subside the side effects.  Not sure why the company has discontinued making ogen, not too pleased with that.

The hot flashes went away and I have not been awakened in the night due to night sweats. My weight gain came before I went on the Medication, but it hasn't come off since I started on the medication.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	8/6/2009 12:27:30 AM	I was prescribed Ogen 0.625mg for relief of hot flashes and sleep disturbance. I don't know how long it is supposed to take for improvement of symptoms, but I have been taking it for 1 1/2 weeks with no relief. I will probably discontinue use due to nausea side effect.
