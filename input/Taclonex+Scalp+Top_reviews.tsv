Psoriasis of Scalp	cfri, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	9/1/2011 3:05:27 PM	My dr gave me a sample bottle to use and it worked after the first treatment.  When I got the Rx filled, it didn't seem to be as effective, but it still worked.  I've been using it for almost 2 years.  It is greasy so don't overapply, but I only have to shampoo 2xs to wash it out.  It may not be as effective as when I first started using it, but now I only have to apply it once every couple of weeks at most.  Better than anything else I've tried.
Psoriasis of Scalp	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	8/3/2011 3:14:28 PM	I have horrendous scalp psoriasis.  This medicine has been extremely effective - the only problem is if I run out before my 30 day renewal period, the psoriasis comes back with a vengeance.  I highly recommmend Talclonex to anyone suffering from scalp psoriasis.
Psoriasis of Scalp	W, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/14/2011 6:31:33 AM	 Only used once due to the oil slick experience. I washed my hair with  shampoo &amp; with Dawn 6x and still had traces of oily hair!  Worst part...I spent an extra hour on washing the greasy stuff out of my hair which made me late for work. Who has time for this ordeal? Not me!!!!
Psoriasis of Scalp	joe, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	4	Male	35-44	4/19/2011 2:43:21 PM	My doc changed my scalp med from clobetasol solution to taclonex scalp.  It works in about a week.  It does do it job.  However, it is very greasy and difficult to apply.   I tried applying small amounts at a time but soon my entire hair was also covered in medication.  Trying to wash the medicine off my hair the next morning took several rinses which could be painful to someone with severe psoriasis.  However, again, it does work.

She put me on taclonex and sulfa top and i can not believe how great this has worked for me in one week.                 John

I had tried clobex for 2 months with little or no improvement.  It is 'greasy' but if you wash your hair a couple times it is no worse than a heavy conditioner.

Psoriasis of Scalp	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	5/3/2010 11:28:32 AM	I love how quickly the spots on my scalp went away when using this product. i have only recently been diagnosed with skin problems, including psoriasis, and i dont feel like i need to try out any other psoriasis medication. Did not like the texture of the solution though, its thick, slimy a little stinky but it works amazingly well and quick.

Psoriasis of Scalp	BigG, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	10/26/2009 12:55:03 AM	I have been suffering with a progressively aggressive scalp psoriasis for the past 10 years.  I've been prescribed Fluoccinonide, Dovonex, Protopic.  Taclonex scalp (is not the same as Dovonex) started relieving my symptoms after the first night.  No more exfoliating with a fine tooth comb, no more redness, mo more scaling, no more hair falling out.  Patches at my hairline and forehead now have the chance to heal. They are healing a little dark, due to the numerous times that they have flared up, but they will lighten up in time. Taclonex applies easily and you don't need to soak the affected area...it's not butter.  It is expensive, but there are $50 pharmacist rebates available.  Be patient, it worked so well for me, it easily offsets the cost of all the other medications I spent money on.

Psoriasis of Scalp	happynsweet77, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	1/28/2009 1:42:34 PM	In my dermotologist's words - &quot;You're a responder&quot;.  After 1 day, itching stopped.  After 2 days, no more flakes on my clothes.  After 1 week, no scales on my scalp.Makes my hair really greasy too, and not the easiest to apply on the bottom of the head, but I'll take that for not having to scratch my head anymore.
