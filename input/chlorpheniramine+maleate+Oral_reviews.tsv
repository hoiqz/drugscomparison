Runny Nose	Sneezy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/7/2012 12:47:08 AM	I have been suffering from hay fever for around 23 years.  I have tried many medications and this is the ONLY one that works for me.  The others either don't work at all or have some very unpleasant side effects that I can't handle.  I was on allergy shots for a while, but they did not seem to give good results either and my allergist recommended just using the medication.  I do get occasional drowsiness but it passes.  I would rather deal with the  temporary drowsiness than suffer with the allergy symptoms which would literally drive me crazy otherwise.  Without the medication I get sinus headaches, sore throats, sneezing, watery itchy eyes and ears and my tongue and throat will even get itchy when it is really bad.  Spring is the worst for me because I am allergic to the budding trees and the cottonwood from the cottonwood trees.  I take the chlorpheniramine maleate along with pseudephedrine (decongestant).  In the spring when my symptoms are the worst I do have to double up on the dosage of the chlorpheniramine maleate (2 pills every 12 hours instead of 1 pill every 12 hours) in order for it to be effective, but I do not double the pseudephedrine (sudafed). The only side effect that I am aware of is a lot of constipation so I have to take LOTS of fiber.  I take  the twelve hour dosage two times a day, in other words all day every day along with a twelve hour dose of generic sudafed (round the clock as well).  I don't know how I would survive without this medicine.

Runny Nose	Jim, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		2/16/2012 9:52:36 AM	This is a follow up review to my review 3 years ago. I am 78 now and have been taking this antihistamine to control my debilitating runny nose for over 6 years now. I find that I need to increase the dosage to 8mg every 3-5 hours to control the allergy(s) to which I am reacting. I also found that my pharmacist (Kroger) can order chlorpheniramine maleate in 1,000 quantity bottles for $7.59 which makes the drug cost less than a penny each. This is the only cost effective effective treatment I have found after consulting with several ENT specialist MDs who all suggest continuing its use as needed. It's a sanity saver.

Runny Nose	Sunshine, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	12/26/2009 2:00:00 PM	I have been taking this med for rampant chronic sinisitis &amp; weather sensitivity since I was 25 (I'm now 66 and have moved from my home of 30 yrs. and evidently have less allergies to surroundings to plantings in this area)--1st by Rx--then by mail to Rugby (who only sells now to manufacturers, then by special order through Walgreens pharmacies. Now 1 take 4/day and am doing great--unless there's a weather front coming in--then I take 2 with a mild decongestant and maybe a tylenol, and I'm fine again.  I've had absolutely no problems and my doctors have always approved.
Other	Lilium, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	13-18	11/28/2009 6:12:07 AM	I suffer from insomnia and so my doctor prescribed some of these antihistamine pills for me. It works everytime to effectively make me fall asleep fast and I haven't experienced much side effects the next day except for drowsiness.

Drug stopped, symptoms gone.

Runny Nose	Jim in Atlanta, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		7/20/2009 8:28:50 AM	I am a 75 year old male in generally good health and have been taking this drug for over 3 years. I have developed an allergic reaction to a broad variety of environmental conditions and/or perhaps the drug interaction of several other drugs I take for high blood pressure, acid reflux and enlarged prostate. Chlorpheniramine Melate is the active ingredient in other more expensive medications recommended for persons with these symptoms and with elevated blood pressure. I may be developing a tolerance for the drug because the recommended dosage is not fully effective. 4 Mg every 3-4 hours except when sleeping is effective.  I sometimes experience dry mouth when awakening.  It does not make me drowsy or hyperactive as some other antihistamine type products do. Without treatment my runny nose sneezing become debilitating so I am grateful for an inexpensive ($3 per 100) drug that works for me which I expect to be taking indefinitely. Other topical and ingested (and expensive) medications tried by my allergist have not been as effective and some have had very undesirable side effects.
Hives	jmb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/10/2009 8:23:26 AM	I have chronic hives which is assumed to be allergic reaction, but cannot be tied directly to a specific food or item, except I am &quot;highly sensitive&quot; to getting hives if I take aspirin or ibuprofen, mint, FDC yellow #5 and coated pills, so I avoid those altogether.  However, I often can feel myself getting hives (by itching in my ears or slight swelling in my lips or the appearance of a few hives) even while avoiding these items.  If I immediately take 4 or 8 mg of chlorpheniramine maleate, the progression of the hives is stopped about 99% of the time.  I am also approved by my physician to take 12 mg, if needed, in this situation.   Benadryl and Zyrtec do not work for me in stopping the progression of the hives, and I end up in the ER with difficulty breathing.  So this medication is very important for me to always have on hand and carry with me.  An added bonus is that it is very inexpensive if you purchase the generic -- 100 4 mg tablets for less than $4.  The generic is also not a coated pill, which is often the case with brand name versions of this drug, especially the time-release.  I do not purchase the time-released version.
Stuffy Nose	Wow, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/25/2009 12:56:37 PM	Chlorpheniramine Maleate worked very fast and was more effective then the other allergy medicines and prescriptions that I have tried and I have not noticed any side effects.I take a small dosage 4mg twice a day and I do not get tired or hyper. In fact, I feel like I have not taken anything at all. I no longer have the runny nose then stuffy nose problem and I do not have to blow my nose hardly at all.I also noticed that I didn't have that extremly dry mouth feeling.My local drug store pointed out Chlorpeniramine Maleate to me and I thought for $3.00/100 pills I could give it a try. After all I usually spend hundred of dollars on new and improved allergy meds. Personnally, I think the side effects are sometimes worst then the cause. Headache, dry feeling, sleeplessness or tired feeling verses a stuffy and runny nose, blowing and sneezing. Anyway, I assumed anything that cost $3.00 wouldn't work since most allergy meds are sold for $20-$40 a package. Wrong, It has become my main allergy medicine.Give it a try! Don't forget to heck out the warnings....
Runny Nose	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	3/8/2009 6:00:50 PM	It works very well for post nasal drip.  I have found it is actually the only medication that truly works for me while sleeping at night.  
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	11/25/2008 8:07:53 PM	I have used this drug for over 50 years.  It works quickly, but you really need at least 5mg to work.  I use on 4mg tab and sometimes break another one in either quarters or havlves to use.
