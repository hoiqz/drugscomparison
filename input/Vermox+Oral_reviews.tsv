Pinworm Infection	OCD Mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	12/12/2011 5:01:26 PM	My daughter was infected with pinworms and i got them from her.  She took 2 doses of Vermox and they were immediately gone.  I have now taken 8 doses in 3 weeks and I still have them.  I have not been reinfected they have just not gone away.  My doctor is baffled.
Pinworm Infection		1	1	1			4/8/2011 2:40:48 AM	You all need to try to treat these worms with herbs such as garlic, goldenseal, barberry or anise. There are a few more that might work also including black walnut. Just do a little research, you will be surprised instead of turning to drugs that harm you and don't really work!!!

I have washed the linens and towels twice weekly in hot water. Washed the bathroom rugs weekly, and washed the pj's in hot water. We all still have pinworms. I am especially infested. The doctor will not prescribe any additional since she is afraid of liver damage.

Whole family took the 2 doses 2 weeks apart.  Washed sheets and jammies daily during this time.  Seems to have worked. Mild stomach aches with 6 year old, though. Kids didn't like the taste of the tablet so we held their nose while they chewed it.
