Cancer of the Ovary	mom2cozmoe, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	9/25/2012 1:31:51 PM	Have been fighting Ovarian Cancer for 3 years.  Have lymph node involvement since 2010.  Flare up after only 2 months post 6 infusions of carboplatin/taxol.  Only had two treatments in 2 months because of the neutrapenia.  This is my third round of chemo and all three have cause different side effects.  Hoping this works but the nausea all the time is almost too much.  Have lost 20 pounds since August 1st.   The doctor says I may be on Gemzar for the rest of my life.

Worked great but too hard on my platelets. Took a 3 month break, have progression but can't go back onto this regimen. Tolerated it very well, no problems other than the platelet count. No Neulasta shots given.

The first time I experienced severe headache and nausea related to the head pain.  I was not given anything to boost my white cell production, so they could see how I would react. My white cell count dropped so low that I was hospitalized for 3 days. It took 4 weeks for my neutrophil absolute count to get above 1.5 to be able to get the 2nd dose.  The 2 dose was given with a Neulasta injection immediately following the infusion.  I started with a headache within 24 hour.  The pain included my eyes, bones of my face, my head and neck,  A nurse on my care team told me it sounds like a migraine.  It lasted, non stop for 5 days.  Today I am pain and symptom free. It is 6 days since my treatment.  It is too soon to know if it is working or if these symptoms will continue.  I intend to try it for 3 months before deciding if it is worth the pain.  My plan of treatment is to receive Gemzar every other week, since I reacted too severely to receive it 3 weeks in a row, then one week off as originally planned.

After treatments she has very bad sob, weak, panic from no air.Has taken antibiotics and prednizone for the breathing to no avail so I think she is reacting to the gemzar in a negative manner.

He does not get any side effects and is tolerating it very well so far.  He has been on several chemo drugs and I hope this will get the cancer under control.

Have has no nausea or side effects except for occassional low white or red blood counts. I get one shot and am ready to go next time.I take G. for 3 weeks on &amp; 1 week off. Get a CT scan every 3 months; also my CA19-9 level has came way down and I feel so much better than before starting chemo. Have even gained back my weight but appetite is good so I'm not ready to diet yet. Tumor was too close to celiac artery for surgery so don't know what's down the road as far as surgery goes. Energy level isn't quite as high as it used to be but it's pretty good. I give all the glory to God and the prayers on my behalf, that Gemzar has given me another year of life. My oncologist thought I was dying a year ago, but he's very caring and knowledgeable.

Procrit helps with severe fatigue, weight loss and low blood count.  Vision is always fuzzy and off. serious lung issues, easily catch pneumonia.light exercise and deep breathing helps. Always floss and brush ur teeth, hard on ur enamel.  No dental work during trmt.  Eat well.
Other	Gloria, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female		11/12/2008 12:19:35 AM	I have had Non-Hodgkins's Lymphoma for six years and have relapsed three times during this time.  Gemzar was started in April, 2008 to treat the recurring NHL which was very aggressive.  I have had three CAT Scans during this time and the NHL has significantly impproved.  I have had low blood counts though during all these months and treatment.  I have fatigue which bothers me the most, probably because of my low blood counts.  I have another CT Scan scheduled tomorrow - 11/12/08 and hope I am in remission again and can stop the chemo.  I also get Retuxan once a month along with the Gemzar
