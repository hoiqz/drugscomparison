It worked very well, but after 5 months (60 mg dosage), hands started to swell and I've had a horrible rash.  Have taken none for 5 days now and still have itchy rash.  Did have very tired muscles and severe cramping with this drug,too.  Wish the side effects weren't so bad.

High Blood Pressure	Sara1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/21/2010 1:35:36 PM	after having preeclampsea, my BP's were still elevated and am on beta blocker therapy. I still have high BP's and Im only in my 30's. When I get bp readings over 170's/100's I call my doctor &quot;1st and formost&quot; to advise of the situation and take my procardia with drops of about 20 points S/D within about 20 mins. As instructed, may increase with an additional dose of 30mg if still over 150/100. S/E include headache, and gerneralized fatigue ( like I'm zoning out.) Hypotension occures for about 20min with the increased dose very infrequently. I will usualy have a small sip or two of chicken broth for a small dose of sodium if that occurs.  All in all, for the 2 to 3 times a year this happens Niphedipine (Procardia) has worked for me and I am very happy this medication is avalible for use.

High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	65-74	12/12/2009 11:05:07 AM	I have taken this drug for a little less than 1 month.  The day I took the first pill, 60mg, my blood pressure was within the low normal range.  However, the ankle and lower leg swelling was not acceptable.  Also, more frequent and lengthy urination. The drug also caused headaches. I have stopped taking the medication and am starting a daily exercise program.
High Blood Pressure	mslydia1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	12/3/2009 1:31:17 PM	This drug started out as being a wonderful drug.  It kept my blood pressure very low. I have been taking this drug for over 15 years.  I was borderline hypertensive and now with hindsight, I should have never let a doctor talk me into going on meds.  He never indicated diet and exercise. Nevertheless, even though the drug is keeping my blood pressure down, I am now developing chest pains, and difficulty breathing if I am even hours late taking the drug.  I dont feel like its helping my cardio problems at all, but it helps my blood pressure.  Does that make sense? The longer you take it, you develop other problems.
High Blood Pressure	renonevada, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/11/2009 4:34:44 PM	I have been on this medication for 11 years, no problems including taking it during pregnancy. I have a family history of high blood pressure, and was sad but not surprised to start taking this at 30. It still works. I can say that I have told my doc in recent years that I have lowered libido, and she told me it could be due to this drug, but she didn't offer any other remedies either. It may be helpful to hear that in case you have a similar experience.

I feel bad all the time and it is hard to function at work...I will most likely have to try something different.

Other	Mrs.Dee, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	65-74	3/9/2009 2:27:10 PM	Took this medication for over 5 yrs. to treat Raynauds and had nothing but problems, especially swelling.  Started out just hands and feel and got so bad that is was a total body problem.  Had to take increasing doses of diuretics and potassium.  I needed to increase the dose, but couldn't handle the fluid problem.  Have just been put on Norvasc and am hoping that this will work, although I feel that there is still some swelling.  My MD had started me on a very low dose and will increase it slowly, but it has to help my Raynauds w/o the swelling!

Another drug I was taking caused me to have high count of enzymes in my liver. My doctor was about to send me to a specialist until my Fetal Maternal Medicine Dr prescribed this. It is much better tolerated for my organs and my pressure is regulated with 1 pill, 60 mg a day instead of the 500 mg, 3 times a day of Aldomet I was taking. I did experience headaches for the first 3 days, but after that, every thing has been great. My pressure went from 158/101 to 127/70 within 1 week's time!
