Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	1/4/2011 5:56:34 PM	I have had this medication four times in the last year and 1/2 all with great success after one dose. One of the times took about 60 seconds to bring my heart rate down. Then there was an awful pressure that lasted about 3 minutes and I had a hard time to catch my breathe. The other three times took less than 20 seconds for my heart rate to return to a normal state and the pressure and shortness of breathe lasted about 90 seconds. I have a love/hate relationship with this drug. Love how it works but hate the feeling that goes with it. If need be I will gladly use this drug again until I have an ablation done.

Husband took me to the ER. BPM's were over 200. And, I am 29 weeks pregnant. When they gave me the Adenosine in my IV, it was a matter of seconds. You felt a funny feeling through your body for about 15 seconds. Other than that, it definitely worked for me!! 
Having a Rapid Heart Action - Supraventricular Tachycardia	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	2/6/2010 12:05:10 AM	I received this drug IV in an ER dept when I noted to have a very high, pounding heartrate. My pulse when I got to the ER dept was 158bpm and it was causing me to have chest pressure, dizziness, and short of breath. I had never experienced this before and I am a healthy 30 year old female. When the vasovagal maneuvers didn't work they had to give me 3 doses of Adensoine and it gave me the worst chest pain/tightness, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. Unfortunately, it only dropped my heartrate to 80bpm for only 2 minutes and it shot back up again. I had to have cardioversion and that was also unpleasant but I was asleep and don't really remember it all. I still haven't found out why my heartrate was so high and I certainly hope I never have to experience it again.

Heart was 160 beats per minute. Worked very quickly less than 10 seconds rhythm fell to 100 bpm. It felt as if I was in an elevator going down fast. I did not have any reactions afterwards.

Other	Adenosine Nuclear Stress Test, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	4/16/2009 6:58:46 AM	I had to havea Adenosine Nuclear Stress Test for part of a pre admission testing for back surgery, even though I have no history or family history of heart problems. As soon as the drug was injected I felt as though fire was running through my veins, I felt as though I was about to die, then my head started trobbing, my left ear felt like it was bleeding &amp; was so naseus &amp; thought for sure I'd throw up but then stopped the injection early as they stated they had what they needed for the test.I plan on contacting my family doctor today &amp; I'll wil never take this test again.
