It has kept me from getting any more UTI, however I have had a persistent Cough and fast heart beat for 15 months, I have been sent to 8 doctors, all treated me for either asthma, or Acid Reflux. Till I read the drug Store instructions. Here all those symptons show up, including the cough and fast heart beat. I hope my doctor has another way to prevent UTI in me, this coughing is sending me to my heart surgeon.

She has trouble swallowing a pill or capsule.  I open the capsule and sprinkle it in small amount of applesauce. It cleared up her infection. She took it for ten days.  She now has another uti and is taking it again.  This is her second day on the med. I did not notice any side effects when she was on it before.  Hopefully there won't be any this time.  Mother and caregiver.

Very important to take this medication WITH FOOD, whether you are hungry or not.  Drink plenty of fluids.  Read directions. Although I noticed improvement after first pill, I did have a headache but it was quickly resolved with other medication.  I am very pleased with quick resolution of UTI symptoms.

The only side effect was a lot of sweating at bed time and a slight head ache. I would take it again if recommended. I am also a medical professional.

After the 7th day I went back to have a urine test to make sure the infection was gone.  However, it was not.   So they told me to take it again twice a day for seven more days.  But the infection is still not gone.  I will say that while I was on the medication it did make me feel better, it just didn't get rid of the infection.

The first day after taking it, I felt like I lost 10lbs...It took away my bloated feeling completely. I will say that it has made me EXTREMELY dizzy and unable to concentrate...I have caught myself making really bad spelling errors while on this medication. Other than those problems, I am ok so far..I will update if anything changes. Oh yeah...I have a little bit of acid reflux also.
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	9/11/2008 2:03:15 AM	This was an absolute help for my issue - constant UTIs.  After using this as a prevention drug (taken after intercourse, due to it causing UTIs), I have seen an extreme decrease in UTI occurrence.  Im sooo happy Ive begun using this drug as a treatment, as having a UTI about every three to four weeks was painful - not to mention not good for my health.  The only issue is having to eat when you use it, and if you dont it will give you a rough stomach ache

Coli Bacteria	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	11/2/2007 10:36:26 AM	I did not like the four times a day dosage as it was hard to take with food that many times a day.  I got intestinal gas and my skin was sore after the fifth day over my belly.  Felt tired the first couple of days and really do not think it completely cured the infection.
