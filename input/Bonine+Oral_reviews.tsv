Sensation of Spinning or Whirling	Lorzgld12, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/2/2011 10:07:40 AM	In the morning I have trouble waking up with dizziness, nausea, and unstable walking. This medicine took care of all of these symptoms so far. However, I do feel the dried up feeling associated with antihistamines.

It helps me get threw my work day!  I hate the way the Bonine chewable taste, I almost gag on it, I wish the store I work at sold the ones that you can swallow instead, like Dramamine.  But its cheaper and causes less drowsiness.

No dry mouth. No drowsiness. It is safe to use with barometric concerns and it lasts all day. I take it the evening before the dive, and again in the morning before boarding the boat.

Bonine worked great for me!  Before using Bonine I had problems with all types of motion. No more.

My symptoms occur if I consume too much caffeine, usually coffee.  This drug is effective on one dose.  Now that I am 60 yr old, I use the children's chewable.
Motion Sickness	Danny P, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/2/2009 9:07:42 AM	I use it as an anti-nauseal when deep sea fishing.  It is easily available at the local pharmacy in both adult and child dosages.  I've given the children's dissolvable to my 10 year old who doesn't even like the taste of Flintstones vitamins, and it works for him as well.  He is very prone to motion sickness; car, plane, boat; bonine does the trick for him.  Most of my extended family and friends use it when on the ocean.  I used it in 7-8 foot seas in the Sea of Japan, and the only non-sailors not sick were the two of us on bonine.

At first it worked on the ship but 1 day after my return I developed vertigo and had to go to the emergency room. Now it's 4 days later and I still feel lightheaded and dizzy. The doctor said it was the bonine. I took 4 pills in 7 days. That was way too much.

Sensation of Spinning or Whirling	spike, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	1/27/2008 9:23:17 AM	I have been taking this for a viral inner ear infection which is causing bouts of vertigo.  I find the pill, taken as directed knocks me out cold, and if taken before bed cause me to wake very early not feeling well.  Half a pill seems to help to some degree, less tiredness, but still some nausea
