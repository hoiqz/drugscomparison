Full body hives swollen eye lids and lips.. doctors did not suspect amarly since i had been on it for one year with no problems.  Hives last 3 1/2 months.  When I finally stopped taking the Amarly on my own the hives were total gone within 76 hours.  Terrible experience!

Over time the Byetta made me so nauseous I asked to switch; they changed me to Actos and I gained 30 lbs. in 3 months.  Then I learned that can be common in some patients.  On Amaryl/Glimepiride for about 6 months &amp; I began to lose the Actos fat right away.  Got injured in a horse accident &amp; while in hospital they increased my Amaryl dose from 3 to 4 mg. in the AM.  Oddly once I got home my fasting blood sugar in the AM was higher than it was before they upped the dosage.  Now that I'm feeling stronger &amp; getting more exercise it is really working for me again &amp; steady weight loss is continuing.  So it surprised me to see so many comments about it causing weight GAIN.  I DO have occasional symptoms of LOW blood sugar on Amaryl which seems weird because my problem has be hyPERglycemia.  But symptoms are not so severe as to cause distress/concern - just have a little sugar if it gets too low.  I've had readings around 70 on occasion and that never happened on Byetta or Actos.

When the hives started in I discontinued. Had no effect whatsoever on my blood sugars. Disappointing. Hope it works for you.

So far it is great, but like everyone else, my sugar drops FAST!  I will have to eat on schedule and see how that does, as I usually just eat when hungry.  I can see why you have weight gain.  You have to eat all the time. My sugars were 200+, but now they are around 130.  So far, I have not gained anything, but I am walking around 2.5 miles a day.  Hopefully with a schedule and walking this pill will be what works!

I had taken Micronaise first and it dropped sugar to 40 and had a hard time bringing it back up. I have not had any side affects since being on it for 2 weeks now. sugars have dropped to 120in the am and 159 in the eve.I am pleased so far. waiting to go for A1c monday afternoon. Last one was 9.2 hoping it has dropped alot.I was the last to get it in my family and I am the last one living. My father and siblings all died from diabetes. I just lost my last brother last week from it.So far this is the only thing I have to take. Watching my diet and walking every day.lost 30 lbs in the last 2 months from sugars being high. I feel gr8 for the first time in a year.Bonnie

My sugars have improved and go low in the afternoon I'm on 1/2 of 1 mg 2x's a day. I'm usually 116 in the am and 70's 90 in the afternoon and 120-130's evening. Not happen with the weight gain and I'm eating the same way I have been. 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	frustrated51, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Male	45-54	3/14/2010 10:15:43 PM	Started on 2 mg / day about 2 to 3 weeks ago and had to adjust down to 1 mg due to MANY hypo's. a1c is down from 8.2 to 6.6 over the last two months since starting in late December originally on glipizide for glucose control. Have discovered that once taken in the morning WITH food as instructed, pancreas goes into 'make insulin like crazy and pump into system irregardless mode' of constant carb intake (or not). Seems I BETTER NOT slowdown on carbs AT ALL (as opposed to trying to LOWER carbs..I HAVE TO keep them coming in or i'll end up with a hypo)! This means constant glucose test test test much more than doc prescribed of 4 times a day into upwards of 6 and that taxes the testing supplies wayyyyyyyy too much. Although having 'better' results because of knowing what to expect with glimeperide as opposed to glipizide XL which hits like a nuke but waits and waits until it hits, I would love suggestions and help finding a glucose control med that doesn't have to be monitored THIS MUCH so I don't go hypo so easily.  I thought the idea is to REDUCE carb and sugar intake NOT have to drink sugary juices and the like throughout the day and hit the glucose tablets twice to three times a day when the meter drops near or just below 70 almost on a regular basis seems around mid afternoon to early eve depleting the testing supplies wayyy too rapidly to 'keep up' with the med's over-effectiveness (even at my 1 mg level) throughout the day.  The warnings on side effects are dead-on especially on the beta-blocker masking some of the hypo's oncoming symptoms since I am also on two high-blood meds which are working just fine. All of these lows have initiated GAD which I have to watch for onset when a hypo hits now and have had to be placed on ativan for that!  This 'eat eat eat' and then juice juice juice WITH test test test is REDICULOUS.  Help would be greatly appreciated opinion-wise.  Thanx VERY Much !

I started out with 2 (2mg) tablets taken in the am with Janumet/1000 twice a day. The hypoglycemic episodes were terrifying. My endocrinologist reduced the dosage to 1mg or 1/2 tablet in the morning. I still have episodes of low blood sugar in the early afternoon.(50-70) I usually can feel the low sugar coming on. I then have to eat to get my sugar up, which can cause weight gain or the inability to lose weight. I have not gained any weight although I am unable to lose weight due to the hypoglocemic episodes and the need to eat to raise my sugar. I have noticed an improvement with 1mg vs. 4mg, but I have to monitor my sugar readings closely. I manage to keep my A1c around 6.5 to 6.9. Carbohydrates are not my friend. I try to stick to proteins and veggies.

My doc prescribed this when I changed docs to her because my previous doc had me strictly, and I do mean strictly, on humolog insulin and lantus at bedtime. It is helping somewhat but alot of it is my fault do to poor diet. Sometimes have low blood sugars with amaryl but I am also taking novolog on a sliding scale now. Overall, basically pleased...

It works great following a good diet and it keeps my blood sugar in the good zone 95% of the time. I find that I am my worse enemy by not always eating right. I did not have any weight gain. I am 57 and have been using Amayrl for over 5 years, it has been a life saver for me.
