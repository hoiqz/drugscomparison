Ear Wax that has Hardened and May Cause Blockage	Richi47, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/3/2012 12:55:52 AM	The medication worked great for me. I just bought it this afternoon. I took it once and it worked great. The blockage is gone. I can hear perfectly now. I had a huge chunk of wax in my ear that even my EMT doctor could not get out. He thought he removed most of it. He used some type of instrument plus some type of vacuum thing. It was somewhat painful and it didn't get all the blockage out. So I bought Debrox today and it got a giant chunk of wax out immediately. I have no more blockage. The stuff worked great.

My doctor recommended I use Debrox ear drops. After the first use, my ear felt clogged and I felt I ringing inside my ear and I lost some hearing. I called my doctor's office and a spoke to a nurse who told me keep using it, it will get better. After four days of using it twice a day, 5 drops each time, the clogged feeling is still there and by now I can't hear at all from that ear. I am so diappointed and worried. I am going to see my doctor tomorrow. I hope this is reversible.
Ear Wax that has Hardened and May Cause Blockage	Kjsmarley07, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	10/11/2011 1:19:16 AM	I am 28 years old have had ear problems my entire life. I recently had my tubes to fall out, however, the left tube is stuck in the ear canal due to wax. I still have the holes in my eardrums from the tubes. My dr recommended the drops and they seemed harmless enough... Wrong!! I put them in alone with no one in my house and was terrified after putting in the drops. The intense pain and dizziness were terrible and immediate! I would not recommend this for anyone with prior ear problems. I wish I would've read your comments first, because I definitely regret putting what felt like acid in my ears.

Think I must have overdosed (how do you tell how many drops are going in your ear?) as the next day experienced dizziness, sinuses buzzing, light-headed feeling.
Ear Wax that has Hardened and May Cause Blockage	Los Altos Mom, 35-44 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	4/2/2011 1:44:27 AM	My 6 year old son' pediatrician recommended this for him.  We tried 1 ear and he cried, so we stopped and asked the nurse to irrigate (with just water) for him.  I decided to test it out just 15 minutes ago with my right ear.  It is totally blocking my ear now,  very painful and uncomfortable.  So I googled &amp; found this page.  I wish I did this before I tested out the product...

I am a tv person so wear and earpiece that wreacks havoc on my earwax.  This medication takes care of it.  Per the other review, I would definitely not put it in my ear if there was a hole.  Also, keep away from eyes.
Ear Wax that has Hardened and May Cause Blockage	25-34 Female  (Caregiver) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	3/7/2010 11:02:07 PM	Debrox drops were recommended for my eight year old nephew by his pediatrician for hardened ear wax causing a slight blockage. Despite double checking with the doctor concerning my nephew's hole in his ear drum, he assured us (and I'm not saying he was wrong - I have respect for thirty years of medical experience) there should be no problem with using the drops on the child.Let me tell you - if you have ANY holes or inner ear deformities, DO NOT use these drops. I can not strongly emphasize 'DO NOT' enough. Less than thirty seconds after administering the drops, my nephew began to scream bloody murder, his face turned beat red, and he was shrieking about the pain in his ear.Upon calling his pediatrician at home, the doctor was confounded by the response, informed us to keep a close eye on the boy, and to go to the E.R. if the pain should persist or his condition worsen.Again, none of us blame the doctor for using his own personal experience with this product, nor do we blame the company who produces it, however, we wanted to let other parents/consumers know this:IF YOU HAVE ANY INNER EAR PROBLEMS PRIOR TO USING THIS PRODUCT - DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT USE UNTIL YOU SPEAK WITH AN EAR NOSE AND THROAT SPECIALIST.However, I personally used the product on my own ears (as a demonstration to a worried eight year old that it might hurt to use them) and had no adverse reaction. The product did as promised, was easy to use, and was personally satisfying...if you have no inner ear deformities or anomalies.

I reccomend.I and in extreme pain,no hearing, and then I got insomminia, I asked him for #7 Ambien so I could sleep, and he refered me to a nut-Dr.!~talk about passing the buck.P.S. I am a professional musician!~This O.T.C. ear stuff administered by a medical Dr. is very dangerous-refuse it by all means nessary.
