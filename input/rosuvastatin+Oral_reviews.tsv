High Cholesterol	Chiefed, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/4/2012 5:16:39 PM	I just got rejected by my drug company. They want me to try a generic brand of cholesterol reducing medicine. There is no generic for Crestor. This has worked for me. I don't want to change because of the possible side effects from using other drugs. I have not had any side effects using Crestor. So in other words, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The drug companies need to leave us alone and let us lead as healthy lives as possible.

I was placed on this drug and began having blood in my urine on a heavy basis.  I discontinued use and the problem was corrected.

Within 10 days, I both lower legs and both hands go numb, getting worse every day.  I am SO done with statins--nothing but muscle pain and now numbness. Looking for natural alternatives.

Both cause extreme pain.  One put me in ER with cardiac systems.  This drug has had no pain and reduced my LDL from 200 to 68.  I was amazed my total was 300 is now 174. I do watch my diet as well.

Rosuvastatin seems to be more effective in reducing Cholesterol. Furthermore, I take 1/4 the mg dosage of other Statins to achieve the same results.

After 6 months off my LDL was higher than before. I am back on it and hoping that the leg aches don't return. If they do my doctor and I will look at alternatives.
