Prevent Blood Clot with Fast Irregular Heart Rate	mlkirkl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/26/2012 3:27:54 PM	I was in the hospital on a heparin IV for a blood clot. They sent me home with Coumadin to help dissolve it. I had to quit taking it because my period was unbearable. I was passing clots every 10 minutes and the bleeding was horrendous. I am not willing to go through this for 6 months. There has to be something else out there. I ended up feeling very weak, dizzy, and tired. I will never take this medicine again.
Blood Clot	Jessica Lynne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	25-34	8/7/2012 10:38:13 AM	I've been taking coumadin since I was 16, when doctors told me I would be on it for life. At first it was the end of my world. I had a disease at 16 years old. I had to wear those awful circulation stockings, which I always took off once I got to school. I hated it! I am 26 now and I'm still on the meds. The coumidin works. I'm the proof. I'm alive. I would skip it for a week or days or accidentally take it twice in 1 day.. All when I was younger, of course. I have had no side effects since I've been taking it. NONE! Except bleeding a little longer than normal, but it's a blood thinner. That's to be expected. I don't take the pill on the EXACT time everyday. I take it around bed time each night. Between 9pm and 11pm. My INR, which I go once a month is always around 2.5. I have been therapeutic for over 4 months. I eat all the green leafy vegetables that I want! I can't have cranberry pills or too much cranberry juice. Because of the blood thinner and now also anemic. I take iron supplements once a day! I will be on this drug for life. My only regret is that at my young age my thirst for adventure is cut short because of this drug. I have to be careful and I hate that. Plus, I'm an accident waiting to happen, as my mother says. I cut my self all the time. I bruise all the time! I'm still here. No internal bleeding, no clots. It's no the end of the world to be on this.

I had to set alarm to take it at 5pm every day because I would forget. It made my joints &amp; muscles achy and changed my personality. My husband said I was snapping at him and that isn't my nature at all. My gums bled terribly &amp; my taste buds were way off. Nothing I ate tasted right. My taste buds were a real eye opener because I had quit smoking &amp; everything tasted better until I took the coumadin. I stopped taking it my 4th week because it NEVER got regulated (and never would have-I believe) and I felt I didn't need it as I was up and very active to prevent any type of blod clots anyhow. I haven't had any issues since stopping it. Food tastes great, bleeeding gums resided and achy joints gone and aint snapping at my husband. I have to have my right hip replaced in a couple months and I will NOT be taking coumadin again. My doctor will have to find something else for me.

It did not affect my quality of life. You can eat greens, as long as you always eat greens, so they can set the dosage accordingly. Eight months ago I had open heart surgery at the Minnesota Mayo Clinic for Hypertropic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy and while there were in there, I asked them to do the Afib ablation. I have not had Afib since then, so I am off of almost all heart meds.Coumadin does work. Sometimes it may go off in one direction or the other, but you are so carefully monitored, those situations are easily handled. No side effects from coumadin for me.

In Dec.2010 She slipped and fell hitting her head &amp; was taken to emergency. No serous injury was found,however,they discovered that she had a slight stroke and how long ago wasn't known.Months later The decision was to put her on COUMADIN, since she also was found to have a rapid heartbeat and later diagnosed as AFIB. . Controlling the dose of COUMADIN was difficult/ very erratic.I researched AFIB &amp; antenolol.I found that long term use of Antnolol can lead to severe damage to the atrium valve of the heart &amp; Fragmenting/ weakening of the arteries. My wife was doing fine until she was put on Coumadin. She had a severe stroke caused by a blood vessel bleeding in the brain and was rushed to emergency.Nothing could be done since the bleeding caused severe damage to her brain. she went into a coma within two and four days later she passed away.The doctors were more concerned about her having a heart attack by blood clotting. However , my question is would she had a better chance to survive without Coumadin causing difficulty in controlling /stopping the bleeding? As I said she was doing fine until she was put on Coumadin. In less than six months on coumadin is now deceased.?? I am telling this because I believe she would of had a better chance of survival without COUMADIN. It also should be known to patients taking Atenolol of the long term use &amp; the  damage it can cause as stated in a research done.

Took Warfarin for a couple of years then quit. Got another DVT in the same leg now I'm on it for life. I haven't had any issues except that I have to watch out for the green veggies and take it easy with them. I can't take ibupofin or asprin but I'm a MMJ patient and the cannabis works great with no side effects. People living where it's legal that take warfarin should consider marijuana for pain applications when you can't take over the counter NSAID's. Weed doesn't change my IRN levels either.

For those of you that have trouble getting the correct blood results, remember the things that thin the blood, such as coffee, soda, aspirin, liquor. Also, not only green vegetables contain vitamin K. Even Cauliflower and carrots do.

I ended up with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) brought on by hormones I'd been taking. I'm a vegetarian woman in my mid-fifties and have been on Coumadin since about 2004.  I seem to manage it well enough most of the time, but sometimes the dose gets out of whack and I end up in the hospital ER.  The last time I went to the ER with a nosebleed that wouldn't stop.  I had to have my nose cauterized and packed (lots of fun), but at least I didn't need a transfusion and am still alive.  That visit cost $3000 (after my insurance paid their portion).  I now have no insurance and dread another hospitalization.  This is one nasty drug.  I understand people with atrial fib can now use Pradaxa instead of Coumadin, but Pradaxa hasn't yet been approved for DVT.  I ask my doctor about Pradaxa every time I go in.  On the one hand I am grateful I have Coumadin to help prevent future clots (I've had two now and am told I must stay on blood thinners for life).  On the other hand, Coumadin is nasty, scary stuff and I can't wait for something else to become available for those with DVT.  I've also learned that we must be our strongest advocates and INSIST our physicians follow up on our concerns.  If I'd have done so I mightn't have been in this boat now.

I was started on 5mg now I am up to 12.5mg. I still have the DVT in my right leg and my pt/inr Level is not where it needs to be. Last test it was at 1.0 And I am in alot of pain in the leg where the DVT is. I dont know why my levels are not where they need to be. I am wondering if I should be on an additional medication like Lovenox or the new Pradaxa. And also I did not realize that warfarin, the generic for coumadin, is used in high doses as a rat poison.

I was very tired the first year as I see many other people were as well, but I am also on a few other drugs. I'm not sure it's the Coumadin, but frequent urination, fatigue (mental and physical), some sort of skin rash, are the result of either Coumadin, Carvedilol, and/or Amiodorone. Three horrible drugs, but I guess necessary to avoid a blood clot.

Blood Clot in Lung	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	45-54	4/15/2011 12:07:05 PM	This may be a life-saving drug, but the side effects, depending on your dose, can be horrible.  I had my first PE (nearly 2 dozen clots in both lungs) in Oct. 2008; in Dec. 2010 I had another round of the same thing (multiple PE). At the time of the 2nd encounter I had already spent 6 mos. on Coumadin and 325/day aspirin until it happened again. Now I'm told my condition is so severe that one more multiple clot episode will absolutely kill me (I barely survived the second) and I must be on Coumadin for the remainder of my life; I just turned 46.  The side effects from my 10 mg./day dose are horrible.  It feels like the worst flu you have ever had minus a sore throat or respiratory problems.  I have all-over body aches that are unbearable in the evenings and morning, and fevers.  My hands are always crippled and hurting and even my eyelids hurt to move in the evening.  Nobody told me of these sides until after I started reporting/complaining of them to my doc.  I did not have these before, but I also was on a lower dosage.  That's why I say it depends on your dose.  But I have been absolutely miserable for the past 3 months.  By the way, the new drug -- if you've already had a multiple PE (or 2 like me) your doc probably won't put you on it.  It works entirely different and sounds better than it really is (no blood testing, etc.).  But it's so new that most pulms won't put you on it because the risk of recurrence of multiple PE is too high (i.e. you'll die) that they prefer you stay on the tried/true/miserable drug Coumadin.  And, it doesn't have arsenic in it, but is used in very large amounts as rat poison (kills them by bleeding to death), nowhere near the therapeutic amount people are prescribed.  Hope this helps someone.

Blood Clot in a Deep Vein	josie, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	2	1		35-44	4/11/2011 4:32:15 PM	My 14 yo son was diagnosed with a DVT in his left inferior vena cava vain.  Numerous tests to determine a reason why, no answer other than he plays catcher for baseball and that up and down movement could have caused it??  Yeah right.  Had a vascular surgeon go in and thrombolyse it (basically shoot TPA in it to melt it).  Told us to stay on coumadin for 6 mo.  Since then, my son has lost weight, become weak, has dizzy spells, nose bleeds, occasional blurry vision, joint/muscle pain, headaches, and has not been able to participate in his love of baseball without a lot of protection on his body.  We are coming off it after 4 months, not worth the side effects, esp if staying on it is only for therapeutic recommendations.  Would not recommend it!  he started taking Lovenox shots, but is allergic to metals and was reacting to them so we had to switch to coumadin.

I have a clotting disorder which can cause strokes, heart attacks, etc.  I had serveral clots during pregnancies but have been clot and stroke free on the warfarin.  You must take it very consistantly or the counts get out of wack.  I never worry about any foods I am eating.

I was first on heparin, then on to Coumadin. I take 2.5 mg daily and that keeps my INR within the desired range of 2-3. I can't eat all I used to eat, especially green veggies. I have tried other remedies but that only resulted in damage to deep veins in my leg. Now I also have DVT, with the usual discoloration around the ankles. I suggest strongly to anyone with a similar condition to wear compression stockings religiously. It's a nuisance, I know, but it does help to regain your energy levels. Watch what you eat too, for the PT rate can shoot up easily and then there is the weight that doesn't want to leave, although I think this has more to do with my reduced activity level.  Stay well and especially, well informed.

In May 2008 I was diagnosed with a rare and fatal disease called Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. My Anti-Coagulation nurses told me exactly what to expect and exactly how serious coumadin is. They warned me all about the side effects and changes in my eating habits. Yes, I get random and frequent nose bleeds but I also am on oxygen 24/7 which can dry out my nose and cause nose bleeds. Other than that, I haven't had any serious side effects. Sometimes strange bruises do appear even if I didn't bump into something, although when I do bump into something pretty hard I get really nasty looking bruises. All in all, I trust my doctor and my Anti-Coagulation nurses when it comes to taking care of my health. So far, I've been alive almost 3 years now!!

I did avoid having a stroke. I did also end up with severe osteoporosis caused largely by the coumadin as it blocks vitamin K's bone metabolism regulating mechanism. I would suggest anyone needing to take coumadin do research into taking vitamin K2 MK-7, menaquinone-7, as a supplement to prevent metabolic bone disease as well as calcification of the circulatory system as a result of long term coumadin therapy.  Further I would  suggest that such patients look into other safe effective natural nutritional supplement alternatives to coumadin that prevent blood clots. Investigate nattokinase, Seanol (eklonia cava seaweed extract), and high quality fish oil supplements for a start. Not only are these alternatives safe, they are good for you.
Blood Clot	Michel S, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3		55-64	12/7/2010 12:48:08 PM	Have been on coumadin since 1994 for A-Fib, no particular problems other than the occasional black &amp; blue, but my doctor told me from the beginning (I was 41) that there was a 1 to 2% chance of bleeding in the brain for coumadin users. I never liked that, but I needed the drug to reduce the chance of blood clots. After 15 years, my A-Fib seems to have disappeared and I was allowed to take aspirin instead. I am relieved. And even more so when I just read in Discover magazine that the Cochrane Collaboration - an international network of people helping healthcare providers, policy makers, patients, their advocates and carers, make well-informed decisions about human health care - examining medical evidence on warfarin, found only 2 studies supporting its use for patients at risk of developing clots... NEITHER STUDY PROVED THAT THE RISKY BLOOD THINNER WAS SUPERIOR TO SIMPLY GIVING THE PATIENT IBUPROFEN. All patients should talk to their doctor about the risks/benefits of using Coumadin/Warfarin

The surgeon said it was probably due tot he infection I had from the surgery. This medicine has made me so sick that I've decided I am done with it after just being on it for a little over a month now. I get these bee sting like pains all over my body, my legs hurt as does my sides and recently I have had pain in my head. I complained to the doctor, had a CAT scan yesterday and nothing was found. My thought was right, its this medicine! I feel like I've drank a class of gasoline or kerosene each time I take it. I also want to run to the hospital ER because I think I am dying. My ears sting, by eyes are black and blue and this is just bad stuff. You make your own decision but for me I would rather die than live like this. My levels were high yesterday so I am off it today and feel like a million bucks. I am so scared to take it tomorrow because I know what I will feel like shortly after. I took 325mg of Aspirin today just for a cya and may continue to do this instead of the warfarin, but will I die or stroke? Only time will tell.

Blood Clot caused by Artificial Heart Valve	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more	4	3	3	Male	45-54	11/7/2010 1:27:20 PM	I am writing this on behalf of my wife who passed away 9/2010 of cardiac arrest. I received her autopsy report last week and was shocked to discover the root cause of her death due to excessive calcium build up through out the artery walls &quot;The root of the aorta is decorated with innumerable round calcified atheromatous accreations, nearly obliterating the ostium of the left coronary&quot;. In 1988 she had a valve replaced with a mechanical valve and placed on this drug 22 years. She had regular checkups and vitals were always excellent. She ate healthy foods, followed doctors advice and took all medications and vitamins religiously. There are other articles concerning this side effect. I write this because I knew my wife's habits. Doesn't matter how healthy a person is when on coumadin long term. Beware Counadin. It prvents clotting but encourages excessive calcium in the bloodstream.

I have never had any side effects, but I do agree with one other review, take Coumadin and not Warfarin if you can afford it; Warfarin can very between manufacturer.

I had negative side effects and my doctors kept telling me to take the medicine so I did. One night I got so sick I couldn't take it so I stopped. I haven't taken it since. When I went back to my doctors they admonished me for ceasing taking the medication and told me that I was putting my life into my hands. I told both of them that I was taking a drug that had helped me to get rid of the clots but which was going to kill me anyway. My rash was all over my arms, headaches, nauseousness and the worst, swelling of my feet to twice their normal size. Of course the doctors said these were not side effects of coumadin but when I stopped taking the drug all of the side effects went away. I am going to have a ct scan next week to see what my condition is. All of the blood tests were negative for genetic or heredity factors, lupus and cancer. I am not scared either because I feel normal again. I am drinking lots of water to flush the coumadin completely out of my system and taking two 81mg baby aspirin daily which I think I am going to switch to one 325mg daily. I am not eating greens or other foods that contain huge amounts of vitamin K. I am watching how I feel and I am very in tune with my body. I can't tolerate coumadin. I am happy for those of you who can but I am not one of you. Coumadin is rat poison. Doctors claim it is the ONLY treatment for blood clots. I am demanding that they find something else for those of us who have bad reactions to it and that they stop making us feel guilty because our bodies are different than the &quot;normal&quot; people who can obviously tolerate the drug without complications. Good luck to all of you.

Blood Clot in Lung	Lee Lee , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	7/30/2010 1:26:16 PM	I have been on Coumadin since Feb 2010. My treatment plan is 6 months on to treat a small pulmonary embolism developed after surgery. My experience has been ok with this drug. No one likes to be on any medicine but this drug comes with constant monitoring. I don't like avoiding green veggies, wines, and mayo but I am happy it has been helping to break up my clot. The first doctor visited me in the hospital saying I'd be on this drug for life. The second said 6 months. Now, in my 5 month and the second doctor is trying to pin me for life under the assumption the cause must be genetic and not from pelvic surgery. I won't continue taking this drug after my 6 months without an evauluation to determine if I have a deficiency. I pray and hope not. I want this to be the first and last time taking it. For those of you on it for life, bless you, it's going to save your life in the long run. For the short termers, hang in there. It's not a fun drug to take at any stage of your life. I have noticed I am more sensitive to temperatures, my menses are heavy and cramps last longer (1st post op period lasted 19 days - had to take a chance with progesterone to stop bleeding), splinters/cuts/scrapes are more painful, and if I get fatigued, I am sacked!  My hair is a little thinner and a bit brittle and hair loss is present but not excessive. No upset stomach. Concentration can be off at times. Overall, will be glad to get off Coumadin.

Severe Heart Failure	jasonltx29@aol.com, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	7/16/2010 10:30:26 PM	In May,2010 my mom was in the hospital and diagnosed with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. after she came home 10 days later the doctor had her on 2.5mg a day of warfarin. Then 10 days later he told her to start taking 2.5mg on monday,tuesday,thursday and sunday. On wednesday and saturday she was to take 5mg on those days. I took her to her heart doctor on thursday, 6/10/2010 for a follow up visit and doctor said she was doing great. the next day, friday, 6/11/2010 I found her deceased in her bedroom. she looked like she was tryng to get out of bed. I called 911 and paramedics arrived and said that she more than likely died from a blood clot to the heart or lung. They determined that after seeing all of the medications she was taking. How could this be possible to be ok one day and die the next? Then I thought that maybe when her doctor changed the dosing of the warfarin and increasing the mg might have caused her to die so sunddenly. I shared this information with my aunt , mom's sister and she kind of agreed. A few days after I had told her this, she calls me and asked if mom was taking any over the counter pain reliever/sleep medication. I told her yes. She was taking tylenol pm at night because she had a hard time to get to sleep at night and that is when she told me that the tylenol pm more than likely caused her to throw a blood clot to the heart or lungs. She based this on her doing some research online about the warfarin she was taking. She said that it specifically states not to take any over the counter medications like the tylenol pm because it was a high risk to form a blood clot and could very possibly be fatal. WTF?!?! no where on the pill bottle or even in the brochure that came with the warfarin did it mention ANYTHING about not taking OTC pain relievers/sleep aid like tylenol pm. Nor did her doctor mention anything of the sort. mom was only 65 when she died. And her untimely death could have been prevented if she would have been told this.

He never had problems breathing, worked to supplement our income. I thought he should see a cardiologist just for an exam. He put him on coumadin and that's when the mental confusion and forgetfulness started....also falling weak legs. Had to stop working. The dr would not accept the mild dementia saying that is NOT a side effect so he kept taking it up and down trying to get it regulated. In May 2010 he got pneumonia and was hospitalized..the took him off the coumadin because he falls...even got a new cardiologist. Last week he had an episode where he couldn't breathe so ambulance came and he was again hospitalized. They think he had a mini stroke and pulmonary embolisms. The hospital dr pushed me to approve coumadin while the neuro dr disagreed. I was made to feel that if I didn't let them give it to him and he died his blood was on my hands. They had been giving him heparin, then lovenox IV.He was doing quite well, up and walking, making sense when he talked. Then  3 days ago they gave him 7.5 mg of coumadin and within 4 hours he went ballistic. The nurse called me at 11 PM and told me they had to call security and give him atavan. They wanted to send him home the next day and i had to argue for them to keep him one more day because I wouldn't be able to handle him if he did that. The dr was upset with me because I discontinued the coumadin. He came home today and slept all day, is really confused.  Of course they have him on Lasix, Levaquin, and some other drugs including anti-psychotics. I will not continue the anti-psycs. They sent him home with 8 RXs to be filled.  I will see our PCP next week before I do anything else.

My INR is all over the place for 3 1/2 months.  Still not regulated.  I take Coumadin for treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.  Once INR stabilizes in the 2.0-3.0 range, I will get put on a new &quot;shock&quot; drug for one week, but I continue to take Coumadin for who knows how long, probably forever.  I am guessing I will stabilize in the 4 mg per day range.  I had a terrible time at first with bleeding and nose bleeds.  It's taking too long to regulate Coumadin.  In the meantime, I could die of heart attack or stroke.  Coumadin and/or this heart condition makes me very tired.

Blood Clot	Elizabeth, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	55-64	5/30/2010 5:08:30 PM	I began treatment with coumaden in the late 1960's after a car accident. Stopped treatment to have children, resumed off &amp; on until 1996. Can't say that taking the drug has been a pleasant experience, but it is much better then the alternative, which to me would be death. Once since 1996, my doctor decided I should try plavix. It cost a week plus visit to the hospital, prognosis likely death. True, just a simple tooth extraction can be extremely expensive, have to have my blood checked at a minimum of monthly, often weekly. One missed dose causes unfavorable test results, resulting to more frequent tests. I have been through at least 6 doctors and if there were an alternative I would have it by now as most doctors I have seen do not like their patient on a drug as dangerous as warfarin. I do not notice any changes in my body other then those that normally occur with age, except perhaps tiredness at times. I cannot honestly state that I wish I had never went off the drug, there were two wonderful healthy children born during that time, but do wish I had returned back to the drug shortly thereafter as it would have prevented at least 6 hospital stays due to blood clots. Since my serious return to warfarin in 1996 there have been no problems with blood clots whatsover.

I opted to have a mechanical valve insyead of a pig valve. If I had chosen the pig valve I am pretty sure that I would outlive the pig valve. Did not want to have that surgery again! Now I am on coumadin for the rest of my life. So far it hasn't been to bad. Now that I am 48 I have other health issues going on and being on coumadin is causing many problems. Things that happen to women naturally and don't cause major problems have become major one's for me. Like having an ovarian cyst burst-need I say more. I now wish that I had gone with the pig valve. I know that I will have to be alot more focused on what I can or cannot eat or drink. I am also looking into getting a home INR test kit so I can be more involved with tracking my INR.

I stopped taking omeprazole and the tremors stopped.  I found this side effect only in clinical trials of omeprazole, noting that coumadin could increase the likely hood of this side effect.

I am told to stay &quot;active&quot;.  But my primary activity is horesback riding.  I'm tire all the time, and am fearful to ride my horse.  I understand that it is a medical emergency if I fall off.  So, I guess that means I need to call an ambulance.  My work is suffering because I am so tired all the time.  But, if I'm careful, I understand this is a lifesaving drug, so I'm grateful to have it.

Over the past 20 years I developed some more DVT .  About 5 years ago I had done a detailed test that confirmed I have a genetic factor, which is a mutation that makes me more prone to develop blood clot.  Hormones (like birth control, IUD) also put me at risk. So now I cannot have hormones (no IUD that contains hormone) and I have been taking Coumadin daily.  I do the blood test and monitor the medicine specially if I need to go under surgery.  I did not have any of the side effects described by others.  But I do have to monitor the intake of vitamin K so the levels of my blood readings don't change too much.  I may have to take coumadin for the rest of my life to offstet the risk associated with not taking a blood thinner.  Other than that, there is the inconvenience of bruises or lab once a month, but it seems to be safer this way.  Proper medical monitoring and consistency of food intake seems to work well for me but we are all different individuals and should be aware of how our body responds to  medicine.  In the end, any medicine is invasive.

Blood Clot in Lung	Nosebleed0709, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	1/16/2010 1:25:08 PM	I started coumadin/warfarin after a pulmonary embolism following nosebleed surgery. Prior to the nosebleed I had been diagnosed with Phlebitis of my left leg and had self medicated with aspirin for about 20 years.  About 6 mo. prior to the serious nosebleed I noted shortness of breath, so I think that i probably already had small embolisms.  After the surgery this became very pronounced and I could not even climb stairs tho I had been previously fairly fit. My Doc. had an ambulance take me to the hospital where they diagnosed the PE and put me on heparin, then warfarin.  Subsequently they tried to take me off warfarin 6 mo. later, but a PE recurred so I was put on warfarin &quot;for life&quot;.  This allowed me to resume my regular activities including fairly vigorous activity for my age (59).  My main complaint is that my HMO's Anti-coagulation management service (AMS) kept ratcheting my dose up until I was at 60mg/week.  Then 2 weeks ago I had a very severe nosebleed that required taking my INR down to 1.0 to stop it with a 5 day hospital stay, transfusions and surgery to put in a vena cava filter to catch clots.  I think that AMS biases their dosage on the high side and am determined to see if I can't reduce it by a third to guard against more nosebleeds.  I would like to start home testing of INR so that it could be more frequent and thus allow a narrowed and lower INR target range, maybe 1.7-2.0.  I think the medical people need more studies to refine the range requirements for each type of case, since bleeding is a definite life risk.  On the other hand I am convinced that coumadin/warfarin is essential to my health/well being.

In the first few days of treatment I took both Coumadin and Clexane. For the next couple weeks I was solely on Coumadin. The swelling and the pain decreased tremendously. After two weeks I was able to walk around again. A few days later, I was able to return to work.

I have known 5 people who developed Alzheimer's and all 5 had been taking Coumadin for 5 or more years. 2 men died from complications of Alzheimer's in their early 80's. 1 woman died at age 64.  I know 2 more women in their mid-50's who were recently diagnosed with a &quot;dementia.&quot;  I am aware that what I have witnessed is anecdotal and there are no studies that I can find that show a correlation between dementia and Coumadin. But this scares me.  There are other blood thinning medicines out there.  Why risk it?

I aim for 200 mg vit K a day, and so far INR is constant. It does require some planning. One thing I don't understand is why they warn against lentils (and for that matter against healty vegetatbles in general). Lentils have almost no vit K as far as I can find (USDA site).

I don't like coumadin. I have been on it for 2 yrs and will be forever and for many months at a time I will be fine and then all of a sudden I'm tired and have stomach cramps, headaches, dizziness and I always have very dry skin. I highlight my hair and it used to take 30 min to lighten. Now it takes five. So beware ladies if you're on it and have your hair done a few months later. Be checking that cap every couple of minutes. And for those that made comments you dont know what to and not to eat, just look up on yahoo, what to eat while on warfarin and they have the same list I got from the Dr. You don't want to stop eating those foods with vitamin k in them if they have already adjusted your medicine around how you already eat, and you change your eating habits, you may need a different dose. Don't take any herbal supplements or vitamins if you don't already without telling your Dr. first.

I just eat a little greens every day whether it be a very small salad or food prepared with greens. Also have a glass of wine. Have had a little lightheadedness and shortness of breath, but that could be that I haven't been out of the hospital that long. Experienced a little weight gain, but hope to start walking and trying to get healthy again so that I can maintain a healthy weight.

Which is where your blood is as thick as molasses. I had it. It is very difficult to remember to take my meds daily or everyother day whatever it may be. I wish I could get one of those home test kits and call in with my results every week instead of taking time out of my day and spending so much money to have a lab person do it.

It doesn't take much to remember to take coumadin once a day and I also take many vitamin supplements on a daily basis.  Planning your meals is about all the effort you need when on this drug.  I have had no side effects that warrant a call to the doctors office.  Not that taking this drug is my first choice, but a subsequent surgery was out of the question... and it beats the alternative.  The best attitude is that the grass is much greener on this side.

I have experienced side effects that included very cold in the winter to very hot in the summer. I am losing my hair and it is suspected that my thyroid func. and nodule on my thyriod was greatly effected by this medication. I have had to take it for 6 mos. due to a post-surgical partial blood clot. I am hoping that the struggle with this medication has reduced the clot, but I do have to say, it has been really hard to be on.

Afterwards, on Coumadin for 1.5 years.  Dr. heard a murmur, but no tests were done.  Went off Coumadin. Gave birth, and had frequent TIA's and chest pain.  Dr. discovered mitral stenosis and I went on Coumadin forever. At 44 yo, had the mitral valve repaired. Previously, my older brother, at 40 y.o. died of a massive clot.  My younger sister at 37 yo, had 3 DVT clots. The doctors finally all met to discuss our similar events.  After going off Coumadin, under great observation and testing, we were diagnosed with Factor V Leiden AND Protein C &amp; S deficiency (I guess that's rare?)...too late to save my brother. My father died at 62, my mother is now 80.  My younger brother does not have either clotting disorder. My sister and I live a normal life, eat a normal diet, exercise normally (walk 5-8 miles/wk), have thick healthy hair, sleep, work, play and otherwise enjoy life because of this miracle drug.  I can't say enough about it.  If all we have to do is get stuck once every month, I can live with that.  Our doctors manage the dosage based on our normal diets and activity. (including lettuce, and a glass of wine now and then) After 31 years on the medication, I can actually FEEL how thick or thin my blood is, my sister says the same thing.  INR is almost always the same...between 2-3.  Wonderful medication-I am so grateful for it.  My children and husband are also grateful.  Too many of you are already so unhealthy, unaware of your own body, whimpy and lazy.  Quit complaining and live life.

If you get blood clots have your doctor run a &quot;Factor Five Liden&quot; blood test. I get blood clots easily after dental work or minor surgeries, or IV's. Been on Coumadin for over 2 years. Labs test are a must. Starting weekly to monthly after a maintenance level is established. Any surgeries and dental work that will cause bleeding, you must stop the coumadin and/or asprin for 5 to 7 days. Beware of lab test, tell techs not to fish for veins, this causes severe bruising. Stay away from green vegetables, this decreases the effectiveness of the drug. ie; brocolli, spinach, certain letteces, green peas. Anything high in vitamin &quot;K&quot;. Wear an ID bracelet with Coumadin alert. If you are in an accident and are unconsious, EMS and Hospital personnel will need to know asap. Hope this helps.

I was diagnosed with PE (Pulmonary Embolism) in both lungs during my last pregnancy. They still have yet to find out why my blood is clotting too much though. But this stuff does work. You get the occasional bruise here and there, but that's just to be expected cause you're blood is thinner. And be very careful when taking it at the same time as other meds. I did and I threw up a little blood. So I've learned on my own to wait 30 minutes after taking Coumadin/Warfarin before you take any other meds. And it thins your blood truly well so don't take any kind of aspirin with it either.

I will be on this stuf forever thanks to Yasmin. bi-lateral embolism from it.  I'm doing ok now besides the hair loss and joint and muscle pains. Just happy that it's keeping me alive right now, and think of all the thinks I would of missed if it wasnt for Coumadin keeping me going!! Like seeing my Grandson grow up!Take it one day at a time everyone and good luck to all of you. You are all in my prayers. :)

I'm positive.  Coumadin is the only known drug to treat this coagulation disorder with. It's not an easy drug to regulate as the PT level flucuates. After being on Coumadin for 10 years I have to tell of you the side effects are better than having a crippling stroke. I'm thankful my doctor found out why I had the first stroke.  The problem I  had was finding a Primary Care Physician (PCP) to monitor coumadin. As, ten years ago Leiden 5 Factor was new to the medical world. PT goes up and down.  The physicians accused me of not taking the medicine or of taking too much.  I've found a wonderful young doctor who understands my condition and I've done really well under her care.  I have had a couple TIA's since the old stroke, but none crippling. Good luck to all of you.  Be patient with this medicine.  It's better than the alternative.  Don't you agree?

The first 3 months were rough.  I was tired all the time and had trouble sleeping.  My dr. put me on a sleeping medicine (lunesta) and told me my body could take up to 6 months to recover.  I have been off the Lunesta for 6 weeks and I am not bone weary tired like I was before.  I will have to stay on Coumadin for at least a year since they couldn't find a reason why I got the blood clots in the first place

Blood Clot	25-34 Female  (Caregiver) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	12/20/2008 5:00:46 PM	My Dad has been on coumadin since the early 90's due to blood clots and a high risk of them returning.  Currently, I'm sitting in his hospital room because the coumadin has caused bleeding in his brain amongst other problems according to his internist and neurosurgeon.  I know there are very good reasons ppl take coumadin and it's helpful for most (my Mother has taken it since her heart surgery 13 years ago).  However, even with regular blood testing (my parents both go each week to have blood taken) something very serious, which was potentially fatal, can happen.  I feel like everyone on this drug should be very careful and aware of all side effects.  Best of luck.

Must take daily to prevent valve from becoming &quot;sticky&quot; and blood clots from forming.  Other than having to take on a daily basis, I am grateful for a successful surgery.  Surgical scar/zipper isn't so pretty - had to be rushed back into surgery and undergo a 2nd operation to stop bleeding - but I feel SO much better.  Basically had congestive heart failure due to congenital heart murmur, which w/ time became a very leaky heart.  Also, my PT/INR tests fluctuate and it is hard to find the right dosage.  However, the coumadin helps keep me alive and I will have to take for the rest of my life.

Went to doctor, couldn't do 3 minutes on a stress test and was sent to hospital.  CT found massive blood clotting in lungs making attach formation at my heart (doctor later said 95 out of 100 die with pulmonary embolism so severe). Clot in leg went to lungs so put a IVC filter in and cracked open my chest to surgically remove clots.  On heparin in hospital and on warfarin (generic coumadin) ever since.  5MG a day keeps me between 2 and 3 on my weekly blood tests.  No known cause so I'll be on until we can figure it out.  I think it is physical as every time I sit down in chair that puts pressure on bottom of right thigh I can feel my leg going to sleep and have to lift it up or stand up to stop it.  Anyone else have this?

I went to the ER and i was told i had vertigo but from the reviews i know its the side affects from this medication.

On Coumadin 1.5 years because I continue to fly for my work.  Two episodes of bleeding because of too high dosage.  Dr. controlled both incidents.  I am a female, 59 years old and just had genetic testing for pre-disposition to clots (mother and her mother had clots), and I am 4-5 times more likely for clots than most people.  My problem is going back on Coumadin.  I was off it for 30 days for the tests and felt so much better.  No real side effects, just felt better off it.  I want another option than Coumadin.

I had an ultrasound at the end of October and was told that most of the clot is gone.  The rest has started pulling away from the vein wall, which is a good thing according to my doctor.  The only complaints I have are that I can't eat salads or have a beer now and again.  I am pretty tired all the time, really don't sleep all that well, and run out of breath and energy pretty quickly.  I haven't lost any hair, that I know of and I really haven't gained any weight either  but the downside of not being on the meds is a lot worse so I don't mind it.  I am hoping to come off the drug soon, but not sure when that will be.

Tim was put on Coumadine 2 months after the accident, because he had a stroke, because a doctor did not want to listen to me about Tim's health history,  He was in a hospital for almost 3 weeks because of the severe clotting in his left leg which were traveling to both of his lungs.  We would not have known this if they had not done the ultrasound and CAT scan.  We could not get Tim regulated on the Coumadine at all, was having headaces for almost 2yrs, before he had another stroke-bleeding on both sides of his brain.  Tim is blind now and left side is affected.  To anyone taking this medication get off it!!  There are other blood thinning medications out there.  Tim's nuerologist does not recommend this medication at all.  Tim is able to take (2) 81-mg Bayer Lo-Dose aspirin.  Talk with your doctors there are better altenatives,  If the doctor tells you no, ask why, keep asking to be changed, it is your health and life you are protecting.  Just because it is so cheap of a drug that most insurance companies cover it.  I do not want somebody else to go through what we have been through.  Tim was 46 yrs old when he had the first stroke.  48 yrs old when he had his second stroke,  if he would have a heart attack or another stroke he will not make it, because of the damage from the second stroke,because of the Coumadin.  Please be your own advocate of your health care or find someone to help you.

I've been on Coumadin for almost two full months now, compared with some of the comments I see I must be pretty lucky, I only have to be on it for 4 months.  I started out on 5 mg a day, that caused my INR to be too high, then I switched to alternating 2.5mg and 5mg each day and that caused it to be too low.  I then switched to 4 mg and it has been regulated ever since.  I haven't lost any hair, anymore than usual, and I don't think I've had weight gain or loss.  I have felt more tired than usual, so I'm glad to see others have that as well, so I know I'm not just imagining that.  My biggest complaint is that I can never be on oral birth control again, and my periods are very heavy and last 8-9 days.  I'm not sure if this was a direct side effect of the coumadin, but I drank about a fourth of a margarita and broke out in hives, I don't know if it was an allergic reaction from the alcohol or the salt mixing with the medication.  The doctor said only one drink a day...but I'm staying away while on the coumadin.

After 6 months I came off the drug, and had the normal side effects...  This past September i encontered another blood clot, so i am wondering, with all the people who will be liferes, why I was not told to do so, as there are significantly fatal complicatins from just getting a blood clot in the first place. So I'm on it again, and find that I have the following side effects:1.) Tired - maybe due to thinner blood-less exygen in veins.2.) Occasional diarrhea and sometimes several soft stools per day.3.) In cold weather I get chilled quickly, and find it almost impossible to get warm.4.) Have had blood in my urine due to INV being out of the sugested range 2.0-3.05.) Lost 11 pounds in 8 weeks, and have a loss of appetite. (I wonder why some of you gain weight?) not my experience...maybe it has something to do with my stomach issues and not wanting to eat much due to my complications with the diarrhea, or needing to find a bathroom all the time due to not getting to the bathroom soon enough.6.0 Good news - I never experienced hair loss this time or my last time on the drug.  In short, there may be side effests, but on the other hand, I've tempted fate twice now. I'm pleased to take the drug, and can live with the side effects.

I have been on Coumadin 5mg daily and 7.5 on one day and my INR has been 1.8 to 3.7but this week in range 2-3. It is important to take the brand name as this drug is a narrow index drug which means it can go out of range quickly with generic. I have had no hairloss or extreme bleeding-lucky. My doctor told me to keep a can of spinach handy for bleeds as it contains vey high VIT K and will make blood clot fast. Look up High vit K foods on the web and make your diet or go to drgoumet. There is a home PT/INR tester on the web a bit pricey but may be worth it to some. I hope I don't have to be on Coumadin for life and I wish all --good luck.

Blood Clot in a Deep Vein	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	9/23/2008 9:57:15 PM	In May 2008 I was diagnosed with DVT and then through more blood tests found I was positive for Factor Five Leiden.  SO my hematologist told me I would be on it for the rest of my life.  I have had hair loss, which is sad.  I am experiencing more fatigue.  I now have to use an alarm clock to wake me up, but I don't sleep well.  I also wear a compression sock 12-13 hours a day on my left leg where the blood clot was found.  I have a sedentary job and my ankle swells without the compression.  I am also a member of the military (Guard) and now find my retirement in jeopardy because of the DVT, Factor 5, and medication.  I have less than 2 years to get to retirement, but that may not be possible.  I'm heart-broken after 18+ years.

I have been taking Coumadin for eight years, and my INR has never been stable for more than three weeks.  I cannot take generic warfarin because my INR is even less stable on that.

I spent 12 days in the hospital and was on both iv heprin and oral coumadin.  Well come to find out I have lupas anticouagulation disorder, so I will have to be on this medication for the rest of my life!  I have gained around 25 lbs. while on this medicine and I too continue to be very tired and nauseus.  I also have alopecia and this has seemed to have gotten better since my PT/INR has become regulated, but I don't want to lose anymore hair than I already do.  I can't afford to find a hematologist, so I rely on my family doctor to do my coumadin therapy.  I can't stand not being able to eat greens, I love salads and greens.  And after searching this site I found out that there are so many more things that I shouldn't eat too!  I just wish that I could figure out a way to not gain the weight and still take my medicine, because I have to take this medication, or else.  Just help keep us informed on things that can help us while on this medication!

I have had trouble adjusting the medicine but it is certainly better than a stroke! I am also a diabetic and a pill or two is easier than four shots a day. I wish you all the best.

I was diagnosed with this on 8/22/08.  After being admitted to the hospital and put on IV Heparin, I was soon discharged and put on Coumadin 5mg daily.  The only main side effect that I have is light headache and occasional restlessness.  Currently my INR is 1.5.  As far as diet, I have cut out the following: garlic, Vitamin E supplements, ginger, cranberry products, onions and greens.  I go back for another INR reading in two days, so we'll see how it goes then.  I have lost 8 pounds since being on the anticoagulants.

Blood Clot in Lung	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	19-24	7/31/2008 10:19:22 PM	I have been on coumadin for almost 4 years following bilateral pulmonary emboli when I was 19. I had two more PEs while I was in the theraputic range and an additional PE after a Greenfield/IVC filter was placed. Bringing my total to 5 PEs in less than four years.Following diagnosis of Factor V Leiden Thrombophilia and Activated C Protein Deficency, it was determined that my treatment would be lifelong. I had some major side effects from this medication including severe brusing, hair loss, bleeding gums, and heavy heavy periods. I am waiting at this point for a new drug to come on the market that doesn't have these side effects and does not require me to get tested every week. There is too much variation and my INR is never stable. I have been on 6mg all the way to 15mg depending on the week. I am currently on 12mg for 6days a week and 10mg for 1day a week. Yes, this medication can do some people some good but there are alot of improvements to be made in my opinion. I am just waiting for another option, besides heparin injections because they are not any fun either (gotta love the softball size track marks from heparin)

I finally found through this site that rare but serious side effect is muscle pain and pain in arms and legs &amp; chills.  My doctor said they never seen others like that and I still have to take it.  They are trying brand nane Coumadine instead of generic Warfarin.  I been taking it for 5 days and I still have pain and last night the shakes.  It makes me very anxioius and I can't sleep, which makes me feel even worse.  I hope the side effects are not permanent!

I want to say that you're not restricted from &quot;green veggies&quot; unless your doctor explicitly tells you that. Just keep them consistent and you should be fine. As far as the drug goes, it makes me sleepy and cold all the time, as well as bruising more easily. I've switched my dosage to a morning-time one to see if it helps with the tiredness. I read online that it did make a difference for some people - but so far I haven't noticed a difference. I would love to be off this stuff, but it seems like it's keeping me from clotting so I guess I have to stay! :)

I finally got to 2.1 this week and for once my dosage remained the same as last week.  I am constantly naseous though and very tired all the time.  Not bad side effects though considering all Coumadin can give you.  Hopefully in time I won't have to take this medication because since it is rat poison, it frightens me. Also the dietary restriction are a bit hard to follow, but I understand consistency is the 'keyword' in diet planning.

So I take my coumoudin daily as directed, I stay off any green veggies or Vitamin K, to keep my levels at 2, but sometimes adjustments on the medication because of surgeries or teeth being pulled. But I still continue back on it after. The only side affect I did have was gaining weight, but slowly got it back off with exercise and eating better.

I tried the generic and had the same problems as everyone else.My inr numbers where all over the place, so I went back to the name brand. It was well worth it .I was'nt at the doctors office every week.Hope this helps some people who have to be on this drug for the rest of your life

I have had PT/INR's almost every week since. My levels are never constant, my hair is really  falling out badly, and I have gained 15 lbs in 3 months on this drug. You really have to watch your diet and other meds (for example: antidepressants are a blood thinner too). It's easy to take alot better than the Lovenox shots I had to do twice a day. I am ready to come off of it!

I have been has high as 8 only to stop coumadin and drop to 2. I watch amts of green leafy veg. etc., yet I find no rhyme nor reason for such variations. I sometimes have 2 to 3 blood tests a week. Very frustrating and costly!Yet can't be off of this medicine-must be very careful and prudent when on this drug. Always know what your INR is!!!  
Other	fullmoon, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	55-64	2/24/2008 12:36:04 PM	I have a St. Jude's artifical mitral valve. The valve has never clotted since I do take coumadin, so I don't take it for a clot due to the valve, I take it as a clot preventative.  Everyone who has a mechanical valve has to take coumadin for life.  I hate being tied to this medication, but don't have a choice.  I notice that my skin has changed in appearance since starting this drug.    Also, I can't roller skate, ride horses, water ski, or anything else anymore.  I hate having to go get the PT/INR tests all the time...especially when my INR goes out of whack.  I sometimes end up going once a week until it gets back on track.  I HATE taking this med, but have no choice, will be on it for life.

I was 24 when they diagnosed me and told me that I will be on it for the rest of my life. I got the PE from taking birthcontrol and plus I have factor 5 and Lupis anti-coagulant. Those were factors for my clots. I have to be very careful about getting pregnant. I will have to get off of the coumadin and give myself hepren shots twice a day so it won't harm the baby. I love to play rough sports like basketball, soccer, and football. I was in the Army, so they gave me a medical discarge. I can't do that anymore and that is my downside of the drug and not being able to eat greens. It's either doing that stuff or die.

I developed a superior mesenteric venous thrombosis following colon resection in Ocober, 2006.  (In months prior to the surgery, I had three unsuccessful colonoscopy surgical procedures to remove giant flat pre cancer polyps by argon laser.) So fortunate to be referred to and attended by notable top hematologist at University Of Florida Hospital following diagnosis of SMVT.  He informed me most conditions I had were discovered in autopsy, so I was one of the &quot;lucky&quot; ones.  I had Heparin IV therapy for 11 days in hospital followed by weaning to Coumadin at home.  My family physician monitored my (first twice weekly and eventually monthly) INR levels and along with diet monitoring, they have remained therapeutic since.  I consulted with my hematologist January, 2008 who, after testing and reviewing my records,  discontinued Coumadin with the caution that I should monitor any injury or trauma and advise attending physicians of the need for immediate coagulation therapy.  I accepted the treatment plan and follow up INR testing willingly and am grateful my experience was positive with a favorable outcome.  I did have side effects others have mentioned on this site, but am unable to determine if they resulted from Coumadin, other daily medications I am on, the resection recovery, or subsequent gyn surgery and recovery in November, 2007.  Most notable were significant hair loss and fatigue ... both of which have been attributed to copious anesthesia administration during the five procedures.  I am very anxious to see if the Coumadin cessation improves my sense of well being.  My advice to those expressing concern over INR levels or side effects would be to seek out a hematologist of high repute to manage your blood issues in addition to a family physician.  You cannot over estimate the risk of the condition that prompted the need for Coumadin therapy.

Other than that This drug works good but even after taking it for over 8 years they still can not seem to get me INR levels stable and stay where they should be. Hard to regulate levels.

I had had several DVT's before this diagnosis. In July of 2007 my protime was low so my Dr raised my dose. I started having severe headaches, then a seizure.  My Dr assured me it was sinusitis.  After being in severe pain I decided to go to the ER.  I was told I had a brain hemorrhage that now had turned into a clot on my brain.  I had an emergency crainiotomy (had my skull cut open). The surgeon said it was a spontaneous bleed from being given way too much coumadin.  Now I can't take any coumadin, advil, asprin etc.  Now I pray to God I never have a DVT again.  Please be careful on this drug and pay attention to any ABNORMAL SYSTOMS! I am lucky to still be alive.

These reviews are AMAZING! People using words like; &quot;annoyed&quot; with the drug. Try stroke, now THAT is annoying. (Done it) &quot;I can't eat what I want when I want to&quot;.... u can eat, it just takes planning. Try being a diabetic! Coumadin has saved my LIFE. It can save yours, or keep you from having a stroke or PE. Read the INSERT on your prescription. COUMADIN will NOT; make your hair fall out, feel cold; listless or weak. You have ANOTHER problem... these are not listed AT ALL, not even in the &quot;one in a million&quot; section. Save your life. Take your drug. Live with it. Or..... don't.
Prevent Blood Clot with Fast Irregular Heart Rate	anamcara,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	4	2	Male		1/8/2008 2:37:46 PM	Taking coumadin for atrial fib and a 40% blockage of left carotid artery.   Still have an irregular heartbeat at times and am unusually tired most of the time.  My doctor is concerned that I may throw a clot from the blockage and have another stroke(had a minor one two years ago) and that another would be much worse.   Don't have much bruising but have to be careful as I live on a sailboat and am involved with a lot of physical activity needing agility and balance.   So far, so good but would like to have more energy and be able to eat the foods that I like when I like.   Hope to someday be able to have clean arteries and live normally if possible.

Crestor will counteract the desired effect of coumadin. I have discontinued Crestor and hopefully my next  regular INR check will be elevated to the desired level. Coumadin and will be prescribed a different statin drug by my primary care doctor. Coumadin also interacts with many commonly used medications and chemical that may be present in appreciable quantities of food. Warfarin is slower acting than the coomonly use anticoagulant heparin.

I will be on Coumadin the rest of my life. It scares me to think of that in a way but so far other than a few nosebleeds (when my blood was a little too thin) i've not had any problems. They try to keep my INR between 3.0 and 3.5 because of 5 blood clotting disorders I discovered I had.

So far my symptoms for dvt have gotten worse.  I have factor five lieden which is a blood clotting disorder.

I am constantly out of breath and my left leg is very swollen and red.  I have tightness and extreme pain in my left leg.  I am very afraid that because this drug is the least expensive way to treat many conditions that I will probably die from my condition.

Other	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	10/29/2007 6:54:33 PM	I was put on Coumadin for a heart condition called Atrial Fibrulation.  I was only on it for a few months when I had a severe hemorrhage from my nose and had to call 911 and they had to pack my nose in order to stop the hemorraging. 6 months later it happened again and I had to call 911 again because it was so severe.  I realized that the treatment for the atrial fibrulation was worse than the disease.  I also had many large bruises (&quot;black and Blue marks&quot;)on many places on my body that took months to go away.  I lived in constant fear that I would get into some kind of accident and bleed to death.    After one year I refused to take the Coumadin anymore  and was put on one 325mg tablet  of aspirin a day  which I can tolerate much better.   
Other	jincolorado, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	25-34	10/24/2007 2:43:14 PM	This medication was prescribed to me in low dose to help my heart normalize (atrial fibrillation) before I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism.  The side effects of this drug are staggering, it's potent stuff.  Follow your dosage and precautions exactly.  It's been difficult to find an acceptable median between results and side effects, leading to bi-weekly pro-time tests and seemingly constant assessments.  Over all, I would ask my doctor about other treatment options before beginning this as a therapy.

I love this drug because it has saved me from getting another blood clot. I have not had any side effects at all. This medication can be hard to regulate, you just have to keep on a similar diet. I do sometimes miss the activities I am not supposed to do, but being worry free is so much better.

Every time I have been taken off this med I have had a reoccurance in another part of my leg.  Finally the doctor said I should be a &quot;lifer&quot; on this because of my history.

Blood Clot in Lung		4	2	4			9/25/2007 1:08:30 AM	The side effects of this medicine is often overlooked.  Everyone is quick to say how wonderful the medicine is, but no one takes the time to explain the side effects.  Severe hair loss, fatigue, the major changes in diet, unexplained bleeding, chest pain and let's not even mention the way that you have to be extra careful to ensure that you don't injure yourself and cause internal bleeding. Truthfully, the benefits do outweigh the side effects, but it would have been nice to have been able to prepare for them instead of experiencing them and then being told that they are normal.  My biggest problem other than the side effects is the fact that you have to take the medicine AT THE EXACT SAME TIME EVERY DAY.
