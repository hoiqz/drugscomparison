Heartburn	Mary, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/25/2011 5:22:58 PM	I was taking Protonic, and my dr. took me off it and recommended I take Pepcid Complete, Dual Action and it works great.  Now I can't find it at any pharmacy and was told by Rite Aid that it has been taken off the shelf and don't know when it will return.  Do you know any kind of information and if I can buy another product like Pepcid.  Thanks

Heartburn	DebraMcJ, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/3/2011 1:56:09 PM	Pepsid Complete AC-0ral tablets always work for my indigestion.  Unfortunately, I can't find it on any of my pharmacists' shelves these days.  I wish I knew where I could get it.  Most stores just indicate that there is a problem getting this product from the company/distributor without any other details.
Heartburn	lina, 35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5		35-44	12/29/2010 3:50:57 PM	Pepcid complete is the best medication for heartburn that I have found.  It works almost instantly (like 10 minutes, sometimes less) and I feel it lasts a long time.  The pills even taste good, like the berry and mint flavor.

Also had some swelling in my ankles.  I have stopped using Pepcid and will wait and see if it is the cause.

I have never had to retake this medicine with in a 24 hour time frame. It can be a bit chalky, so I always have a glass of water on hand that I sip while chewing the tablet. Very effective and I  recommend. Its the only antacid we keep in the house.
