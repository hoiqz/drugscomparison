Panic Disorder	Dupodo, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	35-44	11/25/2011 8:15:39 PM	This medication was prescribed to me for panic attacks, but it hasn't really worked to that end at all. It has, however, stopped, or nearly stopped some of my compulsive obsessive behaviors. The side effects I'm experiencing are not the greatest. They include: flushing, dizziness, shakiness, slower moving, and occasionally extreme drowsiness.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	gibby, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	3/15/2010 3:34:15 PM	This med was very effective in helping me control my obsessive thinking patterns.  I was on it for 3 months and my OCD and depression abated dramatically in that time.I weaned myself from the medication last week because I could no longer tolerate the physical side effects.  My hands shook uncontrollably (and my boss noticed and commented).  I had terrible constipation which led to bloating, stomach cramps and gas.  I also had a real problem when trying to run or work out at the gym.  Any sort of jumping or bouncing caused severe dizziness to the point I thought I might pass out on several occasions (the room started to go black, my head got swimmy and all sounds were muffled).I'm really disappointed that I couldn't tolerate this medication.  I was only at 75 mg/day at my max, but was on 50 mg/day mostly.  I hope I can find something else that controls the OCD as well without the side effects

The second time I had to come off a drug to go on it and I was beginning to think nothing would sort me out so it's been a relief to get a better result.

And an inability to orgasm until I quit taking it. After 2-3 weeks I started to feel angry, almost to the point of rage. At other times (days) I just felt like crying. Weened myself off with half doses for the next 2 weeks. Feel better without it?

Panic Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	9/15/2009 11:03:33 PM	I  have taken this drug for 15 years except for the last 6 months. I thought i could be ok without it but i am starting back on it tonite. I suffer from panic, anxiety and ocd. I think the ocd causes everything else. It has always helped me but the side effects make me very tired for a week or so also heartburn and i even feel a little bit more panicky when i first start it again. But in the end, i feel like a normal person and have next to no panic attacks and dont feel anxious. It helps me best withkeeping my ocd under control
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	9/12/2009 9:59:45 PM	It has helped my OCD very much especially at the 225mg/day dosage.  I would recommend to first-time users to start with 50mg/day and gradually build up the dosage or your mouth will feel as dry as sand.  Overall if you don't mind the weight gain it is VERY effective for OCD and it it also very affordable.

Sweating to the point of shirt drenched, and hard to take a deep breath. I'm looking for somthing new, and in the past been on other anxiety medication without these type of side affects.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	5/24/2009 5:39:34 PM	I had a severe OCD attack come on, and was hospitalized for a month.  My doctor started me on this drug after the first week, and once it kicked in, it worked wonders.  The side effects are not bad, and it helps control the unwanted thoughts.
Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	4/25/2009 4:49:25 PM	I've been prescribed 25mg of Clomipramine once a day for premature ejaculation. Absolutely amazing results!  I can hardly believe the difference.  If anything this dose might be too high for me.  The only down side for me is heavy fatigue after extended lovemaking, increased thirst and occasional slight nausea.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	25-34	4/2/2009 4:45:53 PM	I suffered from crippling obsessive-compulsive disorder and tried virtually every medication on the market for that malady, to little avail. Finally, the doctor suggested this medication. It didn't have immediate effect, but after about 6 months and when combined with intensive cognitive behavioral therapy, I am now functioning like a normal human being, which is remarkable, considering the abyss in which I languished for so long.That being said, there are serious side effects. (Ironically, the side effects appeared within days of taking the drug, but the therapeutic effects took months to fully manifest.) They include excessive bodily sweating, hypotension leading to dizziness during many types of physical exertion (though this hasn't stopped me from working out regularly), muscle twitching (including occasionally violent twitching while asleep, which I didn't notice until someone else mentioned it to me, since I usually sleep alone), and, most vexingly, a catastrophic effect on sexual function. Achieving an erection at all is difficult, and maintaining it for more than about 30 seconds at a time before it wilts is improbable. Orgasm is very difficult to reach during manual stimulation, even provided that everything else is ideal. I have not had the chance to test during actual intercourse. Libido and drive are decreased significantly, partly out of frustation, because sex now seems like such a fruitless exercise, and largely a waste of time and energy.However, I still remain on the medicine because I've not found a viable alternative, and at this point, I've just learned to live with the sexual dysfunction.

I wish it were prescribed more; my dr. said that it was an 'older'med and some of the newer docs didn't know about it.  Wow, is that scary or what? Has not effected my ability to achieve orgasm.
Depression	laura, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/22/2008 8:31:15 PM	My doctor prescribed this after we had tried almost everything else, from paxil to MAOI inhibitors, to wellbutrin, even considered ECT. over the course of three years.  This drug ended the chronic depression when nothing else would.  It was a lifesaver.

I had tremors, pounding heartbeat, sweating, I was so dizzy I couldn't stand, severe nausea, constipation, insomnia, loss of appetitate, numbness in my hands and feet, tired, no energy. I was so hopefull that this med would help my OCD. I am now on a different med.

This changed my life in 1 week. It has been an absolute God send. The side effects were pretty intense at first, I could not stay awake during the day after taking it at night, but after a couple of months I was fine. I still just take 25mg every night. Sometimes I feel like it needs to be increased, but I have a baby now and I can't take care of her while going through the daytime sleepiness.  By the way, I stayed on this medicine through my entire pregnancy and she is healthy and happy, no effects on her. My OCD did get worse during pregnancy though. I recommend this to anyone who has suffered with OCD.

Other		5	5	5			3/15/2008 12:01:02 PM	I have never heard of this med before until I went to the Vet with an overall aggressisve dog that I adopted.  She has moderately severe allergies and has behavior issues with other dogs.  She doesn't play well with others.  I have 4 other dogs and a litter of puppies...She has been on this med for 2 weeks in combination with Claritin for allergies and she is a new dog.  Her anxiety and aggressive behavior have decreased drastically.  I know this sounds weird, but dogs are treated medically very similar to humans.  And I feel this is pertinant in the big picture.  Especially if you have an animal with anxiety and aggressive behavior.
