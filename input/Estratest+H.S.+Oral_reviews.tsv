After two weeks on generic EEMT HS plus provera, I was down to 1-2 hot flashes per day, now after 2 months none.  They were ruining my life, plus vaginal dryness is gone, sex drive is great, mood swings have diminished as well, I thought I was going crazy when this all started, crying for no reason.  I went with my OB/GYN recommendation and this seems to be working.  My complexion has worsened, always been a problem, but now is like in my teens.  Will discuss during my next appt and see if there is anything he can adjust.  Overall I would stay on it regardless, it has helped tremendously.

The drug does manage my symptoms wonderfully well but hits my budget pretty hard.  When I started taking this med it was around $20.00 for the generic and now it is $55.00, quite a jump.  
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/12/2010 7:30:00 PM	Because I could not take straight estrogen I tried the Estratest HS and have until they stoped making it took it for about 15 to 18 years and have never been happier with any drug. My general wellbeing was great probably, better than great. I have taken the drug that was put out to replace Estratest HS and have never felt like I did before. I have even considered having the drug made for me at a compounding pharmacy but I am sure I could not afford it.

I started the hot flashes/night sweats again.  I also started hurting all over, tired, hopeless feelings, no sex drive, weight gain, hands and feet swelling.  Good news I just had my prescription filled 4/20/2010.  I did not look to see who the manufacture was, just happy to be able to get medication.  Insurance plan does not cover.  I used to get it through WalMart generic drug plan, they have taken it off their retal list.  I am going to see about their home delivery plan, it is still listed on their generic plan.  I paid $23.00 for 30 days without insurance.  It is worth the money to feel like I can move, think, remember day to day activites.

Before I even left the operating room my gynecologist had put a estrogen patch onme. Now I take a minut dose of Estratest. It has esterified estrogen and methyltestosterone in it. I take 1/4 tablet Monday through Friday. I dont have any side effects that I'm aware of. I try to take the smallest dose possible to relieve any symptoms. I tried other brands just to suffer with &quot;hot flashes from HELL&quot;!! I haven't had any problems in 7 years. And on the plus side, I still have a wonderful sex drive.

THE DOCTOR CAN WRITE A Rx FOR ESTRATEST AND YOU'LL ASK THE PHARMACY FOR THE GENERIC BUT ALL GENERICS ARE NOT THE SAME. &quot;ESTROGENMTEST&quot; MADE BY &quot;GLENMARK&quot; IS ONLY $27.00 FOR A THREE MONTH SUPPLY (WITHOUT INSURANCE) AT WALMART WHICH IS MUCH CHEAPER AND IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS ESTRATEST. YOU'LL HAVE TO WATCH SOME PHARMACIES THOUGH. THEY BUY THE CHEAPEST GENERIC AVAILABLE TO DISPENCE AND THAT MAY CHANGE FROM MONTH TO MONTH. SO, ONCE YOU HAVE THE &quot;TRUE&quot; ESTRATEST GENERIC (IT LOOKS IDENTICAL TO ESTRATEST) TELL THE PHARMACY YOU WANT ONLY THAT MANUFACTURER. THEY MAY HAVE TO ORDER IT SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU BUT DOESN'T COST ANY MORE. I HOPE THIS HELPS SOME OF YOU AS I'VE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH WHAT YOU'RE FACING. GOOD LUCK!

If you have Medicare you should also have Medicare Part D prescription coverage or some other creditable coverage and you can go to www.medicare.gov to enter your prescriptions and find a Part D plan that will cover this and any other medications.&#160; I also take Estratest and found out they are no longer making it and have now started Premarin (only 1 day into it) so we'll see.

I just got the generic and did have a strong reaction.  I am nauceous and clamy. I still have a few of the original pill but am not sure what I will do when I'm out.  I was lucky because I had a partial hysterectomy at 32 and did not need any HS therapy till 55.  But when the symtoms hit I felt so horrible.  The estratest has given me back my life.

I am now 55.  I started taking estratest HS after my surgery due to hot flashes / mood swings.  My doctor wanted me to try to go off of this drug.  I did take myself off of it gradually, and was off of it completely for 3 months.  My night + day sweats, mood swings, no sex drive etc. all returned.  Plus my joints began hurting also.  I went back on the medication a couple of months ago.  I feel like a new women again.  I guess I'll try again in a few years and see how it works out for me.
