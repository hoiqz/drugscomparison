I have tried everything you can imagine....all types of other probiotics and home remedies. This has certainly worked for me.

I noticed a difference in one day and was &quot;regular&quot; the entire time I took it. Wish I could get it over the counter!

ReZyst knocked it out in 10 days.  I continue to take it split in two rather than over the counter probotics.  It has really worked on me well!

Diarrhea	Patient, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/16/2009 7:16:50 PM	I have always used OTC acidophilus.  It only worked a little bit.  Rezyst IM was great.  I took it and saw results fast.  I love the fact that it is only once per day and i did not have to carry around an ice chest with me to keep it refrigerated.  I would recommend it to everyone.  I am still on it for overall intestine health.
