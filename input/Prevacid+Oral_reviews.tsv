It seems much more effective than other similar remedies.  Suddenly it has disappeared from the shelves.  I hope this is a temporary market shortage.

Prevacid works great initially,but long term i am beginning to think it is causing my diarrhea. So if that is the case,i will have to stop taking Prevacid entirely.

On the days it causes cramping, it doesn't control the acid reflux as well.  I'm trying to match my diet for the day with the days it is ineffective to see if particular foods are causing the problem.

Stress Ulcer Prevention	rob_j, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	3/5/2011 1:10:22 AM	I took &quot;Protonix&quot; for 8yrs and stopped it 1 yr ago as I didn't need it any longer. I never had any problems with it..6 months ago I began having severe arthritis problems with my neck and was presribed 1600mg. of Ibupofen/day. After several weeks OTC Prevacid was added to help protect my stomach. One week later my stomach started bothering me. I stopped Ibupofen. Stomach continued to worsen, (severe diarhea, nausea, pain, cramping). I doubled Prevacid to 30mg/day. I grew worse. Began to lose weight rapidly. Went to Gastroenterologist. Two CAT scans, complete blood analysis, Stool labs for parasites, amoeba's, bacteria, virus's, blood, etc. I was getting sicker and sicker and began to dehydrate. My Dr. went on vacation and covering md wanted to hospitalize me! I had lost 15 lbs. and now believed I was in really serious trouble. My tests had been negative but yet I was getting much worse. THE ONE CHANGE I HAD MADE IN ALL THIS TIME WAS THE ADDITION OF THE PREVACID! I took it upon myself to stop it. By the third day I had slight improvment. At the end of 3 weeks I was feeling much better. After 5 weeks I'm completely ok ...I'M 62 YRS. OLD. HAVE TAKEN MANY MEDICATIONS. PREVACID IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD. I STRONGLY URGE ANYONE TAKING IT TO SWITCH TO SOMETHING ELSE. I never would have thought that such a seemingly safe drug could be so dangerous. I believe the FDA made a huge error in approving it. 
Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	wisernow, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	2/7/2011 12:32:19 PM	I was sent to an ENT by my Gastroenterologist when two other acid reducers were ineffective for acid reflux.  I was having to sleep on several pillows to elevate my upper body to prevent the reflux, which was ony mildly effective.  The ENT diagnosed me with LPR and said the treatment is the same as GERD but I needed something stronger.  He put my on Prevacid and it helped the reflux.  However, I began having severe diareah only after a few days, while being treated for collanenous colitis, that the ENT was aware of.  My GE told me to stop the Prevacid because it is known to exacerbate the collanenous colitus. I had to not only increase my Asacol I was already taking for the colitis, but had to add Entocort(a very strong steroid with many serious side effrects),which I am just being weened off of after $1300.00/month for two months.  I am still on the Asacol for at least two more months at $330.00/month.  Unfortunately, the GE didn't warn me about the possible side effect in advance of my ENT visit and my ENT was unaware of the possible side effect. I had asked him about drug interactions and side effects. This &quot;experiment&quot; by my doctor with Prevacid was a very bad experience, not allowing me to even leave my home for weeks over the holidays, not to mention the expense. I will do my due diligence next time I get a prescription.

I am a singer and had damage of my throat from excessive acid.  I was not being able to sing at all.  My doctor prescribed Prevacid 30mg.  I have had healing of my throat, I am no longer hoarse all the time, and am able to sing again.  I have tried Prevacid 15mg over the counter and it does not work for me.  However, my insurance company will not pay for the prescription Prevacid 30mg, so I am forced to private pay, $400.00 plus, every month.  Shame on UnitedHealth Care and Blue Cross/Blue Shield Alliance!  My doctor knows what is best for his patients, not you!

I had bad hoarseness. It felt like I was losing my voice! I have a very bad throat pain and alot of mucus sticks in my throat! It's very annoying! I went to ENT doctor. He checked my vocal cord. It was little swollen. He said I have bad acid reflux. Everytime I eat, the acid kept getting into my throat and it irritating my vocal cord. He prescribed me Omeprazole at first. It didn't help, it gave me very bad headaches as a side effects. I stopped and took Pantaprozole. It didn't help at all! I stopped taking it. I decided to give Prevacid a try. I just started and I hope taking Prevacid once a day will help to heal and to reduce my throat pain and hoarseness!

The problem worsened as I got older and the antacids no longer were effective. The problem got so bad that I was losing my voice often and thought I had problem with my voicebox. I went to the doctor where he explained that it was probably the acid getting into my throat and irritating my voicebox. I had even started losing weight because I did not want to eat much any more because of the burning and pain. As soon as I started taking the prevacid, the burning started to go away and within a month, I felt as good as new. I have started eating again, working out without feeling sick, and I have my voice back. This has been a terrific drug. The only problem now is that my cost has gone up due to my prescription coverage changing and it is now going to cost $100 per month instead of the $20 per month I was paying last year. This is going to be a problem for me. Anything that can be done to reduce the cost on this medication will help greatly. I do not want the heartburn to return..

The acid in my stomach was reduced and the medicine worked great.  The side efeects were horrible.  I had no appetite -lost eight pounds.  Stools were bright yellow, I am told because food was passed through the digestive tract too quickly.  I had severe anxiety and felt like I had the flu most of the time.  Now I take Zantac 150 mg twice dailyper MD order  It doesn;t work as well but I fell 100 % better.  My esophagus seems to be healing very slowly. I can not wait until I am better.

Made a couple of trips to the emergency room for stomach pains before starting the drug.  Take drug when I experience the onset of the pain and always ends within 10 to 30 minutes.  Take sometimes as a preventative measure but never more than a few days in a row.  Tends to cause constipation in me if I take on a regular basis-terrible!  A great drug for me personally.

Inflammation of the Esophagus with Erosion	foggydawn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	12/30/2009 7:06:32 AM	Taking Prevacid Solutabs allows my esophagus and throat to heal, they don't burn or ache, hoarseness decreases and sensation returns. There is still some acid reflux if I eat after 8 PM, or eat too much fat. {Or eat gluten or other substance I am intolerant of.} Nexium might have worked better for me if I wasn't allergic to the dyes used in the capsules. Side effects include: stinging of mouth and throat, drowsiness for the first couple of days, extreme nipple sensitivity and initiation of lactation. (My friend was given this med to help her milk come in after a premature birth. It didn't work for her.}  I take it at least an hour before dinner, as my greatest symptoms are at night. After a month or two of treatment, swollen, itchy nipples cause me to stop taking Prevacid. This symptom subsides after a week or two and I start it up again because I am getting acid backwash in my mouth at night by that time.  I saw a doctor while I was visiting France and he indicated that I should only take this for two months, and then be reevaluated, in case something else  needed to be done. He also said to change BMI from 30 to 24, as that would be healthier and might improve the GERD more than medication.

Tried others, but they didn't work as well. I absolutely never have heartburn anymore or acid reflux.  It is a good medicine and if you are suffering with acid reflux or GERD I would recommend asking your doctor about using Prevacid!

I am now experiencing swollen ankles and sharp pain in my lower back, thighs and back of knees. I stopped taking Previcid over the weekend so I could take Aleve for the pain. I noticed that after stopping Previcid, my ankle swelling went down, and the pains in my legs subsided. I took Previcid this morning, and the swelling and pain is back. It is interesting that I now have side effects after 4 years of use. Am going to the Dr's to find out if it is indeed, the Previcid that is causing all of this. From what I have read, it is highly possible. What a bummer! as Previcid has been 100% effective in treating my acid reflux. 
Stomach Ulcer from Aspirin or Ibuprofen-Like Drugs	ageorge, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	9/27/2009 6:55:54 AM	After suffering from food getting stuck in my esophagus and an endoscopy done, gastritis and small ulcers were detected, thus the Dr. prescribed this medicine.Although I had no symptoms other than the food problem, I took the medicine.  After a week or so, I developed severe diarrhea &amp; called the doctor.  Without an answer, I did my own research, and found this can cause a problem with microsopic colitis.  I was diagnoised with lymphocytic colitis a year ago.  Since stopping the medicine 3 days ago, the diarrhea has almost stopped. Why if it is a rare side effect, does the doctor ignore symptoms?  Thank God for the Internet!

Worked fine until now.  Now I am experiencing side effects such as stomach ache and nausea.  Told 2 different doctors and they said to take more previcid.  Increased my dosage to 60mg (2 capsules) per day and started to itch terribly.  Stopped taking it and the itching went away and it seems like my stomach aches and nausea are getting better day by day.  I think doctor's don't know enough about many many drugs.  They just prescribe them cause some drug sales rep comes in their office and probabloy gives them some kind of kickback to put people on drugs.  Doctors don't care about side effects in my case.  If you really want to know about drugs and their side effects, talk to your pharmacist.  They went to school only to learn about drugs.  Like I said, doctor's don't know enough about drugs.

I started taking this medicine reluctantly when my insurance company raised the co-pay on Nexium I had been taking for ten years.  I loved Nexium, but am very pleased with the Prevacid.  It is wonderful.  I can eat anything, as long as I remember to take Prevacid regularly. I can be a normal person and sleep well, without waking up to heartburn.

I am able to tolerate all types of foods which means I can enjoy going out to eat anywhere! I take one pill first thing in the morning and am able to eat either right away or sometime later. I am able to take it with either my morning coffee or water. When the Rx had to be refilled and my insurance company gave me and my doctor a hard time, I had to either carry the antacids with me and take them all day or decide not to eat. Once I was able to resume my regiment of a daily dose, I am now able to not be concerned with wether or not I have the antacids with me or not. This medication, to me, is a God-send! Until I lose a minimum of 25 lbs., I will need to take this medication. The likelihood of me losing ANY weight is a constant battle so I more than likely will be taking this the rest of my life. It is a safe drug and my bloodwork shows NO ill effects whatsoever. I have been taking this for over a year. I highly recommend this to anyone who has GERD.

Interestingly, Prevacid's listed side effects include severe diarrhea, which is interesting since I have had no problem. Nexium caused the most problems as far as diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps for me. What this means is if one type of proton pump inhibitor doesn't work for you, keep trying!

I suddenly lost my hearing loss 8 years ago after receiving Zithromax 5 times in 2 years, while I was on Prevacid.  Doctors should be informed of this bad combination and drug companies need to know how this affects all other medications as well.  I have been on Prevacid for about 10 years, and now have to be careful never to take antibiotics or pain medications so I won't lose the rest of my hearing.

My dad uses it because it was the only thing that worked for him and he had Barret's Esophagus. I was using OTC but they seemed to stop being so effective. The only reson the ins. companies don't want you to take it for a long time is because they don't want to pay for it since there is no generic. I haven't really noticed any side effects.  Very easy to use.

I don't eat spicy foods, but what I did eat would find its way up my throat at night, and almost kill me in my sleep.  Sore throats, coughing.  I would try to sleep sitting up!!When I finally got health ins. I told my dr about it and she put me on Prevacid and lo and behold...As long as I take it everyday in the morning about 30 minutes before breakfast, I do well.  I've been told by my ins co that they also don't think I should be on it this long and I should try something else (things I've tried earlier).I get mine free after I satisfy my ins deductible.  
Excessive Production of Stomach Acid	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/24/2008 5:19:51 PM	This medicine has been the only one to work without the side effects of others. The only thing is, I have experienced a headache every day that I take it. I don't seem to have a headache when I do not take it, but the symptoms return after a couple of days. I have decided to try taking it every other day.
Inflammation of the Esophagus with Erosion	Dusty, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	45-54	6/16/2008 6:49:22 AM	I have been having nasty side effects from all the acid reflux meds I have tried thus far. Prevacid gives me a constant headache and makes my head feel like lead, I feel drugged, it is difficult to think or partake in daily activities. Forget about my passion of cycling or doing much of anything....I just want to sleep. Typing this was difficult because of how spaced I feel.

Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		4/19/2008 8:16:58 PM	I have been taking Prevacid for 10 years.  It works best when I don't overdo on the fried foods and just plain eat too much.  Lately, my insurance sent me a letter saying that I should not be on this type of medication this long.  So with the help of some digestive enzymes I am trying them.  I am in misery, heartburn so bad I am drinking  7up, soda and taking tums.  I'm going to my doctor to find out if there are any dangers and try and go back to Prevacid.  Heartburn is bad enough, I just don't want the acid reflux.

I couldn't believe how much better I felt on it. Then my insurance lapsed and I had to stop it. Now I really notice how much it helped because I'm having such a terrible time with the acid now. I'm trying to start my insurance back up on 4/1 and can't wait to go back on it and get my life back! It's worth every penny of the cost! (I really wish I could afford it now, $175 for 30 pills.) 
Excessive Production of Stomach Acid	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	3/23/2008 1:31:36 AM	I took Prilosec/Prevacid for 7 years and found that when you try to wean off you'll experience acid rebound and it's 100x worse than regular reflux. It made me extremely sick.  I also found out that I have osteoporosis after years of taking these pills and have since read articles linking these drugs to bone loss. If you have reflux, you may want to have a HIDA  scan to check your gallbladder. About a year ago, I had my gallbladder removed and the reflux is almost gone &amp; can be controlled with just Zantac.

I have taken all of the ppi meds and experienced different side effects from all but prevacid. The only downfall which now I guess is a blessing is that I gained weight again from being able to add foods back into my diet that I had not ate for 2 years because of acid reflux. I know alot of people on this medicine and they all have had great results with it also.

Almost every night, burning sludge would push up into my mouth and wake me. During the day, it was like fire in my chest, and it didn't matter how little or how bland I ate. After years of suffering with over-the-counter items that didn't work, I finally mentioned it to my doctor. 100% fixed, absolutely no more problems, no matter what I eat. Concerning the cost, when I lost my job and had to reduce expenses, I found that I could go 3 days per capsule before the burning chest returned. Thank you Prevacid.

Works extremely well when taken every day for heartburn and acid reflux or GERD. I like the disintegrating tablet more since it doesn't have to be swallowed and you can take it on the go, but they work equally well. This is a great medicine.
