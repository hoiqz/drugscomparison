Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	35-44	6/15/2012 1:09:38 AM	This medication made me have such vivid dreams/nightmares that I could not tell upon waking if it was a dream/nightmare or a reality.  The horrible nightmares were so vivid.  I rarely had nightmares before so this was a very scary thing.  I would wake in the middle of the night &amp; have to check things or even call family/friends to see if they were OK.  I honestly could not differentiate between reality &amp; these nightmares.

I haven't seen any other comments regarding this but I have noticed an increase in libido.  I have not had a drug that had this effect on me before.  I take 1/2 a 200 mg pill 1st thing in the morning which is about 5:30 am and 1/2 around noon.  By 10:00 it is all I can think about.  It is not too bad when I am working but if I am not distracted, it is almost like a yearning or need.  I guess if a drug is going to have a side effec, this one is not too bad.
Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day	Janie H, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/2/2012 1:42:22 AM	I take this medication for chronic fatigue caused by Hep C and Fibromyalgia.  I wake up tired and can not even function until Ive had at least a pot of coffee.  I fall asleep instantly if I sit longer then 10 minutes no matter where Im at whether it be a restaurant or Doctors office etc.  Since I started my pain control it has helped me a lot in that I can get out and exercise now which seems to help with the fatigue. At first I didnt notice any difference in my level of energy when I started the provilgil but what I did notice was if I had to take a long drive it kept me awake.  It doesnt give me tons of extra energy but I dont need to nap any more during the day when I take it and I have quit drinking so much coffee in the mornings.  I did notice however that I have to take breaks from it for it to remain effective.  I now only take it if I have a full day planned and have to go out, otherwise I stay at home and take a nap.  I take 200mg in the am and it does not interfere at all with my sleep at night.  I was thinking about asking my Dr. to give me another 200mg for the afternoon but because I have Hep C I worry about the effects on my liver especially because the other meds I take are so damaging.  I have not had any side effects from it at all.  Today I was given the generic form (Modafinil) for the first time and I hope it is the same.  I hear many complaints of how expensive it is and I know a 30 day supply is over $600.00 but luckily I have good insurance and paid roughly $20.00 for Provigil and $5.00 for the generic.  I would definitely recommend anyone with a fatigue problem try this.  Its better then caffeine with no jitters or feelings of anxiety. 
Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day	KSN, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/9/2012 12:29:14 PM	I commented previously but failed to mention the main reason for this medicine and how I take it.  I am using a cpap, and I have incredible urges to fall asleep sometimes even standing up. I yawn alot during certain periods of the day. Always have.  My husband gets sick and tired of me being tired all the time and particularly hates it when I have to have a nap.  Laziness is the first opinion.  Then comes the &quot;you need to get out more&quot; and &quot;you need more exercise&quot;.  I know those are both good advice but they change nothing.  Although I don't fall asleep while exercising.  But the lethargy makes it difficult to really get into it.  My Dr. did eventually put me on 200 mg a day twice a day.  Suggesting the second dose be given part way through the day when I need to be awake.  I've never had the effectiveness deteriorate in the several years I've taken it.  It's had a super positive effect on the marriage.  However I have had a cup of coffee a couple times a day with it with no lasting effects. Not a habbit, just more social.  Caffeine had never kept me awake at night, ever.  Sorry this isn't brief.  But I wanted to make sure someone thinking about taking this consider trying it for a little while at least.  The headache side effect has been sporadic for me.  But still totally worth taking this medication. I should mention we have no insurance.  HORRIBLE price, but necessary.
Sleepiness Due To Obstructive Sleep Apnea	KSN, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	4/9/2012 12:00:02 PM	It's just enough to keep me from the &quot;need&quot; to take a nap or fall asleep.  Makes all the difference in the world for working and quality time with family and in social situations.  Helps with alertness, yet never jittery.  I skip using it when I don't &quot;need&quot; to for work or family occasions. It's so expensive.  When you don't have insurance the price is horrible.  The pharmaceutical companies should be ashamed for the pricing of this medicine.  Greed, pure and simple.  The people that need it REALLY need it to have any quality of life at all.  Even one of my Dr's said there was no excuse for it.  You don't often hear that.  If you think you may need this kind of help, try it.  You may get some of your life back.

I take 200mg a day. My Dr. suggest that I take a small nap in between the day to help with my sleeping condition. I first began on Provigil but insurance changed and they changed it to the generic brand. I would like to return back to provigil. Overall it does the job, and all meds have a side effect. 
Other	juliusgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	11/7/2010 11:04:05 AM	I have had a sleep disorder which no one wants to name for 3-4 years which includes bouts of sleep lasting 3-5 days w/o any waking (or stage 4 sleep apparently)- not even to urinate - followed by a few hazy hours of bumping into walls and an inabilty to form sentences. So far all docs want to do is either tell me it's in my head or medicate my symptoms or both - no doc seems willing to try to find out what is causing these symptoms (that have me miserably in debt, jobless, friendless, etc. and barely leaving my mother's house where i remain at the age of 30) beyond the VERY BASIC bloodwork. So for the past 3 years or so its been adderall which is maddening because the xr makes me sick and the fda limit on the regular tabs (60mg/day) only keep me alert for 8-9 hours and give me anxiety like you wouldn't believe. Provigil is a good alternative but for some reason it stops working after 2 o doc about 3 days and I end up in a 3-day sleep. Then it works fine again. It's not reliable enough for me to start working even part time, though. I was thinking about asking my doc about combining the two - either the provigil (or nuvigil) for a few days and then the adderall or having the adderall boost the provigil when i need it. Has anyone tried this? Is it even safe? Btw, while I'm posting here, is anyone aware of a sleep doc who takes insurance somewhere around the east coast who would take the time to help me with my &quot;mystery diagnosis?&quot; I know this is not the appropriate forum but I'm desperate. In a nutshell, my review/advice: if nu/pro vigil works, take it and don't start with the adderall - especially if you have underlying anxiety. It has a very short shelf life and a hard come-down: every day.

She had been suffering with falling asleep during school and missing child acivities since 2006. She was perscribed Xyrem @ night with her CPAP. During the day she was given Provigil 2x's daily &amp; Effexor XR. Since on these meds(Aug 2009)she has been the happy, cheerful child she deserves to be. These meds were an answer to our prayers! Since June 2010, her dad lost his job so no more insurance. I applied w/ Cephalon Cares to get Provigil for her but they denied her since she is a child and said it is not recommended for children. Shouldn't it be based on the needs to be a normal child and have the energy to enjoy being a kid! I will fight for her to have this back!

Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	5/28/2010 9:52:48 PM	I have been through 2 sleep studies and I wasn't quite a match for the CPAP machine but according to my doctor at the Mayo Clinic, there is obviously something wrong with how tired i am and how easily i can fall asleep. This medication has worked very nicely. Except every 3 weeks or so I take a weekend off from taking it. It seems like the effectiveness wears off. After I skip a couple days it works great again.I have read the other comments and totally agree regarding the absurd cost of this medicine. Why isn't there a cheaper generic available? My insurance covered it until just this year. It's insane! I'm working with my doctor to try to find an alternative but when you factor in the office visit copays to tritrate the medicine or try something else...i don't know if it's worth it. I have to say because of the medication I am able to function, drive, play with my children. When I don't take it even for a day, every goes to pot. I can't even think of household object's names like couch, chair, basket. But seriously, I think the drug company has made enough off of this medicine. I know they use their profits for research and development of new medicines but stop bleeding us dry! Their are many people like me who NEED this medicine. It helps them live and function. COME OUT WITH A LOW COST, INSURANCE APPROVED GENERIC ALREADY!!!! It's coming down to paying for this medicine or the mortgage...sorry, my kids need a roof over their head. I have to stop taking this. Shame on the big drug companies for making people choose...functionality or food.  I wonder, do the CEO's from the big drug companies take their notes from the CEO's of the big oil companies? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....

I complained to doctors about fatigue just to hear them say that I'm depressed or I need to exercise more. My 1st sleep study was about 20 yrs ago and was told it was &quot;a sleep apnea&quot;. The drug prescribed had one side effect, cariovascular disease. So, then I had high cholesteral and the drug was taken off the market. I've narrowly escaped many wrecks while driving, gone to sleep at work-STANDING UP,talking to people, walking, during sex (bummer), on the back of a motor cycly,and any time I was still more than a few seconds and sometimes while moving. I finally found a sleep specialist that put me three 2 night time studies and 1 day time. I have narcolepsy (without cataplaxy). It was a relief to finally know for sure. He prescribed Provigil and it changed my life. I take 400 mg in split doses. 200 in the AM and 200 around 1 or 2 PM most of the time. Sometimes I don't need the 2nd dose. Sometimes even the 2nd dose won't keep me awake but those time are rare and are usually preceded by a really bad night. On week-ends, at least 1 day, I take a &quot;drug holiday&quot; and sleep that day away. I'm 67 yrs old, fairly healthy, still working full-time and have no plans to retire soon. I've been taking Provigil for 4 yrs with NO adverse effects. This drug is my miracle.
