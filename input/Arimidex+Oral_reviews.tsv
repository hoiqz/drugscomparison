Constipation,headaches,dizziness,muscle aches,can't sleep at night,tired all the time ! Only been on it 2 months so I ma not sure it has been effective for treating the cancer spot on my C-7 vertebrea. I had stage 2 Breast Cancerin 5/2004 and had chemo,mastectomyand radiation. And everything was fine until I statrted to have back pain and went to the DR and had a bone scan and a MRI in May/2012 and that is when the sopt on my spine was dicovered.     Going for another Bone scan and MRI at the end of this month to find out if Arimedex( I take the generic and it is only $20.11 at Wal-Mart) 
Breast Cancer	vhindel, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	8/30/2012 4:16:15 PM	I had a mastectomy (L breast) and this is what my doctor put me on. I had 1 lip-node taken out and it was negative. I've been taking the med for 2 months and can say (at least for now) I've been satisfied. I do have hot flashes, joint pain and get tired terribly easy (dr says I'm severely anemic and I will be starting an Iron drip next month). If this is the only side effects I have and the cancer doesn't come back, I'll be HAPPY !!

I have had every side effect except bleeding.  I  stopped taking it 1 month ago.  I am still experiencing SEVERE burning bone pain.  Pain meds are ineffective.  Memory problems are present.  Weight gain is a problem.  Sleep is a problem.  Jesus is my only hope!

Would like an answer to this question.
Breast Cancer	Turtle, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	55-64	6/19/2012 11:45:51 AM	I was diagnosed in July 2010 with stage 1 lobular carcinoma.  After a lumpectomy, I had 36 treatments of radiation.  I have been taking Arimidex since November of 2010, along with an anti-depressant, Effexor.  I have experienced nausea (which has lessoned over time) and also joint pain.  The joint pain started slowly in an elbow joint and now is in just about every joint in my body.  My fingers are stiff in the morning and swollen (I have taken my rings off).  I have gained weight, but feel that has been a direct result of my feeling tired alot and not exercising like I should.  I broke my shoulder in March of 2011 and my Dr. immediately did a bone density test and found that I was fine.  While I am not enjoying the side-effects,  I realize that lobular breast cancer is one that recurs more frequently and I will be continuing the Arimidex because of that.  I have also read that those of us that experience joint pain are less likely to have a recurrence of the cancer after taking the Arimidex.  
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	6/5/2012 2:20:59 PM	I've used this for 5 months.  Initially, swollen hands/feet and lots of bone/joint pain.  No hair thinning, no libido either.  But hot flashes/night sweats.  Pain in hands, feet, and hips.  From reading a drug side effect list of other AI drugs, this looks to have the least problems.  Trying to figure out the best pain management approach. Finally, I answered that this has been highly effective, but not can't really tell if it is or not.  Only 55 more months to go...then I should know if it's effective or not.

I have been on Arimidex for 1 yr. and the pain, joint swelling, sleepless nights have just about taken their toll on me. My joints in my hands are hard balls and I can't open my hands fully anymore.  The arthritis has increased in my feet, am going to have bone fusion surgery in the upcoming month due to the severe pain and significant deteriation noted through x-rays. (in only 1 yr. on this drug)  Breast cancer, then this the rest of my life?..not sure what I will do. My fingers have deformed and it is very painful going about my daily routine.  I was a very active mother of 4, tennis everyday, still full of life outwardly,  I have a high tolerance for pain, never complained about chemo, radiation...etc.  This has changed my life more than all of that, just doesn't seem right that this is keeping me alive, but my quality of life suffers more and more everyday I'm on this drug.   Will be meeting with my oncologist this week for other options I have heard are no better. Don't misunderstand as I am grateful to be alive!

Horrible joint pain especially in my wrist, hands and fingers, insomnia, hot flashes and burning skin. I have turned into a 100 year old female within the last year and a half. I think the doctors that prescribe this beast should have to take it themselves. Maybe they would get clue on how terrible we feel.

I was forced into menopause and had hot flashes every 5 mins with Tamxofin. Stopped it. I'm now taking Arimidex and so far so good.  I think it makes a difference with side effects if you start this medication while you are going through chemo and radiaation. My cancer is in 3 spots but has not spread.  The hardest part is this just wait and see it the drug works.  Luckily, my Dr. did a blood test with a tumor marker so we have a starting point.  As long as everything stays put and just shrinks I'm good. I do everything I can combat side effects. If you ache, take Motrin or Aleve. Get moving, eat right. If you are doing chemo, after 48 hrs, the drugs have done their work.  Get into a hot tub or suana and get that stuff out of your system.  The quicker it leaves you body the better.  Take a good multi vitamin, Vit. D and B. Advocate for yourself.  I went to the Mayo for a 2nd opin and they agreed with the treatment My Dr. suggested.  Everyday is a gift.  I have a 13yr.old to raise yet and 4 grandchildren. I'm going to live life and fight all the way!

The only problem I have is some moderate pain in my right hand and right wrist which started recently. I have been having good labs and had two good scans in Jan. this year. I feel so far it is working for me.

I feel like one of the lucky ones have no real side effects...with the expection of hair loss and and bone loss in my spine. I have no pain to speak of, no hot flashes, slight numbness in my left foot which i had after chemo. I can continue after 5 yrs if i choose to do so. any comments from experienced fellow Arimidex takers.

HOWEVER, I have a very smart oncologist who, in addition to the Arimidex, prescribed ZOMETA treatments for me every 3 months during this time.  Some docs, I've heard, recommend them monthly, but my doc says that every 3 months is effective and eliminates the side effect of bone loss in the jaw that the monthly treatments have caused with some patients.  ZOMENTA puts calcium back in the body that Arimidex leaches out.  Good luck to all and hopefully your doc will prescribe the Zometa for you, too!
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	peanutgirl,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		3/30/2012 10:39:43 AM	When I saw my oncologist a month after starting this medication I asked him if it was working. He said he had no way of knowing for the individual patient. In the clinical trials it reduced the risk of recurrence in 1/2 of the women but not in the other half and he could not tell which category I fell into. 6 weeks after I started the medication I developed a strong metallic taste in my mouth so that it was impossible to eat or drink anything but water and a soft boiled egg. My doctor had never heard of this side effect. When I researched it on the internet I found the symptom sometimes occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy (when your hormones are chaotic) or could be due to a deficiency in zinc. I self prescribed zinc which seemed to address the taste problem; I now take a zinc supplement daily. My cholesterol levels have gone from 200 to 250 in only three months and I have gained 10 lbs that I can't seem to lose despite good diet and exercise. I have osteopenia and am being watched for further bone density loss; so far it is minimal. I do bone pounding exercises (running, jumping rope and jumping jacks) to improve bone density. I am working on my balance to avoid the falls that can be so dangerous for women of my age (65) and diagnosis.
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Koagal, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	3/18/2012 7:11:26 AM	Iam new to this medication.  I started taking arimidex about 3 weeks ago.  I just turned 47 and for my birthday I had my fallopian and ovaries remove.  Breast cancer is prevailant in my family.  But only after 3 weeks,  I notice that I have been getting dizzy and have terrible cramping in my feet and lower legs!  I do have the fatique and bloated feeling in my stomach.  So, is there something else that I could take?  This drug is worse than all the treatment that I went through.  I also am experiencing lower back pain.  I have a young son, so I'll do whatever it takes to survive. But it isn't limited to taking this drug! I've read all the comments and it frightens me!  3 years of hell now this!  I'll give it until my 3 month check up to decide if this drug is right for me!
Breast Cancer	KC gal, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	3/13/2012 12:14:03 PM	Diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in July 2011.  Surgery to remove mass and took out 4 lymph nodes.  Lymph nodes were negative but could not get clear tissue around the mass.  Had mastectomy in Sept. 2011.  Surgeon did not see any need for chemo or radiation. Breast tissued tested and only a 10% chance of recurring. Sent to ongologist and I'll have to say he was the most arrogant doctor ever.  He demanded I take arimidex to rid my body of the estrogren, even though I'm 67 years old and my ovaries are completely dried up, they do not even show up on a c-scan.  He also wanted me to take Fosmax to increase my bone density.  I took Armidex for one month and all the side effects listed I had them.  Dr. said I had to stay on this.  Tried for another month and the side effects got worse.  Extreme anxity and depression, joint pain so bad I couldn't walk, can't sleep, body aches and muscle pain real bad.  I have irratible bowel anyway and it has really messed me up.  My gut hurts all day no matter what I eat.  I switched to another oncologist and she says the benefit far outweighs the side effects.  Been off the meds for 6 weeks and not much improvement yet.  I will never take Foxamax after learning the high risk of its side effects and the class action law suit now is progress.  Get on the web and get all  the horrible info. about this.   Know a woman who took this and almost died from the holes it ate in her stomach and gut.  I will take my chances without the meds and try to get my life back.  I'd rather have a few years of quality life than live like this. I think drs. want to scare us into taking these meds and they're always pushing pills at us. Most days can't even get out of bed.  I was in good health until this happened. Glad some of you are not suffering.  Hang in there girls!
Breast Cancer	ootw, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/4/2012 4:59:09 PM	I have been most fortunate as I am almost finished with my drug therapy, have had my first mamogram since surgery (all clear) and have had no known side effects; if the small amount of fatigue is from the medication, I can live with that until my therapy with the drug is complete; then be amazed when the fatigue disappears.  this has been a very successful drug in my particular case
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	sback, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	45-54	2/22/2012 11:40:14 PM	I took Arimidex for a year and a half following three years on Tamoxifen.  The side effects were pretty bad.  It caused me to develop some pretty bad arthritis and joint pain as well as weight gain and depression.  I have broken both legs in the following years even though my bone density scans fall around the normal range.  I also had a tremendous problem with my tendons swelling and being painful and suffered a partial tear in my Achilles tendon that required surgery and being in a wheelchair and cast for several months.  I stopped taking it when my other leg felt like it was having the same problems.  I switched to Femara for the remainder of my treatment and was much more satisfied with it.  It has been 8 1/2 years that I have been free from cancer but am now undergoing tests as we feel my cancer may have returned.  Glad to have had the 8 years but 5 of them were in pretty bad pain.

Some aches in a hip and knee, lack of sex drive, minor hot flashes occasionally, that I have experienced all could be due to regular aging, my pre-existing overweight and lack of exercise.  So far this med has not bothered me.  Wondering if hair grows back after being off this drug. Hopefully, this will be the only problem for next three and a half years of treatment. Also wondering what effect the removal of estrogen will have on our hearts. Will be praying for all who have had difficulty with this drug, to be blessed with comfort and good health.  Also, will be exercising! 
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	Janice Fields, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	1/31/2012 7:12:38 PM	I am 63 and found I had breast cancer at 60. Had lumpectomy, 6 chemos over 7 months (carboplatin, docetaxol, nausea med, Herceptin IV's, and a Neurlasta shot), followed by 8 more IV's of Herceptin over 8 months, along with 31 radiation treatments, at last one 1miligram Arimidex I'm to take for 5 years daily. My complaint is that I was completely bald all over, but was told that as soon as I finished the 6-5hour chemos, my hair would come back in. It didn't. It started coming in fairly evenly during radiation; it was short but kinda thick by May, 2011. I had started daily Arimidex (generic) about June 2010. A month ago, I was looking at some old pics made in May2011, and it started to hit me that my hair was thicker with more coverage than NOW (Jan. 2012). It was heartbreaking, it was becoming thinner and patchier on top front where you want it the most. I accidentally happened on a site, read that 40 or more women sharing this experience, and most believed it was the Arimidex. I tried generic Femara for 2 mo. with no improvement. I have aches and pains and feel &quot;aged from the inside out&quot;. I have serious pschological issues, and I think if I'm gonna KEEP 10 extra pounds in my stomach and be half-bald, I might just drop the Arimidex, take no &quot;cancer&quot; pill, and pray it won't come back. It was ductal, stage 1. .4cm, not in nodes;however I was positive for estrogen, progesterone, and Her2neu at 2.5 which showed up ONLY in the biopsy. Two sample of teeny tumor sent to 2 great labs, and I was negative for her2neu. But I took the Herceptin on advice of Dr. Now, I'm thinking that I had dramatic and long &quot;everything they could throw at me&quot; treatment, supposedly bringing me to only a 10% chance of recurrence; I was told the Arimidex takes me down to only 2%. The only thing sounding slightly negative about my &quot;tumor&quot; had &quot;poorly differentiated margins&quot;, but my surgeon went well beyond the margins. So, I might just stop this PILL that hurts me and makes me OLD with no hair. Okay
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	1/28/2012 1:18:28 PM	Taking this med for approx. 2 months.Extreme lower back pain 2 weeks after started, brushed it off. At this point just using my arms is very painful. My shoulders are in extreme pain. Talked to oncologist nurse and am changing to another but as of today I just want to cry I am sick of all this pain. Did not have any of this before!! I am in no way a baby, and can handle pain but even I have reached my limits. Hope this helps someone else who is experiencing the same issues with this drug. I made it through the battle of cancer for this??  Hopefully the next drug will not be like this!

I had a lumpectomy followed by chemo and radiation.  I've been taking this medication since March, 2008.  The main side effect I have experienced is joint and bone pain.  After sitting for a period of time I feel achy and struggle somewhat to stand up.  My bone density is now at 2.3 with 2.5 being osteoporosis.  I was prescribed Fosamax but cannot take it because it caused me to have severe gas pains. I will continue to take Arimidex for 2 more years with the hope that it will help to prevent a recurrence.  Not sure about taking another osteoporosis medication.

I am not sure that I will after reading the comments. I already have osteopenia, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and vaginal dryness. They are all under control with meds. I do not want to start having problems in these areas or create new problems for myself. I am so afraid of taking this now.

Now my thumb is locking up and I had no idea it was from the Rx until reading the other reviews. I am achy after sitting for a short time and have really sharp pain in the back of my hand sometimes when I pick something up, even a cup of coffee. My cholesterol/triglycerides are rising tho I've never had a problem before. I'm glad to know I'm not just being a complainer without reason. I just hope it doesn't get progressively worse. The prospect of the cancer coming back is more scary than the thought of more side effects. I am lucky to have a supportive, patient husband. God Bless all of you and keep the faith!

Hair is still okay after 1+ year of treatment.

Huge side effects and it takes almost 6 months to adjust physically and mentally.  It takes a very positive attitude to continue and not to give up.  I discussed often with the oncologist.  Still have side effects, such as somnolence, insomnia and loss of energy, hairloss, but it is better than the alternatives, considering my condition.  All I can say to women who start out with this medication &quot;hang in there, eventually it will get better&quot;....If nauseated, because that also happens in the beginning, drink ginger ale, or chew ginger gum.

Breast Cancer	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	9/29/2011 2:32:06 PM	I had less than stage 1 breast cancer.  Lumpectomy and radiation and then began taking Arimidex.  After one week I lost my will to live. Depression, joint pain so severe I could not sleep. After 9 days I stopped on my own.  Dr. is recommending Tamoxofen but reviews are similar with side effects so I am going to heal with vitamins, exercise and diet.

After a few months, I began to have significant breathing problems on exertion. My oncologist said it wasn't the pill.  But after every test known to modern medicine, it appears to be the pill.  Now off of it for 3 1/2 months, I feel back to normal.  Now I have no idea what to do.

My doctor is now trying me on Femara due to chance of cancer returning.  Don't like the thoughts of another medication but am willing to give it a try and prayerfully the side effects won't be as severe.

Breast Cancer	Kelly, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	55-64	9/2/2011 12:56:54 PM	Early stage BC and the tumor was small. Biopsy Nov 2010, Lumpectomy Dec 2010. Radiation Feb-March 2011.  OncoType DX test results showed I was at low risk of the cancer coming back. I had reservations about Arimidex  because of the bone loss. I already have osteoporosis, but the oncologist insisted I had to take it. Said I had &quot;no choice&quot;. I started taking the generic form at the end of April 2011 and within two weeks started getting bad side effects.Pain in my arms and legs (couldn't stand for more than 5 mins), especially knees and elbows which swelled up. Dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headache (which went away eventually,) not sleeping, blurred vision, depression, absolutely no appetite, weight loss, hair loss, affected breast swelled up and was very painful. Then I started to get tingling and numbness in my hand which went up my arm. The patient information says this is an &quot;unlikely but very serious side affect&quot; and to call doctor immediately.Oncologist said to stop taking it and see if the side effects go away. They did, and she said that I didn't need to take it. Said I was borderline whether I needed to or not. Hmmm. She didn't put me on anything else.Anyway I know some are asking what happens when you stop taking it and I am happy to report that all the side effects have gone, although the appetite is taking a while to come back, but I feel better than I have in a very long time. Of course I was only on it for a little over two months.Good luck and bottom line. Make your doctor listen to you.
Breast Cancer	lydian, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	45-54	8/31/2011 9:11:24 PM	Diagnosed with Invasive Lobular Carcinoma III Jan 2010-chemo Feb to Jun 2010-double mastectomy Jul 2010-radiation therapy Sept to Oct 2010 - began taking Arimidex October 2010.  Immediate side affects joint/bone pain especially after sitting awhile and sleeping.  July 2011 began gaining weight, difficulty falling and staying asleep additional side affects.  I Cannot imagine another 4 plus years of this.  I see my oncologist the end of this month and will likely cease taking - difficult to weigh the risks of recurrence against quality of existence.  Very unhappy.
Locally Advanced Breast Carcinoma	jnewville, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	8/31/2011 1:00:11 AM	I had invasive lobular carcinoma- bilateral mastectomy w/axillary pad removal, sentinal removal~ 4 of 8 nodes involved- 6 chemos/33 radiation treatments. Was first put on Aromasin-started having diarrhea, doc said once started, that doesn't go away; put me on tamoxifen started having pain &amp; bad migraines.  Doctor changed it to EVISTA, much, much better.  It is an estrogen blocker with bone builder in it.  Has been around a long time used for bone health.  I also have osteopenia from the chemo.  Side effects not so bad.  Doctor said my bones had improved &amp; to keep doing what I was doing.  I also take 18,000 units Vit. D3 each day, morning, noon &amp; night split.  My D levels were just about middle, but in the good range.Then NEW oncologist wanted me on aromatose inhibitor; my former experiences were ignored. They put on tamoxifen, side effects worse, 10 lb. weight gain in 1 month, can't get it off, lots of pain, headaches; then put on Arimidex- pain in bones so bad in the a.m. I could hardly stand, knees, all joints, hands...gave me neuropothy in 3 toes on each foot, from little toe in, STILL hasn't gone away. I had more weight gain, brain fog, felt like I walked like an old person, felt myself going into a deep hole (depression), on Effexor XR, both arms went numb and tightness across my chest, hands went numb &amp; my radiation oncologist asked me why I was slurring my speech. I had to work to put words &amp; sentences together, I put it together &amp; stopped taking it, I could actually feel the fog lifting. I still have some symptoms. First oncologist opened back up, I went back and he put me back on Evista!   Do not take this medicine, not worth it!!  I was diagnosed &amp; had sugery in 11/06!

Started Tomaxafin for one month, became exhausted, joint pain and vomiting.  Decided quality of life is more important to me.  I have chosen not to take any drugs and have discussed this with my doctor and am due for further discussion end of July.

Prescribed in '07 after left breast removal. Had 1 yr of chemo and 7 weeks of radiation. Cancer and removal of right breast in Dec '09. Another year of chemo and 7 weeks of radiation. All the while taking the Arimidex. I experienced every joint, back, leg, knee,neck, arm, feet, etc, pain you can imagine. I have hurt in places I did not know could hurt. Headaches, moodiness, unable to walk too far, stand or sit too long, many sleepless nights. Extended stomach (shaped like Santa Claus), no energy, tearful, just unable to be my old self. Regardless as to how much I try to explain all of the pains I have, I cannot describe the severity or the sudden strike of pain and general effect of this medication. But, I continued to take it. In a few days I will begin taking Aromasin. My doctor thinks this may help with side effects. We will see! But, if it does not, I wiil continue to take it, praying that God will work through the medication and keep the cancer away!

The hot flashes and night sweats were the worst for me, even with Effexor I still had many per day, and they were unbearable! I had very little joint pain, but gained about 10 lbs, that I can't get rid of. I'm very glad to be done with this drug, and the good news is that I'm still cancer free. But, am wondering what side effects I should expect to experience for  a while, now that I have stopped it, just 4 days ago. I'm feeling very depressed right now, and don't know if this is normal. I was told that I didn't need to taper off, so I didn't, but the heat is still awful, and I really am not feeling well. I wonder how long it will still be in my system.....

I had a mastectomy, with no chemotherapy or radiation treatment needed afterwards, for which I will always be grateful. My main problem with Arimidex is the constant struggle to remember names and events and loosing, my descriptive words at times, as I call it.  I find this very disturbing. Also moving quickly from being very positive to feeling negative and almost paranoid. I know that I did not have any of these problems before taking Arimidex. I have not so far experienced any real pain in any of my joints, but feeling like an old lady sometimes I can relate to. The memory thing however is my big worry. Why does this pill cause this problem does anyone know? Anyway take care everyone and laugh much, it really works.

RX for the lung infection.  Pain meds for lingering joint pain.  Subsequent xrays reveal this med has given me hip arthritis and I am in constant pain, having to restrict normal activity and sitting all day at my new office job is torture.  This medication should have prescreening for markers for severe reaction before letting people take it.  It has damaged my body.

My lymphedema worsened, carpal tunnel worsened, night sweats were severe, depression, confusion. I had a horrible time with my memory although I don't see memory loss as a side effect of this drug. I took Arimidex for about 2 months before I finally said no more. It has been 4 weeks since I stopped the Arimidex - all symptoms have either stopped or lessened substantially.My oncologist is now prescribing tamoxifen but I haven't started it yet. Oh joy.

My mother is 78 and I'm almost 60 - we're both thinking about quitting.  The bottom line is do I want to live like this?

I took chemo and have been taking Arimidex for going on two years.  I, like so many of the women who are on this drug, have been suffering from joint pain.  Just in the last week both my wrist have become very touchy and I've experienced extreme pain at times when trying to pick up an object or turning my hand.  I too, look as if I could be in my 90's when trying to get up from a chair or getting out of bed or the car.  I have told my oncologist but his reply is that the benefit of taking the medicine out-weighs the side effects.  I'm beginning to doubt . . . I know my age has some to do with my aches and pains but I truly believe this medication is limiting me.  I don't know if I can reach the five year mark feeling the pains and anxiety this medication seems to be causing.  I haven't read much from women who came off the Arimidex after giving it a year or two, and feeling it was the cause of some of their medical issues.  I wonder if one can stop and things will go back as they were or if we've created other problems by staying with it for so long.

So far the drug appears to be effective.  I was warned that side effects include weight gain and increased hot flashes.  Unfortunately I am experiencing both side effects.  I am taking more vitimins now including more D and E but I have experieced an increase in bone loss (to the extent that I now have full on oesteoporosis in my spine) and am looking at other therapies for that.  What is most disturbing is the weight gain.  I have fought weight gain since turning 50 but at 61 when I started the drug therapy I was able to manage that weight gain.  I can no longer due so and am very unhappy about that. Other suspicious side effects include one severe dizzy spell and pain in my foot though I do not have other noticiable joint pain.  I have increased my excercise to include daily walking which helps with overall mental health and to stave off depression.

Shooting, burning pain in my hands, knees, hips, severe bone loss in my left hip. Told a hip replacement won't work for me, as my bones are too fragile. Going to quit this awful drug, two drs have told me it's either Arimidex or death, must be another option. Advance DCIS with 14 out of 24 nodes positive, largest tumor was 7 cm, smaller one was 4.5 cm, NOT FOUND ON MAMMO! Had a MRI to confirm tumor size and location. Dr has me taking mammo each year, still have dense breast tissue, going the Bio identical hormones route now.

I do not notice any increased exhaustion.  I was hot all the time before I started it, and now have periods where I actually feel cool. Pains in bones I attribute to metastized breast cancer...take tylenol and try to get over it.  As long as this drug does it's job, I'm in for the long haul. No nausea, headaches, etc.  Look at the alternative, put it into perspective and persevere.

Many side effects as everyone else but I find that it's getting worse instead of better.  I thought after being on it for a while pains would taper off or I would get used to it.  But not so - hair thinning is getting worse, getting more tired, feet and hands and legs hurt more, etc.  Will all this go away after 3 years when I'm finished with it?  I have almost 3 years to go. What will I be like after being on it for 5 years?  I'll not be able to get out of a chair at all.  But I'm afraid to stop, will continue to suffer and take the pill.

I had radiation, chemo and a stem cell transplant. I have been CA free ever since. I've been on Arimidex since then and see my ONC every 3 months for blood tests,and am grateful to be pretty healthy. I'm on many drugs for other problems, so if I have side effects to this drug, it is hard to tell, but mostly I have joint pain that may be or not be just arthritis. Over all, it is great to be CA free and I have to give credit to this medicine and a healthy lifestyle and a positive attitude.

Breast Cancer	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	3/23/2011 7:00:54 PM	I have been using this drug for 4 years. Had breast cancer in 2007. had a lumpectomy and radiation every day for 7 weeks. I have had some hot flashes joint pain. A total of 6 triger fingers, 4 I had surgery to correct. the surgery was very succesful. Joint pain remains a problem. I have gained over 40#. Head aches pain in the right eye, When I told my Dr. I was thinking about stoping the medicin. He said if I did I would risk the return of cancer and the choice was mine to make. I have gone this long I will try to go 1 more year. I am so glad I am not the only one having these symtoms as I thought I was going nuts. 
Breast Cancer	mad, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	3/12/2011 7:41:01 PM	They should have named it &quot;ARIMIDEATH&quot; This is a horrible med and causes prolonged painful side effects. Would not give this to my worst enemy. Don't know why it is on the market, should be banned!!!
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	alive but not well, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	3/10/2011 5:30:44 AM	Lumpectomy with radiation in June, 2009. Have been taking Arimidex since Sep 1, 2009.I was very positive about this treatment and trusted my Dr when she said the side effects were minimal. I am very active and walk every day as well as hiking and heavy gardening. My bone density was excellent!Shooting pains at night, feels like a bolt of lightening inside the bones of my legs.Wake up with these two or three times a night. Hot flashes, night sweats, depression, anxiety, inability to focus on tasks for long periods. Memory loss and confusion. Surgery on trigger finger last October. Didn't know it was caused by this until I started reading the posts here. Sex is excruciatingly painful. Now my foot is drawing up like my finger did. Cannot straighten three of the toes on my right foot. Very pronounced arch and is progressing very rapidly. Podiatrist says only fix is more surgery. Very painful as my toes rub the top of my shoes. Saw my Dr a week ago, liver enzymes extremely high. Have had same several times. Have had complete body scan, PT CT scan, sonogram and numerous blood tests. Also two more biopsies. Have gained about 25 lbs. Never had a weight problem before this. Headaches and some diarrhea. Carpal Tunnel. Slight acne. Hair is thinning. Cholesterol is high, but refuse to take statin drugs. Trying to keep it in line via diet. Last week after reading this site, talked to Dr. She said I would have to discontinue taking the drug.Have been off of it for 7 days, nothing has changed. Wonder how long it takes to get it out of my system. Hoping my body will return to normal. I'm really worried about not taking this, but can't imagine what kind of shape I will be in if I continue. The Dr says she has other patients who can't take it as well and just have to be very diligent with blood tests, exams &amp; mammograms. Any slight variation will require further tests. I also tried Aromasin, but the side effects were worse, after one month, went back to the Arimidex.

Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Nefertiti, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/7/2011 7:53:58 PM	I've been on Arimidex for 2 months for Stage II breast cancer , had surgery and chemo. Like all other reviewers I had all the side effects: Bone and muscle pain, hot/cold flashes, neuropathy, arthritis , fatigue,weakness, malaise, flu-like symptoms, depression, dizziness, insomnia, irritability. The last straw for me is the excrutiating pain in my hands especially at night. Carpal tunnel syndrome-like pain, only worse. I tried hot/cold packs and even wrist splints &amp; NSAIDS, Exercise, yoga &amp; meditation. They helped very little, I still wake up after 2 hours of sleep to excrutiating pain and never able to go back to sleep again. My Dr told me to stop it for two weeks and hallelujah the pain in my hands is gone. But he switched me to Femara, I will start next week, so wish me luck.
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	Gjean, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	65-74	3/5/2011 4:38:23 PM	I started taking arimidex almost 3 years ago. I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 62. My left breast was removed as were 2 lymph nodes. I went through 6 chemo treatments and no radiation. I was keeping weight on, very tired, depressed and insomnia was ongoing.  Now, three years after,  I find that by eating better... I lost 20 pounds by sticking to low carbs, fruits and veggies, no &quot;white&quot; foods...rice, potatoes or breads, I find that by taking charge of myself, I'm feeling much better.  I used melatoin (5mg) every night for awhile but I find that by sticking to a walking program and some exercises, I feel much better and am sleeping without any aid recently. In February I had my annual mammogram on my other breast.  Because the film looked different than 2 years ago, I'm back thinking of cancer again.  So I may have to hold off on my arimidex findings until I'm retested in 2 months.  My surgeon says not to worry but you always have that nagging feeling in the back of your head. I do find that after my hair came back thicker after chemo that in the last 6 months, it seems to be thinning out.  I'm not sure what to attribute that to.  Thanks to all for sharing your experiences with your cancer. It sure helps to know that I'm not alone in this continuing journey.
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	3/2/2011 1:12:57 PM	I was on femara-cost was outrageous and side effects were terrible for me as well. Switched to arimidex-Cost is better but side effects are worse.  Bones and joints hurt all the time, tired, can't sleep, water retention, weight gain, swelling.  I decided to stop taking this drug.  I, like some other reviews I have read, believe quality of life is better than a possible risk of re-occurence.

Only on Arimidex less than a month. Starting to feel the joint pain, esp hands, muscle pain in legs quite bad. Yes, when I get up from a chair, I walk like I am 90. Want to share with others who are paying huge prices for Arimedex: Coscto charges $29.00 a month for 30 tablets, 1 mg. Yes, it is true. I cried happy tears when I found out. Walmart wanted $350 a month. If you don't have a Costco in your area, find one near you and ask if they will mail it; perhaps in 90 day supply. Or maybe a friend or relative lives near one and could mail it to you. You do not have to have a membership to get meds. Anyone can use their pharmacy for free. For all of you struggling with side effects: I have learned about an exciting new vaccine that is just in trial 1 that targets the cancer cells, kills them and has NO SIDE EFFECTS. I am going to find out where it is being offered. Don't give up. There is promising new treatment on the horizon. Have a positive attitude, stay active, and calm the mind; try meditation/ relaxation tapes. It really helps put me to sleep. I have placed my life in God's hands. It really helps my anxiety which is purposeless since it only stresses my body out. When I get down about the Arimidex side effects, I think of my mom and grandmother who did not have the good drugs and suffered a lot of pain. I try to think that by taking this medicine, I may be helping not only myself, but my grand-daughter and future generations who will learn from our taking this med. Hang in there, everyone.
Breast Cancer	Pat, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	2/9/2011 12:57:45 PM	Since taking Arimidex I have had hot flashes, joint pain, weight gain, and memory loss. I fractured a rib by just bending over to pick something up off the floorboard of my car.  I walk like I am 90 years old and the mornings are the worse.  I have 2 1/2 more years on the medicine. My oncologist changed me to Femara but the pain in my knees and hips were worse than on the Arimidex so I switched back.
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	JK, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1		55-64	2/7/2011 11:19:42 PM	The side effects of this drug are arm/shoulder joint pain, limited arm mobility, short term memory loss, some dizziness, severe mood swings accompanied by anger and missed sleep due to pain in arms while sleeping. Taking 20mg of Melatonin and 2 tablets of remeferin have improved sleeping patterns and eliminated the mood swings and on edge feeling.(NO more B%$@H..my husband is very happy about that) The arm mobility is another issue. Stretching/yoga, physical therapy are very helpful. Moving the body is so important! Have found alternative estrogen blockers but no studies to back them up.  Still searching.  Six months on this drug with one month break per my doctor to assess my symptoms to make sure they were drug related. That was affirmative. At this point it is what it is.  Working with a Naturopathic doc (who had breast cancer and knows first hand what we go through) has helped me tremendously.

Minor joint pain I can live with. No weght gain, no nausea, no hair loss and no HOT FLASHES!! I take the med in the morning prior to leaving for work now. When I took the med at bed time, I had experienced occasional insomnia, and I woke up with stiff joints/muscles.

I have turned to Deep Tissue Massage and Hot Stone massages which helps tremendously.  The bad thing is yes the hot flashes are bad along with the body aches,severe pain in the joints and muscles,absolutly very  little sleep but I have only been on this for 6 months and God help me I have 4 1/2 years to go.  I know the best thing is no cancer again!!!!  But I am also experiencing Heart palps and dizziness and I don't feel like myself and I just want to feel somewhat normal again.  My pharmacist said to take Green Tea for the hot flashes and yes that helps they are definitely not as bad.  But has anyone else getting heart palps?
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	waryone, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	1/21/2011 10:27:27 PM	The fear of breast cancer recurrence is a major impetus for following doctor's orders without hesitation when the promise of a drug cutting the chance almost in half is available. All drugs have side effects, some are intollerable, as was Arimidex in my case. Besides all of the side effects listed by most users, I experienced vertigo when I turned my head that made driving  dangerous and, already an insomniac, I virtually didn't sleep for the five months I was on the drug. The fear of recurrence was trumped by the &quot;quality of life&quot;. Some of us will just have to take our chances.     
Breast Cancer	bam, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	1/19/2011 7:23:39 PM	I have been on this drug almost 4yrs. As with many other ladies I have experienced joint pain in my hips and knees.  I also have noticed hair loss, insomnia and constipation. I was part of a clinical study group and will be taking arimidex for 5 yrs.  If it does the job it will be well worth some of the side effects.

Relief to know others experiencing same reactions. After sitting/driving for a while, so sore it feels like I can't move and need to stand for a few seconds before I can walk. My hands/legs/feet swell; the weight gain stinks-seems like I went from a size 10-14 overnight! Would love my sex drive and previous fun life back! But cancer free so far and hanging in there. Do hope these issues are not permanent after treatment!

I have such horrible aching in my knees and hips. I have had a total knee replacement years ago and even that knee (or lack of it) hurts. When I sit and get up it is just awful and it gets you so depressed to feel like this all the time. But, I keep going. I take 2 1000 mg. of cinnamon a day (2X) one am and one pm. I read that Japanese women used this for hot flashes. It has helped a lot. Originally I had about 10 flashes a day and now maybe 2 and they are not so severe. Cannot hurt to use it. I think the depression comes with feeling so crappy all the time. I thought of quitting, but figured I better stick it out. Don't want another bout of BC. Hope this helps someone and please try the cinnamon. Also, my onclogist told me that people who have trouble with paying for the Arimidex (even the generic is outrageous) can contact the manufacturer and they can cut you a deal and even free if you qualify. I am happy since I will be in the &quot;donut hole&quot; on Medicare next year in a few months. Pitiful that we have to even worry about money going through this. Good luck to all of you.

A pill that helps prevent further cancer, think about it......that is a God sent.I thank God I am here to take it! 
Breast Cancer	C, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	65-74	1/2/2011 8:58:12 PM	Mastectomy at 49 followed by chemotherapy 6 Month (I thought that was it).  Cancer returned at 62. The turmor was removed and followed by radiation treatment.  This followed by Arimidex.  I have been taking it for 5 years.  Some discomforts like hot flashes, body aches, etc. but these seem to have deminished as the years went by.  So far, it seems to be helping.One important factor I think is that I didn't and still don't dwell on the cancer and I never stopped working or doing things due to the cancer. Only family knew of my condition.  I wore a wig.  I also choose to not give it any excessive attention.  I do get a check-up once a year and a mammogram/ultra sound about every two years.  Life goes on.  The journey continues.

I then went back on it a few months ago but for the past week the pain (when I move) in my lower back, left hip and knee is unbearable. Not sure if it is the Arimidex, but as of today I'm not taking it. Has anyone tolerated it for a long period of time, then believe the extreme pain is caused by the Arimidex?  I would appreciate any comments.

I have also gained 35 pounds, but don't think I can blame the medication 100%.  When I am exercising on a regular basis, the aches do go away.
Breast Cancer	Shirl, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	12/12/2010 3:17:27 PM	Double mastectomy in 2009. Started on Arimidex, switched to Tamoxifen now back on Arimidex. Had to stop because of the cost. I found that the side effects were no worse than Tamoxefin. Now I have found Healthwarehouse, an online pharmacy in Ohio highly rated by the better business bureau. They specialize in generic drugs. I get 120pills for $76.00. Hot flashes are less than Tamox, bone pain and insomnia, but I can tolerate anything to keep cancer away.

Oncologist suggests going off drug but gave me the choice to continue until new data is available that suggests whether taking for a longer term than 5 years is beneficial. I have tolerated Arimidex pretty well.  Weight lifting has helped with the body aches.  Effexor really really helps the hot flashes.  My cholesteral went up along with my weight and my libido is gone.  Should I go off the drug now or wait?  Have the negatives been corrected once women go off the drug i.e. weight loss, improved sex drive and non-aching joints?
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	mainer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	12/5/2010 2:01:12 PM	I appreciate all the input here...maybe I am not crazy after all.  I had lumpectomy, chemo, mastectomy (bi-lateral) and radiation.  I just went through a bunch of pricey tests to try to find out why liver enzymes up, I wish I had read these comments first, I think the drug is to blame for me feeling like I am ninety. Sore bones, achey joints, at times quite sad and depressed..I am not sure gaining an extra year or two is worth living the next five years in such a state. Sex is out of the question..am sick of being sick.  I am wondering if anyone knows what the percentages are with regard to reoccurance if medication is stopped.  Hang in there everyone, this too shall pass...(hopefully sooner than later)!!!

(I'm thankful it is now available as a generic!) I am having a lot of joint pain, feet burning, and especially numbness/tingling/swelling/trigger finger in both hands.  I am grouchy, at times, and can't seem to stop it.  And, like so many others, I am tired.  I appreciate reading reviews that others have written - it helps me to know that I am not just imagining/whining about all these problems.  These are side effects of the medication that is supposed to be helping me. Five years is a goal I may not be able to reach, but I plan to give it my best shot.  Thanks for sharing your experience with Arimidex.  It was helpful to me.

I haven't had any other side effects after 4 months of use. I wonder if some of the side effects reported are just the effects of arthritis and aging.

During my 1st year I did not understand what was going on with my body/mind. Severe bone &amp; muscle pain, hot flashes almost unbearable at times and the memory loss was very scary. Once I read these postings, I made up my mind to fight these symptoms just like the breast cancer. I am almost at the 5 year mark (thank you Lord) I started running and lost 18 lbs. I feel better when I stay active. I still hurt a lot, feel very tired, memory often is terrible, and started losing hair. But I am looking forward to finishing in 4 months.

Breast Cancer	Sveta, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	10/9/2010 2:45:06 AM	Started a year and a half ago. I am only 49 now but felt like 90. Really bad joint and muscle pain, esp around hip area, bad flashes, dryness. Everything kind of toned down after a while and with Effexor was doing pretty good. Now the generic is out which is a fraction of the cost and is supposed to be the exact thing. Well it is not. I have had all the symptoms return and then some. Headache, more fatigue, depression, and can hardly walk sometimes. I am very active-dance, ride a bike, walk the dog. I am miserable and not that glad to be alive, because I don't have the energy to enjoy it. I am going to switch to Tamoxifen and if that doesn't improve things then I am rolling the dice.

I checked the 5 stars for effectiveness because I am hoping and praying that this medicine is working.  I had a mastectomy in 2009 and took the Tamoxifin first, switched to Femera, and now Arimidex.  I have been on the Arimidex for about 6 months and the side effects are no better than the Femara.  I am stiff and sore most of the time, had the weight gain, but the worst of the side effects for me is the memory loss.  They call it &quot;chemo brain&quot;.  It effects my everyday life, my job, etc.  I am thankful to have read everyone's responses though.  It lets you know that you are not alone.

Have kept a positive attitude through all my tx's, just hope I can keep going. I feel older than I used to, before chemo-radiation and now these pills. I am 52.

Weight gain, headaches, legs hurt and even breast pain now. I have seriously thought about telling my doctor I don't want to take it anymore. Been a year now, I just hate it. They make it sound like if you dont take it the breast cancer for sure will return.

Came back in liver and on surface of lung in 2008.  Have been on Arimidex since 4/2008 with excellent results, but side effects have been awful--extreme hot flashes responded to Effexor but didn't like sexual side effects.  Now sex is very painful.  Sore knees.  Psychologist says drug makes anti-depressant less effective. Am very emotional and short tempered.  Feel awful most of the time, but probably not as awful as chemo.  Not sleeping more than 1 or 2 good nights a month.  Many nights no sleep or wake up and can't get back to sleep.  Catepres patch helps with hot flashes but may need higher dose since blood pressure has also gotten quite high.  Now bones are thinning so doing lots of walking and weight training in addition to water aerobics and osteoporosis class.  Tumors are nearly gone, and I'm still hoping for NED.
Breast Cancer	Bubba, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/7/2010 8:25:51 PM	They changed my script to generic I have to crush to take or it doesn't disolve in my body. My legs weren't hurting I was feeling better than I had in a while until I discovered why. I have been taking this since mid Nov 2009. So I can't tell how it will do for me.  My hair still doesn't seem like it wants to come back.  My doctor said it was the second half of my chemo, so Ive been preparing for side effects.  I take pain meds for other conditions which helps with the leg pain(bone pain). I'm also having brain issues which I guess is expected from the cancer treatments.  I still have a long way to go with this treatment.

After about 6 months I started getting extreme pain in my right shoulder joint; then the right knee and occasionally the right elbow.  My cholesterol has jumped as well by a lot and am now trying statins and Niacin.  The ldl has gone from 130 - 178, however the hdl has also gone up.  I am switching to Femara, so we'll see.
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	Pam, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	65-74	8/3/2010 1:49:10 PM	Age 66, diagnosed one year ago July 6, had lumpectomy, then radiation daily for 7 weeks, no chemo reqd due to OncoType DX test results of 5%.  Started Armidex in October 2009.  Immediate joint aches, and now 8 months into the daily dosage my right thumb locked and three months later have  trigger finger on the same hand.  Last month, when the left thumb also started hurting, the oncologist switched me to Aromasin,the left thumb is better but the right hand thumb and finger are pretty much useless. Not certain how to face another four years of these estrogen blocker medicines.   Know that I have tendosis causing the thumb and finger pain, but evidently local steriods are the only solution.  Am icing my arm to try and reduce swelling in the tendons, and taking ibuprofen often.... Have an appt in a couple of weeks with the oncologist and will probably try the third, and as I understand it, the last choice this type of medication.   Evidently the female body needs estrogen to allow everything to work properly, without it, complications arise that you never dreamed of.  After reading some of the posts, just confirms what I suspected that that tiny pill Armidex is potent stuff.
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	7/28/2010 1:28:04 PM	Stage 3 breast cancer, postitive nodes Her2 +, Estrogen+. Chemotherapy followed by 5 weeks radiation, 18 Heceptin treatments.  I was 45 when first diagnoised.  Chemo induced menopause.  Took Tamoxifen for 1 and half years prior to having hysterectomy.  Side effects of Tamoxifen very similiar to Arimidex.  Hot Flashes, joint pain, thinning hair(Arimidex), dizziness, trouble sleeping.  I have a Hypo thyroid, taking Arimidex has lowered my thyroid levels.  I had been on the same medication for my thyroid for years without any fluctuation in levels.  Overall I will just put up with Arimidex and all the effects because the alternative of cancer returning is not what I want.  48 years old now and 2 years post surgery.
Breast Cancer	frottina, 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	3		55-64	7/28/2010 4:16:04 AM	I have been on Arimidex since November 2007 after lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. My tumour was grade 3. So far no metastases (fingers crossed). I did experience frozen and very painful joints after taking it for a month, I felt like an old woman, I could hardly get up from my chair. I searched on Google and I read somewhere that this drug depletes your body from vitamin D (already low in many women with breast cancer) and that Vitamin D could stop the painful side effects. I got a blood test for vitamin D levels and sure enough it was very low. After I talked with my oncologist and we decided to try a high dose of vitamin D. I took 2000 U a day for a few months, which cleared the symptoms and got my vit D blood levels up, now I am on 1000 U a day and doing great. Thought I'd pass on my experience so somebody else can benefit from it.
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	lain, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	7/20/2010 11:55:22 PM	I went on Arimidex after first trying Femara.  Although the joint pain was not as severe on Arimidex, it was still very strong. At age 49, after using these 2 drugs, I was diagnosed with severe artheritis in my spine.  I didn't have as much numbness in the hands as I did with Femara, but still quality of life issues as well as being able to continue with my job (armed forces) came into play.  I was stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma with not lymph node activity as well as oncotype tested with a score of 6, so I decided the odds were in my favor and my doctor and I decided to put me back on tamoxifen even though I am now post-menepausal.  I feel much better on tamoxifen, and have actually been able to loose a few pounds in the short time I've been on it.  I still have some joint pain but it has only been a week since I've been off Arimidex, so I have high hopes to start feeling closer to 50 soon, instead of 90.

My cancer was caught very early and no spreading, no treatments advised except for Arimidex. It's only been 1-1/2 yrs. but so far so good.

There are side effects that for whatever reason have not been made known I feel to Bone &amp; Joint,Arthrithis,ect. Drs. or maybe we are still learning.Both of my thumbs now stick and I have knots in the fat part of the hand,hard like a rock.(termed Trigger finger)also on bottom of feet. My biggest scare is the breast that took radiation it hurst like it may fall off. If I stop taking the Arimidex the pain stops.Pain so bad no one can touch that breast.My liver enzemes were elevated so they went down with scope and found 2 strictures but couldn't go thur to small.We are still working on this.Need to mention my cholesteral is so high 285 but I cannot take a statin with these issues.The sweating and hot flashes and soar throat and weight gain are way down on the list,so if my liver can make it 2 more years and no cancer I guess this is an effective drug.Bottom line if you think you have a symtom thats new to you it is not in your head,I repeat it's not in your head.

No further treatment in 1992, but chemo in 2007. I have been on Arimidex for almost 2 1/2 years. Have had hot flashes,burning feet, memory loss,alot of weight gain, with elevated triglyderides and cholestral,with no success of bringing down.  Now for the past 5 months, my hands have become numb and tingly and this really bothers me, because it never lets up. Not sure if it is the arimidex or not. Will be getting checked out with a nuerologist this next month, so we will see.  Had a tumor removed from my spine in Jan. at the T4-T5 area but it did not affect my hands, so my surgeon in referring me.  If they do not find anything wrong with the nerves,I will have to decide on whether or not to continue with this medicine.  Was advised to acupucture for the hot flashes. Never had come across anyone having trouble with numbing of hands, or reading about this side effect until the other day when by GP told me this was a possible side affect. So I started exploring the internet once again. God bless you all and may we all remain cancer free!

Don't like them (especially the weight gain) but don't like the alternative.  Been on Arimidex for 4 months.  Know I have a ways to go but willing to give it a try.  Going to keep active, eat healthier and stay positive.  Good luck to all and God Bless.

Was put on Arimidex for 4 months before I finally told my oncologist-enough! Pain in feet so bad I can barely stand or walk, pain in both knees makes it difficult to walk up and down stairs, pain in both shoulders, memory so bad it frightens me. Oncologist tried to pass it off as &quot;Oh, sounds like you have rheumatoid arthritis, I'm sending you to a Rheumatologist&quot;, to which I replied, &quot;No, you're not, this is a side effect of Arimidex, it's chemical not phsiological&quot;.  Just what I need, another doctor appt. NOT!!!!!!! Glad I found these posting which helped me understand where all this pain came from so quickly.  My history...age 50-diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma with bone mets, 1 lumpectomy, 3 lymph nodes removed, all cancerous.... one year later... mastectomy, 19 more lymph nodes removed-all cancerous, breast reconstruction with implant, 5 weeks of radiation.  So.....for me, quality of life at this point is important.  I still work a full time job which is physically demanding, used to be very athletic, have gained 25 lbs. in short period of time. Doctor took me off Arimidex, put me on Aromisin for two weeks, no improvement of pain, then back on Tamoxifen. I liked the posting of the women who said she was 52 (my age) but felt 92!!!! Amen!! I think they need to go back to the drawing board and try again.

Mostly in my knees and back. Hot flashes, but they can be fixed with a fan. My biggest problem is the fatigue.  Can't sleep at night which doesn't help with the fatigue. Lost my libido and want it back. Fell one day and ended up breaking my leg in five places. I sure hope that all of this is worth it. Depression and mood swings are a huge problem for me. I want the old me back again!

I had arthritis in my back and hip before treatment, and it does hurt more now, but I use hydrocodone for pain management a few days a week, totalling maybe six tablets durning my evening job where I am required to stand for four to six hours at a time. I do have trouble getting a good nights rest because of the hip pain, which has moved into both hips. But, I know there are other treatments that could be far worse to deal with, and I prefer to remain alive. When first diagnosed with breast cancer I chose not to let it be what defined me and I took an active hand in deciding my forms of treatment, which included brachy therapy radition instead of being trapped into six weeks of it. I took a short two week vacation and stayed with my daughter and her family, riding to work with her husband and he would drop me off for the treatments (2 half hours a day, four-six hours apart). I finished the treatment the day before my 51st birthday. I will survive the pain and I appreciate what Arimidex is doing for my otherwise estrogen-happy producing body. I plan on a long active life, pain or not.

Was on it for 2 weeks when the bone/joint pain started. At 3 weeks I started having blurry vision. Called my oncologist at 4 weeks to be switched to something else. Started on Femera today, hope it doesn't have the same side effects. 
Breast Cancer	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	5/22/2010 2:27:35 PM	I have been taking Arimidex for a year now and have experienced only joint pain in my hands, some carpal tunnel syndrome-like symptoms and pain in knees when I sit too long and get up. Similar to other complaints, but otherwise I have no side effects and remain cancer-free.
Breast Cancer	Patty, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	65-74	5/21/2010 3:43:56 PM	After taking Arimidex for the past 6 months, the only real complaint I have is terrible lower back pain, and some hip pain, especially in the early a.m.  I can hardly stand up straight when I get out of the bed.  I take the dog and walk for 45 mins. every day, which helps somewhat.  Midmorning I go swim for 45 mins., and this helps a lot.  I'm not getting used to the pain at all, and don't know how I will make it for the full 5 yrs.  Meanwhile, I take calcium and omega-3 fish oil supplements daily, along with a multi.  I also drink one tablespoon of Noni Juice every day.  Thanks for all the input, as it is very helpful.

Other	Karen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/3/2010 1:04:50 PM	January 1995 at age 44 I had a complete hysterectomy and put on hormone replacement pills.  October 2005 blood was detected in my stool.  Colonoscopy revealed a bad spot in my colon.  Surgery was performed.  When the doctor opened me up I was FULL of cancer. The biggest tumors were removed along with some intestines.  It was determined it orginated as uterine cancer and the hormone replacements fed the cancer.  It was so tiny it went undetected.  I have been on Arimidex since December 2005.  February 2010 my latest CT Scan showed NO MORE CANCER!  Yea for Arimidex - it &quot;starved&quot; the cancer into disappearance! I have not had any side effects from Arimidex that I have noticed.

Chemo, Radiation, ovaries removed because I continued to have periods.  Have been on arimidex for 4 months now.  Side effects include weight gain, joint pain, terrible hot flashes, fatigue...bottom line, I feel horrible.  I was a very active 44 year old - 5 days a week in the gym after work.  Today I am lucky to make it through my day.  I will be talking with my Dr in May to discuss the need for the med.  I can't imagine another 4 years of this.

I have had a few mild hot flashes &amp; also some joint pain but no more than I had before from arthritis. I was 79 years old when first diagnosed with breast cancer &amp; had a lumpectomy followed by radiation. So far (my fingers are crossed) I have had good reports from my oncologist. Perhaps some of the occasional lack of pep that I have been attributing to old age is due to the Arimidex, but I have continued active both physically &amp; mentally and am grateful for the good health I've enjoyed for five years.

Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	4/18/2010 2:35:44 PM	Stage 2 cancer in 2003, chemo.  I just came to end of taking Arimidex for 5 years.  It was easy to take, but my side effects were: progressing hair loss (this worried me the most), joint aches, bone scan showed some bone loss in spine, however extra calcium, vit. D and walking have helped reading come back up.  Next scan showed some gain in bone.  I would get stiff if sitting too long, had to take a minute to get going again.  No pain after I started moving around.  I did experience very dry mouth the past 2 years (mostly at night). Stick with it if you can, I hope it saved my life.  Good luck to you all.

Breast Cancer	Terry,  Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female		4/11/2010 3:23:09 PM	My first cancer was in 1999 and after a mastectomy I started Tomaxifin with little side effects.  In 2003 the cancer returned on same breast and 8 weeks of radiation I started taing Arimidex.  After 5 years from 2003, my oncologist said he wanted me on Arimidex for an additional 5 years.  Yes, I have weight gain, hair loss, joint pain, loss of sleep, but no cancer.  I can live with the side effects if it stops the cancer from returning.  Exercise, gardening and walking all help.  Also, think positive and pray.

Positive person, not a whiner, keep on doing what I want, but positive also this drug is tough. Every part of my body hurts, breast pain, very little sleep, total fatigue, increasing arthritis &amp; all-over stiffness. Tests last mo. indicate fatty liver, osteopenia, low blood counts, gall bladder acting up.  Think I will go to the 2 yr. mark in May and ask to finish up with Tamoxifen through Dec. for my 5 yrs.  Quality of life is diminishing and side effects are increasing. Am I risking total health with this? Can't even imagine 10 or more years on this drug for anyone! I'm consulting w/my gp and praying to make the right decision.(PS: Not that it's the most important consideration, but this precrip. just went to $505.per month from 360 last year!)I love my life and I pray for all of us on this journey.  Good luck and God bless!

I am 40 years old and feel like 80.  My hair is falling out, my fingers and thumbs ache, my joint pain is bad enough to make me limp, I have gained 10 pounds and never had issues with weight before, I have lost my labedo and suddenly dislike everything about me.  I have always been happy with who I am and now I fight to see the good.  I am afraid to quit as I do not want cancer recurrence, but then I wonder what kind of life am I going to have!?!  Fat, bald and single?  How much can my husband and children really take?  What a bad situation!

Already suffering pain in hip joints, loss of concentration and memory, dizziness and insomia with hot flushes. I am also very nauseated which I did not read in any of the reviews. Has anyone felt nauseated along with all the other symptons?
Breast Cancer	appfel, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	4/2/2010 2:14:28 PM	Can't think well,Joint and muscle pain, hot flashes, memory loss, anxiety, insomnia, hair loss, weight gain..have it all. I hate the way I feel so I went off for 3 months, then became afraid the cancer would return I resumed.  Most symptoms had subsided, when I stopped, but now that I have resumed, they are back with a vengance. Next testing is June 1st, and I am going to ask Oncologist if there is any alternative, or I'm going to stop. This is not a good quality of life, with no guarantee it will prevent a reoccurrance or not leave me with other unacceptable problems from the side effects.

Have all the side effects mentioned, except problems with bowl movement.Does it any good, who knows? Only time will tell! My biggest problem I have is the constant aches and pains and loss of energy I amtired all the time. Also noticed short term memory loss,dizziness being a big factor  also and sometimes Ihave a speech problem. Can't finish what I want to say and my words come out blurry? Does any one else have that problem? But than looking at the bright side, I am alive and try to make the best of every day and look forward to tomorrow.

I was once very active and now suffer from severe bone and muscle pain in my arms and hands.   What really bothers me is that people feel that I should be count my blessings (I do) Yet, they complain about having a tooth ache.  They have no idea what it is like to suffer in pain every day/night.  I keep my spirits up, but it has only been 8 months.

The hand pain and the arm/shoulder pain are unbearable at times.  The hot flashes are bad at time.  Vicodin or muscle relaxers do not work.  Sometimes the pain imobilizes me. I really want to quit this drug, but it is working.  Sometimes I wonder if it is worth it (the pain issues)  But, yes it is, as long as it works.  Does anyone have any suggestions for the pain issues?  Please feel free to e-mail me if you do @ lantz459@yahoo.com and reference &quot;breast cancer&quot;  Like many of you, I am tired of hurting.

I guess it's working because the cancer hasn't come back. Because of the side effects my oncologist is taking me off of Arimidex for a couple of months and substituting Femara. He's tried several times before but I wouldn't go along with it (don't want the cancer to return) now I'm tired of the side effects so I'm willing. I won't go without my anti cancer drugs - no matter the side effects.
Breast Cancer	julie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	3/24/2010 10:46:26 AM	Let's start with the positive - cancer hasn't come back so far. Tumor markers are increasing but they can't figure out why because PET scans come back fine. As for the negative, I have had surgery on both thumbs for trigger finger. The pain in my joints is getting worse daily. I have been on Arimedex for 2 years now. Vomiting, naseau, memory loss, blurry vision, etc.. Practically all the symptoms I have read on here. I don't know how much of this is due to the medication and how much is due to aging. Either way, I'd rather be cancer free, so as long as it is working I will continue taking it and hope the long term effects don't turn out to be worse than the original problem. Good luck everyone.

Early symptoms were hot sweats, chills, sleepness nights. Just recently I began getting severe bone pain, fatgue, confusion, memory problems and my skin has change, looks so much older. I have another 4 yrs and 2 months to go on this medication. I don't think I will make it. I have tried everything for the bone pain, fish oil, vitamin D, calcium plus pain killers. Nothings helps. If anyone has any ideas, please share them. Also I would like to know if anyone has finished or stopped taking this medication and can tell me if they are still dealing with the side effects.

I had a mastectomy and hysterectomy, chemo and radiation.  The side-effects that I suffered from Arimidex were fatigue, headaches, aches in my knees and memory loss/fuzziness.Unfortunately, another cancerous tumor was found and I'm waiting for test results to see what medication and chemo will be prescribed.Your remarks were very useful to me because I hadn't realized that it was Arimidex's fault for my symptoms and I generally blamed the chemo (after so many years!).I wish all of you the best of luck and health.Faye, Greece

Lumpectomy and radiation. 5 years of tamoxifen.  Already had issues...fibromyalgia...didn't realize how much symptoms worsened on tamoxifen until I was off of it.  Sex was very painful.All of the above mentioned symptoms.  Flashforward...2009...Same breast, DCIS returns..bilateral mastectomy...start Arimidex.  Symptoms returned immediately.  Horrible depression, aniety, and all over body pain...didn't tie this to Arimidex until reading these posts.  Sex is unbearable. I want to stop using it.  Tamoxifen was useless.  My cancer returned. I don't want to go through 5 more years of this.  I have no breasts...why am I taking it?

I began Arimidex after 6 weeks of radiation and after taking for 4 years, I have experienced several of the symptoms mentioned.  Of most concern is memory loss/concentration, anxiety, sleep deprivation, leg cramping and dizziness/fuzzy brain.  I have 1 year to go and look forward to being relieved of the side effects particularly the anxiety which exacerbates all others!  I try to stay in the moment and be positive.  Thank you for all your comments and I wish everyone out there joy and peace each and every day!

I have had no problems except for ever increasing joint pain  and muscle weekness.  My joints are almost unbearable at times.  Mostly my hips and knees but also some in the shoulders.  I have always taken calcium with D, fish oil, iron, and multi-vitamins thoughout my life.  Because of my joints I plan on calling my oncologist to see if there is something that can be done.  Otherwise I feel like I will be cancer-free, but unable to move anymore.

I USED to have a sunny disposition! Been on the Arimidex for a year now, and have also had dizziness, hot flashes, headaches.  I had a lumpectomy and radiation, no spread to lymph nodes, thank God. I guess I will have to deal with this for 4 more years...hope my family can put up with me!  I try, but this sure has affected my moods..my husband says the changes started soon after I began the Arimidex, and that is what I thought.  I will be very glad to have these 5 years pass fast.  I am grateful if this keeps the cancer from returning, though.

First few mths were fine but now I am having some joint pain and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome. I usually wake up 2-3 times a night a little restless. I have had weight gain 10 pounds since last June and I don't have alot of energy I feel tired alot.

Breast Cancer	Karen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/19/2010 5:27:04 PM	If the Arimidex  has kept me cancer free for 4 yrs , then I'll continue to take it as long as I can.  That said, the  bone and joint pain has been very difficult. My job is demanding, ER/Fast Track up and down, running 12 hrs nonstop, all the while wishing my my feet, right knee and hands were teeth , I'd extract them!  3 Ibuprofen durning the day does help, then increased  movement gives into more relief.   Hearing others gives me comfort and takes  me further away from &quot;poor me&quot;   We are not alone. Thank you

I have had some constipation but that may be because I am getting older and it is easily controled when if occurs.  Other than that, I don't seem to have any other side effects except when I started I did have a couple of hot flashes but those have gone away.

Have muscle/joint pains, neuropathy in feet &amp; hands, trouble sleeping, dizziness, memory loss, all the usual symptoms.  One I have not seen in the reviews is diarreah, which I experience at least 3 times per week, usually beginning between 2:30 &amp; 4:00 a.m.  I take Arimidex usually between 6:00 &amp; 8:00 p.m.  This is a major problem for me.  Are there foods that react to the drug or does it make any difference.  I cannot find any consistency, except when I eat fried chicken.

She has had extreme weight loss and at this stage in her life, is all of the side effects worth it? Will this improve her quality of life? Any comments would be appreciated. 
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	lilymeg, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	65-74	1/8/2010 3:40:21 AM	I am 66 yr old female and in May 2009 I had a grade 2 lobular carcinoma removed with lumpectomy. Starting in Sept I was treated with 6 weeks radiation therapy. I was supposed to take Arimidex for 3 months as part of a clinical trial. After exactly four weeks I chose to stop because of side effects. After less than 2 weeks on Arimidex joint pain started to develop. I had pain in my feet, hips, lumbar spine, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists and hands. My rheumatologist and radiation oncologist agreed that Arimidex was the cause. I now have an acute flare of fibromyalgia as a result of the stress of the joint pain. With hindsight I would not have taken the Arimidex. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1996.

Breast Cancer	pianoperson, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	1/4/2010 12:50:54 PM	I am 63 and feel like I'm 100. I have been taking arimidex for 14 months &amp; know that others are having all these side effects too.  Yes - I am thankful to be alive!  BUT is there a fine line between longevity and quality? I'm trying to decide.  My bones, joints, &amp; muscle aches are horrible.  I can barely move when I stand up, stairs are almost impossible.  I quit the arimidex a week ago and can walk alot better.  I started it again today.  I can't decide what to do.  (The researchers have to find something more tolerable.)  This is besides the mega-hot flashes, constipation, trigger thumb, brain fog , weight gain, depression from the constant pain, poor sleep, dry mouth, and the list continues.  The bone &amp; joint pain came on more slowly but is getting continually worse.  I don't think I can do this for 4 more years....The positive note is that I just finished reconstruction - I highly redommend it - I feel whole again.  Give me some advice on this arimidex thing....

Breast Cancer	Helen, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	65-74	1/2/2010 10:10:23 AM	I have been on this drug for 4 months and absolutely hate it.  All of my joints ache, very dry mouth, numbness in my thumb and finger tips, weight gain, etc..  I am 65 yrs. old, active, a weight lifter for the last 9 yrs., walk and am physically active at my part time job.  Now, I have to force myself to get past the pain while in the gym, I can hardly stand to walk up stairs, and when I get up from a sitting position I feel like I have the knees of a 90 year old.My doctor wants me to stay on this drug until March and if things don't improve I will be put on aromasin.  I know I could not stay on Arimidex for 5 years and continue to feel this crappy.

Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	12/9/2009 9:51:05 PM	I was diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma almost five years ago. After a masectomy, I had 8 chemo treatments and a one year regimen of Herceptin IVs. I have been taking Arimidex for 4 years. There are times when I feel like my bones will break and I get very stiff when I sit for a while. I sometimes have to push myself to keep going, but that is what we survivors do--we keep fighting and going forward. I find that sitting in a hot tub of water relieves some of the pain, but I can not get out of the tub without assistance. Vaginal dryness is a problem as well. For some time, I thought these symptons were the after effects of the chemo and herceptin. I appreciate all the comments posted. This makes me realize that I am not alone in my experience. If this drug keeps my cancer from coming back, then I guess I can take the pain. Keep smiling and moving forward!

Have experienced joint pain, nueropathy of feet and hands, hot flashes, high cholesterol, weight gain and a variety of other issues.  Side effects seem to be increasing over time.

I really thought I had many medical problems that were unrelated and now I know they are all related to taking Arimidex. Have been on it for 13 months with joint stiffness and pain - especially in hands.  Have had surgery for thumb trigger and now have three other fingers starting to catch. Dr. put me on anti-inflamatory but it's not helping. Also burning itching feet and palms.Night sweats were so bad my GYN put me on Effextor.  Helped lots but it has its own side effects. Oncologist says thought is now Arimidex and similar drugs are effect in preventing return of cancer even after five years so I should plan to be on it longer.  Feel whinny when drug maybe preventing return of cancer but I surely do miss my life before Arimidex.

Breast Cancer	janmar, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	12/2/2009 9:29:46 AM	Was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer and had a lumpectomy followed by chemo and radiation in 2007. I went on Arimidex(after Tamoxifen) in the Spring of 2008. Within approximately 6 months I began to feel a tingling and numbness in my hands and feet, particularly at night. This got much worse as time went on. I began calling this &quot;neuropathy&quot;, as that described it almost perfectly. I began taking vitamins specifically geared toward helping nerves and started an exercise program that included daily walks. I am a bartender, so I am always on my feet, and stay in relatively good shape. Nothing seemed to help and then I was experiencing it day and night. I could barely walk when I got up in the morning. I'd have my good days and bad and was starting to wonder how long I could do my job! In the meantime my doctors were suggesting I may need to see a nuerologist. I misplaced my Arimidex on Memorial Weekend of 2009. Had no way of refilling prescription until the following Tuesday. Within 3 days OFF the Arimidex this crippling conditions was almost completely gone!! I contacted my Oncologist. Needless to say, I am off the Arimidex and now take Femara. I have at least learned that &quot;they&quot; don't know all the side effects of these drugs. We all may play an important role in that. I have now been on the Femara for 6 months, so far so good. Hurray for sites like this where we can share our experiences with and reactions to different drugs. THIS INFORMATION IS SO VALUABLE AND IMPORTANT! Thank you.

Yes, I have and am glad to know that it was the Arimidex and not a shell fish reaction.  Actually had an Allergist do the skin tests to see if I was allergic to shell fish.  Nope, only 4 different pine trees.  I love shell fish so I'm happy to know it's only the Arimidex.  So far so good with this medication. Hot flashes and aches/pains...already had before starting the drug.  Have taken Fosomax for over 15 years.  No weight gain yet, but am exercising and walking each day.  Still facing an additional surgery for reconstruction.  Long story...pathology report was incorrect and I had a skin flap covering breast form implant removed.  Now we have to start over again.  My advice...get a second opinion if first pathology report comes back positive. I find an active daily schedule and positive attitude go along way to making the breast cancer diagnosis bearable.

Bilat Mastectomy Jan 13, 2009. Started Zoladex (to put me into menopause) and Arimidex. Hit hard with hot flashes/sweats and bone pain. Know many women who have given it up in favor of quality of life, but not willing to gamble with my life. Symptoms being treated with Prozac, Ibuprofen, and Black Cohosh. Having fewer hot flashes (and sleeping better with Benedryl).  No personal evidence that Arimidex is keeping me cancer free. For now, will stick to the 5 year plan.

I took Arimidex for 4 months and stopped taking it as I was no longer thriving.  I had joint and muscle pain especially the lower back and legs, major depression and brain function problems.  I was so &quot;foggy&quot; I would know what I wanted to do but was so confused I couldn't complete any thought or task.  My digestion was totally broken down; consequently, I had autoimmune problems - arthritis, numbness, thyroiditis, fybromialgia, etc.  My tumor was HER2 positive.  I wish I could take this medication.  I have always had a problem taking medication, thus the bilateral matectomy.  I see that women have the same problems with tamoxifen.At 53, I finally reached the point after menopause of being estrogen positive and happy enjoying great brain and bodily functions.  I know I need estrogen in order to have a good quality of life.  I had surgery on March 31, 2009 and had my first granddaughter on April 14, 2009 and my first grandson on August 16,2009.  While longevity is important, quality of life is also, as I want to live every day I've been given to the fullest.  The next five years is a milestone in a little childs and therefore a grandparent's life.

I am 10 years out and have done everything my oncologist has suggested- 5 years on tamoxifen and nearly 5 years on arimidex. Hot flashes have been a nightmare - lots of joint pain in hands and arms - hbp - cholesterol and triglycerides way up - glucose high - can't lose weight and now have a fatty liver as seen by ultrasound.  While I appreciate the drug I now think that these side effects are also very dangerous. Thankful I am almost finished taking it.....

Fatigue and joint pain are par for the course but an aleve in the morning gets me on my way. This medication is managable with regular exercise and diet. I have gained some weight, because I thought that food would give me energy, but sleep or rest is the only help. I have been fully employed the whole time and my drs say as long as lymph node are involved you could be on the drug longer. As long as the cancer doesn't return, I don't mind. Be mindful of your bones.
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	55-64 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3		55-64	11/3/2009 1:48:45 PM	I started taking Arimidex in March '09 after a mastectomy for early stage invasive ductal carcinoma. Node negative, no chemo or radiation.  I have experienced hot flashes, which seem to be decreasing in frequency, vaginal dryness, hip and joint pain and fatigue.  The hip pain is worse after sitting for a while and trying to get up.  I've started seeing a chiropractor/acupuncturist to help deal with these side effects.  If the drug will keep cancer from recurring, it will be worthwhile.

I had a mastectomy with no chemo or radiation. I have experienced hot flashes, which seem to have decreased,vaginal dryness,  and hip and back pain, worse when sitting and getting up.  I've started seeing a chiropractor/acupuncturist to help with the symptoms.  I'm hoping that will ease the muscle spasms and joint pain. If the drug keeps me from having a recurrence, then, it'll be worth it.

I was allergic to tamoxifen and put on arimidex.  I hate it!  I have been on it since 2005, vaginal dryness and EXTREME foot and leg cramps that have been getting worse, not better.  I now have a tingling, twitching of the muscles in my thighs.  I hate this drug.

I am 62, have always been very active, doing aerobics, yoga and dancing.  Now I am having pain and stiffness in my hips, pain in my back, and have had previous neck problems with headaches which seem to be worse.  I also have painful intercourse, dryness.  Like many of you, though, I feel that if this decreases my risk of recurrence then it's worth it.  I have an appointment with a chiropractor for the back problems, and I'm looking for a yoga class to help with stretching and flexibility.  Good luck to you all, and God bless.

So far I mostly feel achy especially in the morning or after sitting too long. I have become somewhat sensitive to certain foods and crave others. Has this happened to anyone else? I will continue with the medication as I feel that it is hopefully saving my life.

Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	55-64	9/27/2009 4:33:00 PM	After taking A. for 4 months, I have had foot,knee, and hand joint pains, plus very noticeable vaginal dryness.  The joint pains are worse in the morning, but I walk and exercise then, so my day seems to be mostly pain free, but  I stiffen up noticeably, once I sit down for a time.  I started drinking soy milk and found the v. dryness lessened considerably, but have reduces that now, not wanting to add plant estrogens that might feed my &quot;hormone receptor positive&quot; cells.  I am a type 1 diabetic, so I watch my diet religiously and have not had weight gain.  My night sweats are light and not much of a problem.  I have worried that the joint aches will become a  permanent arthritis condition.  With a positive attitude, exercise, and my job to think about, I find my days are busy.  I do feel noticeably older than I am, but try to not dwell on that.   No one else sees me as old as I feel, with my hands clumsy, slow,and weak, and my knees wobbly.    A smile really helps me and everyone else.  Keep smiling..! Don't give up.

However, have just begun to connect that my memory and concentration issues may be the result of this medication. I quit one job..after being there 8 years because I was making important mistakes and did not want to get fired. Now on new job, still memory problems, and lately weepy most of the time. I take Effexor, works great for hot flashes...Klonopin for anxiety...and Trazadone for sleep (wonderful stuff). But I don't think there is anything I can take for loosing my thinking skills...I was as sharp as they come...now it takes all of my effort and constant use of a note pad to keep on track....it's like I have really bad ADD. Will be talking to my doc about it in October.

Breast Cancer	Dianagay, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	65-74	9/14/2009 9:56:29 PM	I have read alot of your reviews.  I have only been taking Arimidex for 1 month and have had alot of the same side effects but  consider all of them mild at this stage.  About 5 hrs. after taking I get very hot and start to perspire on my forhead and breasts, I usually do not sweat at all.  Very uncomfortable but only lasts about 1/2 hour.  I am having headaches but I also have migraines so this is not too bad.  I have felt really sore arms around my elbows or lower arms, feels bad but not severe.  Sometimes I get itching on my arms also, but I can take it.  The worst is the pain in my neck that hurts bad and it becomes kind of stiff also.  I know that I have arthritis in my neck so I am sure this is a contributor to the pain.  You can get shots from your doctor to help this and other pain associated with arthritis;  they are steroids but if you get the shot in the muscle it does not effect you like when athletes take it, at least that is what my doctor told me.My finger got hot on the tip one day and I thought that was weird.  I have not felt any weakness so far and hope I don't.  I am 65 and am in what I consider really good health, except for this.I had a lumpectomy on July 28 2009 and they got it all.  Only had to have one node removed as it had not spread.  I will start radiation for 6 weeks in Oct.  I am praying for all of you and myself that the symtoms get better and that it outways the alternative.  God bless you all.
Breast Cancer	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	9/14/2009 8:35:01 PM	After taking this drug for 6 week I began to have chest discomfort which I interpreted as breathing difficulty. I wondered if the radiation treatments had caused lung damage. My doctors assured me that this was not possible. The discomfort became progressively worse and one day I went into a very rapid heart rate with severe chest pressure and difficulty breathing. I felt as though I would pass out. I called 911 and I was taken to the ER and admitted to a cardiac  unit for 24 hours observation and test. A cardiac event was ruled out. I looked up the drug for side it's effects. Some people have chest pain and vasodilation  with this drug. I feel as though this is a side effect from this drug and no-one will listen to me about it. I am wondering what my options are. I have never experienced anything like this before.

I had the great fatigue some were mentioning. My oncologist did routine blood work and found I had very low iron. This has been about 3 months ago and I feel much better. I am taking a large dose of iron and B12.I'll never run a marathon but I wasn't in the greatest shape before cancer. I do have a problem with hot flashes during the day and at night.My arthritis is a little worse but not to hinder daily activities. I will continue this therapy because I feel it will help protect me from recurrence. It was interesting to see people mention weight gain and bloating. I've been on it for a little over a year and these have just now been a problem. I had been on a diet and and lost over 20 lbs before I was disgnosed and I have put it back on these last few months. I don't feel like I had over eaten but who knows. My best to you all.

Started Arimidex around Feb and gradually developed severe joint pain which was somewhat helped by movement. Dr switched me to Tamoxifen which was horrible right away. Took two week drug vacation and started on Femara. Only mild joint pain so far but a slight weight gain which might be eating more. I liked the Arimidex as it seemed to cause no side effects other than the joint pain. Good luck to everyone out here. We're in this together.

Works well. Cholestrol really high. Went to a nutrionist and lost 32 lbs in a year. Helps with the cholestrol and joints. Walk daily even when I am tired which is most of the time. Haven't slept well since tamoxifen. Think fatigue is caused by the problem with sleeping. Keep a positive attitude and don't give in. I work full time and haven't missed work because of this med. This is my second breast cancer in eight years. Just get up every day and show up for life. The rest is up to you.
Breast Cancer	Lisa , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	8/17/2009 6:42:20 PM	Have been taking Arimidex for 2 1/2 yrs.  After first 6 weeks developed severe headaches.  Took a break from med for 3 weeks and headaches slowly went away. Have bad night sweats, no sexual desire, and hurt all over.  Started with my joints, but now its muscles aches too.  I know I am getting older, but it shouldn't happen this fast.  Trying to make an informed decision.  Have been told I can &quot;take a break for 3 weeks&quot; because the medicine stays in your system for that long.  Gonna give that another try because it did work for the headaches.  Good luck Ladies!

Advanced Breast Cancer Progression Post-Antiestrogen Therapy	martha, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	7/26/2009 2:41:03 PM	Have been on Arimidex for 3 1/2 years and since that time have had to have 3 root canals done and don't know if the arimidex producers have checked into this side-effect.  Another s/e is that within one month both of my vitreous ruptured, can't find any reference to the eyes in Arimidex's literature.of course I have the bones creaking and feel like a bowl of rice krispies, I take Glucosamine/chondrointin/msm for that which really helps. The weight gain, especially in my belly seems like a lost cause.At times I have the nausea still, as well as headaches.  I'm just hoping the drug works!

I take it right before I go to bed.  I have had no side effects that I know of other than maybe a little soreness.  But I do have a little arthritis so that could be the cause of the soreness as well.

Breast Cancer	Donna, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	65-74	7/10/2009 9:52:21 AM	I started taking 1mg daily of Arimidex on 2/1/09, I take it early morn w/my BP pill.  The stiffness after sitting &amp; trying to get up is excruiating, the bone pain is bad at night, especially in the arms &amp; hands, legs and feet; swelling is bad in the hands and feet as well. Weight gain is another issue with this medication.  I constantly feel &quot;bloated&quot;.  My Oncologist gave me a Rx for a very mild anti-depressant, saying most patients have good results when taken with the Arimidex, but I had serious issues w/it and stopped after a week.  I also tried Aromasin &amp; it was no better; I know my breast cancer isestogen fed so I need to take this pill daily for 5 years, or so I'm told.  Is there anything better?  I also get acupuncture for the pain; sometimes helps, sometimes no. I started doing Curves 3 times a week since February.  The key is constant moving -   Last chemo was 1/2/09 and my hair is very slowly coming back but still very thin and only 1/2 to 1 inch long. I believe it is the Arimidex.  But, hey, I'm alive and otherwise well.

I thought I had either a vaginal infection or UTI--had symptoms for both.  Two different doctors (OB/GYN and Urologist) prescribed antibiotics even though my urine was clear.  The symptom which was puzzling was that I had pain and cramping half of the day.  After &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; I read that painful, frequent urination was a side effect that prompted me to &quot;see my doctor immediately.&quot;  I took the med early in the morning and didn't have symptoms until afternoon and evening.  Then when I went to sleep at night, I had no symptoms.  I believe that I had the symptoms whenever the Arimidex got fully into my system during the afternoon and evening.  It has been six weeks since I started taking Arimidex.  I have an appointment tomorrow with my oncologist.  I read nothing about this symptom in the one hundred comments that I read.  Has anyone else had itching, pressure, cramps during urination.  Also most of the time, no urine came.  I went to the bathroom every half hour.

On Arimidex since end of radiation treatments in December of '05. Many side effects -- 35-pound weight gain; hot flashes which are better now; joint pain. No sex drive whatsoever.I Will remain on this drug for another 1 1/2 years.  Best of luck to other cancer survivors!

I would be unable to walk if it weren't for Celebrex. I also have increased blood pressure and ankle swelling. I've torn the meniscus in both knees just doing normal stuff. I hope the joint problems are reversable. I can live with the constipation &amp; vaginal dryness.

My oncologist started me on Arimidex and I have been on it for 3 weeks and just stated to have vaginal bleeding cramps. Since I am 77 I do not get a period. I have read all the reviews and noone has said they had these side effects. Is it common and how long does it last?

I had heard about stiffness as a side effect. My doctor suggested Omega 3 (fish oil). My stiffness has greatly improved within 6 months.  Yes, my hair is thinner, but after going though chemotherapy and no hair, I am satisfied. Sometimes I do get dizzy. It only lasts a second.  Yes, there are hot flashes.  Some days more than others. A cool washcloth helps. I am on Fossimax due to loss of bone density which can happen with Arimidex. I also take Calcium. One day at a time.  I am 52, alive and happy!

Have not had surgery but 10 treatments of radiation, tumors appear smaller.  Will have CT Scan next week to verify. Having infusion of Zometa once a month for bone strengthening, 8000mg of Vitamin D and 1500mg of calcium. Thanks for the postings...the weight gain is my biggest issue, and not sure how to handle, but going to have a chat with oncologist.  God Bless each of you.

I had joint &amp; muscle aches, even my toes hurt.  Doctor put me on anti inflammatory for one month about a year ago and during that time I started flexability exercises.  I rarely have these pains anymore. I still have some difficulty getting up from a squatting position though.  I think the exercises really help and I have been walking also.  I still have some hot flashes, but not as bad as they were the first couple of years.  They are mostly at night so i keep my bedroom really cold and keep a fan by my bed.

Not just any headache but one that, never went away, hurt intensely, and didn't lessen with any medications. I was moody and irritable, joint pain in knees, cholesterol raised dramatically, already had hot flashes and lack of libido. IT WAS UNBEARABLE! I stopped taking it and will see what my 6 month mammagram shows.

This is after taking tamoxifen for five years previously for the original, non-metastatic diagnosis.  The only really bothersome side-effect for me has been weight gain, but having been on the tamoxifen for so long before hand (and having already had a hystorectomy) I don't know that the usual menopausal type symptoms would even apply.  I would certainly recomend this medication to someone in my situation.  
Other	Catrinka, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	6/6/2009 12:05:45 AM	I was diagnosed with Leiomyosarcoma, had a complete hysterctomy and 7 months of chemo. My tumor was hormone receptive and I was started on Arimidex after completion of my chemo. I remain NED at last CT/Pet which was done 1 yr post chemo. I have had no side effects. The only thing that I am experiencing is NO LABIDO. However, this I feel is in direct correlation with my hysterectomy. I take a calcium/magnesium supplement to help defer the effects of bone loss. I am 51 yrs old. My last bone scan showed minimal loss. I have faith that Arimidex will assist in the decreasing the risk of recurrance of cancer. I can handle any side effects if I know I remain cancer free. It is worth it to me. I have had difficulty losing the 30 lbs. I gained while going through my cancer treatment. I don't know if Arimidex contributes to this. And, I have a small amount of edema which I understand is a side effect of Arimidex. Again, I feel the benifits out weigh the risks and side effects and plan to continue taking this medication indefinitly.

Have experienced joint pain for which exercise has helped. One doctor told me to get 8 hours of sleep every night. I believe this has helped immensely. Glad to know that others have experienced the weight gain and thinning hair. I use Rogaine. The most bothersome side effect are the hot flashes. I will try the effexor. I am extremely grateful to be alive totake Arimidex, having lost a very good friend to breast cancer 9 years ago.

Bone density has deteriorated severely and hip and knee are very painful.  I do not believe that depriving the whole body of estrogen is a good remedy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  I am trying to find a better alternative, but Aromasin seems to cause similar problems.  Will probably quit soon in favor of nutritional and alternative health solutions.

I would cry in an instant over everything, or nothing.  I tried to take this medicine twice, with the same results each time.  I finally made the decision to stop taking it permanently.  If I were to only have 3 good years of life remaining, it would beat having 5 -10 years while taking Arimidex.  This drug is horrible!

I have developed the arthritic pains in my hands and I have flare-ups of aches and pains in my arms, back and legs.  I discovered that by seriously reducing the sugar in my diet, most of the pain disappears.  An occasional Motrin takes care of the arthritic thumb joint.

WRONG!  I have been dizzy, had hot flashes, vaginal burning and dryness, and am extremely worn out.  I thought it was something else, till I decided to check on the side effects again -- hadn't looked since before I started the drug.  Guess I have to keep on for 4 1/2 more years, since I don't want the cancer back.  If this is the way it is, it is going to be a very long 4 1/2 years.  It sure would be nice to feel good again......but I guess that won't happen for a long time.

After 3 months of this I was switched to Aromasin which is similar.  After only 3 doses of this I started with the really bad headaches again.  So now I have stopped this also.  Will start on something new soon. Five years was just too long to suffer with the headaches.  Otherwise I would have remained on it because it has a very good success rate.

I have pretty severe shoulder pain, short term memory loss,and the fatigue has started. Also,I have a lot of insomnia, and cannot lie on my left side(my favorite) for very long due to hip pain.I don't know about the hair thinning yet, because I had just completed chemo, and my hair is still trying to grow back, although it does seem to be coming back slowly.  At my checkup the nurse seemed less than interested in my side effects.  I am very thankful for the medicine, but, I,too, worry about the long term effects on the body.Thanks to all of you who have taken the time to post, it is very helpful. God Bless us all.

On Arimidex since end of radiation treatments in November of '06.  Many side effects -- 40-pound weight gain; hot flashes which are better now with Effexor; hip pain (burning sensation after walking not very far); stiff joints; and mainly FATIGUE.  Feel 90 years old with no sex drive whatsoever.  Will remain on this drug for another 2 1/2 years with reservations.  Best of luck to other cancer survivors!

After reading all the commments you all have posted, you have put my mind at ease.  I have been on this drug for 7 months and take it at night.  The hot flashes are unbearable but taking this at night I dont notice the hot flashes that much.  I was terrified of the severe upper arm pains i get, but I see I am not alone. The pains last 2-3 days each time then goes away for a while.  I do have to concentrate harder and write things down to remember. I cant wait for the 5 years to be over. I guess the benefits outweigh the side effects.  I dont have hair loss with this drug but it has come back (after chemo) very curly (UGH!!)  Thank you so much for your comments!!!

Joint and muscle, insomnia, higher cholesterol &amp; triglycerides were the worst, and trigger finger in my thumb. I went off the drug 2 mos ago, and the trigger finger is much better as well as aches &amp; pains. More energy and feel much better in general. Doctor is going to put me on Aromasin (sister drug).

I am on HRT for men and the aromatization of the testosterone they were giving me was worse than the low level. This stuff has ceased the aromatization completely and I feel like a man again. I know most of the women wont find this helpful but I dont like having estrogen in my blood stream........

I am doing great.  My first MRI last week came out clear and I don't need to have another one for 6 months.  I hope this helps someone who has to take this medication.
Breast Cancer	cocoa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	2/12/2009 4:24:14 PM	I am 2 years into the Arimidex treatment.  Can't wait for the 5 years to be over with.  Extreme joint pain which moves all over the body.  Most pain is in the hips, legs and feet. Alot of trouble getting up from a sitting position and don't even think about squatting.  I'm 44 years old and feel 90.  Sleepless nights, hot flashes, the works.  Recently diagnosed with Osteoporosis, most likely caused by the Arimidex per my oncologist.  Remains to be seen what that medication causes.  Just tired of the whole situation.  Definitely will not take it after 5 years.  To me, quality of life is much more important than long lifespan.  I just hope it is actually working.  
Breast Cancer	35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	4	5	2		35-44	2/11/2009 10:05:39 PM	Wow!  Finally hearing the &quot;truths&quot; behind this medicine.  I took Arimidex for four years.  Never thought I would be one of those patients who took themselves off the medicine but...after a 30 pound weight gain I emotionally couldn't take it anymore.  No matter how much I exercised and cut my calories I gained weight.  My doctor told me to stop eating so much!! How insulting!  Finally feel great about me again!  There's a lot to be said about feeling good.
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	2/4/2009 6:32:34 PM	I have taken this drug for 2 1/2 yrs. In the beginning I too experienced all the side effects mentioned, but they have subsided somewhat. Still have night sweats, memory is sporadic, but joint pain is minimal and so is leg and hand spasms. Hopefully when this is over everything will be back to normal,time will tell. Wish you all good health and God Bless.

They said &quot;Why don't you go somewhere else,if you don't like our choices for yo.Like how rude is that?

I thought my trigger fingers &amp; thumb was from excessive knitting! Like most of what I read, I have aches &amp; pain in getting around in morning, tiredness, hot flashes every hour,fuzzy brain, feel older than 56. Cholesterol went up too. Eat healthy, ladies! and exercise daily-after 2 surgeries, chemo &amp; radiation, I don't want cancer again.

I am starting to have more fatigue and overall pain in bones and muscles. My hair is thinning and I feel terrible! I don't have much choice in taking this drug but the side effects are worse than I expected. Maybe just finishing 13 months of chemo and starting to feel better made this even harder to take. I usually very optimistic but find myself more depressed than I've ever been. My oncologist says these side effect usually get better after the first 6-8 months. I sure hope he's right!

Breast Cancer	D-Mac, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	1/13/2009 10:57:41 PM	I have only been on Arimidex for three months.  I am experiencing all of the side effects you have described.  Trouble sleeping, aches in every joint and muscle, and pain when trying to be intimate with my husband.  My oncologist took me off of this drug today.  Thank You!  I was cancer free for 11 years, and found a small lump in the affected breast that had been treated with lumpectomy and radiation,in May of 2008.  I had a mastectomy.  Taking Arimidex was an option for me, not a requirment.  I am also taking Zometa, which is an IV, given every four months.  It is normally given to patients with osteoporosis.  Tests have shown that it can also help to prevent a reoccurrance of breast cancer.  I'm going to continue with that treatment.  God Bless all of you!

I too have all the symptoms/ side effects of severe joint pain, hot flashes/flushes, stiffness, memory issues and wonder too if there are long-term effects to taking this drug. I think it is too early to know the effectiveness for me so rated low. I am 58 years old (57 when diagnosed) and feel many days like I am 90! It is not a pleasant drug to take and I only pray the benefits outway all this.

I received a lumpectomy with a second resection due to cancer still on the margins.  I also had a hysterectomy with ovary removal in 2006.  I have found that I have memory loss, weight gain and severe pain in my joints.  I worry that the Arimidex is doing permanent damage to my joints.  It is comforting to hear that everyone is having the same problem. (if there is any comfort in that!)  My questions is what happens after the 5 year period.

While I'm relived to now know what's causing me to feel 100 years old, I'm wondering if I can stand all the side effects for another year.  Any discussion with one's doctors for alternatives or help with the side effects would be greatly appreciated.  I have muscle weakness, sore joints, consipation, hot flashes, memory problems and weight gain.  I'm exhausted when I get home from work and go to bed.  The extra rest does not help.

I have extremely painful joints.  Joint pain seems to move around.  For the past several weeks it is concentrating in my shoulders.  I can't lift my arms, can't sleep--basically debilitating.  I can't bend over or kneel.  I'd really like to know what permanent damage is being done.  Is it nerve damage or arthritis?  I feel like I'm going to be disabled before long.  Trying to work full time through this and drag myself every day.  I'd appreciate any feedback.

Don't understand why. Looking for recent articles on research. Have little to no pain, some hot flashes in the evenings. Am 58, 150 lbs., had a mastectomy &amp; chemo in 2005. Sometimes take AdvilPM to sleep. Trouble remembering things at times &amp; wonder if that's related. Don't know how I would have survived if it wasn't for Wayne W.

Currently experiencing joint/muscle pain and stiffness, hot flashes, thinning hair, weight loss and sleepless nights.  I have vaginal discharge and dryness.  Dr recommended I douche with 1/4 vinegar and distilled water (I douche each time I shower and use a lubricate during intercourse).  Also have 7% bone density loss and will be starting Actonel. Considering Femara.  I take calcium, D, Magnesium, C, Folic Acid, Flaxseed oil and Fish Oil.  I work out three times a week cardio and weights and bike and play golf.  Sometimes these activities are harder to do but I do it as much as possible.  So far mentally I'm fine.  Thank you for sharing your experiences.  It has helped me continue on and so far cancer free.

Have been on Arimidex for about 2 years. Tops of my feet tingle and it can be painfull to wear shoes laced snugly.  Left thumb pain, all fingers aresore.  Knee paid but I think that is related to weight and previous history of knee pain/injury before Arimidex.  Hip pain when laying on my side.  Previous history of LBP so do not feel Arimidex has influenced the pain I already have in back.  Elbow pain sometimes at night.  Had problems sleeping during first year but no problems now.  I had hot flashes before Arimidex due to full historectomy at age 33 for endometriosis so it is nothing new for me. I have some hair thining but could be in genes,,mom has that problem too. Memory loss is bothersome,, especially because retaining info for my new job has been difficult at times.  I also find I am not able to type as fast or as accurately as before.  Not sure why but all of this is just fine with me as long as cancer does not come back..  PS: CANCER SUCKS

The fatigue I had ascribed to my heart meds and condition may very well be due to this drug. Changes in my drug plan have made this drug too costly.  I am considering stopping it or getting it online at less than half of the cost.  Consulting with my oncologist this week before deciding.

Recently they discovered benign lessions in my right breast. Should I take Arimidex as a precautionary measure. Or, just keep the breast under survailance, rather than endure the potential side effects of Arimidex.

Been on Arimidex for almost a year and I've actually LOST weight, no hair loss, some short term memory loss (formerly attributed to that second glass of wine), no dizziness, fatigue or sleeplessness.  Four hundred hot flashes a day reduced to one or two with the help of Effexor (thank you, Drug Gods!), but I do experience frequent extreme pain at the base of both thumbs,  Usually Aleve works for that.  As others have said, this sure beats the alternative.  I'm very lucky to have good insurance because this drug runs to about $11 per pill, for which the drug maker should be ashamed.Stay positive, girlfriends!

I'm 65, and my symptoms continue to change. Have the ache joints, specially the shoulders, hands hips. Stiff in the mornings and then again late in the day around 4 or 5pm.  I find a nap really helps. Insomnia for 21/2 yrs, just now getting better. Memory loss, thinning hair, depression. Now dizzness and vertigo have just started, and my cholesterol &amp; triglycerides are high. Never had that problem before. And trigger finger in my thumb - WOW! It's excruciating! I do wish the doctors had told me to expect some of these problems. And even with all these symptoms aren't we blessed to be cancer free. I won't stop taking Arimidex, I would worry myself to death. Thank you all for sharing, it makes it much easier to cope with, and now I don't feel like I'm alone or going crazy. Keep the faith ladies.

The worst side effect with which I am dealing is trigger finger and both thumbs.  The pain is excruciating and almost unbearable at times; taping provides only moderate relief.  Have some hair thinning and occasional fatigue which a 10-minute nap relieves.  I'm not even considering going off this drug but am afraid that surgery is in the offing for the trigger finger situation.  Was tested for arthritis and, through process of elimination, have pretty much concluded that it's the Arimidex.  Am blessed to continue to be cancer free, so will continue to &quot;grit it out&quot; for the next 2 1/2 years.  To any of you ladies who have had the surgery for trigger fingers - was it successful and do you recommend it?  Thanks for &quot;listening&quot;!

I am glad to be cancer free and will continue the Arimadex, but at 59 I feel like I'm 80.  Hot flashes, aches &amp; Pains, stiffness, trouble getting up when stooping, extreme tiredness, trying to exercise and walk to build my bones, but am so tired.  Broke a bone this year and discovered my osteopenia had turned into severe osteoporosis.  I've always thought of myself as healthy &amp; energetic before, but now I seem to be a tired, very fragile, old woman -- but praise God at least I'm cancer free.

I've been on Arimidex for 2 1/2 yrs. Experienced same aches &amp; pains, but unable to sleep has been awful. But better than having cancer. Just this last month I have been dizzy, off balance, and now vertigo. Just knowing I'm not the only one makes it easier to cope with. I didn't know what a trigger finger was (never heard of it), but my thumb is like that. I just thought it was arthritis, but now I can gladly &quot;live&quot; with it. Sure it hurts, but we are cancer free. That is a blessing and I can take Arimidex and not worry as much. With God's help we are survivors. It's been three cancer free years for me.
Breast Cancer	PinK, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	10/16/2008 5:08:32 PM	I tried Arimidex after trying Femara and Aromasin. With all three of these I experienced severe, debilitating headaches, confusion and some major depression. I was unable to function and had to make the decision to stop taking anything. This was after my 5-year stint with Tamoxifen from which I had few if any side effects. Since my cancer was stage 3, I am quite anxious about not taking anything at all. Searches for other options have left me worried and frustrated.

I've gained weight, had horrible pain in my joints, especially my legs, hair thinning, horrible sweats(My oncolgist put me on Neurontin 2x daily which helped alot) and most recently vaginal bleeding. Which I thought was my period back again.  (I haven't had it in 3 years). I've also had vaginal dryness and my gyn has put me on Vagifem.  She says this dryness is common in women post menopausal women.  The bleeding is recent and I called my oncologist who said to stop taking the Arimidex. I had a biopsy which came back benign. Since I've stopped the Arimidex I've lost weight, do not have the vaginal dryness and feel like myself again.  I'm debating going on the Arimidex again.  Anybody else going through this?

I'm 57 and suffer from the same side effects as most of you...fuzzy memory, joint pain, hair loss, weight gain...but I haven't seen anyone mention painful intercourse.  I've asked 5 doctors and they all suggest lubrication. That's not the problem.  My cervix doesn't seem to open, so I feel like I'm giving birth in reverse.  I'm wondering if it's from the lack of hormones in my body.  Anyone else having this problem or am I just crazy?

After a lumpectomy and radiation tx. I was put on Tamoxifen for several years then changed to Arimidex. Now I experience less side effects/hot flashes and I am a lot more comfortable on Arimidex. I will soon be evaluated by an Oncologist to determine when I can discontinue the Arimidex. I also take Calcium and Vitamin D. My bone density tests show I am in a normal range for my age.

Unlike most of the patients, I did not have breast cancer, but uterine cancer, stage IV, spread to my lungs. Have had one scan in late May and the Arimidex has prevented any growth or spread of the cancer. But I am miserable. It helps to know other women have experienced the same side effects. I was beginning to think it was all in my head. Some days every bone and joint in my body hurts and I am so tired. Especially painful are ankles, feet, and hands. I don't see my oncologist again until Oct. Has anyone found any relief for the pain. I feel like I can't lead a normal life.

I just started radiation treatments on Friday.  Saturday I felt so wiped out it scared me.  I thought, how can I do radiation therapy for six more weeks if I'm this tired from the first dose?  Is this normal, or is the the two things combined at the same time.  Please answer. I had estrogen positve, node negative, Her2 minus, 1.4 cm breast cancer.  Thank you.

Still have a lot of fatigue, some days worse than others. Still, I wouldn't even consider stopping the drug, because it's working so well for me. I was relieved to read all the posts and see that other gals are having the same symptoms.

I am hoping it will all go away soon which some say it will. It makes it very hard to exercise.  I go to Curves 5 days a week and can barely make it around one circuit.  I was hoping to include walking too but the tiredness I feel now makes that impossible.  I definately will take the drug longer to see if alot of the side effects go away in time.  Thinking very positive here.

After a year I changed to Aromasin because of muscle aches, but didn't see much difference.  So - I went back on Aimidex after my last check up in February.  Muscle aches are my only side-effect.  I can live with that.

Did chemo and went on Femara.After 2 years on Femara had blood clots in both lungs probably due to femara since Dr took me off immediately.  Now on Armidex for about 2 years and have many of the problems others have mentioned esp pains and aches in  joints and back, trigger fingers etc.  I feel much older than my 64 years. I'm only staying on because my last tumor was inoperable (between the sternum and aorta) and I don't want the cancer to come back.

Along with the muscle pain that others have experienced, I now have something called &quot;fatty liver&quot; which was diagnosed by ultrasound because my liver enzymes had increased.  Have rib pain on myright side which makes it difficult to sleep on that side (my favorite) but alsofrightens me.  My cholesterol level has increased since taking this drug and I cannot take statins because of the muscle pain associated with them. I am trying to lose weight but very difficult.  Eat lots of salads and am hungry all the time.  Oncologist said she has never heard of this side effect from the drug, but I have read that tamoxifin sometimes has this side effect.  Blood is being retested in a month and I hope that enzyme levels are down. I have been taking milk thistle and eating artichokes (without butter of course) which I heard is good for &quot;fatty liver&quot;.

Breast Cancer	Rosco, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	4/23/2008 8:58:58 PM	I have joint pain, tingling in my hands and feet, occasional sharp pain (like a needle sticking me) in my hands, feet and legs and sometimes elsewhere on my body.  I am embarassed to rub these areas because someone may see me.  Rubbing does help.  Also, if my skin is exposed then, I have more prickly pain, I guess from wind or air conditioning.  While I'm covered up at night, I don't feel the tingling or sharp stabbing pains.  Also am tired all the time but, am starting an exercise program, mostly walking.  I'm up to 2 miles and feel much better because I sleep earlier.  I have occasional headaches that seem to be less frequent and less intense as time goes by.  I have been on Arimidex since March '07.  I also have trouble with weight.  There should be something that can counter the weight gain.  Maybe each of us needs a different dosage of Arimidex.  Maybe we all need to be reassessed.  I think some of us just need to take a pill once a week or once a month, depending on how our well being is, i.e. other health conditions.  If they're giving us the same dosage then, there should be some research for different types of cancers and symptoms.  I think, for me, my Doctor should cut me back on Arimidex, say maybe once or twice a week only.  I'll ask him this week some time.  Just to let you know, most of my symptoms started off pretty intense but, is subsiding with exercise, vitamins, antioxidants, water, milk, yogurt, more vegetables and more rest.

Just finished 36 radiation treatments. To all of you who have trigger fingers and carpal tunnel: I've had cortisone shots for triggers and surgery for carpal 4 years before I was even diagnosed with cancer. My orthopedic surgeon told me that these conditions are VERY COMMON in postmenopausal women, so the Arimidex may not be the cause.  I feel so lucky that my cancer was diagnosed so early. I had a very small tumor in each breast, needed only lumpectomies and radiation. I also was diagnosed with osteoporosis ten years ago and have been on Fosamax ever since, which my oncologist was happy to hear. I feel so blessed to have had early diagnosis and excellent doctors. I wish you all could feel as well and as lucky as I do. I hope you regain your health and THRIVE!  Bless you all.

Lumpectomy, radiation &amp; Arimedex for two yrs now. Very active  before using this drug. I have had increasing weight gain, dizziness, falling, dry mouth, headaches, fatigue, blurred vision and most of all painfully swollen joints. I sit here now with my leg propped up with ice packs. I stopped taking arimedex about Jan this year. felt so much better except for joints. Went for my mammogram this week and clusters of calcifications were found in same breast. Biopsy next day. I don't know what to think now. Is this a reprocussion from stopping the drug?? Who knows. I also had a MRI done due to increasing headaches &amp; blurred vision. No sign of cancer but a cluster of blood vessels have ruptured. Not a stroke but was told this was a side effect from chemo which I did NOT have. Very depressing. What next?! I do offer taking effexor for the hot flashes. My hot flashes stopped immeadiately! Ask your Dr. It does work!!!I wish you all well.

Symptoms started showing up about 3 or 4 months into treatment.  Bones, joints and muscle pain occur all over with some days worse then others.  Had lower back and hip pain originally which is now worse.  Also insomnia and feet feel like they are on fire all the time.  The Doc took me off for awhile to see if it's really the Arimidex.  Been off for about 4 weeks and see no difference....wondering if it takes longer for the symptoms to disapper?  See the Doc next week and I'm sure he's going to recommend trying another drug (Aromasin) which I doubt will be any better.  Has anyone have had experience with that?

Fatigue, weakness,hot flashes day and night. Stiff joints, fuzzy memory at times, insomnia and feel like I am 100. Maybe even a little depressed from the way I feel all the time. Never any energy. Work full time but it is hard.Am switching to Femara but I think will have the same side effects pretty much. Can't wait for the 5 years to be up. These meds are affecting my quality of life. Hope my body can stand the course of these medications. Everyone says &quot;I look good&quot; but they cannot really see just how bad I feel.Maybe all the research being done will develop a medication that is effective but with less side effects. We can only hope.That is what I have learned to do best throughout this diagnosis ... HOPE.

Breast Cancer	cclark, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	45-54	3/29/2008 11:14:57 PM	No problem with hot flashes or joint pain.  Have some muscle weakness and mainly notice it when getting up from chair.  I walk regularly and did yoga for a long period of time after my BC treatment.  I walked in the Susan G. Komen 3-Day 60 Mile Walk last October and was seriously stiff throughout each day's 20 mile walk.  There were no chairs and I hated to sit down in the rest areas since I had to get to the ground and up again.  Sleep is fairly normal now though has been poor during and after chemotherapy.  I haven't gained any weight but until recently haven't been able to lose any of the chemo weight (+17 pnds) either.  Started a low-carb diet 3 weeks ago and have lost 4 pnds to date.  Oncology nurse practicioner at major cancer center recently told me that of all the women she has seen who are on Arimidex, only a handful had not gained weight.  Found it interesting that others had swelling or increased problems with lymphedema because I've noticed some of that as well.   I'm trying to alleviate side effects through exercise, diet, and relaxation techniques (such as massage, yoga, guided imagery).
Breast Cancer	Barbara, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	65-74	3/29/2008 9:47:31 PM	I have been taking Arimidex for 3 months. Have shoulder, upper arm, chest and breast pain mostly when I awake in the mornings. My hands ache most of the time and have dry mouth in the mornings. Water walking and stretching 4-5 times weekly helps tremendously. It was interesting to read that so many women have the same symtoms that I do. I have an appointment with my oncologist next week who will review my symtoms.  I am aware that all drugs have side effects. Hopefully, these will subside in time.

Had left index trigger finger. (relieved to hear others had it too); thinning hair. Had high BP but don't know whether it was because of Arimidex. Now BP very high and referred to cardiologist who did echocardiogram which showed thickened heart muscle. After checking info on internet found some possible causal relationship to heart problem because Arimidex depletes body calcium (for which taking Fosamax and Caltrate with D) also experience lightheadedness which could be heart related or medication. Thanks so much for sharing; very appreciated. God Bless us all. 
Locally Advanced Breast Carcinoma	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	55-64	3/25/2008 8:06:53 PM	I have taken Arimidex for 5 yrs post chemo and radiation.  I read extensively the side effects of both tamoxifen and arimidex before I chose.  The research facts gave better long term results with the arimidex.  It seemed that the earlier research gave joint pain and stiffness as a lesser side effect but I was greatly effected by that as well as the development of osteoporosis.   Both in the morning and after sitting even for a short time period it was difficult to move because of the stiffness.  Still in all it is much better than having cancer again,  I am thankful that it was available.

Breast Cancer	Jo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	3/24/2008 8:13:03 AM	What has appeared after 4 1/2 years on arimidex, I have suffered 5 bladder infections in the past 12 months and 3 in the first year. The tests has shown that due to lack of estrogen in my system, it has caused an imbalance in the bacteria which prevents bladder infections.  Otherwise, like the rest, weight gain, joint issues which could go along with my age and not the medication.

Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	Diane, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/11/2008 8:11:34 PM	I've just begun my Arimidex treatment. During the first 2 days on the drug, I felt like an Energizer Bunny who had tossed back a handful of &quot;uppers&quot; washed down by several cups of strong coffee. Trying to sleep at night was utterly impossible even with over the counter and prescription sleep aids. After 2 days, I emailed my oncologist who suggested I stop for a week, then resume to see if I get the same results. If so, he'll switch me to Tamoxifen or a similar drug. Has anybody else experienced this same crazy thing? I've also experienced moderate diarrhea and some mild dizziness. I'm hoping that whatever drug is substituted will be kinder to my body. 
Hormone Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer	lisago, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	3/7/2008 12:20:08 PM	Have been on Arimidex about half a year, and have it all  fatigue, joint aches and muscle weakness, swelling in hands (can barely get rings on and off), trigger finger, depression, hot flashes bad enough to disturb sleep, elevated triglycerides.  I was in excellent health before this, and my breast cancer was most likely due to abnormal estrogen, i.e. taking the highest dose of hormone replacement for 8 years.  Of course I discontinued the HRT.  In my case, precautionary removal of the remaining small amount of natural estrogen in my system  seems to me to be overkill.  Ive been told that the risk for me is pretty much reduced almost back to normal (10%) as a result of having gotten pristinely clean margins and the recommended course of radiation.  Next step with oncologist  discuss getting off this, and avoid trying an alternate.  The alternates seem to be just as bad.  The quality of my life is important.
Breast Cancer	Carla, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	3/6/2008 6:59:45 PM	I have been on Arimidex for 4 years. Other than some stiffness in my hands and some weight gain, I've had no side effects. I walk daily and watch my diet. It has been hard to keep my weight down, but well worth the effort. When I found out the obesity is one of the risk factors for breast cancer, I was motived to keep my weight off.

I have since been able to lose 25 lbs. by eating a raw veggie salad for dinner with no cheese or eggs and by working up to walking 3 miles per day. The raw veggies are filling and stick with me so I don't feel so hungary. Works for me!

I have difficulty sleeping due to aching muscles and cramps in feet and legs.  I have a trigger finger and hands are very stiff in the morning.  Mobility after setting a long period of time or sleeping is very difficult.  I take extra vitamins and minerals daily, but would like to know if there is anything I can do to offset the pain. 
Breast Cancer	Shelley, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	55-64	2/25/2008 10:22:25 PM	I have been on Armidex for almost 2 years,when I told my oncologist that I had stopped taking this drug for 2 months hewas very upset and told me that it was necessary for me to take Armidex because itwould not only help to protect me from breast cancer but also other cancers.  I have learned that this drug is a steroid andthat is the reason for the weight and muscle gain.  Also have had trigger finger,and been tierd.  I am also weighing the sideeffects and feel that it is better to bealive than to stop this drug. Wishing everyone good health.  Michele

After reading all the other reviews, I consider myself lucky - no bone pain, flashes, etc. However, I have gained almost 15 lbs in these two months. I never had a weight problem before. Asked both my surgeon and oncologist about a connection with Arimidex. Neither gave me anything but a very vague 'watch what you eat answer'. Additional investigation has proved there is better science about the connection between low/no estrogen and weight-gain out there and I should have been told! I could have been pro-active. I'm hoping that weight watchers will help. Otherwise I'll be 500lbs when my 5-year course-of-treatment is over.

Since finishing chemo &amp; radiation I have been on Arimidex. I have hot flashes all day, can't sleep at night and when I wake up or stand up I hurt all over- mostly in my arms and shoulders and feet. Today I went to my oncologist and he is going to have me try Femara for 1 month and see if the pain is any better. After reading all the comments I am glad I am not alone in this- I agree with the one lady who is going off of it and wants quality not quantity. Good luck to all of you!!
Breast Cancer	katie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	55-64	2/12/2008 7:14:18 PM	I have taken this drug for 5 years and was finally released from this treatment in Jan.08. I had all of the side effects that others have spoken of on this web site; trigger finger, joint pain, no sex drive, bladder infections, couldn't sleep, hot flashes etc...however I didn't like what the alternative could have been and as each year went by, some of the side effects disappeared; others remained.  The drug was my security blanket and now that I no longer have to take it, I am a little fearful of my cancer returning because hormone receptors are no  longer supressed.  I can't find info on what happens after this treatment is over. This medication has great promise to breast cancer patients even though the side effects are hard to live with. It could never be as bad as chemotherapy and how hard it was on my family.
Breast Cancer	abpack@aol.com, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female		2/9/2008 12:38:56 AM	I am 75 years old &amp; after mastectomy, chemo, radiation  was 3 years on Tamoxifen. I have been on Arimidex for 4 years. Have very bad joint pain, especially in my knees &amp; hands. Fingers swollen &amp; very stiff. Also have serious weight gain that I can't seem to lose. Serious dizziness too. Have been on Actonel about 3 years. So far cancer has not returned and am hoping despite some other side effects from Arimidex, I will still have some quality of life left after I stop taking it.

Joint pain and stiffness in AM has subsided somewhat after the first few months.  I have tried to exercise, lift weights, hike, ski, Pilates regularly and would recommend it, because it helps with the stiffness and will help counteract the osteopenia side effect of the drug. Hot flashes, every 1-2 hours and often they wake me up at night. Yes, I have gained about 10 pounds and it does not want to go away!  My main concern are the periods of depression and feelings of my self being gone.

The pain in my hands at times is unbearable.  The joints hurt most of the time and three fingers are numb.  I have trouble if I sit to long getting.  The doctor is taking me off the drug and putting me on Tamoxofin.  I am not sure I want this drug either.

Felt like I was an old woman, trouble getting up from chair &amp; walking long distances.  Because symtoms did not go away after two months off of drug, the Dr. does not think it is the Arimidex but may be arthritis.  But it does not feel like &quot;bone&quot; pain. For anyone going off of drug, how long did it take for side effects to improve?

I do have joint pains in the morning when I get out of bed.However bone loss is a reknown side effect of the drug that is why my Dr recommends I take 3 caltrate pills a day.  I also started working out, lifting weights to prevent any bone loss and make sure I follow a healthy diet.What really bothers me are the hotflashes but would rather live with those than not live at all.

This drug was worse,--constant pain, tingling and swelling in hands and feet, and joint aches, especially elbows and hips.  Killed sexual response. My mood was all over the place.  Arimidex made me feel 80 years old although I am a fit 54.  The final straw was my hair falling out in clumps with every shampoo.  Ridiculous, but I just didn't want to deal with that again after losing all my hair during chemo.  Switched to Femara recently,--hair loss has stopped, but other side effects are no better.

I thought I was having no side effects, but reading the other posts I am wondering if this is what is causing my leg/joint pain and weakness. I am 48, have trouble getting up out of a chair or up from a squatting position, like another post says I feel like an 80-year-old woman. In the morning my feet hurt and I am very stiff and sore. Sometimes my entire body aches. Also trouble sleeping for the first time ever. I am going to talk to my oncologist!

My sympathic nervous system never shut off.  I am finally sleeping again, but I have body pain from the waist down. Muscle and joint aches bad in the legs with my feet getting numb.  The doctor's don't know what to do about side effects and the drugs they give you just have other side effects. So, I am avoiding anything except asprin.  Some days I am in tears the pain is so bad.  I have been on arimidex for 2 years.  I am not sure how much longer I can stay on it.  I have no signs of a reoccurance and feel confident I won't. I'm not sure it's armindex, who knows.

I have constant burning, numbness and tingling in my feet.  I just been diagnosed with a mass on the outside of my uterus.  I had an ultra sound today, but won't know for several days of the outcome.  I feel it is from taking Arimidex.

I have been off of the Arimidex for three months and most of the symptoms have gone away, except for the numbness in my fingers.  I ended up having a carpel tunnel decompression surgery last week.  My hand surgeon told me that he sees a lot of people that have had similar hand and joint problems from taking Arimidex.  I'm so glad I stopped!

Oncologist repeatedly insisted it was not related to Arimidex, so I went through knee injections (Synvisc)and lengthy Physical Therapy.Also had severe low back pain. Therapy in water finally helped ease both. When thumb joints got very painful I began getting cortisone injections. I stopped Arimidex at 3 1/2 yrs. Wish I had stopped sooner! I have just had my second thumb joint replacement this year. Both my breast surgeon and my hand surgeon believe that Arimidex may well have been responsible for my joint disintegration. What good is a &quot;promise&quot; that a drug will keep you safe from the reoccurance of cancer, if your quality of life is taken away?

First, very bad lower back pain then changed to upper arms and shoulders.  Have difficulty putting on a sweater or coat.  Hot flashes have been ok recently -only 1 or 2 a day. Since September have been upping my dose of fish oil capsules (2 a day) and also using flaxseed oil on my oatmeal.  This seems to have helped the pain somewhat. Also take Vitamin B6.  As others have said have gained weight, have fatigue and don't always sleep too well.  My cholesterol level also jumped 20 points in 2 months after taking Arimidex.  I eat lots of fruits and vegetables so this should not happen.  I don't want to take statins for this condition because it has caused muscle pain in the past and with all the aches and pains I have with Arimidex don't need more.
Breast Cancer	Faisan, 55-64	5	5	4		55-64	12/9/2007 1:56:49 AM	I have been taking Arimidex for just over 4 years. I show no signs of recurrence. I had severe arthritis-like pains at the start of my treatment, and suffered two fractures from falls which shouldn't have caused fractures. My pain went away when I started taking Actonel for osetopenia, and I haven't fractured anything since then.

The side effects are very unpleasant.  I've had many but most disappear in a short period of time.  Those that I'm still having cotton mouth, weight gain, water retention and limbs swelling, joint &amp; shin pain, nasty yeast infection and sore mouth (inside upper lip feels scalded), difficulty sleeping.

I have severe hot flashes. 15 to 20 daily even on the Effexor.  I have muscle and joint pain in the morning.  Brest tenderness,weight gain, sleeplessness. I am on Ambien for that, but still wake up 2-4 times a night with hot flashes.

I experience; memory loss, weight gain, sore joints, hot flashes (2-4 daily) and sleeplessness.  I take effexor to counteract the hot flashes.  Without effexor, I would have 10-15 hot flashes daily.  Effexor also works as an anti depressent.  It reduces hot flashes and your happier.  Not a bad trade off.  It works. . . I am thankful.  I am a second generation brest cancer survivor.  And plan to stay that way.

All your joints ache, can't sleep, diarrhea, constipation, no memory, hot flashes, weight gain and not able to lose it.  Can't get an insurance policy because you have to still take a medication as treatment, even though the medicine is supposedly preventing a recurrance.  I quit and feel so much better.  I'm living for quality not quantity now.

I want to thank everyone for their comments.  I have gained a lot of weight and when I asked my oncologist if Arimidex caused weight gain,he said &quot;Not really&quot;  From the comments it seems I am not the only one.  My last blood tests showed my glucose was above normal and my cholesterol too which I think is from the weight gain.  Also I have osteopenia which is a side effect of Arimidex. Now I am on Boniva for that. I am grateful for the drug but will be happy to finish the 5 year treatment and I hope I am not ruining my health in other areas.

Over all bone pain, diffuculty sleeping. The only good thing thus far is that I am still cancer free, 3 years after 6 chemo treatments (TAC) &amp; 40 round of radiation.

My oncologist wants to put me in a study where I would continue the drug for another 5 years.  The probpem is that I have an existing heart problem (mitral valve prolapse and the ejection fraction has been reduced within the past couple of years)-- coupled with a lung condition.  My pulmonary doctor tells me that I have chronic emphasyma (I never smoked).  I think that the radiation therapy, after chemo, didn't do my lungs any good.  I've had weak lung tissue for years and had pneumothorax on the right and left side and had surgery on both of them. Needless to say, I have tried, in vain, to find more extensive information on arimidex.  When it lists the side effects of Airmidex,lung and heart problems are just two of them.  I have other side effects, but the heart and lungs are my main concern--especially if they want me to continue this drug..  My breast cancer affected five of my lymph nodes.   I would like to know, exactally, how  or what this drug does, specifically, to the lungs and heart.  I hope you can help.  Thank you for your time.  Mary
