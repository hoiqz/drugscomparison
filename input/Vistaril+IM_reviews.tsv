I ended up back at the hospital because I started having symptoms of a stroke. Scariest thing I have ever experienced. I will never take it again.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Jenny, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	12/30/2009 7:37:36 PM	I moved to another state and had to find a new doctor for my health issues one of which is chronic insomnia. My new doctor wants to wean me off of Ambien and Xanax (which are working fine combined for my insomnia) and this is the second prescription she has put me on for sleep. w 50mg of this medication did nothing for me, after 3 hours of tossing and turning I took an Ambien and fell asleep within 15 minutes. What another waste of time.
Severe Itching	lisagarrison10@yahoo.com, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	12/16/2009 10:26:25 PM	I was given this medication to treat severe hives that I've had for the last 6 months.  Been to the ER three x's, 6 doctor's visits, and 1 allergist.  I have 0 allergies.  Blood all normal.  This medication helped the first week I used it. Now it just makes me groggy and I still have severe itching. Taking a cocktail of meds...Clarinex, Vistaril, and Doxepin.  Nothing. No good.  I asked the doctor how can this med work for me, I'm not allergic to anything, which is what the med is prescribed for, so it must be something else.  He said it would work regardless of why.  He said once I forgot about the hives they would go away....Okay. I'm trying.  In the meantime I'm going to an intern then a determatologist. This is ridiculous!

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	10/19/2009 10:03:55 PM	I was given this for anxiety, however I am afraid to take it during the day for fear that I will be a zombie, or too tired to function at work. It was also prescribed to help me sleep.  I do sleep however I have had the worst nightmares and just plain whacked out dreams, like people getting murdered and other crazy stuff  I have also noticed that I startle very easily when I am sleeping.  My husband will whisper my name and I jump up screaming.  It's actually kind of scary.  I will probably stop taking it.

I experienced dreaming but didn't improve sleep and increased to 50mg.50mg only increased the restless sleep but also experience excessive dreams and nightmares. Worst nights sleep I ever experienced.

Nausea and Vomiting	Migrainelady, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	45-54	3/9/2009 11:56:01 PM	Vistaril IM (IM means it's injected).  I have had it twice.  Once in conjunction with Demerol for a migraine and once post surgically for nausea (general anesthetic).  Both times it worked it's magic on the incredible nausea.  I keep it in the back of my mind for the next time I have a general anesthetic since I am always ill afterwords no matter what I am promissed.  The ease of use is lower because you have to wait for a nurse with a sharp needle.

Anxious	gracegraciela@aol.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	5	2	Female	45-54	3/8/2008 12:50:05 PM	I feel as though it has &quot;altered&quot; my mood.  I didn't like what it did to me.  Stayed in my system for a long time; ie jittery, just felt &quot;out of it&quot;.
Additional Medications to Treat Pain	PerfectKitty, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	12/6/2007 11:30:56 AM	I was given Vistaril &amp; Diluadid at the same time and the Diluadid had most of the effects on my body pain. But the Diluadid made me groggy for five days so I'm sure the Vistaril took away the side effects of the itching from the other drug. Together they took away the pain but man, trying to get back to normal is still a challenge. Today is day five since I got out of the hospital and I'm still feeling the effects...
