Lack in Vitamins	cajungirl053, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/4/2010 2:18:17 PM	My doctor prescribed Encora to me after I  explained to her I was experiencing mood swings and feeling tired all the time. I had had a partial hysterectomy 14 years prior, but not any hormones due to my levels were still up.  Took Encora with no side effects, felt better than I did in years. One day went to re-fill and my pharmacist informed me of the recall.  Since then, I have been taken another Women's Vitiamin Pack (6 tablets verse 2) daily) and am re-experiencing the emotional mood swings, feeling really tired.  Had my doctor check the ingredient of the vitiams and she gave me a list of additional vitiamins for me to take along with the 6 pills already taking.  Still not feeling much better.  Does any one know when a vitiamin like Encora will be on the market?

There are hopes that the vitamin will be available once again soon.

When will they be back on market or what other product has similiar balance or vitamins etc. I recommended to several friends including my pharmacist, who all loved them. Now I'm retired, recovering from surgery and just can't get my Mogo back11 Help
Other	PHC, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	9/15/2009 9:03:24 AM	The omega-3 helped in lowering my cholestrol and I also found that the Encora had enhanced my memory and maintained my energy level to the max.  After it was recalled and my discontinued of the vitamin and I found that my energy level had dropped drastically and I have a hard time remembering thinks unless I write it down. The 3 years that I was on Encora I felt great and I'm a mom of 2 highly intelligent and energenic children (9yr son and 3 1/2 yr old daughter)  and an entreprenuer (16 yrs) and trying to balance everything is very exhausting.  However, when I was on the vitamin (Encora) exhaustion was not even in the picture.  Since May 2009 (after I had completed my last pack) I have tried other mutivitamins and other supplements, I noticed they did not help.  I'm always tired now and my  memory is very poor.  I need to be back on Encora (I don't know if the FDA had lifted the recall). I believed Encora had worked very well for me personally.

I *really* liked it, and like others was really dismayed when I could not get it due to &quot;manufacturer back order.&quot; I learned myself thru the web about the manufacturer recall and was concerned. Apparently ALL similar products were pulled due to lower than acceptable standards in the plant...I was JUST able to order Encora again, today, so perhaps all is resolved. I am looking forward to being back on it! I feel like I noticed a big difference being off of it for now about 3 months.

Mi doctor me receto estas vitaminas y me siento diferente con mucha energia.  Cuando por descuido las dejo de consumir regresa el cansancio y los dolores de cabeza.  Mi medico me dijo q ya no la estan haciendo pq los planes medicos no las quieren pagar.  Como podre conseguirla aunque no las cubra el plan medico.  Estoy dispuesta a pagar por ellas.  Los calentones pre-menopausia han regresado bien fuertes necesito conseguir estas vitaminas.  Por favor, como puedo conseguirlas.

I was perscribed Encora when I was going through infertility treatments. I took it for years, even after my son was born because I love how effective it is. I am so confident that it gives me the right vitamins at the right times. I am now pregnant again, and have discoverd is is discontinued. I am so disappounted!! I wanted to take it during this pregnancy since I have no doubt it contributed to the health of my son. Does anyone know whay it was discontinued or what I can take that is comparable?

I have found it to be and incredible help to me in every way!  It is a great product ~ I tried to stop taking this and regretted it!  Went back on and feel so much better.

I was just informed by my MD that it has been discontinued. Is there anything else on the market that provides everything that Encora did?

I am told by both CVS and Walgreens that these vitamins have been discontinued by the manufacturer.  I would like an alternate comparable to Encora.  I love the ease of use and the fact that they are made for women and women's needs.  Any suggestions?

My Doc was using this product and suggested that I try it and gave me samples. So now not only am I getting enough Calcium but my hot flashes &amp; night sweats have disipated as well(a bonus I am truly grateful for) I do not take any other prescriptions so encora gives me a base to determine what other supplements I might need. I;m very pleased with my experience with this product!

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/19/2009 11:04:26 PM	I am 42 years old. I had a hysterectomy in Jan. 08 but still have my ovaries. I had started having hot flashes and moodiness again around Sept. My doctor checked my hormones but I was not menaposal. She started me on the Encora and I have felt much better.  I have been on them for 3 months and hardly ever have the flashes or mood swings.  I never had a weight issue until about 3 years ago.  I slowly started gaining weight and dieting didn't help.  Since being on the vitamins I have dropped 12 pounds without dieting.  Its really has balanced my hormones.  I am very satisfied. 
Treatment To Prevent Vitamin Deficiency	Encora, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	12/26/2008 1:03:22 AM	I am allergic to 'cod fish' and to ''soy''.I have had very severe abdominal problems for months now, since I started taking Encora vitamins.  My physician gave them to me, and possibly was unaware of the fact that I am allergic to soy, cod fish.  I always am a Type A bloodtype 57 yr old female, and I do not absorb calcium carbonate well at all.  I do best on Citracal supplements.  Thus this vitamin has ran amuck in my system due to my food (soy and cod fish) allergies, and due to my blood type problems with calcium carbonate.Encora includes cod liver oil, soy, and calcium carbonate in their vitamin regimen.Now all the excess gas, severe abdominal cramping, and allergic reactions will have a chance to stop, so that I may live a normal life.

I was leary about taking them since I have had trouble with nausea when taking vitamins. No trouble! I felt great when I took them. 2 in the morning, two at night. They helped me sleep, and gave me energy during the day. I highly recommend them. 
Other	djamado@optonline.net, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	7/1/2008 12:11:40 AM	I had a bone narrowing and constant severe pain down my arm and fingers eight months.I could not sleep either. The pain was unbearable. After taking Encora for less than one month the pain went away completely! I forgot to take it for one week when I had a cortisone shot and the pain came back in full force. The shot did not work for the pain but encora did. After taking it regurlarly for the next week the pain dissappeared and has not come back! I was told I would need surgery to eliminate the pain. I consider encora a miracle and recommend it to anyone dealing with pain as a resulting from issues with bones. I also sleep better and the doctor told me at 48 I have the uterus of a 20 year old. Side effects include decrease in bowel movements. I have also noticed my skin lighened. Has anyone else?

I am now 49 and have a headache every day.  I have severe low back pain.  I started taking Encore 7 days ago. My back pain is gone and I have only had 1 headache.  Has basically stopped my headaches.  Very little back pain.  Sleep good at night and have energy during the day.  I am so glad I found this medication.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	5/7/2008 1:54:53 PM	I was prescribed this by my doctor, because I will be 40 next year and she thought it would be a good idea to get started on a multi-vitamin.  Now I have been taking this since October 2007, and I am starting to notice a difference in my body.  I feel bloated (as if I am gaining weight).  My menstration has been much lighter (ehich was a problem before), but I am very dissapointed at the fact I feel like I am gaining weight.  I think I might stop for a while and see if I feel less bloated.
