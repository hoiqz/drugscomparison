Emptying of the Bowel	Misty, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	4/23/2012 8:16:01 PM	Medication worked as prescribed as prep for colonoscopy. Bisacodyl 5 mg. tablet worked within 1-hr. Clear watery stools apparent before taking HalfLytely. Followed with HalfLytely as prescribed even though stools were clear. Lemon-Lime mix included in packet seemed to make the drink more palatable and allowed me to burp so as not to fill so bloated/nauseous.  I would use this treatment again but hopefully not for another 10 years. 
Emptying of the Bowel	Texas patient, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	2	1	Female	45-54	1/21/2012 2:10:46 PM	Don't use this prep.  I folowed the instructions to the letter and did everything I was supposed to do, but my doctor couldn't complete my colonoscopy because there was so much stool left in my bowel.  Sounded too good to be true, and it was (just having to drink 1/2 the amount but only did half the job.  An expensive mistake.  Now my doctor has to do another colonoscopy, my insurance company won't cover it, and I will be out thousands of dollars.  In addition, I still can't eat for another 24 hours.  This should never be prescribed.  Beware.
Emptying of the Bowel	Cori, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	45-54	6/29/2011 3:52:56 AM	Wow...after reading the other reviews, I should just say refer to all the negitive comments above...My husband started the HalfLytely Prep Kit yesterday at noon by taking the pills. And 6pm drinking 1/2 the solution as the doctor told him. No bowel movement yet,and it's 13 hours later. Just stomach pain and cramps, and sweats, with a sick feeling. We'll see I guess by morning when he is suppost to drink the other 1/2 of the solution at 7am, for the 11:30am appointment. Very unhappy so far!!

Taste wasn't great, should've tried the Cystal Light I guess but after 5 glasses nothing was happening except I was sick.  Lost it all after the next glass so had to cancel the test, still no bm this morning? Is there any other form of cleansing that works? I wish I had read the reviews and tips prior to starting, every 15-20 minutes and maybe I would've made it.  
Emptying of the Bowel	ttyme03, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/2/2011 10:18:16 PM	Considering the several alternatives that are prescribed to empty the bowel - HalfLytely-Bisacodyl Bowel Kit is EASY to use.  Like another reviewer- I was worried about the potential stomach distresses -namely nausea and vomiting -that are common side affects with this drug.  Needless to say - my doctor's office gave some very simple but effective advice (besides what was on the instructional sheet): a)eat lightly the evening before; b)ingest 8oz+ fluid every hour on the hour until time to drink solution (to tablet at 12, started drinking solution at 4); c) chill and mix each dose with a packet of Crystal Light lemonade powder; d) pace yourself - not everybody can drink that stuff at a rate of 8oz/10min. I did 8oz in 20 min increments and kept moving around instead of sitting.  Basically, I did what I was told.  And having consumed 130oz of clear/light fluids over an 11 hour period (boulion, juice, water, popsicles) - I did not have one ounce of trouble with this prescription.  No side effects, and no bad taste!  You get sick of drinking it after about the 4th or 5th glass. But that is about the worse that happens. The only &quot;side affect&quot; I had was the one that was intended - watery stools. Everything was textbook perfect. I couldn't be happier for being prescribed this versus GoLytely, NuLytely,or the GATORADE/DULCOLAX 5mg/MIRALAX regiment,or a number of other horrible concoctions that are prescribed. 
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	10/23/2010 10:10:36 PM	Wow! I guess I was the only one who broke out in a very itchy rash.  Everyone said to stop, but I wanted to complete the procedure and not have to redo it.  My breathing was okay, and time between drinking was extended to once every 30 - 60 minutes.  Pills did not start bowels.  It was midnight before bowels started and continued all night.  My test was perfect, so I am free for 10 years.  Due to allergic reaction, I will not be able to use this medication again.

Started liquid solution at 6 pm.  After only three glasses, I vomitted and continued vomitting until 9:30 that evening.  Stopped drinking at 7:30 pm due to vomitting.
Emptying of the Bowel	karen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	8/23/2010 1:56:16 PM	My experience with the bisacodyl pills is very different than what two friends of mine experienced. We're all having our first &quot;You're 50 yrs. old&quot; colononoscopies this year. For them, the pills worked gently and overnight. I, on the other hand, got a violent and painful abdominal reaction three hrs. after taking the pills. I went into 'flop sweat' and had difficulty breathing. This while I was repeatedly vomiting. This reaction lasted for over an hour. Thankfully I fell asleep afterward and made it through the night. Today is my Halflytely day. 
Emptying of the Bowel	Elizabeth, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	55-64	10/31/2009 3:36:51 AM	For a week in advance of HalfLytely Day I was concerned about a vomiting reaction. This didn't occur partly because I put an 8 oz mug of the 24-hour prechilled &quot;beverage&quot; in freezer for several min.to make it extra cold. Also I held my nose during 5 gulps; didn't try to do it in fewer. Used 1 gram CrysalLight diet iced tea mix instead of an included flavor packet. (Was warned in advance that they're not palatable.)Ate lightly 2 days before the test, but still needed to drink 7 of the possible 8 glasses. Took 15 not 10 min. between drinks. Was impt. to be GENTLE w myself to prevent any barfing ! I don't have to be retested for another 7 yrs. In the interim I certainly hope a far more palatable solution can be created. Colon testing is very important -- so PLEASE MAKE THE PREP PROCESS FAR MORE USER FRIENDLY ! (Medical field should be encouraging this testing, not deterring it thru such an unpleasant drinking experience.)I wish the best to all future users.      
Emptying of the Bowel	linda702, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	9/11/2009 3:49:31 PM	After reading all the review on the internet is was concerned, there was no reason to worry so much.  I took the tablets and about three hours later started the process, mixed the liguid and put the orange and cherry flavor packets in.  I noticed the sodium taste but it wasn't that bad.  Once I noted clear liquid leaving my system I did not finish the rest, left about 16 ozs.  I also did not drink it quite as fast. This did not seem to have any adverse effects as my test was completed and no problems were found.  Don't scare yourself reading the reviews, it really wasn't bad at all.
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	45-54	8/13/2009 9:52:10 PM	Although it worked for me as far as prepping me for a colonoscopy, I dreaded drinking the large amount of the solution. My anus burned every time I eliminated the watery discharge. With technology today, there has to be a better way to prep one's bowels for a colonoscopy.
Emptying of the Bowel	jo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	7/15/2009 9:13:41 AM	Within 20 minutes of taking the 2 bisacodyl tablets I developed a severe headache.  After an hour I started to drink the solution.  I drank 2 glasses full and got nausea.  I developed pain in my neck,ears,eyes and throat.  Called pharmacy and said it sounded like a reaction.  He advised to stop and call dr.Dr. said was very unusual.  Hung up with him and vomited 5 times through the night.  I did not have procedure. I will never use this again nor would I suggest anyone else too.
Emptying of the Bowel	EJ, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	1		55-64	6/29/2009 8:35:49 PM	This medicine is downright disgusting to use, and far worse than the previous treatment five years ago.  The taste is revolting, and the amount of fluid required to be consumed makes the stomach bloated and uncomfortable.  There has to be something better and more friendly to the patient than this stuff.  It's like sending yourself to a torture chamber where you waterboard yourself on both ends.Perhaps if physicians who order the medicine for their patients tried it themselves it wouldn't be proscribed again.  Again, awful stuff.
Emptying of the Bowel	laura, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	6/18/2009 12:39:14 PM	I was surprised that it wasn't worse, though I was thankful that I didn't have to do the kind where you have to drink a whole gallon.  The Crystal Light suggestion is much appreciated (I have read that some doctors let you add powdered Gatorade).  Although it doesn't turn the stuff into a delightful beverage, I didn't have any trouble getting it down, nor do I have an aversion to lemonade following. I was surprised, also, that there was no cramping.  Just the urge, and the liquid coming out.  However, the number of seconds between the two was in the single digits -- don't be far from the bathroom!Also, for me, the &quot;purge&quot; kept going on intermittently all night and right up until the procedure, which alarmed me, but the nurse assured me that it is normal and expected, and that they have suction machines and all for the liquid during the procedure.  Sorry to be gross, but I was relieved to find that out so I thought I'd pass that on.Another unexpected thing -- drinking that much cold liquid so quickly makes you cold!  I was shivering and needed to bundle up.It's never going to be pleasant, but I feared it would be much worse.

Nurse said to put crystal light in the mixture, worked great.  No adverse effects.. drank it evry 15 minutes rather than 10 and didn't get the upset stomach.. Also kept busy, walked around rather than just sitting.
Emptying of the Bowel	Lin, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/30/2009 7:02:11 AM	I became violently ill - throwing up causing much pain - sweats and difficulty breathing.  After taking the pills I vomited harshly and then tried to continue with the drink - after 2/3's done I throw up with much pain and fright.  I would not use this product or recommend it. 
Emptying of the Bowel	beckster,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female		8/15/2008 11:02:01 PM	Horrible salty taste - gives a bloated feeling from drinking so fast - its worse to drink it slow because the taste is so aweful.
