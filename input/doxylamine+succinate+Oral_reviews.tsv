I have a really hard falling a sleep. Doxylamine puts me out like an ambien does but without the side effects. Anymore than half a tablet, than I'm to tired in the morning to get up. But overall the best sleep aid no doubt.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	65-74	3/8/2012 9:01:47 PM	Tried this for two nights, second night had trouble waking up with increasing difficulty during the day concentrating.  I was unable to drive and blood pressure dropped considerably over the remainder of the day I am 69 years old in good health and not overly medicated otherwise.  I will not take another dose, in fact am flushing the remainder of the container.  Pay close attention to the warnings  drug interaction information was far more extensive on the internet than on the package information.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	fairiegurl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	3/3/2012 8:04:27 PM	I have been having trouble sleeping for about a year(no idea why). I have tried every otc sleeping pill i can find, and discovered that 98% of them are a benadryl(diphenhydramine) base....Also have tried the &quot;natural&quot; ones, with absolutely NO effect at all...the benadryl ones only work if i take a large dose, but I then get horrible &quot;restless leg syndrome&quot; which affects my arms and hands as well....so ill stick to one or two benadryl for my seasonal allergies(takes me about 5 of them to get sleepy)....Then I discovered that Unisom comes in two kinds....diphenhydramine(benadryl), and doxylamine....I tried the doxylamine - walmart brand....worked wonderful for about a week....took one tablet before bed, and other that taking about an hour or so to kick in, it worked great.....Now im up to taking 3 to get sleepy at all, and it takes about an hour and a half even for that.....Im sure taking too many is risky, but not sure at what point i should stop upping the dose for it to be effective...Anyone know? I have not tried any prescription sleeping pills yet, but I am about ready to because I am so dissapointed in the otc ones.....

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/23/2012 7:39:10 AM	Doxylamine/Unisom has helped my inability to fall asleep for years.  I buy the generic form and really only need 1/3 of a tablet to fall asleep and stay asleep.  I've been taking it for over 8 years now.  I just stopped taking it a few days ago, and seem to be doing okay, so dependance on the drug does not seem to be a problem.  I will use this drug again if I again have insomnia.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	grandpa phil, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	9/20/2011 2:58:51 PM	I've had chronic insomnia 4 close to 20 yrs. (lots of stress in my life),&amp; taken diff't meds.4 most of that time. Unisom works but THE KEY IS THE DOSAGE, which also VARIED 4 me over time. At 1st, 1/2 a pill was too much, leaving me groggy next day. As I developed tolerance over the yrs, had 2 go up to 1 or 1-1/2. Reading other user comments, I C some ppl complaining that 1/2 pill leaves them groggy, others say they need 1 to 1-1/2. The long term users (like me) seem to say they take more. So the import't thing's to GET THE DOSAGE RITE!   Ambien also works 4 me, but it's only DESIGNED for 4 HRS. My Dr. said if U wake up, take another. Then they made Ambien CR, which works great for 8 hrs. 4 me, but requires a prescriptn, ins. co. limits it, &amp; co-pays EXPENSIVE. Unisom's cheap &amp; easy 2 get.   Benadryl works 4 me 2, but only for 3-4 hrs. Lunesta doesn't work, Restoril used to, but stopped as i developed tolerance.   It's comforting to see i'm not alone w/ chronic insomnia! Gd luck!
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	9/3/2011 3:32:12 PM	I have been taking this medication about 3 or 4 times a week for about a year. I take one half tablet. It does work, does not leave me groggy in am and I sleep about 8 hrs. The only problem I find is after taking it for a couple of days, about 10-12 hrs after taking it I am very grouchy. The grouchiness subsides after about 3 hrs, but during that 3 hrs. I am a &quot;bear&quot;. I do not take it on the weekends at all because my husband is home then and I will bite his head off over nothing. During the week, by the time he gets home, I'm fine.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Loki, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/28/2011 8:40:22 PM	I have tried other &quot;over-the-counter&quot; sleep aids but this one really works.  I only take 1/3 to 1/2 a pill and only occasionally when I am unable to get to sleep or when I wake in the night and cannot get back to sleep. I purchased it at Costco and the price is very reasonable. It also works extremely well if you need to sleep on a plane.  I have never been able to sleep on a flight until I tried this.

I do not take the drug every night; only when having extreme difficulty falling asleep.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	GrandmaShaw, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/28/2011 5:57:34 PM	I have had problems sleeping for as long as I can remember.  I could sometimes fall asleep (not always) but could never stay asleep more than a couple hours before waking up for the rest of the night. Diphenhydramine did not work at all. Even with this drug I wake up several times throughout the night but most times can get back to sleep. I usually feel groggy the next day but have learned to live with the hangover effect since it's the only way I can get any sleep. Occasionally, I'll be up all night and then realize the next day that I didn't take a pill before bed. On rare occasions, I will still be up all night even though I've taken a pill. I have taken one 25 mg. pill every night for about the last ten years now and have tried to wean myself off without success.  I usually throw in the towel after about three fitful nights of not sleeping and go back in desperation for some sleep.

I tried Diphenhydramine and what made me feel terrible. Also after couple days of taking Diphenhydramine it started to not work so much. I have been on multiple medications for sleep if louds of side effects. Wasn't so good so I am now sticking with Doxylamine.

I been using this (Costco brand) for over 3 years. It has remained effective with no side affects other than my allergies don't bother me anymore.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	zzZZzz, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	4/6/2011 10:10:10 AM	After being unable to &quot;reset&quot; my sleep rhythm after bronchitis, I sought OTC medication. Melatonin didn't work anymore and benadryl didn't work anymore. So I picked this up.The little blue pills taste AWFUL. I took one when I got home from work (server), and waited an hour. Nothing. So I took another. And in about 15 minutes I was so tired I could barely THINK. (Just an hour prior, I was ready to go for a run!)The only bad aspect is, I can't wake up. I set my alarm for 8-8:30 to get ready for work. I remembered hearing my alarms, but I woke up at 9:30 extremely groggy. Either way, it could be the new medicine, too much medicine, or my body's upset I forced it into sleep.... I just CAN'T WAIT to go bed tonight!!!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Suzannesh, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	4/6/2011 12:36:19 AM	I have tried a lot of different things for sleeping and find that this one works the best by far for me.  I don't feel any after effect and wake up in the morning feeling refreshed.  Do foggy morning feelings. I use the Costco brand and have found that taking 2 tablets works best for me.  I still have a night or two where I wake up, but seem to be able to fall back to sleep pretty easy. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	vantil, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	3/14/2011 3:14:23 AM	This is the only otc sleep aid that has worked for me.  I have used it as needed for over 3 years and have had no major side effects.  It is much less effective if I use it every night.  I use it for 2 or 3 nights and then take a break for about a week in order for it to remain effective.  Diphenhydramine (benadryl) doesnot work for me anymore and it causes much more side side effects (ie morning fog, increased dry mouth and eyes).  I also buy the cheap Wal-Mart brand.  Hope this is helpful

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	intune, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/11/2010 2:58:32 PM	I had started a job and I needed to get up by 5:00 Mon - Fri. My trouble is I would go to sleep fine at 9 or 10 p.m then at 2:00 I would wake up and not get to sleep till almost 4:00. Go back to sleep and was so droggy at 5:00. Now at 8:30 p.m I take the sleep aid and by 9:00 I am ready to go to bed and wake up at 5:00. I get up and do 30 min. on the treadmill and ready to leave for work by 7:00 or 8:00 a.m. I feel great, and I only take the sleep-aid Sun - Thru. I take a whole pill 25 mg but I want to try a half a pill instead. If any side effects I should know about please write Lboonud2@aol.com, so far it has been great to get a full nights sleep on hours that I am just not used to working.

All 3 combined still did not help me sleep.  Why pay for potentional prescription side effects when this works?  Very inexpensive and has been a life-saver for me.  Chronic pain keeps me awake and 3 hrs per night was commong.  Now I can sleep for 6-7 hours.  Yea!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/9/2010 7:45:24 PM	Use for occasional sleepless nights. I only need 1/3 of a 25mg pill in order to get the effects. Unfortunately I wake up tired and stay groggy if I don't get enough time to sleep off the drug before needing to go to work in the AM.  Also have been experiencing morning sickness and although I will not take the drug durring the day it does help for that half hour before falling asleep. (the drug is being taken with doctor's permission)

One effect/benifit is that I don't have to urinate more than once thru the night. I prefer natural healing so would not use it more than 3 xs a week. Give it time to work. I take it 1 or 2 hours before bedtime. At 150 lbs I take 1 at 8:00pm, &amp; get to bed by 9/10:00 to get up by 7am for work. On weekends I could sleep till 11am so I will try 1/2 since others say that works well. I have not noticed next day groggyness once I excersize in the morning. I love this stuff but as I said before, wouldn't use it more than 3 times a week and not 2 nights in a row.

This is the first time taking sleeping aid. I must say it has helped me. I only take 1/2 a pill and am able to fall back asleep when I wake at wee hours. I also drink, and have had no side affects. I wake ready to roll. I do wonder if I stop taking these pills will it make it even harder to sleep.

It's a lifesaver! It doesn't seem to make me very drowsy after I take it for several days, but still gives me the nausea relief. I am still queasy most of the time, but only vomit about once a day, usually when I let my stomach get empty.As a sleep aid - it doesn't work very well for me. It actually seems to keep me awake at night. But that could be the pregnancy hormones too. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	9/23/2009 2:26:20 AM	I work nights and have trouble sleeping at times during the day.  It really seems to help.  I take the Walmart brand and am quite happy with the results
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	read73, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/10/2009 1:20:57 PM	About 11 years ago I was diagnosed with hiatal hernia, acid reflux &amp; &quot;non-cardiac&quot; chest pain and have had trouble sleeping ever since.  I've recently developed chronic shoulder &amp; back pain. I used to take a generic benadryl sleep aid but found that it caused an odd heaviness in my legs.  I take the Walmart brand Doxylamine Succinate 25 mg and it knocks me out.  It seems I build up a resistance verily easily and if I take it more often than every other night it just doesn't work.  Every third night works great.  Fortunately I have a flexible schedule because lately I can sleep 12 hours at a time.  But that helps to make up for the &quot;off&quot; nights when I sleep only a few hours or not at all.  I do wake up groggy and dry-mouthed even after 12 hours sleep, but coffee takes care of that. Overall I am happy with the medication.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	sandra, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	8/7/2009 2:17:01 AM	I have been taking this for about 4 years, I am retired and single and stay up late and like to sleep late. It works great for me, only take one half pill and sleep for 8 to 9 hours. Always feel great next morning, love it.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	RainCrow,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		8/6/2009 11:25:08 PM	It seems to build up in the system so that daily use produces progressively increasing daytime sleepiness. I cannot use it everyday.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	65-74	7/22/2009 2:50:47 PM	I use this medication at bedtime for occas. sleeplessness. It is very strong at 25mg., in my case, so I cut the tablet in thirds. This results in my taking about 9mg. dose. It is very effective at helping me sleep all the way through the night.  My only complaint is that it can cause sleepiness the next day if take more than 1/3 of a 25mg. tablet or if I use it more than 2 nights in a row.  I don't recommend using this product more than 2 or 3 nights a week and to counteract any sleepiness the next day with caffiene (coffee/tea) early on as driving or using machinery could be dangerous.  Drinking coffee in the morning usually dispells any drowsiness in my case. I do not normally drink coffee everyday.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Up at night, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/17/2009 8:34:49 PM	This is a cheap drug over the counter drug you can buy at Walmart. It is simply called Sleep Aid Tablet by Equate. I found that one 25mg tablet made me drowsy the next morning, so I break one tablet into thirds and it is perfect for me. It is not addicting as I have gotten off of it many times. I also drink alcohol when I take it and it puts me to sleep and I stay asleep. I like it almost too much. But remember I break the little pill into thirds. This works for me.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	5/2/2009 11:44:27 AM	I started with just a half of a pill, now I have to take two. Othrwise it wouldn't work at all. I developed such tolerance to this drug in just a few months. DO NOT TAKE IT WITH ALCOHOL!!! It makes you feel awfull next morning!I hope its safe for long term use because out of all sleep aids on the market prescription or over-the-counter this one doesn't make me feel too miserable in the morning and is effective. But if I have to take more than two pills I'll have to quit. It's safe but not that safe.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	OTC_Meds_R_Bad_2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/22/2009 5:26:41 PM	I've been taking medication for sleep on &amp; off for 20 years. THEY ALL CAN BE DANGEROUS &amp; ALL ARE ADDICTING! With that said, I would never suggest anyone taking anything for sleep for more than 3 days UNLESS under the CONSTANT (weekly) care of a seasoned sleep professional that KNOWS that all of these medications have the potential to become addictive and can be dangerous. I've literally been to over 100 doctors and have even worked in the medical field as a Medical Assistant and know 1st and 2nd hand that these medications all are not good for you. Period. Especially if you have an addictive personality, drink alcohol or use street drugs, use herbs or other medications (including other antihistamines), have depression or ANY type of anxiety disorder. I HIGHLY recommened to NEVER get hooked on this! It's a nightmare trying to discontinue! I've gone through withdrawal from numerous medications (including Diphenhydramine, Ambien &amp; Ambien CR, Lunesta, Xanax, Klonopin, ALL the SSRI Antidepressants, Effexor, Cymbalta, etc.) and must say this is no different than any of the meds I received from supposed professionals and colleagues. You WILL have withdrawal if you take this for possibly even as little as 3 days. Everyone's different so it's hard to say where each person's tolerance level stands. But please think about this: THESE MEDICATIONS CAN RUIN &amp; RULE YOUR LIFE. They have mine for years and now I say no more! It's not only destroying me physically, but spiritually, emotionally, mentally, sexually, socially and carerr-wise as I can't hold a job because of the panic and anxiety this garbage causes when trying to get off of it. It's also caused serious distress to a once &quot;picture perfect&quot; marriage. This not only has made me miserable and sick all the time but it has affected everyone around me in some way because I'm a whole different person and can't remember anything. Also the panic attacks are wreaking havoc on out entire family. SO YES THIS IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE &amp; BAD
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	mg, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	4/14/2009 11:32:46 PM	It helps me sleep through the night. I could fall asleep but not stay asleep. One tablets help me sleep 8 hours, which I need.  Doesn't work for me if I drink alcohol, esp a couple glasses of wine on a saturday night! I would recommend you try it.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	tinwallet, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		4/7/2009 1:32:09 PM	Been using a half of a 25mg tablet each night for six  months now and find it very satisfactory.  No drowsiness the next day that way, and so far no side effects.  Best part is that it's so cheap a Walmart!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/30/2009 12:44:57 AM	Finally something that works for me. I have tried everything from Lunesta and Ambien to herbal remedies. this OTC works better than anyting out there. I actually slept for 7 full hours. First time in years. And it's available for next to nothing at WalMart. Thank God!

I had a very difficult time waking up eventhough I had slept 8 hours.  I was groggy most of the day and never felt mentaly sharp the entire day.  I MAY try it again but will only take half a pill if i do.  I didn't like the way I felt during the day.

It's mid-afternoon and I'm still very groggy.  I'll try a lower dose, but I sure don't like the way I'm feeling now!

I have tried Ambien (only worked for about 4 hrs.), Lunesta, Dalmane &amp; Benadryl and this works the best (can't believe it's OTC).  The only problem is the groggy feeling the next day - may try taking half tablet.  I have taken nearly every night for several years and am concerned with it being addicting but feel so much better knowing I will sleep, that I ignore that fact.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Stylite, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/16/2009 3:46:59 PM	I took half a 25mg tablet and slept for 13 hours!  Too long!  It does make me groggy the next day, but overall I am so happy to have found something that works for me.  I was up at 4:30 every morning for the past six years.  It also helps my mood - almost instantaneously took away my crankiness and even though I was groggy the next day, I was also happy and mellow.  My dreams were really nice on it too.  I will try a a smaller dose next time.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Sophia, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/25/2008 8:05:39 PM	Like many others here, I have tried all the prescription medicines like Ambien and Lunesta, and overall this simple OTC works just as well. It didn't knock me out like Ambien but helped me fall asleep naturally. I even take it sometimes for anxiety, since it totally relaxes me. I highly recommend it. For a while I also took some valerian herb with 1 tablet at bedtime. Best sleep I ever had !
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Peter, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/7/2008 4:27:52 PM	This medicine really works! As one with chronic insomnia, I've used every sleep aid over the course of the last 5 years (script or otherwise.) IMO, doxylamine works about as well as Lunesta, not as well as Ambien (but with far fewer side-effects) and better than Rozerem.  Another nice thing about doxylamine is that I ALWAYS sleep for a full 8 hours, with no early awakenings. As compared to the prescription sleep meds, doxylamine causes me little or no next-day tiredness. This was my primary complaint with Ambien and Lunesta. Doxylamine is also cheap and ubiquitous.If you or someone you know is suffering from long-term sleep problems, I strongly recommend having a sleep study.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	RAB, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/7/2008 1:23:42 AM	Chronic sleep problems for years and I work shifts.  Doctor prescriped Lunesta.  That worked well for putting me to sleep, but would often awake after 2-3 hours of sleep and lay awake for 2-3 hours.  Felt awful the next day.  Doctor recommended trying Benedryl.  That and similar medications like Nytol leave me with a terrible hangover.  Tried doxylmaine succinate and so far it has solved the problem.  I use only a 1/2 pill or less.  What are the long term implications of its use?

The sedative side effect is easier to deal with than the hours of sneezing and misery. I only wonder why it isn't marketed as an antihistamine.

I have to take one and a half tablets to feel a bit sleepy, although sometimes even that doesn't do it, but I haven't ever taken more.  If you have serious insomnia and are unresponsive to other medicines then one and a half tabs may work for you.  I do have a very hard time getting up in the a.m. after taking this and since I take it nightly I have done some research on the long term effects which of course, aren't good. It works well, but I need to break myself of this habit soon.

I absolutely love it. I have restless leg syndrome and ADHD so sleeping at night without meds is impossible.  I just hope there are no long term effects from using it every night.  Does anybody know if there are?
