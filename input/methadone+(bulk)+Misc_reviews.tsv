I was started on 90 mg. a day and I am still on the same amount. If you have the opportunity to try this medication for pain control, please try it. I finally feel like I have some sort of normalcy in my life. Living with pain is hard to deal with, and doesn't have to be tolerated.

Initially I was scared and depressed by the very name. Thankfully it has worked much better then I could have imagened.now after 14 months I think it is time to increase my dosage (which i have been told is a very low dose.)during the first year I would have rated my experiece higher.

I have now been on methadone for 3 years and find it works incredibly well for pain. I would like to warn everyone that methadone is highly addictive and most Dr.s are hesitant to prescribe it. My pain physician decided to just stop prescribing it to me and due to the horrible withdrawls I am now going to a methadone clinic (commonly used for heroine addiction) to try to withdrawl off of it. So before you agree to start taking this medication make sure your Dr. will follow through with phasing you off of it when he feels it is time. 
Pain	bpsanger, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/10/2007 6:42:58 PM	I am in pain all of the time fromPAD,DVT and restless leg syndrome.  I had been perscribed Oxycontin for over 5 years.  Seems like it would work for 6 months or so then the pain would be back.  Well after being on 80mg of the oxycontin for that length of time, nothing much would work, I was physicially addicted to the cure so to speak. The Doctors then decided to try the Methadone and I have to say that I really didn't have much faith in the drug. However after using it now for 18 months, I feel like I can take control of my life again and live like everyone else is.
