However, recently my cholesterol starting rising -it eased slight at 150mg. However, I am tired all the time, have dry, itchy skin and headaches and muscleaches all the time. All my underactive systems have returned.Additionally, I read that I should break the tablet in half, but I need the increased dosage.

Serious Decrease in Thyroid Function	Mario Zammit, 55-64 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	2	2		55-64	12/28/2009 7:57:32 AM	I take Eltroxin to compensate the side effects of Amiodarone (i.e. hypothyrodism). On two separate occosaions I have suffered hyperthyroidis nothwithstanding monitoring of dosage by my cardiologist.  The first time this happened in June 04 I went into fast AF for four months and no DC cardioversion was successful till i went into hypo.This Christmas the same happened.  In June 09 my TSH was 2.48.  In Dec 09 it shot to &lt;0.05.  I'm very worried I might go through the same experience and have decided to stop Eltroxin temporarily to obtain acceptable Free T4 and TSH levels.

Underactive Thyroid	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	4	4	Male	55-64	3/10/2009 1:32:37 AM	After one month of taking this medication, I feel fine with no side effect so far. But I feel low sex drive, something the physician encouraged me that this condition would disappear by time. I take 50 mcg now and after 3 months my case will be reviewed by the phsician to determine either to increase the dose or continue as it is now.
Underactive Thyroid	cindy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/11/2008 11:54:54 AM	I'm sure may have bad side effects, but one month into this treatment of 100 mcg pr day I have had tremednouse improvement in all areas of my life, this has been a great little pill. Before I had started gaining weight, around 50 lbs within a year with no help of diet or excercise, no energy, dry skin, and depression. Within two weeks of treatment, my stomach started going wayyyyyyyy down, I had my old energy level back and I even have my past perkiness in my eyes and smile and the depression has totally disappeared, I now wake up ready to roll!! I'm up for anything now again and for two years I had no energy then the weight gain and depression, why it took so long to diagnos me with hypothyroid is beyond me but all is well now!
