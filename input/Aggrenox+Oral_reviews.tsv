With in a month had a strange left side of head sensation.  Felt like a warm hand on my head.  In time a stronger feeling but sensation would come and go. 6 Months later I thought maybe I could stretch them out so skipped a bit. Woke up with another Tia. Doctors blamed it on &quot;I didn't take pill faithfully.   I was to take them everyday they said.  MY only complain other than the headache which my doctor and neurolgist said &quot;Don't worry&quot; about is they cost so darn much. Anywhere from $200. for a 30 day supply to $600. for a 90 day. Also another problem I have, is drug stores around my area don't carry the item. The  store has to order it which makes me wonder what  other people in my area who might have Tias   take?

The side effects have been horrible. At first I thought the stroke was causing my terrible feelings, but now I am off Aggrenox and not taking any drugs - no more side effects except the horrible residual heartburn - it's sometimes hardly bearable even with different prescription or non-prescription antacids. The bad headaches and severe nausea were initial problems even with taking only 1 per day for the first week. Now I hope that the severe heartburn will heal. I need 2-3 more weeks on antacids - I hope the heartburn is not permanent! I was also on Crestor, only 5 mg/day and it was causing me myalgia/asthenia - also a horrible feeling, and it was getting worse. I initially thought it was due to the stroke - as a patient one depends so much on the medical &quot;professionals&quot; but they only know so much - going by published information and generalized percentages for efficacy. They don't go through the side effects! Generally, I have a very negative outcome from, and view of, prescribed medications. It's like the medical profession uses medications when there are no easy answers - it's easy to write a prescription, but they should be more sensitive to patients with severe side effects. The patient is at the mercy of the doctor who prescribes the medication.

Prevention of Blood Clots in the Brain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	9/22/2010 2:20:42 PM	I had stroke (bi-lat), very rare. Dr started me on aggrenox (2xdy) until they could determine cause of stroke (clot or other, hemorrage ruled out).  Four hours after taking first pill, developed severe headache which lasted 7 hours (felt like someone inside my head hitting it with sledge hammer over&amp;over). Groggy &amp; achy next day. Tried pill in am and achy/groggy with moderate headache throughout day.  Took 2nd dose in evening.  Headache started 3 hours later and lasted 6 hours. Excructiating pain in head.  Any movenment of head or neck set off a 5 minute period of pain like I have never felt before.  I had to lie flat, no pillow and not move at all.  On a scale of 1-10, I would rate the pain 9.5-10.  I felt like I was being tortured. After 6 hours, pain was at a 6.  I spent 2 hours applying ice cubes directly to my head, neck, face over &amp; over. Ice alleviated pain to just a moderate headache.Headache is listed as a side effect but this was no ordinary headache, I could not get up, could not reach for a glass of water next to bed, could not move.  Very similar but much more intense than headaches I had after spinal block for child birth.  Doctor switched me to Plavix for time being until they can determine if clot caused problem.  Reading other views made me realized I should have been given more info on side effects; glad I'm off of it.

Experienced a strong burning sensation on the entire left side of my bady. Much like rubbing alcohol, only magnify the sensation by 5 times or more, that was what I felt Dr. kept twisting my arm to take something. Have had diarrhea with Aggrenox, and this was while only taking 1 dose per day. Also concentration problems, light headedness, feel like I will pass out at times. Blood pressure at Dr. office was 130/90. Experienced rapid heartbeat. Dr. was so concerned he sent me to a cardiologist. Had a echo cardiogram, was normal. Wore a heart monitor for 48 hours. Still waiting for the results. I think this med. is the culprit. Was on Plavix before for only 2 weeks. Had a severe reaction, i.e. itching, difficulty swallowing, broke out with welts all over my body. Was given a steroid shot, and told to take a double dose of Benedryl to alleviate symptoms. Then severe shoulder and joint pain in upper body for several days. About ready to fire my neurologist.

I started only 1 capsule per day to get used to the drug. Use in the morning gave me a migraine headache at work and I had to go home the first 2 days. I then switched to evening use of 1 capsule. Migraines started 2 hrs. after use each evening and continued for exactly 5 hours each night so that I could not sleep during that time. Then, after 6 nights, the migraine only lasted 4 hours. The next 2 nights I had no headaches and was able to sleep, so I began to add a capsule in the morning as well (so that I was taking a full dose each 24-hr. period). I had a mild headache in the daytime for about 2 days when I switched to the full dose, and then they went away. I have not had anything other than a very mild headache at times since then. I've even inadvertently skipped a capsule with no side affects. (I do recommend eating right before taking the drug to avoid side effects.)  Also, no other TIAs or problems. I've had no problems with excessive bleeding when I get a nick or a small cut and no excessive bruising. I also take Lipitor and some asthma medications. Blessings to all.

I was hospitalized for a week. Aggrenox was prescribed for me. It took almost a week to start working. There were no side effects. I was discharged after the aggrenox started to work and three years later have had no tia's or side effects. Need to take two capsules a day. The only problem is the price, now at $195 for a months supply. But if it keeps you alive it is well worth it!!

Never will I take another one. Will notify my neurologist tomorrow

Switched to aggrenox eight months ago. Slight headaches at start, but no issues now. No recurrence of occlusions so far. Best of all, not experiencing the severe brusing issues that I was while using Plavix. Only issue is taking care to remember the evening dose.

At first however, it has some pronounced side effects mostly headache.   This makes sense because the idea is to dilate arteries which induces a two week long migraine headache.   The side effects are transitory and in some respects prove out the medication's effectiveness.   When having some dental work the dentist noticed pronounced bleeding.    This is also a sign the drug is effective.     Presently I have no side effects from this medication and feel that it has positive benefits.

I had been taking this since a T.I.A. a year ago.  I have sufferred the whole year with uncontrolled blood pressure including orthostatic hypotension.(low blood pressure upon standing or exercise-90/35)Also sufferred from Syncope-passing out.  My blood pressure was so low after taking this medictation that I no longer took cozaar and norvasc that I had been taking prior to the T.I.A. This medication has aspirin and dipyridamole.  I was told by pharmacist that dipyridamole is anti platelet sticking medication.  Actually it is a vasodilator which can cause light-headedness or very low blood pressure upon standing in the elderly.  I have lost a whole year of recovery due to not being able to exercise due to such low blood pressure.  Physical therapists were afraid to work with me.  Shame on all the doctors (8) that missed this and pharmacist as well.  Since I have been off this medication (two weeks)I have started back on blood pressure medication and my blood pressure is gradually becoming more stable.  I am now on plavix as well.  I hope this helps someone else.

He had migrain headaches and severe nausea for the first 3 weeks. He then developed bloody stools and severe stomache pain. Once taken off the drug the by the ER Resident the symptoms diminished. He's left with mild nausea and diverticulitis as a result of this. This drug was too strong and his doctor ignored his symptoms.

I had a lot of headaches and overall didnt feel well but after about 2-3 weeks i was back to normal. I had to stop taking it for surgery for 1 week but was fine once i resumed it. i would strongly recommend sticking it out because the risk is higher than anything else.
