I still think that it has helped keep ny blood pressure up a little bit, plus I do not get dizzy &quot;everytime&quot; I stand. I have more energy now than before, but I still have to remember to eat small amounts at a time or i will pass out within 10 min.

She is having an extremely rough time with this drug as it is causing an unusual amount of saliva which is causing an irritating cough. The doctors are saying to just give it some time and tis will subside. I am extremely curious to find out if anyone else has had this side effect?

Was diagnosed at 3 days and have been on fludro most of my life. I can't tell that it makes a difference one way or another, although after reading the side effects I wonder if it has something to do with my holding water weight.

Addison's Disease	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	65-74	1/11/2009 2:16:19 PM	Hopefully someone reading this will benefit. All of my adult life my blood pressure has been 110/68-70 without any ill effects until the late '90's when I began becoming very dizzy and lightheaded whenever I stood up especially if I raised up suddently. Eventuially I began to have attacks of syncope (fainting)or near syncope until I began receiving injuries from the falls and numerous hospital stays and miss diagnosis even though I had failed the tilt table test until a heady nurse witnessed my having an attack which lead to their checking my Cortisol levels. Adrenal gland production which affects our hormones. I was prescribed fludrocortisne.1mg three times daily along with hydrocortisone 10mg's 3 x daily. It has saved my life. Insofar as syncope attacks it is my understanding that once the falling blood pressure has been controlled and continuing syncope attacks presists then it most likely is another problem that needs addressing. I too remain suffering from syncope. Luckily a relative learned from a friend about narcolepsy (a sleep disorder) which my Dr believes may be the underlying cause of my syncopy attacks. If you are a snorer always exhausted with syncopy check it out. My Dr prescribed a new medication on a 30 day trial called provigil 100mg once daily in A. M. so far so good. Anyone that's suffering from the symtoms on this blob need to be presistant in having their Dr check as many avenues as possible and see a good neurologist. I always ask the Dr.who would you send your child to if they had the same problem? Good luck.

I would pass out from standing too quickly or if I excersise too much. I didn't pass out as much as I would get dizzy spells. I usually get them all the time but since my cardiologist perscribed this medicine to me, they have gotten a little better. I don't get dizzy spells as often although they do still occur, and I can actually keep up with the excersises in my gym class. I can say that it has helped me along for strengthing my heart and keeping my blood pressure up. The only time I have passed out on this medication was when I was at my homecoming dance and I passed out 3 times on the way to the hospital in the ambulance, but other than that, I haven't had any major episodes. I am only 15 so the results might have vary for people older than me but I would suggest this medicine.

I typically would &quot;black out&quot; when standing up approximately 10-12 times a day. Now it happens only once a day.
