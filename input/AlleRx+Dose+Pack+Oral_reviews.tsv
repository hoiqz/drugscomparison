Other	Dena, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/2/2012 10:24:52 AM	I've had sinus &amp; allergy problems for over 30 years.  Started on Allerx more than 5 years ago after the previous drug I was taking was taken off of the market.  Both Allerx, and the generic, kept me healthy and allergy free.  After the generic became unavailable, and because of the high cost of Allerx (more than $150/mos.), working with my doctor I tried several other substitutes, none of which prevented the return of sinus infections and allergy symptoms.  After returning to Allerx, I am symptom free again.  I've never had an negative side effects.  This drug has worked like magic for me and I am distressed that it is no longer available.  The new products don't work.  Has anyone tried compounding the ingredients to see if that will work?

I got samples from my ent. Finally I got a prescription for it and it was so expensive and not covered in my insurance. Now I'm sad it is on the list of medications being pulled by the FDA...I'm gonna grab as many samples as I can!

It has been the only thing I have found to fight my allergy problems.  One of the main ingredients was grandfathered by the FDA back in the 60's and in February said that if you want to continue making it, it has to go through the FDA approval process.  Cornerstone was not willing to do that.  So now we are stuck.

Howeve, since i have been prescribed Allerx Dose Pack i have not been sick with a sinus infection. I have come to realize that if something works to make one healthy....fda will pull it or not approve it.  Thanks to our government.

After the third day of taking this medication that completely stopped.  Unfortunely I ran out of the samples of the medication and my insurance will not cover this medication.

The other medications that have worked in the past have been removed from the market due to side effects.  This one is still on the market but is getting nearly impossible to get and now when one of my local pharmacies can keep it in stock for me it costs (w/insurance) $165 a month because it is a formulary. Why does the govt and insurance have to screw with something that works.  I have never suffered side effects from this or the others that I took that were removed from the market and the newer generation drugs don't do anything for me at all.

I have had the bad dry mouth, try taking half a pill worked for me and while taking the whole pill suffered bad with contipation. It was terrible. Other than that drink more liquids and take half a dose still works and not near as bad dry mouth or the other problem.

It did cost me $50 for a 30 day supply, I now have a high deductable and one 30 day supply would cost me $458.00  if I go through Medco 90 day supply it would cost me $1200.00  Just does not seem right.  I am trying Tylenol Sinus congestion and pain instead.  
Other	gapeach74, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/1/2010 2:13:25 PM	I have suffered from severe allergies all of my life and was diagnosed with Minere's Disease in Jan. 2008. One ENT doctor wanted to do surgery (endolymphatic sac decompression) where they go drill into the head and remove a piece of the sphenoid bone so the sac can enlarge when I have so much fluid collecting in my sinuses (which was also causing a lot of vertigo). However, I went to another allergist/immunologist and he prescribed this medication for me and I am doing fantastic!!! The fluid in the inner ear &amp; sinus cavities have dried up and the pain in the right mastoid region has been eleviated. If I get to dry, I leave off the night pill and then start it back when I feel the congestion returning. This is a great medication if given for the right symptoms. I hope it will always be available, because it is the only thing that has helped me after searching for two years for help! The only down side is the cost but it cost society alot more if you can't function and be a productive part of society.

It was prescribed for me for a sinus infection.  I will not continue to take it once the sinusitis is gone.  I suppose it is working but the cost is very high if it's not on your health plan formulary.

Non-Seasonal Allergic Runny Nose	am,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		2/7/2009 10:46:08 PM	This is the only thing that controls my chronic allergies/vasomotor rhinitis. Also helps prevent sinus headaches/sinus pressure. Price is prohibitive. Manufacturer sued 2 companies for patent infringement (latest in Oct. 2008) that made generic versions so generic probably won't be seen soon.

Vasomotor Rhinitis	otterhere, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/7/2009 11:01:02 AM	I was given samples of this, and it totally alleviated my almost constant post-nasal drip from VR; however, the cost is prohibitive; my co-pay alone was $40; outrageous!  There is a generic alternative, VisRx, but my pharmacy can't get it?  what a racket Big Pharma has going!  I don't see why there isn't a cheap, generic &quot;drying agent&quot; (anticholinergic) available; 10 mg of a tricyclic antidepressent would have the same effect and be cheaper, but that causes weight gain.  Still, AllerRx WORKS...
Seasonal Runny Nose	Trudy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	12/9/2008 3:14:26 PM	This medication certainly has a drying agent. It has dried my skin, eyes, mouth, as well as improved my constant runny nose and post nasal drip. The nighttime blue pill wires my up, so I take it during the day and the white at night to enable me to sleep.  The overall dryness of skin, eyes, etc. as well as the cost of the medication make this treatment very unattractive.  I'm hoping my Drs have another treatement available.

I felt dizzy, lightheaded, and a sick feeling.  The next morning, I could barely walk from room to room without feeling very sedated and had to miss work.  It took almost 12 hours for this to wear off. The next night I only took 1/4 of the blue pill and although it was not as bad, a new symptom appeared, a depressed mood (I have been on an anti depressant for several years)and this just made the other feelings worse. As for did it work, it did dry up all the postnasal drip.  I had no problem with the  morning yellow pill. I had to stop the blue one.

Problem is I cannot get the Ins. Co. to approve it.  So now I am trying another brand and it leaves me with my nose running constantly.  For me to take Allerx on my own it would cost me$189.00 per month.  Rediculous!  My eyes are swollen, even my nose is swollen without Allerx.  Am I addicted to it??Louise Evans

It works very well as a decongestant. It seems to be the only medicine that helps when cold or allergy symtoms start. I am a supporter of this allergy medicine.
