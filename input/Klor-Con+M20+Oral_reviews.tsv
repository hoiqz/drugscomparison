I have had them all of my life, and found out about a heart murmur 3 years ago after an extensive ultrasound , and many other tests by a cardiologist at a hospital. I am 62 years old and I know this works for me. If for some reason I forget this med. I know right away to eat and then take it ! If you take this for the same reason I do , DON'T LAY DOWN FOR 30 MINUTS after ingesting this medication ! Very important ! It's odd , because I eat a high potassium diet ! Blessings to all !

But my Potassium went down despite of it. Yesterday I found a whole pill in my stool and today again. I had noticed it before but didn't think anything of it. I take 4 in the morning and 4 in the evening. What am I supposed to do ? These are the smooth yellow ones, should I take the big white ones, will they dissolve any better ? I need help ! I used to take the liquid, 2T, but had to drink a lot of drink with it because it was so strong, just couldn't do it anymore, so they gave me the yellow pills. Tried the big white ones too for a few days, were to hard to swallow.

I felt horrible on this drug and broke out in a rash around my neck, breasts and stomach area. I also had gout-like symtpoms in my feet and knees when I took the whole 20mg each day. As I took 10, the rashes cleared but would come back as I resumed the drug. When I went off it altogether, the rash disappeared and so did the gout-like symptoms.

It took approximately one week to get things back to normal.  Now I continue to take Klor-Con to maintain my potassium levels.

Basically it's a potassium wasting syndrome that is congenital.  I take anywhere from 8 to 10 20MeQ pills A DAY.  Yep that's right a day, and I've done so for several years.  Soft stool now and then, and yes they're not easy to swallow.  I usually take 3 or 4 in a handful at a time with a bunch of water.  I don't always take them with food and have not experienced any real problems.  I wish I could get a larger dose pill and take less pills a day.  Awaiting a whole in my stomach someday!  :)

I discovered what I was allergic to and causing my intense itching or pruritusit was Klor Con M20, a potassium supplement my Cardiologist put me on along with Lasix 40 mg twice daily, a diuretic late last October.     The doctor, nurses, pharmacist, etc didnt help me identify the allergic reaction I had and I was forced to suffer four (4) months of intense itching all over my body.  I even made two (2) trips to the emergency room at the heart hospital and they couldnt figure it out.

They have to be taken at different times of day. I now take the 1080mg of potassium citrate in the morning and at supper and take the Klor-con m20 at lunch.

That way, I for sure had plenty water in case one turned sideways, but also the ability to turn the jug up and straighten the gullet made the pills go down much easier.  I also take 3-4 Calcium Citrate caplets to keep my blood balanced and prevent the cramps that are so bad I break out in a sweat when they hit.  not just in the legs but all over my body.

The greatest problem I have experienced is the size of the pill-it is very difficult to swallow and is very rough and dry!

The problem also might be that other med that I take cause the throat to constrict.Usually I could take a hand full of pills and swallow them with out any problem. Pooblem is the shape ,size, surface and dryness of the pill. Make it smother so it can slide better.
