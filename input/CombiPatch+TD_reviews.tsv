&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	RIMA1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	9/25/2012 4:06:55 PM	I started on the lower dose patch in May.  Hot flashes disappeared within a week, my mood, energy, and libido improved and everyone told me how great I looked.  After 3 months, I started bleeding, at times heavily, so the doctor (after a uterine biopsy was normal) switched me to the higher dose patch.  I've now been on that patch for a little over 6 weeks, and the bleeding has begun again with some mild PMS symptoms.  For those of you who have mentioned bleeding/periods below, I would like to hear if that ever resolved or you stopped using the patch.  I otherwise love what the patch has done for me and don't want to go back to hot flashes, low energy and low libido.  Thanks.

My doctor increased the dosage when my hot flashes started to return.  That did the trick.  I have gained 30 lbs. over the last couple years, however, and I dont know if it's the patch or it's just age, menopause, slowing metabolism, etc.

Only been using the low dose patch for a few days and was very reluctant to engage HRT.  I tried to tough it out, but it became a quality of life issue.  Time will tell if any side effects occur.  But the sleep was worth its weight in gold!

I had night sweats which seem to have been reduced. I notice my vision seems strained, has anyone had this as a side effect? I also seem to have more trouble focusing than before the patch.  Calling my MD today to discuss.

Tried 2 other oral HRT that played havoc with reflux and now LOW acid in my stomach...so trying the CombiPatch. Only been on it less than a week and was wondering how long it will take to work on the miserable every 30 min Hot Flashes &amp; HOW to keep it on while excersizing....all these posts have really helped! Really not liking the idea of being on HRT for any length of time, but needed relief from the severe emotional stress &amp; hot flashes. 
Other	pinkpanda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	6/21/2012 6:53:16 AM	My doctor switched me from vivelle-dot (which I had been using for about a year) to this RX -- I believe because she thought the combination of estrogen and progestin would be a benefit.  I was mostly happy with vivelle-dot; I had asked about going off it entirely because my symptoms had decreased.  After switching to the combi-patch I got a period for the first time in over a year and a half -- and a heavy one at that  I asked the doctor about switching back to vivelle-dot, which she said was fine.  For some reason, the nurse talked about increasing the dose, though I don't see any reason for it.  I felt like a guinea pig being given different drugs.

Well i went on the bio idental cream and used it for a couple of years and my estrogen got down to 20 is suppose to be between 60-100. Started this patch again and my doctor told me to put it on my butt..lol. Skin is tougher. Works like a charm. I clean the skin with alcohol first. After 6 months i spotted and now 4 months later i had bleeding and i'm going to have an ultrasound.  I love the patch and the doctor says if i don't have a thickening of the uterine wall i can start on the other patch that is higher progertone and some times it stops the bleeding.  I was post menapausal at 45.  I am almost 52 now.

At first felt better but hot flashes seems to be back anxiety and sleep problems again.  Also periods now each 30 days with some pretty good PMS symptoms. I don't know what to think I have follow up next week maybe switch?

&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	anonymous, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	1/5/2012 10:16:51 AM	I started the combipatch 50/140 three months ago for mild hot flashes, vag dryness, sleep issues and oily skin that had recurred after stopping biodentical est/progest cream one year ago. My current GYN thought that patch is more reliable delivery system. In first few weeks on combipatch, had very severe leg cramps, fluid retention, mood problems. Then rosascea and oil skin/acne got worse, developed hair on my face (!) and vag yeast infections. Although I was overall sleeping somewhat better, I developed night sweats for the first time in many years (I have been post menopausal for 3 1/2 years - early menopause at 45). After referral to endocrinologist, learned that I have genetic issue which makes me sensitive to the type of progesterone in the combipatch since it has androgenic affects. If you have history of acne or odd hair growth, ask your dr about using another product - wish I had known this before starting the combipatch. I really like the patch for ease of use, but sad to learn that there are no patches with other types of progesterone (this is a gap in the market - why doesn't some company develop this?) Have now switched to Vivelle Dot which is an estrogen-only patch, and take a compounded pill form of natural progesterone - so far, so good (only on these a few days, so we'll see).

Lost 6 lbs from not being able to eat, had 3 &quot;put you in the bed for 2 days&quot; migraines, and bled (not spotted) for 17 days! Needless to say, I am no longer on the patch. Good luck to those of you who try it. As I understand it, this is rare, but it happened to me.

By the third week, I started to spot, which lasted almost 2 weeks. I've been using the patch for not quite 3 months. Until a week ago, I thought this was going to be a miracle drug, but now the hot flashes and sleepless nights have returned and continue to get worse each day. I decided to switch to Bio-identicals and hope it will be the answer to being hot-flash free. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has had experience with bio-identicals.

I really liked the patch bc I did not have to remember to take a pill everyday. But, I have been on it for 4 months now and out of those 4 months I have bleed everyday except for 2 weeks. My doc even went down on my dosage and still bleeding. Now, I'm switching to Activella. Combipatch got rid of all my night sweats and anxiety. It was great except for the bleeding. If you can take this without bleeding to death then its great. Good Luck to everyone!!! :)

I bled for about 9 more weeks once I started the patch.  It slowed down and some days stopped bleeding completely.  After about 6 months on the patch I am bleeding very heavy again the day after I apply the patch and then for two days.  It's about time to put the patch back on and the bleeding cycle continues.  Still have night sweats.  I've gained a lot of weight in my midsection too.

My hot flashes and sleeping problems seem greatly improved, but my sex drive is still non-existent and I'm having some irritating bleeding, depression, and fatigue. I really hope these things will resolve. I'm about 50/50 at this point on whether it's worth it to continue with it or not.

Before the patch, I was dragging to get through the day.  Now, the hot flashes are gone.  I'm sleeping a lot better.  I no longer have the &quot;dead head&quot; feeling.  The only problem is I'm feeling fat.  The scales haven't moved more than a couple of pounds but I feel and see a difference in my belly.   It's like my weight is shifting to my middle.  Am thinking about stopping the patch just to see if it makes a difference in the belly weight.

Menopause had come on with a bang! I was very reluctant to do any kind of HRT. However, I started the smallest dose Combipatch about 2 &amp;1/2 months ago. After 2 weeks the hot flashes disappeared completely &amp; after 6 weeks, the migraines were gone.  I still have some insomnia but it is better than it was. My quality of life has improved so much! I started my periods back but my Gyn dr said if I was still having periods in September 2011, that he would increase the dose of the Combipatch. The goal is not to have any periods while controlling the menopausal symptoms. I am also using the Estrace cream which has also helped with vaginal dryness. Yah for Combipatch! I have had NO side effects at all!

On my 50th birthday I was diagnosed with high blood pressure needing medication (low dose Diovan). Talk about &quot;change&quot;! By May of 2010 when my periods stopped I had gained a total of 20 pounds, suffered significant hair loss (and bought several wigs), and finally understood what Chronic Fatigue Syndrome must feel like.  Hot flashes escalated so that I woke up 6 times a night. On 2/4/2011 I went back to my dr. and said &quot;ENOUGH! I still have one ovary and my uterus and I need help.&quot; I have been on lowest dose Combipatch since 2/4/11. By the time I went to bed that night I already felt better. The hot flashes totally went away after 4 days.  I don't suffer from the fatigue anymore.  Consequently I am getting up earlier and working out again, so the weight is just starting to come off.  My appetite has normalized.  My hair is still thinning, but you can't have everything. I also got my period again last week (forget spotting, it's a period).  I still need testosterone shots to keep my libido up, but the vaginal dryness is gone. It would be great if there was one patch that addressed ALL those things, but I am grateful that Combipatch is available. I could not imagine living like I was for another 20 years, I'd rather be dead, quite frankly.  Thank you, Novartis.

I've been on it for 7 months, due to horrific, paralyzing menopausal symptoms, on top of working shift work for 25 years. The only thing it didn't fix is my libido. If patch gets loosened, from sweat or showering, I pat top dry and it re-sticks itself! Slight itching &amp; irritation after removing. Had sevral weeks of spot bleeding, still occassional. No more hot flashes, night sweats, or lack of energy. Slight weight gain. I think this is one of those things that works diffently for each individual.Someone else mentioned a dry mouth.  Not sure if it's associated with patch, but I've had this problem also.  Especially during the night and when I wake up. I would HIGHLY recommend the Combipatch.

It is amazing how all I hear and read is,&quot;well,you are getting older.Expect it.&quot; I started in July 2010 with the patch. my hot flashes &amp; interrupted sleeping &amp; night sweats are gone. I feel like I have myself back.Symptoms are like when I was 13yrs old.My breasts are very tender most of the time and they feel full. I have a period about every 2 wks. Some weight gain (sucks)I feel like I have PMS all the time. I workout, but am doing even more to try and counteract weight gain. I have other systems mild depression,emotional,some hair loss.Patch doesn't stay on for me at all,I use clear tape to keep it on. Stays on best on stomach and hip, not on backside.I have irritation at the site, but it is as much from the tape I am using. Overall, I am definately in a better place than I was. I thought I was going to lose my mind before these patches. I am hoping some of these symptoms will diminish.I noticed I was feeling more normal within the first week. It IS like going through adolescolence again.I think I might try cutting the patch in half as some of the others have done. Good luck all you girls. This getting old really SUCKS....

And they don't stay on. I had to wear mine 4 a week, but it would fall off. Other then that it's good.

The problem is keeping it on. I've done everything I've been told, ie:drying area, alcolhol, etc.  It comes off after one day.What's the use of a patch if you have to hold it on with band aids or surgical tape. I certainly don't my partner seeing that. Also, I end up using twice as many which I can't afford.While this works I would not reccommend to anyone who is active.

It took a few weeks but my symptoms (hot flashes and insomnia) have really improved after I started on Combipatch. I'm happy about that, however, I started spotting and intermittently have to take off for a week or so to stop the spotting. I'm also having some depression and irritability that I think may be due to the progestin. I'm going to look and see if there's a smaller dose or I might consider trying cutting it in half like another reviewer suggested.

I was absolutely miserable prior to using the patch. My night sweats, day time hot flashes, emotional episodes, along with the vaginal dryness improved after one month. I do have a family hx of breast cancer and heart disease which does concern me. However, my quality of life has improved.

The area where a patch is removed usually is red &amp; sensitive. This may be why it recomends that you apply to different areas of the buttocks &amp;/or lower abdomen each week.

Irritability and major sadness, ie depression. Took 3 months to really help with mood.  Lots of spotting but who cares I have Life Quality again. Hot flashes gone! Anxiety gone! Sleepless nights gone! I smoke and can still use this topical hormone. Some skin patche(dark spots) developing after sun exposure, oh well! It could be worse! Love this drug! Literally saved my life! Give it time to work like 2 1/2 months. You may have a really heavy cycle, in the beginning, if you have started to be irregular.  It gets things working again if your body needs to. Avoid psych. meds. at first so you know whats working.  Almost went on them.  Doctors give them out like candy.  One synthetic drug at a time!  Less is better.  Good luck you are not alone!  pre meneopause and menopause can change who we are... I tried so many herbal remedies and my hormones levels where just too off for, chase berry, progesterine cream  etc..

It's worked great for those symptoms however, I've had the worst periods in years!  I'm on one now into my third week.  Before the patch, I was having a very light one every three months.  I'm not sure it's worth the trouble to stay on them.

Was experiencing hot flashes, anxiety, difficulty in focusing my thoughts and getting no sleep.  It took about 1 1/2 weeks to achieve the full effect of the patch but I have seen wonderful improvement in all my symptoms above. I find the patch stays on pretty well if you use alcohol to clean the area before you put it on.  If you exercise, you will probably need to use medical tape because sweating is most likely to cause it to fall off. As for the cost of $50 per month, I was using OTC hormone creams prior to this and the cost was much greater than the patch. My only complaint is a bit of weight gain which I'm working on from a change of diet standpoint.  If you were as desperate as I was, it provides real relief. I think for minor menopausal symptoms, it is probably overkill.

I quit once and had vaginal dryness and odor and my hair was falling out quite a bit.  My skin was very dry also, so I started using it again. I will try to quit using it again because of insurance issues.

I had vaginal bleeding for 2 weeks, at times heavy. I am experiencing headaches, nausea, and serious depression. My MD thinks that this may be the best way to treat bone loss - recent density studies reveal worsening osteoporosis - but I am going to try a different &quot;bone builder&quot; if symptoms do not improve pretty soon.

When I try to discontinue or slow down on the dose, my symptoms come back - hot flashes.  The best way to keep the patch from coming off is to first swab the area with alcohol and dry completely and put the patch on.  It took me a long time to figure that one out!!

No more hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or sleepless nights. Had some break-through bleeding first few months (light period) but that was explained to me by physician before I started it.  I've been on it about 1.5 years now and only side-effect is weight gain around my waist.  I've researched other HRT and think this is the best.  I'm on the lowest dose 0.05/0.14.  Is there one that doesn't have weight gain as a side-effect?  If there is, I hope it is made into a transdermal system - just apply every 3-4 days and forget about it.  Save your liver!

I still have my uterus and ovaries so maybe this is why.  My doctor had me come in and have an ultrasound to make sure nothing else was wrong.  All o.k. on the ultrasound.  I'm disappointed because my hot flashes were very minimal.  I'd rather have &quot;hot flashes&quot; than bleed.

I'm 37 years old. I had severe hot flashes for 3 months. Then the hot flashes stopped completely. No signs of menopause whatsoever.  The patch itself is a royal pain. It continually comes off, rubs off during showers, &quot;intimacy&quot;, with certain underwear.  Also left a horrible dry red patch of skin wherever it was placed.  Am now on Prempro per my gynecologist due to the skin irritation (I am very fair skinned, light hair and eyes).

I like the fact that I can cut it in half and quarter reducing the dose.  I wait several hours after showering before putting on new patch, so that it wont' fall off.  Would highly recommend rather than taking a pill.
