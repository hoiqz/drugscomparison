Other	nicholsn, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	65-74	7/31/2012 4:47:46 PM	  Have been taking the drug for prostatitis for 11 days. I was cautioned by my doctor not to be in the sun. In doing my yard work, I forgot about the warning and stayed out much too long on a hot humid day. A day later I had a rash all over my body with severe itching.  I have no problem with the drug until overexposure to the sun and now I itch constantly and have 19 days to go on the medication.  This problem is my own fault but is a mistake that is easy to make. My advice is to stay out of the sun as much as possible - tie a string around your finger if necessay so you don't forget as I regretfully do.

I felt like I was breathing toxic waste into my body. I ended up with the worst smelling cooter which is extremely abnormal for me, my vaginia smelled like a sewer. My head hurt so bad. I became instantly sensitive to light, sound, and smell and felt like puking constantly. I read the reviews and saw someone else who had similar symptoms...thank God and stopped the medicine per doctors order. The medicine made me itch and that was the MOST pleasant side effect.

My entire lower leg was swollen and oozing. Within 3 days of taking the meds most of the swelling was gone. It was advised to stay out of the sun but I was in Hawaii and ignored the warning. Wore lots of sunscreen though. Experienced some itching on my skin that had gotten most of the sun but seemed ok. Week after taking it, I broke out into a huge heat rash all over my body only were I had gotten that tan along with headaches and fever. Fortunately this happened after my trip. My wound is still not fully healed so I'm going to continue finishing the meds. I don't regret getting the medication, b/c of that infection, but now I know what happens with antibiotics and sun.

The nausea has been incredible for me though. I take it with plenty of fluids, food. I found if i eat half a meal then take the medication and finish the food it has helped a bit with the nausea. Also seems to just make me feel &quot;out of it&quot; not 100% myself. Glad it's worked, but not likely to ever want to use this antibiotic again.

It seems that if you take this medicine you need to stay out of the sun.  My wife found out the hard way.  Everywhere the sun hit she had a rash.  Had to go to a Dermatoligist(spelling) and get a steroid shot.  My perscription that my doctor gave me isn't what the pharmicist wrote on the bottle.  I took what it said on the bottle and now I have severe stomach cramping and really bad gas. Tums seems to help the cramping.  I am taking this due to a cyst that somehow got infected.

The infected hair follicle is healing, but that seems to be more from my efforts than the meds. I've gotten more red patches on my body, and my whole body has gotten splotchy and itchy. I don't have a history of being allergic to any medication, but it could be an allergic reaction, I'm not sure. I'm seeing a lot of reviews where this stuff doesn't seem to help at all though...

The infection i am assuming is because i decided to wax the area and 2 weeks later it broke out into this rash. Dr. said it was folliculitis and should be on its way out by day 3. There really is no change yet. It hasnt gotten any better but also hasnt gotten any worse like it was. Tomorrow is day 4 of the meds so we'll see.

The first time I was put in the hospital for 3 days, but to renal failure and dehydration and 105 temperature. I figured maybe I wasn't drinking enough water with it.  Anyway this last time, I had severe headaches and nausea and vomiting constantly, after 2 pills. I quit taking it and will call my doctor for something else.  I will note at the pharmacy that I'm allergic to it evidently

I had no prior allergic reactions or medical conditions, and wasn't taking any other medicaitons. After 3 days (6 doses) my body was in excruciating, burning, pain. It hurt to move at all. I started seeing spots and had difficulty breathing. I stopped taking the medication and saw my doctor immediately. At that time I had no visible/external rash, but was prescribed benadryl as my doctor informed me one was likely to form. The pain persisted for about 4 days after stopping the medication. A week later my torso and legs were covered in a rash and was prescribed prednisone for 2 months.

No blood tests were taken before Dr. prescribed this drug. After approx 5 days on a 7 day run, my muscles began to spasm all over my body while cramping up at times. Also had severe pain in my joints and went to ER where they couldn't find anything wrong and prescribed pain pills and sent me home. After suffering 2 more days I remembered I had muscle relaxers left over from a previous Rx and after taking 2 of those my muscles began to relax. I also took pain pills which eased the pain. I may have had a reaction to the sulfa in this product, although I have no known allergies.

Other	LorraineT, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female		8/22/2009 8:10:07 PM	This was prescribed for a painful boil in the genital area.  The boil quickly began to drain and heal and the doctor said the other small, developing ones near it will go away.HOWEVER -- on the night of the second day I had abdominal pain and insomnia.  Then for 2 days I was incredibly tired.  Now on day 5, I am feeling better.  Thankfully, my doctor said I can take it for 7 days, not 10 as he originally prescribed, so I have only 2 days to go!  I hope I NEVER have to take this stuff again!

My daughter is 7 years old and her doctor perscribed it for a UTI. She was so sick she couldn't get out of bed, vomiting, high fever, disoriented. When I finally took her back in her kidneys were inflamed from the drug and we may have to admit her to the hospital. Please do not give this medication to your child.

I guess it depends on what type of infection you have.  But this time I thought I had a spider bit on the arch of my foot but after reading some elses review I was (am) having the same reaction only on the left foot.  Baking soda and water paste helped also I put some athlets cream to stop the itching.  It is not so bothersome and is going away.  Have to take all the pills though.....want this to be gone
Bacterial Urinary Tract Infection	Lucine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	7/29/2009 5:13:47 PM	I took two a day at 800-160mg for ten days. I have chronic severe infections. This med helps substantially, but I bet should have been on it longer ( i will have another one in a week) I did notice feeling sunburned even though I was not, and every night I had crazy dreams while taking this.  On the third day my abdomen swelled up and was cramping and sore. I almost went to the ER, then decided it was just my body expelling the infection. I felt much better on day 4 &amp; 5. Even my energy level started to return. I initially went to the DR starting to think I had Cancer I had no idea a kidney infection could wreak suck havoc on our bodies. I'm so glad I went. I tried ever kind of home remedy imaginable. You need antibiotics, no way around it. GO TO THE DR&gt;&gt;&gt;

Other	thor, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	6/30/2009 2:44:20 PM	I was prescribed SMZ TMP for an abscess resulting from an incompletely cleaned out laceration. After 5 days of the 10 day regime, I had severe diarrhea, a persistent headache and extreme fatigue. It was bad enough I stopped taking it. It has been two weeks since I stopped taking it and I still have diarrhea, despite taking probiotics, acidophilus (sp?), and changing my diet.  I now have to go back to another doctor to get this fixed... which if the original emergency room doctor had done his job right, none of this would have happened. I have never had any reaction in the past to taking other antibiotics- and, as I suffer from recurrent sinus infections, I've taken quite a few. Don't take it if there is any other antibiotic that will do the job.

Fever, sick to my stomach, I was extreamly tired could barely move. I called my dactor he said that it wasn't the medicine, and that even though I got the flu shot I probably had the flu as it was going around very strong in our area. I accepted that but still stoped taking the meds just in case. A few weeks later I still had a really bad sinus infection, and thought if it had really been the flu before I could start the antibiotic again to treat the sinus infection. Bad idea after taking it for just one day I was so sick to my stomach throwing up and diareha- extreme headache and dizzy and over tired. I will never ever take this medication again.

I have had really no issues with this medication, for the first 2 days I had a few light headaches, that pain relievers (approved by my doc) eased. I did have nausea that at first I thought was because of the medication, but found out today that is most likely caused by positive pregnancy test. Mine is easy to take it is chalking, but unlike others I've taken, it in now way haves a bad taste.Hope this reviews help. Don't get to discouraged by all the reviews, all medication has its side effects, and many people don't know what they are allergic to until the take it unfortunitly.

SMZ/TMP DS 800-100 TAB....2x/day for 14 days. Ugh! These meds definately work, but was accompanied by extereme sickening nausea, some vomiting, extreme loss of appetite, weight loss, headaches to the point of almost migraine level, dehydration (can't keep down water), fatigue, faintness, light headedness. Was directed to take with Mucinex D 1200mg...oh my God. This makes you feel worse than being sick with an infection! My last dose is at 7 pm tonight, thank God. I am 10,000x better, but the extreme nausea is still killing me. It might take me a few days to get used to being off the medication! But this is no reason to not take it, it works!

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	9/22/2008 9:19:32 PM	I had a staph infection and i went to my doctor and she prescribed me this because she had seen a lot of people recently with MRSA and figured thats what i had. The clinic didnt call me back to tell me if it was MRSA so i assume it was just a staph infection. Very harsh antibiotic, gave me headaches and very hard on my stomach. I went to work on this and it was three hours of hell. I stopped taking it and then the staph infection came back so I'm taking it again. Not very happy.
