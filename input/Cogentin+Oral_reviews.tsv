Other	Olivia, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	9/24/2012 5:45:03 PM	I HATE THIS DRUG!!!! I am Bipolar Type 1 and began taking Latuda. Latuda works great but I had minor agitation and restlessness on it so doc put me on Cogentin. I stopped taking it a day ago because it has caused me to have disorientation, confusion and short term memory loss. I have a memory like an elephant, normally. I'd rather be restless than be in a horrid cognitive state. I do not recommend this med. It has dumbed me down. I hope it's only temporary.

It really really helped a lot. I felt normal and had more energy than i had before. I had had a brain injury from smoking k2 and taking cogentin reversed a lot of my confusion and improved my memory.

She immediately began having violent mood swings as reported by another caregiver.  It does help with her involuntary movements, however the emotional side effects are as debilitating for her as the dystonia. She has extreme panic/anxiety, anger, despair, giddiness, all within the span of minutes to hours.  The more often she takes the medication, the more extreme the emotional reactions become. I hope this helps ohter people!  
Other	Be of good cheer!, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/22/2012 11:31:58 AM	I take Cogentin 1mg twice daily for relief from tremor(s). It has done more to improve the side effects of tremor than anything yet. I take other medications which can actually cause tremor. I prefer not to take an additivephysically and psychologically medication to combat tremor. Often times other medications are the culprit in ones regimen to treat a certain infirmity; check out the overall side effect possibility of each medication. Each medication has general side effects and the combination of all may likely produce side effects. &quot;Different strokes for different folks&quot; is generally the reality of taking medications as it also applies to other things in life! Have a great day!

I'm after ~ 10 days of Cogentin, and counting, already realizing a major difference in self confidence to actually try certain tasks of which I for some time avoided. I hope to improve even more concerning relief from  tremor. Have a great day!

Soon I was falling asleep all the time while driving, unable to speak in a complete sentence, and apparently raving about nonexistent missiles in Japan.  I can't even remember most of what happened during that period of time.  When I saw my doctor and couldn't communicate with him at all either by speaking or writing, he had to hospitalize me to get me stabilized and to change my medications.

There isn't any information how to titrate off of it but I will ask her dr. how to and hopefully she can get off of it. I don't see how it is useful. Her symptoms aren't helped by it. It's just one more drug they put her on.

Best medication for the &quot;shakes&quot; from mental medications!

She had only been on the med for 3 days.  It caused such severe memory loss, that she could not recall conversations within minutes of having them. She also experienced such severe dry mouth that it was hard for her to talk without sounding slurred. Definetly not worth the extreme side effects!

I felt completely better &amp; my symptoms disappeared within 5 minutes. It was a life saver.

Beware of abilify my husband only took it for three weeks and the side effects have impaired him from every activity.

However, I've been taking it for several weeks now and my mouth has been soooooo dry. I have to drink when I eat as I don't have any saliva to swallow drier foods. I do have blurry vision with small text but I'm not sure if that is due to the congentin or due to my age that I need reading glasses...

The side effects where extremely bad. I could not read, it made everything blury. My mouth was really dry. I think it made me more paraniod than when I was off all medications. I don't know but I think the cogentin also caused me to get something similar restless leg syndrome while I was on it because I couldn't quit moving my legs at bed time. Cogentin did unfreeze my body like it should. The medicine(for me) is good for emergencies like TD on occasion but I won't never take it regularly again.

He has memory lose and can't remember what day or week it is. He can't even concentrate on what he is doing or saying. He also repeats hiself. He didn't do this until he started taking this med.

Extrapyramidal Reaction		2	1	1			10/24/2008 11:41:28 PM	What you should know about this medication. I have been shaking uncontrollably, and my teeth chatter all day.  I have constant tremor in my limbs and lower jaw.  My mouth is so dry that I have to use all Biotene products to keep my skin from sticking to my teeth, and my tongue is tremoring in my mouth all day.  I have a hard time talking and swallowing due to the tongue tremor and my mouth being so dry.  I am taking this medicine to help with EPS from perphenazine a.k.a. Trilafon.  The Cogentin gives me excessive confusion, dizzyness, and double vision along with blury vision.  My eyes are even dry. I have to keep putting drops in my eyes all day long.  I can't study for tests, read, or drive on this medication, and after I wake up in the morning, it takes me awhile to figure out where I am.  I also find myself randomly blurting out what I'm thinking without knowing what I am saying.  I just keep blurting out words while I have been on this medication rather uncontollably.  It's like this medication causes Terets.  Please be advised.  I don't think I will be on this medication much longer.

My stepdaughter has experienced severe confusion and memory loss.  She can hardly make a sentence without saying something strange, and forgets in a heartbeat what she was just talking about.  She is shy now talking with anyone for fear she'll say something stupid. It has really made her brain fuzzy. I think she would be better off without this medication.

The muscle spams are more manageable and the stuttering also. We tried to decrease the abilify to 5 mg but even that was too strong.  Cogentin was given by injection at the ER.  I have a Rx now.
