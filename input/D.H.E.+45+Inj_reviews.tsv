Cluster Headache	MichaelB45, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	65-74	10/10/2011 4:42:13 PM	I had suffered with Cluster Headaches from 1974 to 1988 before they were diagnosed properly.  I usually went through two (2) bouts per year, spring and fall.  In April 1990 they ran non-stop until I was put in hospital by my new neurologist in 1995 for DHE 45 therapy.  After three days of injections the cluster broke.  I had no reactions of any kind. I still suffered annually from bouts until approximately 2004.  I then went without a bout for a few years.  In 2008 I began to get them again intermittently.  The DHE 45 always seemed to work if I gave myself the injection within the first few minutes of the noticeable &quot;tick&quot; that said one was on the way.  I have gone two years without clusters but have started again Oct. 2011.  I tried to get more DHE 45 and now have been told it is no longer available.  The anxiety of this may be worse than the headaches.  My experience has been great and would love to have it again.  Right now I wait.
Migraine Headache	PhillyLion, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	7/19/2011 6:09:08 PM	I've been a daily migraine sufferer for 17+ yrs.  My neurologist suggested a 3 day infusion treatment that failed, he then suggested a 24/7 infusion for 2 weeks.  DHE was the only drug my body responded to.  I've tried numerous abortive medicines and none work nearly as well as DHE or with the least side effects.  I've learned that the fear of needles is extremely less when faced with the intensity of my full blown migraines.  I highly recommend this medicine.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	45-54	4/11/2011 6:50:52 PM	I have been using this medication for eleven years (since 2000), and it has been a lifesaver.  The neurologist that introduced the medication to me, admitted me for three days where I received a steroid, benadryl, and the DHE via IV every eight hours.  The only downfall to this was a bad case of phlebitis.  I could not handle the steroid - I made me whacked out.  The benadryl and DHE were fine as far as side-effects go.  Nowdays, either my spouse or I inject the med into my hip.  It gets a bit rough injecting it into my own hip.  That is the only downfall to the medication.
Migraine Headache	Brady, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	19-24	3/7/2011 3:30:20 PM	In 2009, I was 19 and had a migraine for 30 days and I received the DHE protocol through IV. At that time it worked wonderfully, other than feeling some minor anxiety that quickly subsided. Now two years later, I have had a migraine for 3 weeks, and after trying a handful of prescriptions my neurologist recommended trying DHE again. First I was given Reglan for nausea, followed by the DHE, and lastly morphine for pain. My migraine had become very dull, which was the only positive. As another reviewer described, I too felt incredibly antsy. It definitely wasn't a normal anxious feeling, but far more uncomfortable. It was impossible to feel comfortable or relieved of it for several hours. For the next 24 hours I slept nearly 20 of them. My doctor said that would be from the morphine. I went in the next day to receive another IV of the Reglan followed by DHE, since my migraine had not fully gone. I chose not to have the morphine since I thought it caused my fatigue on the previous day, and I needed to be able to work and attend night class the next day. Almost immediately following the injections I felt that same antsy feeling, only worse than the previous day and longer lasting. I was also incredibly fatigued, even without the morphine. That day and the following day I could hardly walk and was constantly leaning on walls or lying down to regain my composure and breath. I've never felt that weak and exhausted before. Most importantly to note, my migraine returned shortly after treatment. It may have worked the first time I went in, but I will definitely not be using it again. I am also on several different prescriptions than what I was on when I was 19, which could be why I had such severe side-effects, even though my neurologist said I would be fine.Overall, I would rather have the pain from the migraine than to ever have that antsy and fatigued feeling again. For some this is clearly a successful treatment, but proceed with caution as it may affect you differently.

Migraine Headache	 (Patient) 	1	1	1			7/30/2010 1:47:06 AM	This was the most ineffective drug I have ever taken. Being a migraine sufferer for 13+ years I was horrified when the doctor in question gave me this drug that had not been used in many years due to the severe side effects. Even the pharmacy took 2 hours to get it in the hospital! I would not recommend this medication, demand something else. If you're in pain, you need something that will help. 
Migraine Headache	Shannon, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	35-44	7/3/2010 9:51:35 PM	For the past 2 years I have been giving myself injections of DHE when I feel a migraine coming on or the intensity of a status migraine increases. I usually get 6 hours of some pain relief; I rarely am pain free (2 weeks out of a year, maybe). And I recommend that, however, my first experience was not as fun! 3 years ago, I was put in the hospital and given a dose of DHE every 8 hours via IV along with steroid and benadryl via the port first. It was HELL. The benadryl was the worst and the flushing of the IV was painful also. Avoid that!

Migraine Headache	Lucy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	65-74	3/2/2010 5:46:55 PM	DHE is the only treatment that works for me and works like a miracle! I use a compazine suppository first, wait 20 minutes, and then give myself an injection in my hip, lie down in a dark room with ice packs on my head and a heating pad on my feet. I fall asleep, wake up 1 - 3 hours later feeling refreshed, clear-headed and in a very good mood. Now when I get a migraine, I know there's a solution that works 100% of the time.  I've been injecting DHE for about 15 years. 
Migraine Headache	mcjudy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	2/7/2010 12:37:41 AM	In the ER, this drug was given to me IV.  Horrible experience.  I started getting 'antsy' then sort of nervous but the worst thing--I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin.  It's hard to describe but I felt like I had been given a massive dose of CAFFINE..
Migraine Headache	juli, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/1/2009 12:02:38 PM	Been using DHE45 injections subcutaneously since 1993 (today is Aug. 1, 2009) almost daily, with unfortunate chronic daily migraine/head pain/nausea/vomiting.  This drug helps to reduce the pain level most of the time to a level '5', my usual daily pain level.  It does burn when injecting, but one can tolerate that for the few seconds it takes to inject.  Nothing prevents my migraines, so we have to 'treat' them with vascular constrictors.  Pain meds do not help.  This drug has been one of two (the other being Relpax pills) that are my 'drug of choice' to help treat this pain daily.  I have NO IDEA what will happen long-term (I think I'm already getting side-effects from long-term daily usage--high blood pressure, it used to be low; light-headed; muscle pain in one of the legs, I alternate each thigh-each injection, but one calf muscle tightens up--making it hard to walk)  
Migraine Headache	HunnyBunny78, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/10/2009 5:34:54 AM	This medicine so far has been the best that I have ever been treated with. I was in the ER and everything they were giving me through the IV just wasn't helping at all. When the nurse came in and said that the doctor order another dose of medication then she explained to me that it was a very potent drug called D.H.E. Then she reassured me that it wasn't a narcotic and as soon as she said that I was SOLD. At first I wasn't sure if it was going to work but she assured me after about 20 mins I should be doing fine. The only side effect that I had after she gave it to me was heart burn. If that is all I have to deal with to have a medication work on my migraines I WILL TAKE IT!!!!!
Migraine Headache	Ja'aj, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	11/25/2008 7:04:53 PM	My first experience with D.H.E. 45 was in an E.R. in about 1986... I have gotten migraine since 1963.The protocol was Compazine I.V. firstand 15 minutes later, the D.H.E.45, I.V. It was the first time in my life that I walked into an E.R. with a migraine, and walked out without it. My M.D. and my neurologist BOTH! wrote me perscriptions for the vials, so I could give myself the shot. I bought them 20 at a time.My veins &quot;roll&quot;, so I wasn't going to mess with &quot;I.V.&quot; I snapped the neck off the glass vial, drew the drug into a syringe, twisted around to the side, and gave myself a shot in my hip. (I.M.) (High, where all the fat is.) No lessons; I been getting shots for YEARS. I wasn't afraid of something I knew would stop that headache. And it did. It does. 40 minutes later; no headache. It works every time in 40 minutes.It never fails.I know it doesn't help everyone. Very few things do help &quot;everyone&quot;. I tell EVERYONE I meet who have Migraine- about D.H.E 45. It surely helped me. It has taken the fear of that headache away. I used to -in the beginning- also load and inject Vistarilwith the D.H.E. 45; to prevent possible nausea. I stopped taking the Vistaril after about 3 years. No nausea. I have -finally- almost stopped getting migraine. I don't miss it.  I credit &quot;outgrowing&quot; them to some extent. Mostly I credit the D.H.E.45.It gave me back my life.  The E.R. doctor told me that D. H. E. had been on the market for over 10 years when she mentioned it to me.She was surprised I han't heard of it. Thank God she had.   
Cluster Headache	Alyse, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	55-64	11/4/2008 5:34:29 PM	This is a great rescue drug for cluster headaches.  The injection is quite painful and you get a gut ache even with a reglan premed.  If it does not work 100% you can always add steroids.  It all beats months and months of headache pain.
Cluster Headache	hurtingnomore, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	4	Female	25-34	10/2/2008 3:04:11 PM	Had a horrible 4 week bout of cluster headaches where it felt like I had been hit in the head with a 2X4, nothing would make it stop. Was admitted to the hospital and given DHE. The side effects were horrindous but I was willing to do anything to make the pain stop and it did. It worked wonders. But that was the roughest med I have ever taken.
Migraine Headache	cannonofski, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/23/2008 3:34:21 PM	This has been a wonder drug for me. My quality of life was in the toilet and I was facing not being able to hold a job because of the headaches.  I finally found a neurologist that was willing to do whatever it took to find an answer.  He taught me how to inject myself with DHE and 14 years later I still using it to relieve my headaches. I am sad to read that so many others have not had good experiences with this drug. It has always successfully abated my pain within a couple of hours. Every other drug on the market proved worthless and terribly expensive.

I WAS 7 DAYS IN AND AT THE HOSPITAL ONLY TO GO INTO HEART SPASMS FROM THE DHE. CRUSHING PAIN, AND COULDN'T TALK, VERY SCARY WHEN THEY ARE PUTTING NITRO ON YOUR CHEST AND ADRENELINE IN YOUR IV TO STABILIZE YOU.  NEVER AGAIN.  I WENT ANOTHER 5 WEEKS UNTIL I FINALLY GOT SOME RELIEF. RESEARCH, RESEARCH, RESEARCH, I CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH.

Migraine Headache	Lovette, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/15/2008 1:23:19 PM	Hopitalized for 4 days after migrain for 21 days. This med was given IV. It burnt my veins, and the site was moved 3 times, whereby I now have bruises and swelling. Not only was this med not effective, it actually hurt. I am no longer confident with this neurologist, and am finding another. My sister is a 20 year Airforce RN in neonatal intensive care and told me that the military doesn't use D.H.E. anymore.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/16/2008 11:23:52 AM	I did experiance a little shortness of breath and chest pressure- but that let up very soon after the medication was given (within 5 minutes)  I was headache free!  I like this drug because there is no sedation, no narcotics involved.  It's nice because a lot of ER doctors look at migrainers as drug seekers.  I get so frustrated with this!  Another treatment that does work for me is Haldol and Cogentin given IV.  Although be prepared to be &quot;knocked out&quot; for a solid 12-18 hours. Just thought i'd mention this. 
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	3/5/2008 11:15:05 AM	I was admitted to the hospital after 22 days of migraines for a 72 hour treatment of injections every 8 hours. When I left the hospital I got as far as the parking lot when the next one hit. As soon as I got into the sunlight for the very first time it came back. I am now on day 27 with no end in site. 
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	1	4	Female	25-34	10/11/2007 2:09:23 AM	I don't like injecting myself, but it does help with the migraines.
Migraine Headache	8nos8, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	35-44	10/5/2007 8:08:07 PM	I have not personally injected myself with this. I did however receive it in hospital intraveinsly. I did spend 3 days in hospital getting this gravol and demerol every 6 - 8 hours. I felt great on the 4th day after suffering for 2 solid weeks!
