Emptying of the Bowel	Dr News, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	5/4/2009 7:52:50 PM	Prescribed as part of a pre-colonoscopy regimen.  Hard to tell specific effects, since this was administered in conjunction with MiraLAX, but overall, treatment accomplished the desired goal.  There was some very mild cramping, but the discomfort was minor and only lasted an hour or two.

When I take 3 pills, I'll usually have a lot of  diarrhea and moderate to severe pain that lasts up to 6 hours. Perhaps I'll try taking 2 pills twice a day for a few days. I also take a powdered fiber suppliment daily.
