I was used to it because when I was 18 I missed my periods by months. My doctor first said it was normal then I went to the Gyno. Anyways, at the end of April I went to the Gyno and she prescribed this for me to jump start my period then I had to take my birth control as soon as my period started. I got my period the day after I finished my 10th pill. I had my period for 7 days. It's been two weeks and I just started getting my period again! Is this happening to anyone else? I'm calling the doctor tomorrow but I just wanted to see if this has happened to anyone else. Overall the medicine did what it was supposed to do. The only side effects I had were really bad headaches and dizzyness.

It was ruining me and so depressing for me to even want to get out of bed. So far this has worked for me. After 2 doses my period faded. The only downfall is I take 4 a day for 1 week then 3 a day for a week and so on and so forth. I do have slight pressure right above my belly but thats it.

This is a great pill to flush out the body but not a good pill if you want to get pregnant because it does'nt help you ovulate, just to have a period. I have not experienced any side effects from this medication. It also helps jumpstart not only the missing period but also the next two and then afterwards you may have to visit the doctor again to jumpstart your periods again.

I had three regular periods but every month the were coming later and later then the stopped for three months. I went to Doctor and he gave me these to jumpstart my cycle. I was given a five day supply and told to take two evry day. It worked great I started my period within days of taking and had a pre birth control period (alot heavier than when I was on birth control) Hopefully my cycle will return to normal and I can get pregnant this time. I did have bad side effects on days 3 and 4 of taking this. Really bad headaches and nausea. Off and on crying for the entire duration of the pills, and if my husband said one worng word I was all over him. I am so lucky he is patient.

I have been bleeding for more than 2 months with heavy bleeding, pains in my belly, and clots. I have been taking it for about 2 weeks now and there is a difference but a bad one. I am having more blood clots now and more bleeding. My stomach hurts and it is hard for me to focus. My doctor thinks that I may have Fibroidic Tumors in my uterus that is causing the bleeding. I will not know until I get my test results back. I'm not really sure why she prescribed this medication to me if it isn't meant to stop my period. Any suggesstions?

I have not gained any weight in the last 8 years, and this is the only change I have made. I thought I was pregnang, but have taken several tests and that is not the case. Has this happened to anyone else? I'm hoping it's water weight and will go away, but it hasn't happened yet.

Last year, I began bleeding, and it became very heavy. After almost 4 months of bleeding, I became anemic. I went to a new doctor who put me through a procedure where he scraped all the lining from my uterus to stop the bleeding. The biopsy was negative, and he put me on MedroxyProgesterone, 10 days a month. Since I've been on it, I've been having normal periods for the first time ever. This drug has truly saved my life.

I had also told my Dr. that I hadn't noticed my ovulation cycle, which I have been able to feel monthly since giving birth x4. So my Dr. said my cycle was out of whack. I also had just had my paraguard IUD removed which I had for 6 yrs., because I thought it was causing my prolonged bleeding. So he gave me this medroxyprogesterone, took for ten days. Bleeding stopped after 7-9 days on the pills. Then in about 7 days I started spotting and it gradually got heavier. Today I have been soaking super plus tampons and wearing a pad besides to catch the overflow, and going thru these tampons every hour-hour and a half. I have NEVER bled like this before. I plan to call Dr. tomorrow.

I finished the 10 pills 7 days ago and still no period... I have been extremely Tired, nauseous, weak, very tender breasts, and can't seem to drink enough water. I too was wondering if it's possible to get pregnant while on this medication? I've been trying to get pregnant but no luck due to the PCOS I never ovulate. Has anyone else become pregnant while on this medication?

I've taken it for three months.  First month it took 9 days after my 10th pill, second month, one day, third month, period began while taking the pills - on the 7th day. Cramps were worse third month and I continue to have trouble sleeping. Also have had bad headaches right before and during my period.  Has helped with the clotting. I'm just trying to hold off on a hysterectomy so at this time, I guess it is helping.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/15/2009 10:59:51 PM	I took this three times so far in my life. My doc gave them to me before starting Ortho Novum. She wanted to see if I had the ability to bleed to begin with. The first time I used it, it took a week after I'd stopped for me to bleed (my first ever period). The second time was because I hadn't been faithful to taking the Ortho due to the fact I'd throw up sometimes. That time, I bled the week after I stopped. I just finished my third time taking it, and bled a few days after I finished. The cramps are something fierce, but I assume they'll get better, since when taking the Ortho Novum the cramps were killer at first, then not bothersome as years passed. I don't remember how I was before, but I felt 'off' while taking it, and it bummed me out. A day or two after my week ended, I was fine. Luckily for me, I now have a choice between taking a low-dose birth control pill, or sticking to this. I'm leaning on sticking to this, since it's one less pill to worry about, and I'll only need 10 days worth.

This is my 7th day on the pill and I have never been so depressed.  I can't stop crying, I've gained weight, and I'm overlly tired, spending all of my free time in my bed.  I can't wait to be done with this medication.  If you're on it, know that the mood swings are caused by the medication.  If you're already a depressed person, it may make your depression worse. 
Other	Julie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	1/18/2009 2:34:19 PM	I took this medication expecting no side effect because it was prescribed to sluff of the lining of my uterus like a chemical D&amp;C.  At first I didn't notice much change.  But, by the 4th day I had trouble breathing extreme, backache mild, and the worst part was the mood swings and altered mood.  I totally verbally attacked my husband thinking he didn't love me and demanding a divorce.  He tried to tell me he loved me and I just freaked out and could not control my mood.  I am not taking this again.  This was not normal as I love my husband dearly, but on this medication I felt as though I hated him and I had less emotion for my children.  The  doctor knew I suffer from depression and take 40mg of Celexa and I smoke.  What was relatively controlled depression turned into paranoia, screaming, and such horrible mood swings I am surprised my husband did not walk out.  I had this reaction within 4 days.  I stopped taking the medication and I just can't believe how out of control I was. Thank God my husband had me check the side effects as he knew this behavior was not &quot;me.&quot;  Evidently, my side effects from this medication are considered rare and I am evidently sensitive to this medication, I did experience horrible depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and etc.
Other	MesquiteBrieTX, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/3/2009 7:33:24 PM	I started taking this  medicine after bleeding for 8 months straight. I stopped bleeding on the 3rd day of taking it and I continued on the 10 day dose. I then didnt bleed for two weeks. I then had sex and started right back up again. For two weeks straight. Went back to the doctor and she change my birth control and game me Progesterone once again. I  am on my 2nd day and I was FLOODING earlier but now I am noticing that I  am slowing down. I am 24 and after them doing tests and sonograms they cant find anything wrong with me. And bleeding like this is strange for one because all my life I have been abnormal, and by abnormal I am talking about 1 or 2 periods a year. So It works for me but like some of the other people I read it gives me crazy mood swings and my breast get real tender. The only think next for me if this doesnt work is a D&amp;C so cross your fingers for me.

My last normal period was two months ago.  Approx. 2 weeks after the normal cycle ended I had some spotting over two days.  I did not begin my regular period when I expected and about 3 weeks after the spotting began light to medium bleeding which lasted for almost three weeks before I visited the Dr.  (The amount was generally light to medium although one day I experienced significant flow and several large clots.)  Prescribed 14 days therapy of 10mg once per day.  After one day the bleeding decreased noticably and I just &quot;felt&quot; better, almost &quot;lighter.&quot;  After three days the bleeding has essentailly stopped, but I do have what appears to be the remenents of some &quot;old&quot; blood.  No noticable side effects.  So far working as expected and I am quite pleased.

Earlier this year, I then experienced a heavy and long period (3 weeks), so I was prescribed medroxyprogesterone again for 10 days.  The bleeding stopped and I went on to a regular period, but I had broken out in a rash on my 5th day of taking the medicine but since that didn't happen the first time, my dr. and I thought it must have been caused by something else.  Recently, I experienced the same heavy period issue and took the drug, but again, broke out in a rash on my 4th day.  While it resolved my period issues, it made me more miserable to have a rash than a period.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	11/28/2008 5:33:18 PM	I have polycystic ovarian sydnrome.  I found out at a few years ago at the age of around 18 or 19.  I have been on the medicine ever since I was diagonosed.  It had definitely delivered and I get my period reguarly when I take the med's.  I do suffer some slight side effects with nausea and headaches but for the most part if it's keeping me healthy I am willing to suffer through a few headaches.  I do get migraines and have some med's for that when they get really bad but for the most part this medicine makes me feel like a normal woman again.  At the age of 22 I am glad that I found out so early what the problem was and that my outcome was not so serious.  Definitely would recommend women who have issues with their period to get checked for the disease because it is more common then you think.

June of this year came around and I actually started a cycle. But I noticed I still hadn't stopped in July and around the same time I passed a large clot with hard tissue and one batch of just tissue.Well July-August It was still going on so I went to a local ER and they reffered me to a doctor who prescribed the medroxyprogesterone.(This was September) At first it was okay because at times the beeding stopped. Right after I finished my week supply, things got BAD! I had a VERY heavy flow with many Large clots and was soaking many pads. It got so bad that the Friday after I finished I had to go to the ER again. Well the doctor told me that this medicine was DEFINATELY the wrong one for me and that it bascially caused a D&amp;C on me (26 years old and celebate) I became anemic from the amount of blood loss and now am on OVCON 50

The 1st round had me pretty emotional and I had heavy bleeding 10 days after I stopped taking it. The 2nd round is making me a little nauseated. Both times I have become very dehydrated and had burning while I used the bathroom due to electrolytes in my urine. Overall, It is doing what its supposed to and if it gives us a child it will be worth it.

Other	Victoria Y, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	4/21/2008 5:20:46 PM	I am stil in the first week of this med, so I don't know if it will work for me, the dr put me on it to cause a period so I can try and get pregnant.I am curious as to how well this med worked at getting a period started, and how long it took to start one? I am only supposed to take the med for 7 days, then wait for a period. And, when it does start, how long will it last?Also, I am getting some very itchy skin on my thighs, mostly the outside, and on my lower legs around my knees. The skin isn't dry, and I am getting some splotchy pink spots where the itching is, and there are some bumps scattered in the spot. Normal for anyone else?

Other	Chick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/13/2008 11:32:29 PM	I have had extreme back pain for the past 4 yrs. The pain was the worst the week before my period. When I went in for my anual I told my doctor that I was 30 yrs old and too young for it to take me 20 min. to get out of bed in the morning, and that my period was so heavy I could hardly function. He started me on this med and I have had no back pain since. He said that he suspects that I have endometriosis. I just want to know if this is a regular treatment for this disease. From what I have read about it, it's not really good for long term use. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	3/5/2008 7:17:59 PM	This medication did not work for me. When your doctors nurse tells you that you may or may not have PCOS and you have to take more pills. And that you may not be able to have children its hard on a 20 year old you wants kids in the near future. I guess im a little hurt by that. He put me on birth control so when that didn't help three weeks ago he put me on Provera(Medroxyprogesterone which is a sub for Provera) and when that didn't work he decides to put me on another pill and puts me on two more weeks on the Provera sub. Now if that doesn't work what will he try next. So im getting a second opion.

I was prescribed a 10 day dose. On day 7 mu period finally came with a lot of cramps. In the last 7 days this drug has given me nausea, constipation and some stomach pain. Can't wait to start working on baby number 2

Abnormal Uterine Bleeding caused by Imbalance of Hormones		5	5	4			12/27/2007 5:08:51 PM	I suffered from a hormonal imbalace which caused me to have my period all the time with the exception of a few days a month. I have been on this medication for a few years and my new doctor is getting ready to switch me. I never had any major problems with this medication. New users be aware it takes about 3 months to get into you completely and get your regulated.
