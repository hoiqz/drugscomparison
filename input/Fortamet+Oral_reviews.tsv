I had severe upset stomach when taking generic metformin so my doctor switched me to Fortamet ER. Although it is the same drug as metformin, the extended release tablet helps with digestive problems by not dumping so much medication into your system at once. The MOST important thing to know about taking any metformin drug is to eat LOTS of protein when you take the pills and throughout the day. My doctor even recommended drinking a protein shake, which has about 23g of protein, with the medicine. Doing this stopped any stomach upset I was having. The other key to avoiding side effects is to build up slowly to your ideal dose.

It does seem to give me a loss of appetite, however.  I do feel better since I've been taking it for PCOS.

I have lost abt 25 lbs because of diarrea, my a1c numbers are good but the quality of life not so good, my doctor says it should get better, I am tired of changing drugs

Can't take the big 1000 pill.  Using two 500 daily.  My one complaint is the smell of this medication -- smells like old fish.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	1/4/2010 7:35:28 PM	I almost choked to death the first (and only)time I tried to take it.  I had to be taken by ambulance to the ED and they administered medication by IV to enable me to swallow this HUGE pill.  Watson Pharmaceuticals told me they would reimburse me my $40.00 copay, but it has been 7 weeks and all they have done is give me the run around.  I wouldn't recommend this medication to anyone.

I have had intermittent diarrhea.  The most significant side effect has been a bad taste that makes foods taste the way old cigarette ashes smell.

I didn't take one last night and I still had diarrhea this morning.  I can't take Metformin and I told the doctor that.  They assured me that this was not Metformin, it is, just in a different form.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/22/2008 6:25:54 PM	The difference in the Metformin that I was on and the Fortamet is that the Metformin was &quot;fast acting&quot; and now the Fortamet that I am on is &quot;slow acting&quot;...according to my endocronologist.  I have a friend who had the same reaction with the metformin and the fortamet has also helped her.  Take the fortamet just as directed and you should feel better and have better readings.  Stick to your diet.  I feel better than I have in years.  I have a son who is a Type I diabetic and he eats right and exericises every day and is doing great.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	England, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/14/2008 9:17:48 AM	I just started taking this last night but I'm confused after reading the reviews.  You say you couldn't take Metformin and now on Fortamet and doing better.  The box I'm looking at right now says Fortamet Metformin HCI extended-release tablets 500 mg.  So aren't they the same???

My blood sugar was under control but I had severe diarhea to the point of many embarrassing &quot;accidents&quot;.  My doctor changed me to Fortamet approximately 5 weeks ago and I am so much better. I have not had any &quot;accidents&quot; since I changed to Fortamet.  My blood sugar readings are very good now.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	45-54	2/20/2008 8:03:05 AM	I am taking this drug for metobolic syndrome. I have had no s/e from it so far and was unable to take metformin and my dose is currently being increased. The huge pills are hard to swallow. I am hopeful that my serum insulin level comes down and that is works well to assist with some weight loss.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	9/24/2007 1:31:25 PM	I take Fortamet to treat PCOS.  The 1000mg dose is a very large tablet, and since I cannot break it up, it can be difficult to swallow.  However, it is much easier on my stomach than Metformin.
