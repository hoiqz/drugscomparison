Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	Ken, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	7/4/2012 11:58:59 AM	I have been taking this drug for several months following back surgery, a torn rotator cuff and a broken ankle. NSAIDS usually cause stomach pain and reflux for me, but not with Piroxicam unless I drink an alcoholic beverage.  My doctor says it is time released therfore reducing stomach irritation.  My back pain is much improved as is the torn rotator cuff.  The broken ankle is somewhat recent so it is difficult to determine its effect.  I will stop taking the medication for a short time to see if the back and rotator cuff pain returns.

Has caused no stomach or bleeding problems even though I take aspirin for break-through pain. It is inexpensive. I would gladly pay for it out-of-pocket if it weren't covered by my insurance.

I am 67 now and started taking this drug in 1981 while still in the military.  It has been great at relieving pain and stiffness in my joints and for me without any side effects or interactions.  I've taken it for so long now that I don't realize how good it is until I stop taking it.  After 3 or 4 days I notice the increased stiffness and pain.  My pain levels have increased over time such that I need additional pain medication now but the piroxicam still is doing its job.  I take 20 mg once a day in the morning.

Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	10/28/2010 11:59:02 PM	My doctor perscribed me this when I had strep throat/mono combined, and I could barely swallow (he perscribed it as an anti-inflamatory). The first time I took it, I ate right after (it says to take with food) and threw up about a half hour later...I personally had to eat something small and light beforehand. It worked enough so that I could actually swallow with only a small sting.I also happened to have some back pain and knee pain from overdoing myself in dance and figure skating, and taking that for my throat helped those a lot as well.

This has been a lifesaver as I now can move and walk mostly pain-free, while beforehand it was quite difficult to even stand up from seated postion, let alone walk and get around. i have a bit of stomach irritability, and I think I have a little less of a verbal filter when irritated (just ask the hubs) -- but all of that is an excellent trade-off for getting much of my life back.

I've been on piroxicam for a few months now and starting to get tightness and severe bloating in my stomach, but I have IBS and many other digestive issuse so I am pretty much use to that stuff ( but if your not, this medication is not for people with sensitive stomaches). The symptom that Im most concerned with is that Im experiancing continuos tingling serges thoughout my body with any kind of body movement, that distorts and throws me off balance. The closest thing I can relate it to is when getting an epideral, the moment they first tap into your spine, you get a quick but very strong shot of tingles down the left side of you. Anyone else experiancing anything like this?

I used it for severe lower back pain and it worked great until i ended up in the emergency room bleeding from my anus. It was also acconpanied by stomach pain and diareah. On a good note, my back pain was helped greatly.

I used to take vioxx, and this is an acceptable substitute for the arthritis pain.  I also take a minimum dose of vicodin when needed, but the anti-inflamitory agent in the piroxicam is helpful and it is very affordable.  It is on the Wal-Mart list of $4.00 for a 30 day supply, and that helps!  I have not noticed any side effects in the years I have been taking the med.

I can now snap my fingers for the first time in 10 years, not as loud perhaps as I did 15 yrs. ago but certainly better!   I get through most days without now having to take other pain relievers.

After a week the swelling was gone and there was little pain.  I did not have signs of stomach or digestive bleeding like I had with Celebrex.  The only drawback was it took longer to start working, about three days for swelling to decrease.

Other	Rod, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Male	45-54	9/26/2007 11:34:04 PM	I was prescribed this medication for an inflamed triceps muscle / tendon.  My dosage was 20 mg daily so I took it right after dinner.  By the 4th day, though, I was having problems sleeping at night.  By the 6th day I was getting heart palpitations, nausea, and feeling dizzy.  Further, I couldn't sleep at all. Consequently, I discontinued use of this medication and consulted my physician.
