Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	CHER, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	55-64	6/15/2010 2:22:41 PM	For many years I have suffered with an anxiety disorder. Without getting into any particulars the anxiety ruled my life.  I was fortunate to find a new family physician and after really listening to me she said she wanted me to try Pristiq as she'd had other patients who had very positive results.  I've just finished 6 weeks. The first few weeks I did experience tummy issues, rapid heart beat and one or two panic or anxiety attacks that took me by surprise.  But as I write this today I can honestly say I haven't felt this good in a long time.  I feel I can be more spontaneous and something as simple as taking a long walk with my husband doesn't throw me into a complete tizzy.  Sorry for this long note but I'm so happy I can share my positive experience.

Pharma companies come out with new versions of drugs that are getting ready to go generic. Sometimes the newer drug is tweeked to be better but mostly no difference. They just want to recoup their investment and make a profit from research for original..so basically Pristiq took the place of Effexor. Therefore, I would think it would have the same effect on your blood pressure. I'm surprised your doctor wasn't aware of this. You should check with them. Effexor and Pristiq are the only effective drugs for my depression and ADD symtoms. Hopefully you can switch to something else. BE SURE TO TITRATE DOWN PER DOCTORS INSTRUCTIONS WHEN GETTING OFF OF THIS DRUG. STOPPING ABRUPTLY HAS HORRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS. GOOD LUCK!
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/7/2009 1:15:23 PM	I have been on Pristiq for a week now.  The first 2 nights were rough, I had bad anxiety and restlessness thoughout the night, I didnt sleep much but was wide awake for work the next morning and in GREAT spirts!  My husband has noticed the changes and has said to me that it was nice to have the old me back.  This pill has completely zapped my appetite though, and I have lost much weight in a week but its starting to come back but very slowly.  The bad side effects seem to be tapering off slowly and they are my pupils dialating very large, and then mixing pristiq with caffine has given me restless legs syndrome only really noticable at night.  Otherwise I am having a great experiance on this treatment.  I have never tried an antidepressant before.
Depression	MinTX, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	10/1/2009 10:37:51 AM	Mid-second week w/ treatment.  First week had some upset stomach &amp; headache.  This week I feel very tired by mid-afternoon.  However, the upset stomach and headache are gone.  The Dr. said that it would take several weeks for the medication to take full effect.
Panic Disorder	ladyb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	35-44	8/10/2009 2:59:58 PM	After about 4mths of use still not doing great.  Went up to 100mgs and that was too much and lost my appetite, so came back down to 50mgs.  My biggest complaint is that his medicine gets caught in my lower troat.  Anyone else had this issue?
Depression	Sandy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	55-64	4/21/2009 12:42:44 PM	I was taking Effexor for a year, was very pleased with results (depression).  I'm also treated for high blood pressure and was told I had to stop Effexor.  So, now Pristiq and still feeling anxious and elevated blood pressure.  Anyone else?  Thanks

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	omg, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	25-34	10/14/2008 7:04:39 PM	It has been almost 2 months and I have not noticed any change in my anxiety or depression since starting Pristiq (desvenlafaxine), even after an increase of dosage. I had been prescribed Effexor XR (venlafaxine) a few years ago with similar results. My understanding is that this medication is that the active ingredient in Pristiq is the same as in Effexor and Effexor XR. My inclination is that this is another money-grab by Wyeth; patenting a new product by repackaging the old, therefore, guaranteeing monopoly prices for another several years for the same product. I have not seen much independent research on this product, but I would encourage others to try the generic version of Effexor XR (venlafaxine) unless there is evidence that Pristiq does anything significantly different than its predecessors.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	Bostongirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	9/3/2008 10:26:09 PM	I have only been on this medication for a little over a week.  I feel the same, not as much anxiety during the day.  My doctor told me it will take 3 to 4 wks to start seeing some results.  I am going to give it a chance I have tried everything else under the sun I am not going to throw in the towel yet.  I will update this site in order for others to make an informative decision.  Remember, everyone is different so give yourself a chance.
