Been taking it for 2 months now and it's working for me. My LDL went from 163 to 123 so far. I take 2 fish oil for the triglycerides and that brought that down from 300 to 100, so that combination is working for me. I don't have any side effects so far and I'm very very sensitive to drugs. Hardly can take anything because of a sensitive digestion.I'm glad I can take this.

My Trigliyceride level was around 650, been there since 1981.  Zetia with Lovaza (fish oil) 2 gm in AM/2 gm PM lowered me to 350.  Adding Red Yeast Rice with CO Q-10 lowered me to 290.  Added slow release Niacin (over the counter)got me to 220. No side effects.

First, I religiously follwed a strict diet and exercise program with little improvement in my lipid panel. I tried many statins and had liver enzyme and mucle pain issues. I could not tolerste Niacin. Finally, Lipitor started my succesful efforts. But, my lipid levels were stilll not optimal for a heart disease patient. With Zetia, my lipid profile is 75 HDL and 74 LDL. Except for mor frequent need for emtying my bowels, I have no side affects. I have been on Lipitor/Zetia for &gt;5 years. My liver panel is normal. I can't imagine not taking Zetia.

Zetia has been a little less effective than the statins at lowering the cholestrol, but definitely better than nothing.  I have experienced no side effects.  Unfortunately, my insurance is not going to cover it anymore, so I'm not sure what the next move is!

He was doing fine on it , then one day he suddenly developed severe flu like symptoms,body aches all over, nausea, and cold chills. He was in bed for 3 days.He stopped taking the Zetia, all the symptoms went away except for the pain in his legs.His legs hurt and the muscles feel tight all the time. If he even sits for 5 minutes, when he gets back up it feels like he is having to stretch his leg muscles out every time. The pain is affecting his ability to work or even enjoy life at all.Has anyone else had this problem? Can anyone help us ? No one seems to know why he is having this pain and tightness in his legs.

I had liver damage that only reversed when I got off of them. Zetia was the answer since it works through the bloodstream and not in your vital organs. I have used it for about four years and over the last three or so noticed I experience to the bone fatigue particularly in my legs.  Any other users feel the fatigue in their legs? It's gettin really bad and very annoying. As I write this I am feeling it terribly.

Had muscle weakness, was in hospital for two weeks, using Prednisone to combat what was thought to be MYOSITIS, and came home with complete body weakness.  I have had remaining problems for three yearss, ending with permanent muscle damage to legs.  And I have been weaning off steroid for ONE year, with very badx side effects--siezures, tremors, weight loss, hair loss, cataracts, and many other side effects.  Bottom line, this was finally diagnosed as problems from taking the Zetia.  My physician will no longer give me cholesterol lowering medication, and everyone who takes these meds should be consistent in monitoring any changes in their health.

In the last couple of years, pain in my hands has been increasing to the point that it was difficult to write.  Tremors in my hands have increased as well which I attributed to hand pain (but I was also concerned about Parkinson's Disease).  I had difficulty doing precision work like using a screw driver and my hands would shake so much that it was difficult to hold a cup.  I discontinued use of Zetia in early February and within two weeks hand pain decreased and tremors were essentially gone.  I can again write and use a screwdriver!

One day I could not walk to my car. Somehow I reached home (should have gone to hospital straight), I collapsed in front of my door. Ended up with quadrupple bypass. It is criminal to keep this drug on the market.
High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	11/30/2009 1:12:38 PM	I was taking this medication for about six months.  I started to have severe chest pain, but it would go away.  After the second day, the pain was worse, and traveled to my back and jaw.  As a medic, I know the signs of a heart attack.  I stopped taking the medication immediately.  I still have soreness in my chest, but, the pain stopped.  I believe there is no safe cholesterol medication.

It has helped me tremendously!!! I take 1 twice daily. I think everyone's problem may be you not eating when you take it. I experienced some of the same discomforts I am reading about when I took them with nothing on my stomach. I eat about half of my food take a pill then eat the rest. And I have no side effects. There is always an expection to the rules...and I may just be weird...but maybe if you all try this, it might work. It never hurt to try,  you definitely wouldn't be losing anything!

I was taken off statins and put on zetia because of muscle pain/weakness.  I though everything was going well.  I am now 6 weeks into treatment and have been having Major weakness and muscle pain for about 2 weeks.  It was getting worse everyday.  I cannot even sleep because I ache.  Have also had numbness and tingling in my hands in the night.  I went off yesterday but am still feeling horrid.  I am hoping that the effects will fade quickly.  I though Zetia was not supposed to have this effect!!  I am unhappy that it appears to be no different than a statin.  (but is marketed as being better, right!)

It had no effect on my cholesterol.  In fact, my numbers continued to climb.  So, I stopped taking it.  I did not have side effects with it, though, like I did on a different medication.

Have had success with lowering numbers, however, the side effects are really annoying.  I am sore all over, but mainly in legs, back and shoulders.  I have also developed numbness in right side of face and right side of lower leg.  I cannot sit for very long without being so stiff it is difficult to stand up.  I love to walk, but it is becoming difficult (breathing labored).  Not sure if it is worth the side effects.  I had given up on Zetia and started taking red yeast rice, but that has not helped and it is expensive.

My sense of smeall is almost depleted.  I have been off for over 5 yrs and can only taste slightly some foods like spicy italian or chili. Eyesight went down hill fast. That has not changed either. Didn't put two and two together until dizziness was more than I could handle. Mentioned it to a sister who lives 3 hrs away and here she has same symptons. Only one I know of. We do not take it anymore and would never recommend.

Something needs to be done to insurance that when something  is working they should but out and leave it to the cardiologist that works with the patient and knows how they are responding.

My arm hurt when I lifted my coffee cup.  I quit the medication in October 2008 and the pain has remained.  My lab tests showed my low density lipoprotein (LDL) was very low.  I bought and ate a 1/4 lb hamburger with cheese and fries, the first in 5 years.  Within an hour the pain was gone from my left arm and elbow.  When I awoke the next morning all my pain was gone.  I think the Zetia lowered my LDL too much and caused the pain.

My knees hurt first then my elbows and then every inch of my body I could not stand up I thought I might have the flu but I still stopped taking Zetia.  I am just beginning to walk again after 7 days off the medication.  I will never take this again please beware.

High Cholesterol	Fay, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	2/27/2009 7:26:30 PM	A few years ago in the US I was prescribed this medicine for my cholesterol. It worked BUT I had the same symptoms what other reviewers developed. SEVERE MUSCLE PAIN, where I cannot even walk properly. Went to a doctor in Singapore which told me to stop taking it immediately and he gave me QUESTRAN (GENERIC NAME IN THE US IS CHOLESTYRAMINE) 2x a day. They are sachets of a powderwhich you have diluted with water. Drink it at least 1 to 2 hrs after any other medicine or 3 to 4 hrs before you take any other medicine. It is a pain in the neck in the beginning because you have to remember the times etc, but it helped. it is a slow reaction medicine, but it helped. My cholesterol level came down slowly but at least now it is under the border. Also the triglyceride is good now. Talk to your doctor about this and try it. I will never go back to statins anymore. Before Zetia, the doctors have tried Lipitor, Crestor, Zocor, you name it. It all developed the muscle pain, but this Questran was the best for me. Of course you still have to watch your food. lots of fruit, vegetables and salmon. Hope this will help you, as it is helping me. They tell me that it is an old fashioned medicine, but I do not care, I am taking it and I am very happy. Sometimes the oldies are still better.I also read in a review of one of these statin medicines, that these musclepains can go up to your heartmuscles. And then it can be fatal. So, friends, try QUESTRAN (CHOLYSTYRAMINE).

Stopped Zetia two weeks ago and am hoping to get my strength back. Doctor kept insisting I take this even though I told him what I thought it was doing.  Quit taking on my own several times only to have my dr. insist I keep taking it.  Decided I would rather die of heart attack than live like this.

The muscle pain has not ceased with stopping the medication.  The pain has grown worst and my Doctor told me it could be chronic pain.  I am now becoming more concerned that I have read on this site that it can lead to kidney failure.  The warnings that come with this medication &quot;tell your doctor is you experience &quot;muscle pain / tenderness / weakness&quot; are inadequate as it appears that once the symptoms develop the pain is not reversible even with stopping the medication.  I don't feel my kidneys are worth the price to reduce my cholesterol.

I have now developed the same type symptoms as the statin drugs.  I wake up in the middle of the night having to use the bathroom.  Once there, I begin to sweat, feel pins and needles &amp; become very weak; unable to move.  After a while &amp; some cold air, I slowly begin to revive.  Very scary.

After taking for almost 2 years, I began to wake up with an ache in my right shoulder every morning about 3-4 AM.  I have not taken the Zetia for about 2 months and just recently I have stopped having the early morning aches and pains which were waking me.  It was effective in reducing my overall cholesterol and triglycerides but not worth it!

After about twelve months my LDL was down to 66, with good diet and lots of exercise. So I went off of it by my choice for about five months. LDL to back to 101. Started taking it again and after three months LDL down already to 77. Will stay on it, it works and no side effects.

His Dr. thought it was triggered by the Zetia, but kept him on it anyway. One year later he was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer, and six months after that he was dead. I'd been on it, as well as Lipitor, for the same condition and like my father had already when he developed adult-onset diabetes and a heart problem, I had developed high pre-diabetic sugars. No diabetes or heart problems in my family until those of us who started taking cholesterol meds for inherited high cholesterol.After my father's cancer diagnosis I quit the Zetia immediately. My Dr. argued with me about it and showed me the PDR and that there was no mention of cancer. I pointed out that there was mention of pancreatitis and I thought it was logical to suspect they were connected.  He disagreed but I refused the Zetia.  A few months later the newspaper reported three studies that showed susbstantially higher rates of various cancers in people taking Zetia and no lives saved from taking it.Be careful. Our doctors do not know enough.

I have however had side effects from Lipitor that has been taken in combination with the zetia. Doctor has lowered my Lipitor to 10mg and tests being taken for liver elevation and if elevation is up I'm going off of Lipitor. Zetia has done wonders so far. No complaints here and I had a stent put in my heart 9 years ago.

High Cholesterol	anon, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	1/14/2009 8:58:12 PM	Was on this drug for a few years before I started to have pancreas &quot;issues&quot; with me losing 30 pounds in a month.. had to take enzymes with food.. suddenly I wasn't able to reorder the drug through insurance... then I saw studies released on the news about the coverup of pancreas issues with this drug. This Drug as far as I know is not approved in Canada. Have been off the drug changed lifestyle when it happened and now I might be coming off the enzymes... as I'm not sure but it might have repaired (luckily?) I was lucky and heeded the early warning signs of a problem when I had pains and weightloss. Before this happened and before discovering that it was likely this drug that caused my pancreas issues I thought it was GREAT and even recommended it by word of mouth.. now, I do not.

High Cholesterol	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	1/3/2009 12:15:11 AM	MD had me on a series of drugs to lower my cholesterol over the last few years including Lipitor and Crestor.  Each became ineffective or adverse.  MD started me on Zetia.  Within 4 days I felt like a horse had kicked me in the chest.  Went to MD and he said to discontinue Zetia and I would get better over the next 5 days or so.  Extreme pain followed the next morning.  Trip to ER indicated my gall bladder was chronic and because of a stone blockage and I had life threatening pancreatitis.  Gall bladder was removed on an emergency basis.  Crestor had a similar but lesser effect 2 years before, but the MDs did not diagnose it as related.  I would avoid Zetia. It nearly killed me.  I was 57, strong, and healthy.  This was two years ago.

I have gained weight and CANNOT lose it. I am stiff upon rising and need to hobble for a dozen steps until I loosen up.  I have been taking zetia for 1 1/2 years because statins caused me too much muscle fatigue and weakness. I don't think this is any better.  Stay away from it if you can.

All my numbers have been going down. Dr is very pleased. However I have experienced muscle aches and very sore elbow. Try taking at night to eliminate daytime symtoms. This seems to help trmendously. I still have some aches and pains but not as much as before since I sleep most of them off:)

I quit taking it the first time when I experienced leg and joint pain.  Now I have begun to experience muscle and joint pain, extreme fatique, mild depression, inability to sleep all night, abdomen bloating, weight gain, and generally not 'feeling good'...it hit me while attending church yesterday that this could all be due to the Zetia again, so I returned home and researched patients' comments online.  I have discontinued this drug as of today, and plan to have a strong discussion with my physician the middle of January when I have a follow-up appointment.  I am a 65 year old female, am very active, walk 2 miles daily, and generally in good health.  My cholesterol was just about 215 before I was told to take Zetia.  Currently, I feel like if I don't find an answer, I won't be walking a lot longer.  This is very painful to the point that it is difficult to get up from a sitting or kneeling position.  
High Cholesterol	southseasadie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	12/18/2008 8:00:15 PM	This drug stole 1 year of my life.  I had slow onset extreme muscle weakness before this side effect was widely publicized.  I got weaker and weaker and also became extremely depressed after 5 weeks on drug.  After muscle biopsies and treatment, it took over a year for me to get back to normal.  And the joke is, I didn't even need the drug.  New doctor/new tests proved it!  Before this, prior doctor tried the three statins, which gave me tachycardia, and as I have WPW, and this side effect could kill me, I discontinued each after a few days.

I slowly developed side effects ranging from high liver lipids, sore thigh muscles (especially upon standing), tennis elbow, foot rash and lower leg swelling (above my sock line).  Was taken off both meds by my MD and instructed to take fish oil capsules (4 grams per day) for 90 days. Started  experiment 12/05/08...will share results 03/09.

High Cholesterol	JD, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	35-44	12/1/2008 10:55:06 PM	I take a combination of Simvastatin and Zetia and now regret it even though it appears to have dramatically lowered my cholestrol level. The muscular pain, muscle spasms, joint pain, restless leg syndrome, mood swings, constant fatigue, weakness, constant bloated feeling, poor appetite, unexplained weight gain, tough to exercise, etc... has been overbearing for the last 6 months. Because this combination of meds had positive outcomes I never blamed the drugs....hell they were working according to my lab work. My high cholestrol was now under control. For the past 6 months I have been unable to move my arms when I wake up in the morning (I need to literally lift my right arm and shake it to get in functioning....sounds crazy!) I have not taken the meds in almost 48 hours and I am beginning to see some of the most acute, painful symptoms begin to fade.  I will NOT take these again. My solution will have to be diet related since I already run 4 to 6 miles 4/5 times a week (and this has been no easy feat considering the pains that I had to overcome). Never again!!!

However, I do have leg calf pain and cramps.  Also, I don't seem to have the same level of energy.  I also take Lipitor and Lopid and have had no trouble taking those drugs.
High Cholesterol	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	11/20/2008 9:51:54 PM	Eventhough my cholesterol had come down to normal limits through the use of Lipitor, diet &amp; exercise, my doctor decided I needed to add a 1/2 a Zetia a day to lower my cholesterol a little further. I had been taking Zetia for less than 2 weeks when I developed severe muscle &amp; joint pain. After discontinuing the Zetia, the muscle &amp; joint pain began to slowly resolve, however the joint pain in my elbows, fingers &amp; knees never totally went away very negatively affecting my life &amp; the outlook I have on my life. I'm 4 months post-discontinuation of Zetia &amp; guess I'm ready to try alternative therapies now. Either the physicians that are prescribing this medication are uneducated on treatment for the side effects that it causes or there is no treatment. I can't say how much I REGRET ever having taken this medication. I would have rather lived with the higher risk of heart disease than the daily pain I live in now. HELP!!!

I started having migraine headaches and later found out that this drug can cause migraines. It also made me extremely sensitive to the sun.If I was out in the sun for ten minutes, I would end up with an excruciating headache,nausea and severe dizziness. This would last for 36 to 48 hours. Even if I avoided the sun, I would still get headaches four or five days a week. They were not as severe if I stayed out of the sun. My cholesterol level wasn't checked when I was taking Zetia, so I don't know if it loweredmy cholesterol.

My doctor has recommended reducing statin dose to two days per week (Crestor 10mg) and using Zetia Oral to help control cholestrol. Have been taking Zetia for six months with reduced statin dose and cholestrol is lowest ever at 161. No plaque build up found in carotic arteries. Improving muscle weakness by taking CO-Q-10 enzyme which has been extremely effective and no longer have knee wealness, back strength improving, right upper arm no weakness, left upper arm improving.  It would appear that although Zetia does not have all the health benefits of statins, it is still useful to those of us who are affected by the adverse side effects of statins and specifically muscle deterioration.

The upset stomach prevented me from taking Celebrex for my arthritis pain.I started Zetia 3 months later and have been on it for a year.  I no longer have stomach problems associated with taking Celebrex and my body aches and arthritis pain has greatly diminished.  The zetia didn't quite get my cholestrol levels where my doc wanted them so he added Lopid and now they are were they were with Crestor.The best part for me was finding an alternative treatment to statins that produced the same result but not with the same side effects.  I battled stomach problems and chronic pain the entire 2 years I took Crestor.  Zetia has been such a relief, that sometimes I forget I have fibromyalgia.

It lowered my mothers cholesterol, however, after a year on the medication she died suddenly.  I think Zetia contributed to plaque formation in her arteries.

Started Zetia 6 months later because cholesterol and triglycerides had soared again.  6 weeks into the Zetia treatment I am already suffering the same side effects.  The fatigue and zombie feeling is a side effect that so impacts life I feel it is not worth it.  Will tell Dr. as much when retest results are done in 4 weeks.

After just three months my cholesterol levels are great.  I am not overweight, did not change my diet or eating habits and really do not exercise.  I was experiencing some problems with bloating and gas, but I solved the problem by taking the medication in the morning instead of before bed.  My physician said it was better to take before bed, but if you feel better taking it in the morning and the Zetia is doing what it's suppose to do, then take it in the morning.  Zetia works great for me.

After 3 months I started getting rashes on different parts of my body. They finally went away after 6 months, then the muscle aches started and today I have severe muscle pain in my neck and shoulders. Muscle relaxers eliminate 95 % of the disconfort but my concern is the long term affects of this drug.

But side effects include, gas and bloating from time to time. Endoscopy showed irritated stomach lining.  Also had to have Gall Bladder removed. It was also inflamed and gall stones had developed.

I went back on Zetia, gas problem returned within 2 days.  Has anyone else experienced this?  If so, have you found a way to take Zetia or any other RX and not get gas problems?  Pls. respond.  Thanks.

Zetia doesn't, so I have stayed on it longer; however, I am experiencing low iron and ferritin levels, is it possible that the zetia as it blocks absorption of cholesterol also blocks iron?  I am extremely tired all the time, my LDL came down but I also take Omacor (Omega 3 fatty acid) with it.  I would love to hear from others.

High Cholesterol	Ann, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	11/20/2007 4:21:55 PM	Has caused nothing but more problems. I have Multiple Sclerosis, so all Zetia did was worsen my fatigue and acheing joints and muscles. It also caused my hands, feet, legs, face, etc. to swell really bad. I only took it for 5 days(have been off of it for 3 days) and none of the side effects have eased up yet. Am having to wear surgical stockings, elevate feet &amp; legs and stay off my feet as much as I can. Breathing has also gotten difficult. Congratulations to all that it has helped. And my sympathy to those that it hasn't.

I also developed a problem having excess gas after I went on zetia, but have found that if I take calcium too, it reduces the problem. I have also had trouble with fatigue since being on zetia.

I have been on Zetia for the past 6 years and I never heard of it giving leg problems like this. Please let me know if possible if you have any complaints like this.I hurt very badly. On a scale of 1-10, this is a 9. Please answer me soon if you can.

( Note my last HDL was 170, verified by retest)

My Dr. added 10mg Zetia to my Lipitor and after 6 weeks my total chol. was 184; 4 1/2 months later when it was again taken it was 180.  My Dr. wrote &quot;Fantastic&quot; on the lab report when he sent it to me.  Finally, something that has worked with my dieting and 3 days a week at the Y.  Thanks Zetia

Do not believe I have had anywhere near normal lipid panel in 6+ years.
