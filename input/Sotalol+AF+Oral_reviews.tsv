Cardiologist I met with yesterday has asked me to reduce my intake by half, for 2 weeks, &amp; to monitor my feelings over that period. Frequent taking of heartbeat counts &amp;/or noticeable feelings of changes in tiredness should be reported. 
Prevention of Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation	Bill, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	65-74	5/22/2009 9:38:03 AM	I first received it in the hospital to treat Atrial Fibrillaton. After three doses of 80mg each my heart converted to its natural rhythm. I've since been increased to 120mg to prevent future A/Fib.

I find myself NOT taking it at 12 hour intervals since some of my Meds need to be taken with meals and some (like this one) need to be taken w/o meals.Over-all it has worked perfectly and (to the best of my knowledge) I have had no Rhythm issues with my heart.  I am very please so far and would recommend to to anyone. Also, I have no side effects to the best of my knowledge.

Had used Metoprol for 2 years then went back in AF. Doc says take sotalol 1 hour before eating or 2 hours after eating which is difficult for me to follow.
