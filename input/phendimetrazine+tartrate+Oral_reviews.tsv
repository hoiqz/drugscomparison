Overweight	Kewlbuttons, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/18/2012 3:37:26 PM	I haven't been taking this med for very long. Just a week or so, but I have noticed increased energy. Which happens to make me more cheerful too. One side effect that I haven't read on other reveiws is green poop. And it has to be the med cus i haven't overly eatten anything green. I dunno...anyone else have that issue? other than that I like it.

Overweight	GladILostWeight, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	11/2/2010 12:55:20 PM	I started 3 months ago needing to lose 50 lbs. My blood pressure was 150/100 with medication. Now, 3 months later, using this medication and restricting my diet to high protein, low carbs  low calories  I am within 5 lbs of my target. It has been easy actually. And my blood pressure  using only half the medication previously used  is 120/80 range. I have had a couple of side-effects...One is constipation. You need to drink plenty of water. The other is erectile dysfunction. Never really dealt with that before  but I am assuming it is the effects of the pills (at least I hope it is). I guess I will find out in a couple of weeks when I go into maintenance mode..Other than that  my experience has been overall very positive...

Overweight	Cph, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/19/2010 4:02:43 PM	my starting weight was 200lbs and now way 175, I started taking the med in October but had to stop a wk or 2 into it, due having to have my gall bladder removed (which had NOTHING to do with this med, it had been bother some for years). I then started this med again in January and was still around 200lbs. I stayed on the med, did not exercise and lost 30lbs. around May i stopped this med in May (because it is a short term med- 6 months at a time). I did not have any major side effects just found it hard to sleep if i took it after 4pm. i usually only took 2 in AM and 2 at lunch time and watched my diet, reduced my fat in-take a lot. I was able to keep my weight around 175-179 and decided that i wanted to go back on it, and have been on it since 7/6/10 and have not lost very much. I think i am going to switch to Phentermine and see if it works for me. I would like to get to 150 where i feel comfortable being able to maintaine my own weght with out taking a pill. 
Overweight	L.M., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/7/2010 1:14:41 PM	I started taking this drug in October. I take three pills a day at 35 mg. each. I love it. It helps curve my appetite. I had first started taking my pills only on my work days; I work 12 hour shifts. i found that I would eat more on my days off. I was still losing my target weight every month, but it scared me thinking I would only go back to eating after I got off this pill. I have lost 32lbs. and have 50 more to go.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/23/2009 7:21:16 PM	i have taken these pills before and love them. I went to a clinic and got these pills under supervision. I had some side effects in the begining like anxiety and the jitters but after a week they wore off. They did always make me hyper though, I have a low tolerance for stimulants. Needless to say, I saw a review where someone was scared to ween off the pills and I wanted to say that because the clinic got to prioy for me, I had to ween myself off. I went from 6 35mg pills a day to three than two then none.. I was SO scared about gaining it back, I continued to watch somewhat of what I ate.. I was a bad girl... but I also worked out like a mad women. Originally I lost 60 pounds in 4 months.. I have always been over weight and did not want to gain anything back becuase I planned on going back tot he clinic. I went back today and only gained 4 pounds but lost 2.5 percent body fat... So i lost inches! I am now back no the pills and more excited than ever! I love being able to know I am going to lose weight and feel awesome about it! These pills worked wonders for me!
Overweight	Isabella, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/14/2009 2:53:40 AM	This drug helped me to lose 50 lbs. When I first took the drug I felt &quot;light-headed&quot; but that symptom ended soon afterwards. It is a stimulant and as a result it greatly decreased my appetitie, and increased my energy. When I stopped taking the drug it had a rebound effect--I got tired and hungry. In addition, when taken for several months it no longer has the same effect.
Overweight	karen2245, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/12/2009 3:46:25 PM	i have been trying to control my weight issues for years.  tried every diet, exercise program, medication,  all together and separtely...anyway this medication worked best for me and was easy to slowly get off of only because it became to costly to go to the nutritionist weekly and my family dr was against this medication.  my blood results were the best they ever have been in years and yet the dr will not write a rx for them and the nutritionist says come backwhen you can afford to see her again.  go figure i find something that helped and because i can not afford 65.0/week for this medication from the nutritionist i can not get to where i need to be..

Overweight	JC1105, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	4/28/2009 3:37:24 PM	I have been on this medication for about one month.  I lost 8lbs so far.  I was prescribed 105 mg divided into 3 pills per day.  For the most part I take 2 pills per day because I end up forgetting at some point during the day.  I don't get jitters or constipation like I did with phentermine (that was initially prescribed to me).  I like that I still eat, I just get full after much less.  With phentermine I was just not eating since I was never hungry. I do cardio exercise 2/per week and eat a low fat diet.  I also try and stay away from bread. I think I would have lost more weight but I have been cheating the last 2 weeks - mostly because I forget to take the 3rd pill.
Overweight	timeforchange, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	4/20/2009 11:47:11 AM	I started this med about 2months now with a low-calorie diet and exercise. I am also a pharmacist. The medication will help you gain the energy necessary to start exercise. But, you body starts to develop tolerance. It has helped me lose 24lbs in 7wks, but the truth is the low-calorie no carb with exercise is really the benefit. It takes years to add on pds so don't look for overnight solutions. You have to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. Don't look to take this medication for more than 3 months. It won't be very effective after that. But, it's cheap so do as you please...

I go to the nutrionist once a week and get weighed in. I am excited to go in 2 more days...I know I have lost a few more lbs. They only thing is I believe I am not eating enough...and do get a little craving here and there, but that's my fault I think. I already have 2 girlfriends going to get these pills as well.

I exercise three days a week for 30 minutes. I also read the sugar busters book and have been eating low sugar meals. I have been feeling much better since taking the medication. I'm not sure if its the Meds, Exercise, or low sugar meals or all three. I feel great. No side effects at all.I never get hungry.

It has made me very depressed and have so much chest pain. I have had all sorts of tests done for my heart and waiting results of an echo. I found that although while taking this medication I lost weight, but it also put me in my own world where I didnt care about anything but the energy I had. This drug made me very impatient and unloving to the ones I love the most in my life. So I stopped and now I am dealing with all these side effects, and gainning all the weight back...and fast!

I also went in for my annual GYN appointment and discovered my blood pressure is on the high end - I've never had high blood pressure. I stopped taking this drug cold turkey. I'm experiencing some headaches and the feeling of rapid heartbeat/tightness in the chest (after a week of stopping). I pray this isn't a permanent side effect from taking this medication.
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/23/2008 7:56:05 PM	I have been on this for only one week and have lost 9 pounds. I did feel a little jittery at first I would say the first day or two ( as I fully expected with any appetite suppressants ) I do definitely  feel the increase in energy and it does work to suppress your appetite. I mean I used to be able to eat just about any amount of food without getting the feeling that I was full or that was enough. Since I started this I have decreased the amount of food that I am eating because I get that &quot;full feeling&quot;. I am still very new with the diet and hope that if this has started out this successful than it will end the same! Good luck to anyone who does make the decision to get on this medication and LOOSE WEIGHT!!

Overweight	lynn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/12/2008 1:04:18 PM	I took this medicine in 2001 and lost about 30 lbs in about four months. I gained a little back (I was to small) and I looked great. In 05 I had gall bladder surgery and I kept gaining weight. I have taken the pills off and on since the first weight loss and have not stuck to them consistently to see the same results. Today 6/12/08 I am going back on for real, and I know its all about diet and exercise. The pill just helps you keep with a 1000-1200 calorie a day diet + energy. The pill does keep u up if u take it late, and I have experienced heart flutters in the past, but it seemed to only be when I was really hungre...(dont know what that was about.) This pill works and I never write reviews. Just eat better and exercise at least 30 min. First time I lost I didnt exercise that much, but the longer your on the meds u have to work harder. The pills don't work as easy as the first time. Hope was helpfull

I was nervous and skeptical.  I weighed in at 212 lbs.  Today Sunday May 25, 2008 I have lost almost 12 lbs.  I take a pill an hour before each meal and so far its never made me jittery which I was afraid of it doing.  Im following my doctors plan  no more than 4grams of Carbs and no more than 2 grams of saturated fats and not to eat anything with ose in the ingredients.  You eat 100 grams of protein a day and I now can have vegetables with my protein.  My doctor also gave me a list of foods that are safe such as cucumbers, lettuce, and sugar free jello to eat which I can eat anytime I want.  Included was a list of fast foods that I can eat from different fast food restaurants.  Im really excited to see what my results will be in a month.  I didnt think this was going to work at first...but now Im a believer.  Of course Ill have to write a review when its time for me to get off the Phendimetrazine.  I also got a B12 shot.  I felt a little warm/ flushed when I received the shot.  I woke up the next morning at 5am and felt great and ready to begin my weight loss program.   If youre considering this method keep a positive outlook and know you can do it!!!

It has been easy to stick to the diet and I have the energy to exercise as well.  I am going to Medizone Clinic weekly and can't tell you what a difference this has made in my life.  I have 20 lbs more to go to reach my ideal weight of 130.  I have done every diet there is and this program is the best.  I am no longer on a diet. This is how I eat and I love it.  The diet is based on the book the Zone.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/24/2008 3:33:58 PM	I have lost almost 50 pounds 5 months (size 18 to a size 4). I fully believe I wouldn't have been this successful without this drug. I NEVER diet because I have no will-power, but this medication allowed me to stick with my diet EVEN THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS! Not only do I feel like it curbed by appetite, I also think it dulls cravings.  Since the drug is so effective at curbing your hunger, you do need to be conscious of your need to eat (at least small amounts) regularly whether you are hungry or not.  My husband &amp; I did this diet together and were instructed by the doctor not to eat unless we were &quot;hungry&quot;. We learned quickly that our bodies tell us we are hungry by more than our stomachs growling.  I've learned that when my brain &quot;stops working&quot; (can't think clearly, easily) I need to eat, regardless of whether I FEEL hungry.  I saw another reviewer describe what they termed &quot;short term memory loss&quot; (losing keys, forgetting things, etc) as a side-effect.  The reveiwer went on to say that doctor said this was not a known side-effect others had experienced. I think the pill was effectively keeping this reviewer from being hungry, but the lack (amount and/or frequency) of food was preventing proper brain function.  If you take the pills, eat regularly and DON'T try to live off protein alone.  This is great for a few days, but you need carbs (unstarchy vegetables are best) to function.

Overweight	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/27/2007 11:26:54 AM	I have tried this drug 3 times and each time it has been effective in losing the weight.  I only had 20 lbs. to lose, and lost 8 - 10 lbs. each time.  If I would have continued it, I would have lost all 20 lbs.  I quit using the drug because I would get short term memory loss.  I asked my doctor if the memory loss was one of the side effects of the drug, and he said it was not.  He said he never had anyone complain of memory loss from this drug!  But each time I have taken it, I do get memory loss or a little &quot;spacey.&quot;  Once I go off the drug, I don't have the memory loss.  It's not major memory loss, just little things, like forgetting where the car keys are; but then I find them.  I hope this info was helpful.  The drug does work with weight loss, though.

You still have to depend on diet and exercise to make a difference; I made the mistake of thinking it was the pills.
