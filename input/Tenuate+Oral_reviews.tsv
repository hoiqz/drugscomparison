Overweight	sharon, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/24/2012 3:12:20 PM	hello. I work at a physician group as a medical assistant. Most of the physicians there do not RX this particular medicine...Tenuate Dospan, although 1 does. the medication does what its suppose to do...takes the urge to compulsively eat away. I no longer was consumed with thoughts of food. Never felt nervous or jittery. I did drink alot of water, that i needed to be doing anyway. Honestly, my body felt great, but never &quot;high&quot; or abnormal. He would RX the med for a 3 month span...then you had to be off of it for a month, then rx another 3 months. There is potential for increase in blood pressure, so monitor yourself. But for me, it definately works. Its an &quot;old&quot; medication thats been around for a long time. Alot of the new, or young Dr's dont seem to want to rx it, but the new stuff out...it has adverse effects also...so...whats the difference. This one does actually work, and its not overly costly. Even if you are self-pay w/ no insurance, a month (1 daily) is generally only around 45.00 or so. Not bad. I think its great. Thanks for listening. I wish you success in your weight loss endevor.you may have more success in getting this RX from an older doctor who has used it for years with many of his life long patients that tend to remain with the same doctor for many years...that could be an alternative to try.

Overweight	jax, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/28/2011 1:22:23 AM	This Rx is very effective. Dry mouth is a given because you lose lots of bloating water in your tissues. I lost 30 lbs &amp; kept it off. This is a dangerous drug and if it's not taken exactly how instructed you can hurt yourself. Do not take more than 4 months max in your LIFE time. I abused it because I was losing so much weight &amp; loved it and now I have pulmonary problems which can never be corrected but it's my fault for taking as directed.Side Effects are severe headaches, de-hydration, difficulty sleeping, hands shaking and a super skinny body!
Overweight	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	8/31/2011 11:05:52 AM	I've only been on this pill for 12 days and have lost 7 lbs. !!  It has really helped to lesson my cravings.  I'm also eating a healthier diet; no sugars and cut my carb intake in half. I do have dry mouth some days which increases my water consumption but that's a good thing. I have bad knees so have not been on a regular exercise program yet. Due to my age my doctor will only allow me to take these for 6 months and after 2 weeks of use I have to start slowly tapering off. It's a good medication that really seems to work.
Overweight	silvercoach, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/24/2011 9:14:45 PM	My doctor prescribes this medication for me when I described my eating behavior to be similar to drug craving and drug seeking behaviors.  The medication has made it easier for me to identify being hungry or just wanting to eat to stuff an emotion.  I have taken it for over 1 year and have lost 25 lbs.  
Overweight	Dallas, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	5/18/2011 8:19:32 AM	I have been taking this med for 2 months and have not noticed any difference. The first month it made me tired and didn't have much energy like some have reported. I haven't lose any weight although I workout everyday for atleast an hour,i have built up muscle but wish to lose weight. I plan to give it another month or so then if no weight lose I will ask my doctor to try something else.
Overweight	HappyCamper, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/23/2011 9:49:35 PM	I have been taking Tenuate 75mg since November 2010, it says do not cut the pills, but I did, I cut them in 4, and started with 1/4 for a week or so, then up to 1/2 for a couple few weeks, and finally up to the whole pill.  I take it very early, the minute I wake up, just before 6am. I have had no problem sleeping, do have the dry mouth, I drink a lot of water, which is good for you anyway. My doctor insists that I see a dietician evey month, plus I see him every month, he does not have refills on the RX, I get a new RX when I come to the monthly appt. My doctor says this is short-term, several months at the most. Also, the drug info that come with the RX at the pharmacy clearly says that nutritional counseling and exercise are to be used with this drug. I am following the dietician's instructions, that with the extra help from the Tenuate got me down 44lbs so far, 25 to go! This drug works great for me, and I have never taken diet pills before, other that OTC Dexatrim once when I was young. I am eating healthy, fresh foods, no sugar, no white flour, no processed foods, junk food at all. I am physically active also, not an exercise fanatic at all, just doing stuff all the time, and have a physical job.

I had gained it back when I tried to stop. Throughout the years I have developed dry mouth, dizziness,headaches,sleeplessness, and heart palpitations. I thought it was stress being a FT working mother of 3. but it wasn't. Now I a having numbness in my left arm and left, it's not a stroke, I have had the MRA MRI, i'm fine, and my heart is good. It's the meds... I am going stop taking it everyday and hopefully stop altogether. I love the pill but the longer you are on, the worst you'll get overall, you'll look good though.
Overweight	helping_out, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	25-34	7/28/2010 6:52:51 PM	I exercise regularly, but have had problems dropping the last 15 lbs I want to loose.  I have been taking tenuate for five days without any side effects other than a slight headache for the first two days, and have already lost 7 lbs.  If you eat healthier and exercise a little, you will be pleased with this medication.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/9/2010 9:36:20 AM	I have been on Tenuate since November 2009 and to date (July 2010) I have lost 80 lbs. The medicine won't do it alone though you HAVE to include diet and excercise.  But I feel great and have about 50 more pounds to go.

Overweight	losing it for good, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/17/2010 5:48:53 PM	I have been taking this medication since the first week of Jan 2010.  I started trying to lose weight on my own in Dec with little to no results.  This medicine is AWESOME.  As of today 3/17/2010, I am down 30 pounds.  I still have about 30 more to go.  I don't really have any side effects from the medicine, other than I have to make myself eat something, even if it is a little something, but sometimes I forget to eat because I am not getting hungry.  I would and have reccommended this for friends and family.
Overweight	Jewls2010, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	3/4/2010 1:25:45 PM	I actually take the generic diethyl. I didn't see too much about this online so I will comment on here. This is my second day and I love this pill. I have been looking for a diet pill I can take that perks me up, but doesn't create a lot of anxiety. It seems that some pills cause me to have anxiety especially uppers. This pill is great it decreases my appetite. I don't crave sugery foods or carbs as much. I still think about food just not as much or have that need to just eat. So far this is a fanstantic drug. The reason I gave it 4 for effective is because it itsn't as strong as phentermine, but I like it 10 times as much as phent. It is very easy to use didn't make me have heart palps or racing heart So I would recommend this product with suffering anxiety victims. Over all I love this pill!!!
Overweight	p, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	1/28/2010 6:39:54 PM	do have irregular heart rate--did before but seems to increase it.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/19/2010 8:33:47 PM	I take one pill every other day or every three days.  I have been taking this medication for about 3 months and have lost 16 lbs. so far.  The only side-effects I have noticed are dry mouth (which really isn't bad, it just makes me drink more water which I need anyway) and difficulty falling asleep.  I usually take Tylenol Pm on the days I take my tenuate and that helps with the insomnia.  On the days that I don't take the medication I have noticed that my appetite is still diminished and I do not have difficulty falling asleep.  Overall I am very pleased with this product!
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/5/2009 8:49:34 PM	Took Tenuate for 3 months, worked great, lost 30 pounds, however when dr took me off, blood pressure went sky-high, headaches, agitation, increased appetite, fast heart rate, think its from withdrawls.
Overweight	gapeach, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	35-44	9/15/2009 4:59:43 PM	I started taking the RX early August, with my first DR visit I had lost 8 pounds and that was with No exercising at all. It has given my energy and it does suppress my appetite alot, if I didnt just eat something throughout the day, I literally would not eat.I have started to exercise more this month, and I can tell a difference in my clothes. This is truly a weight lose miracle.
Overweight	CnJmommy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	9/7/2009 2:56:46 PM	I recently started seeing a local weigh loss Dr here where I live. I am about 85# over weight and have been watching what I eat and maintaining the excess weight I have. I was placed on Tenuate 12mg and was told to only take 1/2 a day. (I suffer from caffein induces migraines) I found that I wasn't hungry through out the day but once 11pm hit I wanted to eat everything in sight. So the Dr. upped my doseage to 75mg but I'm only to take 1/2. With the upper dose I get very sudden hot flashes. To the point that I have to douse myself with cold water. As the medication wears off the cooler I get. I am always tired and feeling drained. So I'm not sure what I think about this medication. I did lose 1# the first week. I am now on my second week but I won't weigh in until friday at the doctors office.

Overweight	mommy2go, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	6/27/2009 12:48:25 PM	Been on this for about a week through the Lindora program. I do exercise 5x a week and drink 80oz water a day w/fiber. Take vitamins multi and potassium and with Lindora B12 injections sometimes a booster of B6. Lindora has me on a high protein low carb diet to lose so far I'm down 26lbs since May 11th.  I wanted to make sure I listed my dietary routine in combination with tenuate, I take this ONLY when I know that I'll be going somewhere or know that I'll be tempted with my favorite foods, &quot;cake, icecream, in n out burger etc..&quot; I take it 30min before dinner and within about 20-30 min I start to notice it to take effect by me talking much more (I'm generally a person of few words) but with tenuate I'm talking about everything and notice the energy kicking in. No fast heart beats or anything which I'm glad, I'm usually afraid of taking any form of pills but this one has been good to me BUT it only last for about 4 hours then I experience a little down time of just wanting to sit and rest. NO trouble sleeping or any of the side effects, not sure if the irritability is due to this or just PMS, but since I know that it can cause irritability I'm especially on guard to try not to be. I'm also careful not to have caffeinated drinks around taking the pill.  Hope this helps someone as other comments have helped me.  Thanks!

I have also found it to be very effective in suppressing my appetite.I have been experiencing headaches but that has been the only negative side effect so far.

Overweight	TexanNIkki, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	4	Female	25-34	2/7/2009 11:59:30 PM	I had gasstric bypass surgery five years ago lost over 150 pounds. Had a chold 3 years ago and gained some weight. I found that I still had an appetite as if I was still pregnant. I started out with Adipex which worked, then my dr switched me to tenuate. Not as strong as Adipex, but somewhat effective., Along with a 1500 calorie diet and exercise its possible to break a plateau. Also it helps to be mentally prepared for the lifestyle change. Adipex gave me energy. Tenuate increased my metabolism. i hope this helps.

Overweight	Kat, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	4/10/2008 11:06:13 PM	This has been a great assistance in gaining my dietary control.  I work out regularly and can stick to a physician's monitored 1100 calorie diet with no problem.  It has given me some lack of sleep, but that has been my only side effect.  I struggled to lose weight with just exercise (up to 4x week) and watching what I ate, but with this I don't have temptation of &quot;off diet&quot; foods. So far I am very happy with taking 3x day.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/25/2008 7:35:28 PM	This medicine is a miracle. It helped me loose 15 pounds with exercise and proper diet.

The most I ever lost and the easiest I ever lost. I stopped for 4 months and didn't gain any weight back. This was a first!I would recommend it to people who can't lose it on their own.Absolutely no health problems with it, a little dry mouth in the beginning, but otherwise felt great.
