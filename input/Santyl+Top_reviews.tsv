Skin Ulcer	gwenmac1234, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	8/29/2012 10:54:01 AM	I had a bone spur removed May 1, 2012 and it turned into a nasty skin ulcer refusing to heal. I ended up with mercer infection. They played around with me and different medications every week. I had a nasty nerve pain reaction. It made me scream and still does. This is Aug/29/12 I still have a hole in the top of my foot and I believe  the painful santyl is making other small ulcers all around my ankle area. If you love pain use Santyl. You will not be able to sleep for more than an hour at a time. You will become angry and mean because the pain is crazy unbearable.
Severe Burn	D.Stegner, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	35-44	9/3/2011 12:06:46 AM	I had an accident and got burnt on my chest and breast. Had skin grafts on all but one wound.  Doctor didn't think it needed it in operating room.  Grafts are doing great one week later but the one wound on breast is BAD.. so he is trying me on Santyl.  SO PAINFUL... but still waiting to see if it works.  Wound is so green and gross, but DR. says it is not infected.  
Skin Ulcer	Pleased, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	3/27/2011 6:47:25 AM	I had a small sore on my lower leg and continued to get  bigger and bigger around the holidaya. I went to my primary care phys. and he kind of dismissed it to slow heal because i have Lupus. So he tested me to see if i was a DIABETE but I was not and sent me home. A hole month later still no healing so i went to emeregency room,they gave me antibotiic that made the entire situation worse because I am on blood thinners for dialysis, I know right...went back to primary dr. he  sent me to a wound specialist,ok first he got the dead skin off and used honey as treatment for week(PAINFUL)THE next week they tried HYDROPHRN BLUE it drys too fast causing more dead tissue to be scraped ,now we back to square one, then we went back to honey a different kind supoose to be better(NOT)it made the ulcer big.AT this point I am very frustrated the dr.finally gave me as prescrib. for Santyl oin. and the HYDROPHRN BLUE together, its been two weeks the santyl is keeping the ulcer clean to the healthy tissue.The ucler does not have to be scraped every week now to remove dead tissue.It burns when u first cleaning but its tolerable.I would say Santyl is a good product for healing ucler it is helping me.

Skin Ulcer	BlondieMom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	7/11/2009 3:31:44 PM	I have a wound on my foot/ankle.  The doctor had an impossible time debriding it using wet-to-dry bandaging (as did I for 2 weeks).  So - Santyl was prescribed.  I put it on twice a day...two days later, all the necrotic tissue is easily scrubbed away.  The healing is FINALLY happening and I'm thrilled.  The only difficulty I had is getting in such a small area and making sure to not touch any of the healthy tissue.  A secure bandage is DEFINITELY required!  ..and be sure to dispose of gauze and other materials that come in contact with it safely especially if you have children/pets.

Since I cannot feel anything I didn't know that I had burned myself. Showed my doctor who sent me to a wound specialist and he prescribed Santyl. Wounds are shrinking and cleaning up from what they were. Great product but expensive even with insurance.

He went to the foot doctor to find out he had a ulser. The doctor cut away the dead tissue around the ulser and prescribed santyl. my husband has been using santyl once a day for 3 weeks it has been a long process but the ulser is going away.i am very satisfied with this medication, if not for santyl he could have lost his foot to the diabetes. for my husband santyl is a &quot;foot saver&quot;
Other	judyjane1, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	4/9/2008 4:36:20 PM	Because I had to ask for this at my second visit to Med Point and neither time did the doctors have any familiarity with Santyl, I only wish they had known more.  Both doctors looked on their computers.  Luckily for me, doctor #1 removed my sutures and prescribed the Santyl.  I returned today as the healing is slow.  Doctor #2 said to just use saline solution and cover the wound.  I am going to do both.  I will use the Santyl at night.  I have confidence that it was doing something.  I just needed to know what was going on.  I fell.  I have a wound.  Now, I know I have an infection.My own doctor will return soon from vacation. Should I have any more to be done, I will see him.
