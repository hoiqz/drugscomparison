Even if I take it at night and have 8+hrs of sleep I still feel drowsy in the morning. It also gives me dry mouth which is ok since I do drink a lot of water during the day but if I'm stuck 1/2 hour without water it does become bothersome. I've also noticed that if I take it for more than 3 days in a row I start getting anxiety so I try to take it 3 days on and 4 days off which isn't very beneficial during high allergy season.

Sneezing	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/20/2009 4:01:01 PM	I love this allergy medication!  I have been on this medication since 2005 for my severe allergies.  I found it the best to combat my severe allergies without making me tired or shakey.  I take it in the morning and I am set for the day.  Works great and I take it year round.

Cold Symptoms	salena, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	12/23/2008 4:02:17 AM	this medicine works great, I have been taken it for sinus problems. It clears congestion almost immediatly! But the first time I took it was before bed, and I didn't sleep a wink. It cause me to have severe dry mouth and rapid heart beat. My advice is to take it first thing in the morning, or you will have insomnia!

I feel very odd and vague after not taking this for a few days. I want to see how I do without it having completed three years of allergy injections.

Seasonal Runny Nose	claritined!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	5/8/2008 2:28:24 PM	I took Claritin D due to severe seasonal allergies. After taking it for the first day I felt nauseous, irritable and had all day mood swings including minor depression pangs. I am never one to suffer from insomnia but the night of the first morning i took it I also couldnt sleep from 3 am till 5 am. I happened to discuss this with a colleague who had also started recently taking it and he also mentioned severe repeated insomnia. The one day I did not take the medicine - as I forgot - my allergies returned but I had not mood swings. Then I got back to taking it and all the symptoms listed about returned!! After discussing this with my colleague I decided to google the side effects of Claritin d and discovered that there are thousands of people out there experiencing similar side effects. I decided to ttash my newly refreshed stock of the 154 pack tablets immediately - even though they cost close to $18 - as I figured the side effetcs were just not worth the allergy relief!
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	Stuffy Nose, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	4/4/2008 12:19:43 PM	This medicine worked great but I experienced the side effects of nausea, and lost my want to eat. So I am switching but if the side effects were not there it would be a great medicine.
