It enables me to have a normal, active life. 
Other	Jess, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	6/24/2012 6:11:55 PM	I was prescribed 200 milligrams twice daily for suspected back problems that radiated down my right leg. Until I was prescribed this medication, Sodium Naproxen wouldn't relieve the severe pain and I was basically incapacitated. I'm able to function, instead of being bed ridden due to my inability to walk.

Dr. attempted to switch to Mobic because of digestive upset with the Clinoril. Pain returned while taking Mobic which made physical therapy difficult. I am now, happily, back on the Clinoril and just accept the digestive problems.

I have DeQuervains Tendinitus and have to have surgery.  I just wish they would stop messing around with my medications like a guinea pig.  I know the Norco took the pain away...They probably thought I might get addicted, but was originally told to stay ahead of the pain and took the medication as directed.  I dunno.  I hate Kaiser!

So far it works well; better than others I've tried. Great for sore muscles and joints. Hope I don't develop stomach problems in the future, though.
