Major Depressive Disorder	gigantor, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/17/2012 10:50:52 AM	Emsam helps my depression more than anything I've tried. The ease of use is excellent. I have fibromyalgia and this might also be helping my pain, fatigue, and libido since I've noticed improvement with all. At first I craved sweets but don't now. I have mild irritation at the patch site. I wake up at least once at night to urinate (where I didn't before) and I also want a snack at that time, too. Even with night eating, I think I'm losing weight on this medication. Expensive w/out insurance: $700 p/mo.My one concern is that I am definitely losing my hair on this. I will see my psychiatrist next week for a one month follow up and if the hair loss is easily remedied, I'll stick with it.

I have to wash &amp; dry the area completely before applying the patch EVERY DAY! Sometimes some things make me pretty sad=I have found that to be normal, and it doesn't last either. I am grateful for how I now feel. I have found that I cannot do ANY FORM OF SUGAR, or I am buzzed and do not want to go to bed! This has been the most difficult for me cuz I crave sweets all the time...Sometimes I just end up staying up more than I wanted to...But once in bed, I am out like a light! I wish we could respond individually to others on this site... I eat bananas all the time in my oatmeal. I use 9mg patch. It is AGED cheese that we can't have. ALCOHOL is a depressant! Please do your homework! Coffee is a stimulant, I found a substitute I like, I had to cuz I am on Adderall for ADHD. From my personal experience:I will never go to a regular MD with our kind of illness=they just don't know how to diagnose, nor can they prescribe correct medication.I was on EffexorXR from a MD. Totally wrong medication for me that was causing more depression! Worst withdrawal ever in my life!  Being honest with myself and my doctor has always been the best way to go. And, I have found that if I plan my outfit for the day the night before, then I can apply my patch accordingly! Yes it is expensive, and I am so grateful for insurance,(vote O'Bama) but my happiness is priceless !!

My depression was very hard to treat and after trying almost every medication combination available EMSAM was the only medication that worked.

Emsam 9mg/24 hour patch turned my life into a satisfying, successful, productive, &quot;normal&quot; one. The dietary restrictions pose no problem for me. I do ger dizzy and sometimes skin irritation at the patch site. Small issues for all I've gained. After using it for, I think, just under six years, I am having difficulty with achieving orgasms. This is new and I don't know if is due to the drug or something else.
Other	kitsune, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	3/4/2012 1:18:12 AM	DX: Bipolar I, PTSD, anxiety. i've tried almost all of the major SSRIs and a few SNRIs to combat debilitating Bipolar Depression. i was on Lexapro for ~10 years and it slowly stopped working. after three years of cyclic suicidal depression and winter agoraphobia, i requested ECT. i requested ECT again and again but the doctor wanted to keep trying medication. i did some research and suggest i try an MAOI. i began EMSAM 6mg/24hr and it got me out of bed in about three days. six months later i'm on EMSAM 9mg/24hr + Lamictal 100mg + clonazepam PRN, and doing very very well despite it being the dead of winter in New England. i have very few side effects usually associated with SSRI's. EMSAM appears to be weight neutral, no sexual side effects (some from Lamictal, however), very sharp memory and brain function (absolutely NO brain Fog that i've noticed), increased energy and decreased isolation, increased range of emotion (the Flat feeling from SSRI's not nearly noticeable). dehydration / need for increased water intake is readily noticeable, especially when combined with Lamictal. food restrictions are not difficult to adhere to.. i am a vegetarian and eat/drink soy products, noticed no issues. some foods that i Cheat (have just a little.. like Soy Sauce or canned soups) give me immediate headaches and mild blood pressure rise (although i take propranolol to prevent migraines so the side effect controllable), caffeine caused increased dehydration, nicotine lozenge caused heart palpitations, taken too close to bedtime causes mild insomnia. out of every antidepressant i've taken (approx 10-15? over 18 years), EMSAM has the least side effects and most effective, without impairing cognitive abilities (memory, Fog) or causing anxiety/panic attacks or major emotional stunting/numbing.

Major Depressive Disorder	Cindy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	7/20/2011 7:20:26 PM	Shrink told me to do research on emsam patch. SO I called my pharmacist and she told me it would interact with Cymbalta, which I am taking, Dr knows that and I can't get off Cymbalta. Second there are diet restiction. No cheese, bananna, avocada, wine, beer and no coffee. Pharmacist said she was surprised Dr did't tell me the Cymbalta interaction or the diet restrictions..SO can't use Ensam. gosh knows how many other diet restrctons there are. Now at a deadend to treat my debitating depressaion. THere is no hope. OH, and buspar can interact w/ Emsam. I was taking Zoloft whch was my wonder drug, until I came in for refills, DR asked how are you today. I said AH,&quot;kinda depressed. THen she bulled me into taking Proac, a drug I knew I could not take..My life has been ruined because her, original Dr. I got the procac and flused it down the tolet, was so relieved as I had safed myself from dister, and completely forget that I would run out of Zoloft. SHe did such a number on my head, and this is why I am in the condition I am now. I told Dr,NO, don't want prozac, afraid of it. WILL make my head to crazy, had tried it before. She was not listening and immediatly ambush me, PRozac,this...By the time she was done w/me I could thnk straight, was speechles, Stunned. I hate this Dr, till the end of my life..Celexa headaches, Lexapro anxiety,Zoloft would not work after Prozac, anxiety, then killer headaches. NOT gettng ECT.Why did I ever pick up that 2nd perscript for Prazac..why dd I not flush it down the toilet.. Cause I ran out of Zolft get depressed, Dang Dr. was still in my head. My thinking was not right.
Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/24/2011 11:03:01 PM	My depression has dissapeared completely.  I feel like my &quot;old self&quot; again with a positive outlook, more energy and very few negative thoughts.  My side effects are:  chills, dry mouth, some trouble falling and staying asleep and irregular heartbeat which I have a history of.
Other	DMbew, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	2	Female	35-44	4/8/2011 12:23:23 AM	I had the oddest experience with Emsam that I have not seen documented elsewhere on the web, so I wanted to put it out there- about a week after starting (first at 1/4 of a 6mg patch, then at 1/2 and finally at 3/4 of a 6mg patch), my thumbs started to hurt so badly. I could hardly hold the steering wheel of my car, move my laptop around, text on my phone.  I thought I had strained them in yoga or something, but the pain just got worse.  Finally, the sleep side effects of the Emsam really started to kick in and I'd wake to find that I was clutching all the fingers of my hands down over my thumbs and nearly pulling them out of socket.  Think &quot;teeth grinding&quot; but with hands/fingers. (I do also wear an occlusal guard for teeth grinding that I've had for years.)I also started waking up with hot sweats, really &quot;shallow&quot; sleep that would slip directly into and out of unsettling dreams and wasn't very restful, and what kind of felt like a heady/spacey and maybe even heart-palpitating feeling during the day. Combined with the drug not seeming to help my depression at all, I guess I am looking for a new drug. One that doesn't make my thumbs ache.I know not every drug works for every person, but my experiences with Emsam seemed a little undocumented, so I thought I'd share.

I find that the drug makes me feel, not artificially not-depressed, but normal. I have a full range of emotions, not the muted feeling i got from some SSRIs. At first there was slight tremors, a bit trouble sleeping and weight loss.  It felt like I'd drunk too much coffee. But those symptoms faded after about 2 weeks. I think there is a bit of an effect on my sex drive.  Nothing too terrible, but I notice I am a bit slower to respond. Also, i notice that it magnifies the affects of alcohol.  I feel drunk very quickly, but also become sober quickly.  I find this discourages over-indulging. Overall, I am extremely pleased with Emsam which allows me to function and enjoy life.  
Major Depressive Disorder	Denise, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	3/5/2011 9:01:39 AM	I put my first patch on today.

Of course, I will check back within a couple of weeks to let you all know how my satisfaction with the drug is going.

I started on the 3 mg. and was increased from 3 to 6 to 9 to 12. I have had an allergic reaction to the adhesive on the patch. It leaves red blotches that itch, all over my chest. I have reported this to the manufacturer and they say they have had similar complaints. Can anything be done?
Major Depressive Disorder	Sunshine, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	9/25/2010 4:48:33 PM	I suffer from Recurrent Severe Major Depression/ Anxiety. It really didn't start in until I was pregnant w/ my second child. I feel Blessed to have been assigned the Phychiatrist that I have. He tried a list of SSRI's that did nothing, or only worked temporarily. I was to the point where I had ECT, which helped tremendously, until I hit a peak. I have been on the 6mg and 9mg. 9mg works like a charm. The only side effect is that it causes insomnia, but I would rather not sleep than feel like I need to be in the Hospital. The only other problem I've noticed is, sometimes it starts peeling off around the edges, does anyone else have this problem? Also, just wanted to give my Phychiatrist a Big Thank You for getting me through all of this! I don't know at age 24 where I would be w/o everything he's done!

Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	7/30/2010 2:15:35 PM	Did not alleviate my depression/anxiety, and actually made it worse because I wasn't sleeping (or had very fitful/restless sleep), wasn't eating, and was twitchy and anxious.  Best spot to put the patch was on hip - less allergic reaction.  Too expensive with my insurance to keep taking anyhow (6 mg/24 h patch).  MAOIs in laboratory settings helped with HSV infections - this helped (Zoloft made me break out every 2-3 wks due to slight immunosuppression) but I have to find something else besides Emsam that will help my mental state and my bank account.
Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/13/2010 9:16:27 PM	I have had a positive experience with this drug. Although others have also helped, this one is much easier and more effective for me. Another reason is because of other medical issues. I have several other meds to take daily and this makes it so I have less pills to swallow every day which is a very big positive for me.

Major Depressive Disorder	todd, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	45-54	12/8/2009 12:56:02 PM	I suffer from bipolar and &quot;regular&quot; depression.  I've been on Emsam 6mg for 3 months. Emsam seems to have had some positive effect on the depression part, but does nothing to help mania or outbursts. Also have gained 20 lbs in 2 months! despite exercising religiously and dieting. Since it's an MAOI, I can't really take anything for mania except Lithium 300 mg 2x daily, and that's never worked.  My doctor wants to increase to 9mg.  So far, needless to say, it's been a waste of $100/mo (w/insurance-w/o = $500!!) which is not in my budget. I was on conventional anti-dprnsnts for over 10 years did not work at all. I am NOT going to do SCT! THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY TO LIVE.  if you'd like to chat, my emial is &quot;todd0524@netscape.net&quot;. RIght now, I'm mainly freaking out about the weight gain EnSAM has caused and the ridicculous cost.  If I go back to standard AD meds, doc will prescribe Abilify which is also expensive, about $100 month.

Major Depressive Disorder	SalvageGirl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	3	Female	55-64	8/12/2009 4:21:00 PM	When I first began this drug, I thought I found a miracle cure.  The first month &amp; 1/2 I had not felt so relaxed, steady, clear thinking, back to my old self in I do not know how long.  Then I began to hallucinate.  Every where I went I saw little filthy dirty naked babies crawling around.  Across the road, down isles in grocery and department stores, on the alter at church, in the dump.The pharmacist seemed concerned when I was first prescribed Emsam.  He had asked to report to him if I had any problems.  I think he felf I would have a problem with the mix of the other drugs I was on.  I not only suffer from depression on the norm (in my early life I was able to keep it in check without drugs) but I have a disease that causes depression, the cure for the disease causes suicidal depression.  I have gone into treatment 2x for it but to no avail. On a daily basis I take 12-13 other prescriptions so that may have had something to do with my problem with the Emsam.Truly I was so very disappointed that I could no longer take it.  As I related in the beginning Emsam was the best thing that happen to/for me in years.  The drugs I am on now and before Emsam they keep me functioning but with no real love or passion of life.  And with no desire to socialize.  No real desire to get up in the morning.  Life just seems to be passing me by.

I like not having to take one-more  pill and the fact you put it on right away in the morning.  Currently, my blood pressure &amp; pulse rate is very near the normal levels. To keep skin irratation at bay, you do need to switch the sites you apply it to daily.  The only thing I hate is when I apply it to my shoulder and later I want to wear a sleeveless shirt. When others have noticed my patch, reactions have been null.  Combined with another depression medication I have done very well on this regimen.  Being on other non-depression medication I fine it is hard to tell which side effects are caused directly by this drug.
Major Depressive Disorder	Cindy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	45-54	7/7/2009 5:21:27 PM	I have now been on Emsam patches for about 1 1/2 years. In a previous post, I commented that I was doing well with Emsam. Now my sleep is erratic and my mood is depressed as it used to be. I am now on 12 Mg. patches which I went on because the 9 Mg. seemed to stop being effective. My psychiatrist is at a loss for what to do and things seem hopeless.
Other	Hope, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	45-54	4/10/2009 12:19:08 AM	After suffering from depression for over 17 years, and trying so many different meds/combos I can't remember them all, Emsam has been the 2nd most effective drug. The most effective was Prozac for the first nine years, but after it pooped out, Emsam has been the next best. I've been on it about two years and sadly it's effectiveness is diminishing. Being hopeless about ever being fairly-well again I even had ECT last fall--another treatment that lasted for a only a couple of months-- but that is another story. Last year I was finally and accurately diagnosed with bipolar I. I haven't had any side effects with the patch, but it is not easy to use. Peeling off the backing and sticking it on your skin without any edges folding under takes time. Also the darn things will not stick if the area is not really clean and dry. I would clean the area with alcohol first. If you get it on good, it will stay during a shower and even swimming. They only stick well on my arms, so sometimes nosey/rude people ask what they are. I would say, &quot;It's a smoking patch,&quot; and they would reply that they'd never seen one like that. So I started saying it was birth control which shut them up. But I guess that one won't work for the guys! It's also VERY EXPENSIVE. I had to pay for it one month because of my deductible--$600. I  hope Emsam or something else will work for you. This disease is so draining--finances, work (I'm disabled), friendships, just living hour to hour. Wishing you or your loved ones the best of luck. Don't give up!

Other	Deneen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/16/2009 10:53:24 PM	I had insomnia so my doctor thought it might be because I was depressed.  He  prescribed Lexapro which upset my stomach, so I stopped it.  He then suggested I use the Emsam patch which would cause no side effects other than some itching where the patch was.  That sounded great so I had the prescription filled and started using it that night (it's expensive even with insurance).  He was right, it caused some itching which was no problem.  After a week or two, I started having ringing in my ears.  Since my doctor hadn't mentioned that side effect, and it was listed no where in the literature that came from the drug store or in the box, I thought the ringing must be caused by something else so I continued using the patch for another 2 weeks.  BIG MISTAKE.  I finally looked on WebMD and found that ringing in the ears is a rare, BUT SEVERE, side effect.  It was a weekend and my doctor wasn't in so I talked to the druggest.  He said if it were him, he would stop it if it otherwise wasn't helping me feel better.  So I stopped it.  That was about 2 months ago and I still have ringing in my ears so I'm assuming it's permanent.  I don't understand why drug companies are not required to disclose ALL the possible side effects, and especially the side effects that can do long-term damage.  I would recommend anyone contemplating using this medication to check all the side effects, not just the ones listed in the literature that comes with it.  I sure wish I had.

Doctor says we will raise it up to 9mg after one month on 6mg.  I've been on every type of med. for 25 years and dissapointed that I still struggle to even stay alive.  Dr. says we should try ECT next if 9mg does not work.  Skin rash is not bad and does not pose a big problem with using the medicine.

They say you shouldnt cut the patch but i have to in order to find just the right dose for me &amp; it seems to be ok. I go through bouts of insomnia, constipation, slight confusion or anxiety, &amp; trouble remembering things. but these are tolerable compared to what i've had to deal with in the last 15 years. I switch the patch back and forth from right upper thigh to left upper thigh, it helps to stick if you hold your palm over it for about 30 seconds, the heat &amp; pressure makes it stay on longer. I get very minor skin irritation but if i did i doubt it would stop me from taking it. Most antidepressants will give you side effects, but for me Emsam has positives that outweigh the negatives. :)

I have been using them for about 1 1/2 yrs.  I have tried every kind of tape to keep them on and the only tape that I have used is silver duck tape.lol I saw where one person in their experience with Esman was to cut them in half. The druggist said that was bad as there may be more medicine come out at once and that wouldn't be good.  I tried not using them for 1 week and my depression was very bad.  Can't take any oral meds. as I have a very nervous stomach and it actually cooks my stomach, even a coated baby asperin hurts.

Depression was mild to start with, but not feeling like I want to cry all the time.  More energy.  Side effects so far: weight loss, major headaches (Excedrin usually takes care of that), increased heart rate, some restlessness, some dizziness. This is my first MAOI.  Lexapro worked but made me apathetic. Wellbutrin caused hives, mania, suicidal thoughts, loss of appetite, etc.  Emsam is very expensive without insurance!

Major Depressive Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	4/24/2008 6:59:26 PM	I have had major depression all my life, and been on every drug. EMSAM has alleviated a great deal of the depression--and that is truly amazing. My energy level is way up from previously. I responded very quickly to 6mg. I have not had any skin irritation at the patch site. I alternate arms each day. I have also lost weight!I'm pleased that I don't have to be too concerned about the dietary restriction at 6mg.I have however developed trouble sleeping and started taking Ambien. The worst problem is a terrible restlessness that even yoga, exercise and meditation won't relieve. I even have stress rashes on the backs of my hands. I'm hoping to be able to manage this because the anti-depressive response has been so remarkable--when so little else has helped.

No problems with skin irritation or any other side effects except some night sweats. Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance does cover the cost minus the co-pay, but with the mail order option, I only have to pay one co-pay every three months ($100). I am extremely satisfied with Emsam.

I've been down the whole list.  One side effect has been an allergic reaction at the point of application.  Local itching and redness under the patch and if left for the prescribed 24 hour period - blistering and skin seperation. I need the medication so I do the following.  I move the patch to a new location - tape it down with paper tape - every six hours and then only use it twelve hours a day.  Selegiline has a half life of three hours so I'm able to sleep eight of the twelve hours I'm not useing the patch.  A patch will last me two days. Even then I have minor skin damage that takes several weeks to heal.  But I have lots of skin area and just keep moving it around then I can come back and reuse a previously used area.  The Emsam/Selegiline medication has saved my life.I would like to hear from others that might have experienced the same reaction.

Emsam flipped me to the manic side in a bad way.  I wasn't sleeping, even with sleep aids.  I developed a lot of anxiety, a tremor in my hands, and it dangerously increased my heart rate.  I don't feel it was appropriate for my diagnosis.

Major Depressive Disorder	 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	5	4			1/1/2008 11:29:44 PM	Best medication of the 10 antidepressants i've tried for Treatment Resistant Depression - fewest side effects by FAR. In fact, insomnia's the only real side effect I've experienced (nothing compared to most of them out there!).

I do not want to screen all the food and medicine interactions involved with the higher dose. The patch does leave a red mark from the adhesion used, sometimes itches.

I do have some trouble sleeping. I find the least painful place to remove the patch from is the hip area.
Major Depressive Disorder	Cindy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	11/28/2007 6:37:53 PM	  Initially I started on the 6mg. patch, raised to 9mg. after 1 month. I showed improvement after 2nd month. Some side effects are swelling in hands, slight rashs, tingling in feet and buzzing in head, some ringing in ears. Depression was severe and now mood has improved significantly. Hopefully, I will not experience any urinary retention like I have with Nardil after a six month period forcing me to discontinue that MAOI.My psychiatrist is going to try alternating between a 6mg. &amp; a 9mg. patch on a every other day basis. My fingers are crossed that it may lessen these side effects and I will be able to stay on this medication for a long time.
Major Depressive Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	11/25/2007 9:17:14 AM	It makes me feel &quot;drugged.&quot;   I take the patch off at night because it makes me restless and I get nightmares.  It makes me a bit more forgetful than SSRIs. Skin feels itchy &amp; crawly. No insurance - $479!! Better than nothing , but not sure it's worth the cost.
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	35-44	11/8/2007 2:13:01 PM	Started 6mg went to 9. Still waiting for it to work. Helps anxiety. Depression still exists. Sticks best to upper thigh. I would like to see it work better/faster for depression.

The skin is damaged to the point of bleending. It taked two weeks for the spot to heal even with treatment with a rash cream..I run out of placed to apply it. It is very costly $438.00 for 30 day supply. Insurance not covering it at this time.The medication is an old medicine but Drug Company is taking advantage it being a patch. I question its value (treatment  vs cost)There has to be a better way.

On the higher dose I had a strange physical reaction that was very irritating. It was like an extreme restlessness.

They also dont stay on very well.   I feel like I could bust out crying, but really never do.  Just not feeling very happy on this drug.  This is my second month on it,  about my 6th week.  I will give it another month and see if I feel better.  I went on it because prozac kills your sex drive,  this drug does not,  thats the upside.
