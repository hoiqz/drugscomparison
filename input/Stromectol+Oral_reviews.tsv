Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	1/16/2012 2:23:36 PM	I ended up getting mites (mange) from a puppy I bought from a breeder.  The dog mites cannot live on humans, but as long as your dog has them, they can affect you, and they did.  I was prescribed this drug, and I took the first dose and broke out in hives.  Since the drug lasts for days, I had hives for several days.  I didn't take the second dose.  However, now, when I go out in the sun, I break out in hives.  I never had this problem before.  If I wear sunscreen, I don't break out.  The Stromectol is the only medicine I've taken except I regularly take birth control, but have been on the same birth control brand for many years, and as I said, this only started happening last year after I took the Stromectol.  Has anyone else had a reaction like this?  I have an appointment with a dermatologist in a couple months (that was as early as they could take me).  The hives only appear on areas not regularly exposed to the sun, like my face and forearms do not get hives, but my shoulders, upper arms, neck, legs, back, and stomach will.  Please help!

After numerous applications of elimite cream that was never successful.  I was given Stromectol for treatment.  Almost on the verge of loosing my mind, thank goodness this option exists for the treatment.  No side effects and so far after the first dose awaiting the second (after 10 days) I have had my skin clearer and less itchy.  I still feel things crawling around under my skin but I can tolerate it.

I was still itching after a few applied lotions1%. I had to beg my dr. to given Stromectol to me. I am on my second dose.I hope it works cause my dr. refuses to give me any oral meds for this. She only prescribes 1% lice treatment lotions to treat scabies.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/11/2011 10:42:14 PM	I took this medication after five rounds of permethrin cream each 7 days apart. The cream did not work because if you missed a single small part on your body the treatment failed. I was prescribed 5 3mg tablets of stromectol taken on an empty stomach before bed, then repeat in 5 days. I had to beg my doctor for this treatment. Its now been one week since the second dose and almost all itching is gone and I can sleep again. It took three months and 3 different doctors to come up with the diagnosis of scabies. This should have been a first line treatment. After about 5 months I finally got relief thanks to stromectol.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	3/8/2011 10:27:49 PM	I took this medication four days ago, after two rounds of cream traeatments two weeks apart.  After the cream treatments, I had about a week of relief, then the itching/sores returned worse than before the treatment.  I had to ask my doctor about this oral medication.  He said that I would only take it once, then he would send me to a dermatologist if not better.  So far, so good...much better than before.  Today, I seem to have a HORRIBLE bitter, metallic (almost chemical) taste in my mouth.  My saliva seems to taste almost like poison at times.  Has amyone else experience anything like this when tbey have taken it?

Intestinal Infection caused by the Roundworm Strongyloides	DP, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	10/21/2010 10:22:04 AM	I have been diagnosed with lymphatic filariasis which is uncommon in the US.  I recently completed 30 days of 3mg X 2 daily regimen.  It has caused itching and pain but after treatment, there is significant relief. I have had to be retreated with Stomectol over the past two years.  My doctors have informed me that I will have to have  bi-annual dosages which is in accordance with the CDC guidelines.   
Intestinal Infection caused by the Roundworm Strongyloides	JJ, 55-64 (Patient) 	4	5	4		55-64	10/15/2010 8:19:15 AM	After full blown lesions, and almost dying in 2008, both Albenza and Ivermectin along with eight week intervals of doxycycline have saved my life.  Elephantiasis is not something you see in the Americas so the journey has been difficult.  Just completed 3mg X 2 for one month w/o adverse affects on Strombectol. Toxicity is relatively low and reduces parasite load in the skin, and also systemically. My case is rare and the parasite is in my heart and lungs causing severe pain.  Eight months of interval treatment with antibiotics, and Strombectol, have saved my life. Blood pressure was high during the die off but has returned to normal at present. However, the current doctor wants to send me to the University of Louisville (a microbiologist within) and doesn't want to continue my Strombectol medication and Doxycycline.  Both doctors I've seen in two states, KY and FL are from India and Grenada. They are trained to deal with neglected tropical diseases according to WHO guidelines and the CDC.  Recommend to those suffering with parasitic infections to seek doctors knowledgeable in field.  Stombectol causes pain on parasites that die in your body and should be monitored by a physician.  Strombectol is not totally effective in severe cases like mine but helps in reducing parasite load with long term intermittent therapy. Sub-clinical destruction of the lymphatic system is causing disease progression. Strombectol has slowed this process down.

Pain in stomach, legs back couldent walk as time progressed. Almost was paralized, possible from fecal material from parasites entering my bloodstream.

Side effects first week: Joint and muscle pain. Stomach pain, dizzyness, sleeply, then within second week RELIEF!!!!!!! Going back for another check up. Dr. also prescribed Creme for breakout.I am now cleansing with Dr. Natura Colon Cleanse. Love my Dermatoligist!!! Saved my life as i felt like i was going to die soon.  Feel great today!

Other	cpadg10280, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/6/2009 9:15:43 PM	I used the first line of treatment, Permethrin cream,  3 times with no relief. I asked my doctor for Ivermectin(Stromectol). My dosage was six 3mg tablets, taken on empty stomach. I took at bedtime. No side effects. Took second half of dose (six 3mg tablets) one week later.In about 2-3 weeks I was not getting new breakouts and some of the older ones were clearing up. Itching still, but mostly at night. It does not wake me up itching like in the beginning.  I think this should be the first line of treatment. I wasted a lot of money on doctors and medications before I got this and I had to beg my doc to give it to me.  I now have a dose on hand in case I ever get this again.

Doctor noted symptoms and signs and prescribed this medication.  Immediate relief, but did require a second dose 1-week later.  The relief from itching was worth it.  Wish I had known sooner.
