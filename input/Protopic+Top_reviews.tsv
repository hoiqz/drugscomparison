Other	Bob, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	9/9/2012 6:50:02 PM	I had some chaffing on my genitals due to a reaction to a lubricant.  My doctor prescribed Protopic and game me a sample.  I was driving between cities and 1 hour after application it was starting to burn and itch.  I stopped at a gas station and wiped it off with soapy water, but for the next 90 minutes, before I could get home to shower, it was the worst itch I'd ever had and in the most sensitive area on my body.I gave it another try two weeks later thinking I had been too raw, but it happened again and I jumped in the shower.  I will NEVER use this stuff on my body again.
Other	obie2422, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	6/17/2012 9:09:00 AM	I have had Psoriasis in my groin for over 15 years. At first it was treated as a fungal infection with no benefit. Then went to a skin Doctor who with out hesitation said Psoriasis. Prescribed Protopic 0.1% ointment. Relief came within a few days. Dr. suggested trying it for 2-3 weeks daily to see if we could eliminate it for good, this didn't work. I still need to use this every 2-3 weeks for 2-3 days in a row. I have been doing this now for 12-13 years with no side effects. The burning  and swelling go down within 3-4 hours of application. This has been a very good product for me.

I use it maybe once a week where skin erupts.  I find it very effective with only 2-3 applications to &quot;trouble spots.&quot;
Atopic Dermatitis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	3/4/2011 8:27:00 PM	I have had severe atopic dermatitis for many years. I have visited many dermatologists and they gave me hydrocortisone creams which barely help temporarily. Finally went to a allergist specialist and she took the initiative to fix the problem. I am currently taking a very high doseage prednesone, hydroxyine, and putting the Protopic on affected areas. Unfortunately the ''affected areas'' are my entire body and the bottle of protobic ointment is gone after two days. I do not understand how they can recommend me to use the ointment twice a day when it covers my entire body because I already need my last refill, and at $300 a bottle it is ridiculous.. The protopic does work for my flare ups and I'd say 80% of my body has healed almost completely. Unfortuneately I do know that with ointments like this the flare ups will come back with a vengeance, but it such an amazing feeling to have this relief and to actually see my skin cleared after such a painful and mentally draining condition that this is. I will continue to see the doctor and maybe the prednesone will help, or something else will in the long run. Thank you Protopic for my relief! Best ointment I have tried in years.
Other	McMike, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	11/9/2010 9:00:58 PM	I have had alopecia areata for the last two years which has been treated with monthly corticosteriod injections.  I started using Protopic approximately 2 months ago as a supplement to the injections.  Within 2 weeks I started seeing an improvement in my hair regrowth and will definitely continue trying this product.

I have recurring rosacea on one of my cheeks and I am using Protopic on that; however, I used it this morning, and the redness still has not gone down. I would NOT recommend this waste of money!

Other	Matt, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	9/8/2010 5:58:41 PM	I was perscribed this about 3 months ago for Vitaligo, my skin had started to loose its colour in blotches a few years back and gradually got worse until the point it had covered all my fingers and was going up my hands, patches around my mouth, elbows, feet and the odd bit here or there... I went to the docs as it was starting to really bother me, as i tan really easy yet these parts remain a pale white. Ive started to use protopic, and have photographed results, and it actually seems to be working, the colour is starting to blotch back out, admitedly its still there after 3-4 months use but it is noticably better. I will continue to use it. I dont seem to have any side effects, i hope i see more positive results, even if it will take months.. Im going on holiday next month soon, so we will see how it stands up against a bit of sun tanning the area, but i dont think i will use it in direct sun light.
Atopic Dermatitis	going crazy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	7/21/2010 6:20:39 PM	Worse medication I have ever used.  Doctor gave me samples of this for dermatitis and told me to use it on my eyebrows, eyelids,around my nose, upper lip and a thin layer on the lips. Didn't put two and two together until after 4 days of use that the dry mouth, nose, burning face, lips, plus swelling of my bottom lip use due to the medication. Never again will this be used by me and now I have to reap the consequences of these side effects because I cannot take allergy medications or cortisone.  I am drinking as much water as possible to wash it out of my system and praying that my thoart does not close up.

My eczema wouldn't go away after many treatment rounds with other medicines. This has been the only thing that has worked for me. The only down part is that it really doesn't absorb into the skin quickly leaving the ointment to leave residue on many things.

I followed the instructions and ended up screaming my head off because of the burning that it caused. It did work for a total of two days then my eczema spread everywhere from head to toe. It made everything worse instead of helping me with my issue.

Protopic by FAR works the best and the fastest. Within a couple of days no itching or redness or flaking. Also works well on my four year old son who has the same thing.
Atopic Dermatitis	LIPS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/17/2009 9:36:33 PM	I started to get very chapped lips that would not go away. The chapped lips turn into to swollen,burning,blistering,peeling,bright red painful lips. I was apparently allergic to some food that I was unaware of. At first I thought it was nothing and would go away which it did but came back in full force. I had to see a doc for this. My lips looked disgusting and were very painful and I had not a clue to what I was eating to cause this. My doctor had me try Protopic and gave me an inj of celestone. I was 70% better within 24 hrs or less.! By the third day - my lips looked actually normal. The swelling went down immediately and blisters and peeling as well. I read the cancer dangers involved with this drug and I was very concerned with that but I won't be using this for more than 2 weeks so I should be safe. Just to let anyone know that it worked like a dream for me and I am so thankful that my lips are back to normal.

During my last pregnancy I became hyper sensitive to almost anything (even water) that touched my skin and nothing worked at all.  The condition got so bad that I could not open my hands or fingers and they were covered with deep lesions. My doctor had prescribed 7 types of creams and cortisone treatments - finally I INSISTED I see a specialist who prescribed Aerius along with a mild cortisone (used evening ONLY on clean dry skin) and Protopic. i was leery as the side affects noted types of cancer being reported, but I was in sooo much pain. The next day the fissures and lesions that had created scars on my hands were closed and were beginning to heal. Day 2 the skin started to regain pigmentation, OMG it works!!!! I tried everything, and was in tears whenever I went to the doctor about this as a mother of 2 young boys I could not even hardly pick them up without cracking my hands open - if you need less than a pea sized amount and its gone in 2 days and you don't need it for months - isn't it worth having clear skin without pain and risk of infections????

Other	ehcapakori, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	10/1/2008 1:53:25 AM	after 22 different treatments failed, Protopic was prescribed as a last resort.  Burned like my skin was literally on fire, which was the condition I was trying to treat in the first place (extreme vag. itch/burn for 16 months IN A ROW!!) Eventually diagnosed as being an allergic reaction to something either injested or externally. Protopic could not be washed off &amp; the firey burning lasted for 3 days afterward. Possibly I may be allergic to this drug (?) It was extremely severe-I did not leave the house for days after using this product.
Atopic Dermatitis	Andy Chew, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	19-24	9/30/2008 10:35:52 PM	I have atopic dermatitis since 7 years ago.Initially, it had been wrongly diagnosed as neurodermatitis,and I was using many types of steroid medine for the fisrt 4 years until their curing effects became less and less.After a two year break, I start to use protopic from December 2007 ntil now,October 2008 as I was diagnosed to have atopic dermatitis at the end of last year .I apply this ointment only when the symptome appears and try to apply protopic only on the affected skin(the whole neck including the upper chest and back part connecting to the neck, though it would inevitably cover some part of the surrounding healthy skin) I apply to those area once daily and ususally for 6 consecutive days at night before sleep.Severe side effects such as serious itch and burning feeling of the applied area always occurs at the 1st,2nd,3rd day of use and will disappear from the fourth day with the improvement of the dermatitis symptom.I have to take medicine like Centrizine to relieve these side effects for the first 2 days.I try to minimise the use of the drug by reducing the usage time to once a day and repeat this 6-day cycle every 10~14days knowing the medicine is probably linked to cancers.So far I have finished using 5 tubes of 10g(0.1%) in a year time. The medicine is effective in relieving the AD symptom but I am also worried about the side effects including burning/itchy feeeling,links to cancer and depression(in my case),esp. after reading many articles regaring the links of this drug to cancers.I've decided to discontinue the drug when I finish this 1-year treatment and to go for a thorough medical checkup to see whether I am at a higher risk to get cancers afterall, though I know there may be no better treatment for my skin condition yet.
