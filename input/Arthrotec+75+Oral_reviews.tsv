Osteoarthritis with High Risk of Developing Ulcers	PAIN@102, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	8/1/2012 3:46:05 PM	I RECENTLY STARTED ARTHROTEC 75 FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS, DUE TO HAVING A VERY HARD TIME WALKING. I STARTED TAKING ARTHROTEC AFTER JUST EATING A FEW BITES IN MORNING (NOT A BRKFAST FAN) AND EXPERIENCED SEVERE STOMACH PAIN, BUT AFTER TRYING TO EAT A LITTLE MORE AND THEN TAKING THE TAB I HAVE NOT FELT ANYMORE STOMACH PAIN. I ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME MUSCLE WEAKNESS, BUT TO BE HONEST I THINK I CAN LIVE WITH THAT MUCH BETTER THEN WITH THE PAIN THAT I HAD ON A DAILY BASES. SPECIALLY WHEN THE WEATHER WAS DAMP OR COLD IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO WALK. YES I STILL EXPERIENCE SOME PAIN BUT WITH THE MEDICATION MY PAIN LEVEL IS ABOUT 3-4 WHERE WITHOUT IT WOULD BE 8-10 ON A PAIN SCALE. SO BELIEVE ME AS WE ALL KNOW ALL MEDS HAVE SIDE EFFECTS AND I HAVE TRIED MANY. I DO WORK IN A PAIN MANAGEMENT FACILITY AND HAVE TRIED DIFFERENT OPTIONS, BUT SO FAR ARTHROTEC HAS WORKED PRETTY WELL AND BE SURE TO STAY UP ON YOU'R LAB WORK TO MONITOR ANY CHANGES.

My RH has been negative for years. I had tried every prescription strength, non-sterriodal oral pain killer on the market. Every morning I would be so stiff all over I would cry in pain. Then this physcian put on Arthrotec, I have been painfree for almost 6 years now. There is generic available brandname is &quot;Cytopan&quot; same generic ingredients. If I miss a dose I know it pretty quickly. So far so good. I had to consult a Rhumatologist for review in Canada he and several others say I don't have arthritis and should get off this medication and methotrexate that I have been taking for the last 6 years. I don't know what to do.

Can't say it's been very helpful and I have had extreme diahrrea for too long. I can only attribute it to this medication.  Found out it amplifies certain medications and natural remedies, like magnesium and one of my hbp medicines and my doctor did not tell me.  It's very expensive but I am probably not going to take it for a few days and see if the stomach issues clear up.

Osteoarthritis with High Risk of Developing Ulcers	mistyjean, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	7/2/2010 2:05:51 PM	I have been on Arthrotec 75 for two weeks and it works great.  I have severe scoliosis and Fibromyalgia so having sometime to take for all over joint pain is great.  I also take Nexium so I have a protection of my stomach. Going to take it another month and if everything goes well Doctor will write a prescription.

My doctor wouldn't let me take NSAIDs because of a prior experience with ulcers due to naproxyn. So, I used Mobic for awhile before finding Arthrotec. This is by far the best NSAID I've taken, and I've had no problems. I always take right after or with a meal. Because I also have fibromyalgia, I also take Cymbalta., and I find that with both, I can live a pretty normal life, working and active.

After one or two doses, I had extreme hunger like I was taking Prednisone. Nothing stopped the hunger.I stopped taking it arthrotec, and started prednisone again. Also had some diahrrea.
Other	sbuxaddict, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	5/12/2010 11:31:32 PM	Took one dose of this and I'm not taking any more. I've been severely uncomfortable all day with stomach pain. I took the dose with food like doctor suggested. I continuously felt like I was hungry, but my stomach was full/bloated to the point of pain. And when I ate, I felt immediately like I ate too much, and my stomach hurt. I felt as if I had reflux, like my food wasn't digesting at all. It might've help alleviate some of my other pain, but the stomach pain isn't worth it.

Severe abdominal pain within 30 minutes of taking it that would double me over. Every time I would eat,the pain would return. I had a difficult time swallowing it, due to the outer portion of the pill dissolving so quickly causing it to get stuck behind the uvula at the back of my throat which would cause me to throw up. Shortness of breath occurs as well as numbness or the feeling of heaviness in my arms and chest. Bruising has also occurred more frequently since starting this medication.

Stopped the p.m. dose and ok.  I take nexium every a.m. about 30 minutes or more before I eat breakfast then take all the other drugs.  Thsi drug is very hard on your stomach, so take it after eating.  The nexium helps me to tolerate it.  I have Osteo arthritis and RA and my GP thought this would help with some of the stiffness.  It does help my hands a little.  But, nothing seems to help with the stenosis in my lower spine.  May ask my RA to DC this drug for me next time I see him since I am going to start neurontin soon.

Other	millionbells, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	4/16/2008 4:52:16 PM	I have used arthrotec for 3 years now for osteo arth in my hands.I have found it to be very effective in releaving my joint pain. I did have some upest stomach the first few weeks on this med.After the initial period it no longer bothered my stomach.I have been off it now for 2 months due to lack of insurance. My hands have really gotten worse since Istopped taking it. Am trying to get back on it at this time, but ins is fighting the rx.

Started again when back went out.  Was doing ok but then started with diahreah, very bad, waterfall strength (sorry!)  Dr. said stop and the waterfall stopped.  Took one to see effect - same thing happened.  But now the back pain is worse than ever.  Have to call for a different anti-inflamatory in the a.m.

Other drugs have given little relief. This drug has not only reduced the pain but has helped me resume activities that have been nearly impossible...like taking a walk and climbing stairs. I am now looking forward to exercise!

I feel that doctors should stress the damage that can be done during or before pregnancy for women of child bearing age, like myself, more thoruoghly before prescribing it though.
