Ringworm of Scalp	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	8/4/2010 12:34:10 PM	Took it for about 2 weeks, scalp cleared up perfectly within days so the doctor took me off of it. Infection came back even worse within a few weeks.  Started it up again.. Both time severe insomnia and loose stools for the first few days.  So frustrating to not be able to sleep but it does reduce the scalp symptoms fairly quickly.

I had to stop taking it almost immediately. I think I had about every side effect that was noted, which is very unusual for me. My choice was to lose me or to lose the nail. There are other more effective products available today, so I'd certainly consider those - not Gris-Peg.

Athlete's Foot	Lisa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	2/20/2009 10:06:28 AM	I do not know if this medication works.  After taking it for two weeks, I broke out in a horrible rash.  Dr. said it was an allergic reaction to something I ate.  A few weeks later, I took another one of these pills and woke up a few hous later having trouble breathing.  I had all of the horrible side effects.  Needless to say, I will never recommend or take this medication again!  
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	12/5/2008 12:22:17 AM	My daughter was prescribed this medication for her scalp after trying several other medications. After being tested, I was informed by her primary doctor that she did not have tinea capitis and was sent to the dermatologist. She had a coulter taken there and was informed that the problem in her head was not ringworm or contagious. Although they wanted to treat it with medication used to treat ringworm. She was prescribed shampoo and an oral medication. (They didn't work!) As a result her hair began to fall out. After 2 years of trying several different medicine combinations and several specialists, we were given a prescription for Gris-peg oral. I am happy to say within 2 weeks we were able to see a difference. Her scalp had completely cleared and her hair began to grow in the areas in which it had fallen out. This lasted 9 months after treatment was complete. In exactly nine months the problem returned. Within a week her scalp looked as though she never had treatment. Nothing that we have tried has worked.

Ringworm of Scalp	 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	1	3	1			2/8/2008 10:45:30 AM	My son was treated with it. We took him off after being on it for almost a year as the ringworm was not clearing. The cortizone cream alone actually worked best. He's been off for two months and still complains of headaches and stomache aches. I would not recommend it.
