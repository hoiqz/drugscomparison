Wide-Angle Glaucoma	Strumit, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	55-64	7/31/2012 4:00:19 PM	My Dr just started me on this drop to lower my pressure from 11 to a target of 7-9.  Already on Cosopt &amp; Zioptan (new), which is excellent, as it contains no preservatives that irritate my eye.
Increased Pressure in the Eye	EndGreed, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	2/11/2012 12:46:47 AM	Started this when 1st diagnosed with open angle glaucoma. my eye pressure was 47. After using this it dropped to 30. BUT the loss of my vision was 75% (due to the drops!) I could no longer read- not even with a magnifying glass. I couldn't even watch tV because it looked like I was gazing through a smear of vaseline! I couldn't shop in any stores with bright lights because I could barely see to walk around due to the photophobia effect from this med. After 6 months of treatment vision worsened to where I couldn't make out faces of people standing 4 feet away, my eyes were bright solid red, itched like crazy and felt extremely dry. The prescribing Dr. said no prob- at least your pressure is down. My daughter hurt her eye &amp; I went to her eye Dr with her- Her dr. thought I was the patient- he was so upset that my Dr would allow my eyes to be red like that- he saw me for free and performed laser surgey on me for FREE! 3 days after the laser surgery I could read again without even glasses! He took me off the Alphagan (which he said I was clearly allergic to, as many people are)My pressure dropped from 30 to 17 after laser surgery and being switched to dorzolomide drops. The benefits don't outweigh the negatives of this med for me.

Increased Pressure in the Eye	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	10/21/2010 11:10:33 PM	Have been on Xalatan and Istalol and had to discontinue use of both due to severe headaches and pain behind the eyes.  The Istalol also increased my blood sugar levels.  Am supposed to start the Alphagan P but am concerned about the possible side effects due to my years of battling severe depression/anxiety and the meds I have to take.  This is getting discouraging because I need to find a med that will bring my eye pressure down without all these side effects.  This is the story of my life -- I metabolize meds differently and am very sensitive to them.

Increased Pressure in the Eye	Jim, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	6/29/2010 1:00:09 PM	I am a post heart attack and triple bypass patient and post stroke patient with resulting Epilepsy, using Phenobarbital for seizures. I experienced rapid heart beat and skipping beats, with this medication just like Betoptic and four other eyedrops Glaucoma medications. I have spent thousands of dollars for repeated emergency room visits from these drops and other drops due to the cardiac side effects. Dr. prescribed 2 puffs of Marijuana 3 times a day and it works without dangerous or costly side effects. But I do experience one side effect, I get hungry. So I do the marijuana puffs before meals. Side effect controlled.

One application and my eye turned red and burned like fire.  I called the doctor and was told to immediately stop this medication. Now I have what the doctor described as 'optic nerve damage'.

After 6 weeks, everyday function was badly impaired. Memory lapses were bad. Trivial tasks were drawn out. Use of the drug was stopped. Azopt was substituted. An adverse reaction report was filed wwith the FDA. Similar impairment occurred with Timolol but not as severe. It took 4 weeks to restore semblance of normal function.

Increased Pressure in the Eye	Ledgerman, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	55-64	8/21/2009 5:06:55 PM	Although this drug has worked fine for me, I am switching to Brimonidine (Tartrate) Opht solution .2% because it is less expensive. Ir is curious my doctor said this is ok, but my mail order Rx provider does not consider it a generic equivalent.Web MD also associates Alphagan P to Brimonidine Opht so this confirms what the doctor is saying. Yet the mail order pricing for Brimonidine is that of a generic. Have your doctor specifically change your Rx because your mail order provider will not automatically change your Alphagan P to what is effectively the generic equivalent.
