Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	steele, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	10/1/2012 5:24:33 AM	This is the absolute worst medication I have ever been prescribed.  I have every  side effect in the book and I've only been on it for two weeks. Gained five pounds in two weeks!  Stopped taking it and went back to the Abilify (which I initially stopped because, over time, it was causing gradual weight gain.) Actually, I took two Abilify when I stopped the Geodon.   Felt less ANGRY, but still haven't slept in two days and I CANNOT get rid of this constant headache.  When I was on it, the fatigue at work actually caused me to fall asleep on my break and miss a meeting (I'm a TEACHER!) Not good.  Started taking it at night instead.  Had the worst indigestion I've ever had.  Like my solar plexus area was on fire to the point that I almost threw up.  Belching, pressure, constipation, crying, DRY MOUTH, peeing every 20 minutes, rash and hives.  THIS STUFF SHOULD NOT BE ON THE MARKET.  It is absolute poison.  Abilify was the greatest thing ever for me, other than the weight gain.  Got to figure out how to overcome that- hopefully with more exercise and less food, because I'm going back to it.  Hope I get some sleep soon.  How long are these withdrawal symptoms going to last after only two weeks on the meds I wonder?

It is dangerous! I find that doctors give this medication out too frequently to people who do not have the correct symptoms for needing the drug. I had serious side effects including severe tremors, night sweats, tardiv dyskinesia, hallucinations, and irregular heartbeat. It was a nightmare. I did not in fact need this drug. I immediately asked to be taken off, the doctors refused. I hope this drug is looked into more and problems fixed for the patients sake. People suffering mental problems like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder deal with enough heartache that they cannot help! And after 13 years of suffering, I was reevaluated as an adult, I am NOT bipolar at all.

Nausea,terrible insomnia,decreased urination, constipation, sweating,edema of legs and hands, and blood sugar up 100 points. Could not reach my Dr so stopped it after only 3 days. This was POISON for me. AWful, awful. Too bad it did lift my spirits a bit but side effects WAY not worth it!!!!!!

Bipolar Depression	tayterbuhg, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	45-54	9/4/2012 1:44:40 AM	I am bipolar male.  I have been on various drugs for 4 years.  Before I started taking geodon, I was a zombie.  At first, I had moreenergy than I had in years, better concentration, much less depression and manic episodes, and good sleep.  I missed one day and had TERRIBLE WITHDRAW symptoms.(Brain Zaps, chills, and sweating.) Started at 40mg a day.  Upped to 120 mg a day.(80 at night). It has been weight neutral for me.  I have slight dry mouth when taking geodon.  Make sure you carry the medicine with you at first.  Brain Zaps start affecting me after about 10 hours between doses. Dr. may have to up dose again.   I still think it is a miracle drug for me at this juncture.....

HOWEVER , IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR HEART IS TOLERATING THIS MEDICINE AS IT CAN BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. KEEP UP WITH YOUR DOCTORS TAKE AN E.K.G. IF POSSIBLE. I TOLERATE MUCH BETTER AFTER TAKING A LOWER DOSE. A GOOD DRUG. BE CAREFUL.

The side effects were horrible! If I went even an hour without my dose, I would be getting what I was then describing to my doctor as &quot;Volts of electricity running through my brain&quot; I see now on here for this &amp; other similar meds, people are calling them brain zaps. My doctor said that this was not an actual side effect of the drug &amp; that it was literally &quot;All in my head&quot; The only reason he willingly took me off of this medication despite my pleas, was because my face had begun to freeze in one position. I looked as if I'd had a stroke &amp; it took almost 6 months of being off of the Geodon before I was able to move all of the muscles in my face again. Coming off from this was terrible because of these &quot;Brain Zaps&quot; I did not know what was going on half of the time (constantly in a dazed state) &amp; was a single mother of 2 children at the time. I am so thankful that my mother was living with us at the time to help with the kids while I dealt with all of these side effects &amp; withdrawals. If you have a choice to take any other medication but this one, my advice would be not to take the Geodon!

I'm on 40 in the morning and 80 at night. Saw the Doc today and he added Lithium. I'm in fear of losing my job because of the depression (crying and anxiety). I can't stop because the withdrawals are horrendous. I guess I'll wait it out and see if things get better.
Bipolar Depression	I Have Hope!, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	45-54	7/26/2012 6:36:57 PM	I have been on Geodon for four years.  In the beginning I was on 60mg you should take it at night it does cause fatigue quickly and makes you hungry but I was 215lbs when I started this drug and now down to 155lbs. It changed my life! you want to get out of bed, exercise and it  controlled my ocd, yelling at my loved ones. My family noticed such a different person I have become.  In Nov my Multiple Sclerosis was acting  up so I asked my doctor to increase my dose to 80mg at that dose I became very anxious so he prescribed Vallium which made me cry all the time, then ativan made me cry all the time, then Klonipine same effect so come to find out I have sensitivities to Benzodiazpines they made me cry, anxious and have thoughs of suicide I then went to 20mg of Geodon and I had a doctor give me Librium for stomach problems. He told me it wasn't a Benzo come to find out it was! When I was sitting in my car in the garage with it running anticipating doing  the worst thing imagineable!! I realized I needed my Geodon the three years I have been on it I never had thoughts of suicide going to 2omg and having benzo's in my system made me crazy!! Now back on 40mg and realize how fragile Life really is to thing what my 83 year old mother and my daughter,son, husband and most of all my beautiful seven year old Lab would do without me. Try this drug it really does work!! Give it a chance and if you suffer from BiPolar and have no  children living at home and suffer from other diseases like me with my MS get a Lab the are the most loyal and best friend you could have they are your walking buddie every day so it helps with the weight loss!!
Bipolar Disorder in Remission	Chaya, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	7/26/2012 1:12:22 PM	Geodon is my miracle drug. It does not work with every body chemistry, but when it does, you get your life back. It absolutely crushes my mania, irritability and suicidal ideations. Now, side effects... oh yes. As soon as I started it, I began to rock back and forth whenever seated, and I still do. It makes me lactate slightly, which scared the hell out of me at first. Orgasm is harder to accomplish, but I'm on a cocktail so I can't solely blame Geodon (and at least I'm not a sex maniac anymore.) The really scary thing is interference with the heart's electrical impulses, although it's supposedly rare. My pdoc once upped me to a total of 180mg per day, G-d knows why, and I promptly had an abnormal EKG and a pulse that got down into the mid-40s. After a scary week during which I told my case manager I would rather die sane than live crazy, and the doctor's restoring my Geodon to previous levels (he still swears I'm the only case of that side effect he's ever heard of in real life,) my heart is all happy.When Geodon works, it works well and remarkably fast. If you're willing to have a heart workup just to make sure the drug isn't going south on you, I definitely recommend trying it.
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	25-34	7/17/2012 9:47:41 AM	I have bipolar 1. This medication has helped smooth out my moods but have had some serious side effects. Mostly in the form of waking up in the morning and not being able to focus my eyes and feeling very drugged and having to be driven to work by family members. Caused a loss of appetite and I lost 25lbs in 2 months after gaining on other meds that was a great side effect. All in all the medication is working but I am struggling a bit with side effects but to me it is worth it.

However I developed Tardive dyskonesia and had to discontinue the med. My friends and family did not like the way I acted while on this med, they said I was like a zombie, but I myself could not see this I quite simply felt relief from the extreme thought disorder. I stopped the med and it was nt long before the weight returned so I am certain it was the geodon  that caused it... this part I really miss!

I had many problems with extra movements, mouth sores from the dryness, and some swallowing difficulties. My problem is now post-Geodon: I can not sleep longer than 1-3 hours at a time. I do not sleep during the day! I am wondering if this is due my course with Geodon.I was taken off Geodon 2 years ago. When I was taking Geodon I would sleep for 10 hours, and was very sleepy soon after taking the medication, and had to be able to go to bed.After being taken off Geodon, I immediately could not stay asleep. I would wake all night long. Now, 2 years later, I am still having these problems.  I wake every 1-3 hours all night long. I can not get back to sleep most of the time and get up frequently for an hour or so. My psychiatrist is still treating me for depression with Lexapro, but I would do anything to be able to sleep all night.  I am 61 years old.

I have been on multiple meds and this was probably my last chance at anything to help my mixed bipolar.

Other	Lori, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	4/12/2012 1:46:35 PM	My 72 year old father was given this drug 2 hours after been given ativan.  Mind you, he was in ICU for low blood pressure and very low pulse.  The blood pressure and pulse were finally regulated but dad couldn't sleep; (which is normal for him). He's also on Celexa for anxiety; along with about 13 other medicatins for high blood pressure, anti rejection medication, muscle relaxors, etc.   I guess they though the ativan would relax him and make him sleep.  It didn't.  Why in the world would they give him Geodon?  He started hallucinating, talking like the devil, cursing at the nurses, wife, &amp; children. It's over 24 hours and he's still acting irratic.  Wondering if this is permanent or will it wear off?  Very sad situation.  He had to be strapped down and became violent and got out of his restraints 4 times.  Became very strong.  Wouldn't give Ativan or Geodon to anyone after this experience.

No suicide thoughts, think about death all the time, not healthy, vision problems, weight gain was rapid when I 1st started Geodon. 50lbs in 4 mos. My body aches with no mercy, decaying my teeth fast, no sex drive at all. Having Bipolar is very difficult, there is no cure yet. Before I was diagnosed &amp; got on the right med, I was violent, raging &amp; totally out of control, hurting family &amp; myself. This type of disorder is difficult, always changing meds, and hoping that one day you will find one that works for you.

With Zyprexa I was extremely calm, but very sedated, always tired and had gained 50lbs. With the switch to Geodon, I lost 40lbs - and I became myself again. I have a personality, unlike with Zyprexa, but I do not have bipolar symptoms. I take most of the Geodon at night and it helps me sleep. Geodon has changed my life for the better because I feel like myself again and I have been very successful in home, church and career life.

Taken at night it knocked me out and I woke up dazed, suffering from blackouts, until recovering before noon. Later, when I had adjusted and wasn't such a zombie, I started to get muscle spasms and spasticity in my legs. This, combined with a doctor who refused to believe the drug was causing it, provided me with a very unpleasant period.I believe the muscle problems are more common than the company claims... but can't back that up with real statistics.Also, it didn't help with the paranoia.

Became manic, then irritable, impulsive, couldn't concentrate or think straight.   My blood pressure jumped from 98/64 to138/68. I had heart palpitations, racingpulse and pain in neck radiating down leftarm, I was scared to  death I was having a heart attack and tonight same things are happeninng. Add to that having dizziness,cramping all over body, tongue clucking and I had an episode of non-stop swearing (I do not swear normally) and I feel as close to absolutely, out of my mind crazy as I hope I ever get. I am so afraid I don't know whatto do, I can't stop crying. My head aches, my back aches and I have only been on this poison 3-4 days; I'm so confused I can't remember exactly. I am so grateful a new doctor stopped the Geodon today. I pray Iwill feel back to normal soon but I am afraid that I might not or that the craziness will never stop again. All because the doctor told me this poison would help me sleep better.Please think twice and take with care, if at all.

I take 400mg Topamax/day and 200mg Pristiq/day but was showing signs of anxiety and some agitation. Geodon is like a miracle. I had resigned myself to living life, sitting in front of the tv, never leaving my home. I didn't mind people coming but I never left it. I now go out occ. but not into stores yet. An occ. visit to a good fried is as good as I can get. Still on very low dose and we are increasing it monthly.

She was put on rispidol after her father died.I felt if someone would have listened she could have been on it sooner.Her father was diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and she was showing signs of this at age5. at age 9 her mood swings were unpredictable,and frequent. anything would spark them.At 9 she was put on risperdol which kept her blood sugars elevated alot.(type 1 for 14 1/2 yrs.) But geodon doesn't. The only side effect I can say we have is if we accidently run out or she forgets to take it with her-she will be up all night.

I know it has kept me stable, but the only thing i don;t like is being like a zombie on this medication. I suffer from schizo-affective disorder, i tried invega, it stopped working after three month's. Also i've tried abilify, doesn't work. My question to anyone out there, is there any medication's any body can consider for schizo -affective disorder, that does not have a zombie affect on you. I'm thinking about trying stelazine, or risperdal.Can any one please help.

Or you will get SEVERE withdrawal. Be warned, if you can't remember to take your med, DON'T take this. You will feel very bad.

I dropped off for one day and felt great, but got much needed non anxious sleep. Last night I took it again and again the nausea is back horribly and I can't eat a bite. At first I thought it was a virus, but it only happens when I take Geodon at bedtime. What do I do? I find nothing about this in the literature.

I was like a zombie and it was nearly impossible to take care of my 1 year old. So I started taking my dose at night and now everything is better. I don't get tired during the day and I haven't had an episode in months. It's really helped me. The only problem I have is the anxiety, but I now take 10 mg  and it seems to be getting better.

She told me Geodon actually caused weight loss. After further review, it doesn't cause weight loss it just doesn't cause weight gain. I took it at 6pm after dinner and was asleep 15 minutes later. I woke up at 10pm and was so dizzy I fell trying to get out of bed. I ran to the bathroom thinking I was going to vomit. At one point I was almost delirious. I finally fell asleep after a few hours of tossing and turning, being so miserable from feeling as if I would vomit and it never happened. I called my doctor immediately the next morning and asked I be taken off this drug.

A few weeks into taking it everything changed for the better. I feel like myself again. I myself was recently diagnosed w/ Bipolar I.  Geodon was one of the meds they started me on.  I couldn't believe how clear my mind was again. It stopped my mixed episodes very well. One day I ran out of the med and I noticed how bad I felt without it. I highly rate this med because it changed me around for the better.

I take my dose the same time every night &amp; can actually sleep for 6 hours for the first time in years. Slight weight gain &amp; restlessness in my legs but the benefits outweigh this issue.

Bipolar Depression	starg8t, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	7/21/2011 10:03:49 PM	It all began about three months ago (in the middle of June, 2011) when I was prescribed 80mg Geodon 2x daily for bi-polar depression. It wasnt until mid-July, 2011 when I moved to Texas with my two beloved dachshunds (both twins, 7 years old), when suddenly I suffered the worst panic and anxiety attack I ever had in my life.  I was filled with fear beyond belief, and it wasnt attached to anything. It just happened. The anxiety was so paralyzing that I could not think clearly. I was in such a panic that that I didnt know what to do. All I could think was, hospital. But, because I had my two dachshunds, I could not go to a hospital. There was no one available to watch my two dogs for me. So, in a paralyzing fit of absolute panic, anxiety and fear, I quickly placed an ad on the Internet in the hope of finding a loving home for my two dogs. Now my two beloved dogs are gone forever.  I would not recommend Geodon to anyone.  I want it out of my system immediately.  I quit taking it and now have anxiety and sweating, but I'll go though it just to get off of Geodon.  It was a disaster for me.

It was like a veil was lifted from my eyes. I could see clearly once more. I felt like a normal 21 year old young adult. I was doing fun things and not being reminded of this mood disorder that I suffer with. The unfortunate thing I learned about Geodon is it only stays in my system for about 7 hours and then I start swinging into a hypomanic/manic state again so I end up taking it 3 times a day. I don't take it in the morning other wise I will be so tired from my night dose. I am taking medications 4 times a day just to get my bipolar stable which is so frustrtaing sometimes. But The Geodon has done wonders for me and has kept me from going manic many of times.
Other	sailor_0, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	6/24/2011 3:03:30 PM	WOW this medication is exactly what I have been looking for over the past 5 years. I was diagnosted with PTSD in 06 and after seeing 4 different doctors and multiple anti-depressents I can finally say that I feel normal. The only side effect that I have noticed is feeling like I need to be doing something, but this is only when I know something is coming up on my to do list. Besides that I have more normal energy, wanting to enjoy life again, no more extream highs with energy followed by a crash and getting very upset with who ever was around me. My PTSD was due to the Iraq war and the only thing that could keep my attention was basically being an &quot;adrenalin junky&quot; as I was called by many nurses. I never took anything but my work is an Explosive Engineer, always needed something dangerous to keep my attention and focus correct. Geodon has greatly helped me fix all of my mental issues, no longer have the dreams of war, no longer have thoughts of homicide, and feel like I will finally have a normal life, FINALLY!
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	Claratin Clear,  Female  (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female		6/21/2011 1:20:46 AM	I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  I had been treated for depression and taking Celexa for 10+ years.  I gradually stopped the Celexa and began the Geodon.  We make jokes about being &quot;claratin clear&quot;, it's literally like pealing away the levels of fuzziness and getting clearer.  Although I have been experiencing several troublesome side effects.  The worst is the swelling, I feel like my skin is stretched so tight, and diuretics don't help much at all.  I also have trouble breathing and wake up with my heart pounding in my ears.  I love that I feel like a normal person again, after so long, but the side effects are driving me nuts.  I can't find anything in the literature about swelling either - maybe this is the weight gain they were talking about.

I've had a lot of trouble with anxiety, insomnia, agitation, parnoia, and things getting on my nerves. I'm at 80 mg twice a day and I want to cut back to 60 at night and 40 during the day.

Zyprexa was a cure for me, but I went from 140 lbs to 200 lbs after taking Geodon I got back to my normal weight of 140. Geodon treated my depression pretty well, though as I have stated no where near as good as Zyprexa.

Within 30 minutes of taking my inital 20mg dose, I was so dizzy, light-headed, and cloudy that i couldn't function.  Then the muscle cramps started with my hamstrings and I'm a dedicated runner so there was no reason for the cramps. Had i not been physically fit with strong legs, I don't think I could've walked anymore.  This medicine stinks!!!  Plus ,the side effects were so severe, there's no way I will continuing taking it.

I experienced extreme anxiety/panic attacks, and would sometimes have sudden almost phobic reactions to being in crowded places that I had never experienced before.I eventually lost my job in April 2008 and have not been able to find another one; I went to rehab three times in 14 months, and the third trip came when I relapsed and was put into a medically induced coma.On the third trip, after almost five years on Geodon, the psychiatrist switched me to Seroquel (and during those five years I had tried just quitting Geodon and found it even worse than the horrible side effects of taking it).Since switching to Seroquel in September 2010, my anxiety and fears have vanished and I have no problems staying clean and sober. I now face the prospect of rebuilding a shattered career that may never recover.My advice to anyone who is given Geodon is to GET A SECOND OPINION. This is a nasty, nasty drug.
Schizophrenia	DrugsKillTheyProfit, 13-18 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	1		13-18	5/23/2011 2:34:22 AM	Geodon made me gain tremendous amounts of weight in no time flat, my appetite became that of an elephant. I constantly was to tired and lethargic to even think, let alone have rational thoughts. The simplest tasks were extremely difficult.Doctors only treat patients with drugs. Drug companies send promoters to doctors, doctors sell the medicine/drugs, doctors invest in the drug company through stocks.If you want effective treatment, seek natural treatment. I guarantee you'll find natural treatments for depression, schizophrenia, you name it.I guarantee they'll be cheaper than the drugs, doctors visits, and potential problems you could face - because drug companies don't pay for your hospital visits from THEIR drug&quot;s side effects.If you really want to empower yoourself, and stop being a tool for doctors and pharmacuetical companies - research the orthomlecular treatment for your illness. Oh, and please keep in mind - people who use natural treatments are &quot;quacks&quot; according to the FDA and other agencies. But I guarantee taking some St. John's Wort for depression will give you less side effects than the drugs! (Who's the real quack?)May good bless you and help guide you through any illness this country is trying to profit off from you going through.For those wondering. Here's the dose of meds I started at - 1,500 mg and 120 mg.The dose I'm at now - 500 mg and 40 mg.The dose I'll be at in no time flat - zero and zero mg.
Other	7-12 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	7-12	5/16/2011 5:10:34 PM	When my son was 10 years old, {diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar}  he was given Seroquel, Risperdal, Abilify then Geodon and developed Tartive Dyskenisia, or tic-like motions in his shoulders and arms.  Initially he gained 30 lbs, which was hard for him but when the tics started, I asked the Dr to take him off.  I had to put him into a psychiatric hospital for 2 weeks to get him off this medication, which was the most devastating thing I have ever had to do.  He is now 15 and taking Adderall, guanfacine, Depakote and Trazodone.  He gets great grades, is self confident and full of life.  Trial and error with these meds.....it just takes time and patience.  Now I am taking Seroquel and have gained 30 lbs in the last month.  uuurrrrgggghhhh!

Bipolar Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	4/24/2011 3:52:23 PM	My dosages have changed the whole time I've been on Geodon so that my body could get used to it. Started on 20mg for two weeks and didn't feel any different until my fourth week on 40mg; by the time I reached 60mg I began to feel much better, seeing myself for the first time as one is suppose to feel. However I must say that either my body was becoming immune to it, or 60mg just wasn't work for me now into my fifth month. My psychiatrist then split the Geodon into parts. I'd remain taking the 60mg with dinner, but now added 40mg to take in the morning. I was told this would help somewhat with the depression state I was in, so have been splinting the dosages twice a day and I noticed that I am feeling a little better. My only issue with this medication is that it has made me gain weight so rapidly at such a small window of time.

I have been enormously swollen in ankles and feet, and I am someone who does not swell ever.  I had chills and goosebumps then get hot quickly and start perspiring.  I stopped taking Geodon - 2 milligrams - 3 days ago and the swelling is somewhat better, but my legs and arms continue to ache and tingle and my bum knee is hurting very badly.  I had severe insomnia too.  I agree with another writer - WALK DON'T RUN FROM THIS DRUG.  Sad thing is, it was helping me.  HOwever the side effects were too severe.

I was walking with a friend when I started walking funny, like my right leg was longer than my left. I just went home and slept it off right away. on the second day of taking it. In the middle of class my face started to make a frowning gesture without my approval. It was somewhat embarrassing and scary. I called my Father and he told me that we'll have to lower the dose to 20mg. Every time I have a problem with the meds I just sleep it off. It's soo easy to sleep and almost hard to stay awake sometimes. I guess it makes me feel kinda woozy. If it's suppose to knock me the hell out, then it's doing a fantastic job. It feels like my brain is drowning sometimes. maybe it's just me.

The first few days I was sleeping non stop. When I started getting used to the effects it wouldnt put me to sleep so much. But then I could not get up in the morning to go to school, or function. I tried getting off it once cold turkey and I almost went completely insane: extreme anxiety, couldnt stop hysterical crying,depression, and insomnia, it took me about a week to get back to a somewhat normal state. My doctor kept upping the dosage since I couldnt stay asleep anymore, and in the end I was falling asleep everywhere, and now had to go to independent studies due to loss of ability to wake up and stay up. Horrible medicine. I dont want anyone else to suffer the same.

The flu symptoms kept continuing for another week. It wasn't until I got on this site and read someone's post about problems with the drug. The diahrea, cramps, leg pain, nausea.... I had all of that! I went off the Geodon and feel great physically. But I'm sad b/c the Geodon DID improve my mood...could not live with the side effects though! And I lost over 11 lbs from being sick! Hope this helps someone else. All drugs are different and side effects for everyone are different. Back to the Doc. :)

The other thing about Geodon is that when I miss a dose I get flu like symptoms. Geodon has really helped my psychotic symptoms, though.

I am in day 2 of coming off this drug. This is worst thing I have ever experienced.  Here is what I am dealing with at this moment: sweats on feet and underarms, shakeng, back. and neck pain, skin crawls, feeling like I have a bad sunburn, blury vision, cannot , cannot eat, cannot drive. I am getting sores in my mouth.  Two ER trips and still no relief.  Hope tomorrow is better. 
Bipolar Depression	justme, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	2/11/2011 6:31:38 PM	I just started taking Geodon 4 days ago. 80 mg in the morning and 80 mg at night. I can't stay awake, my whole body feels heavy and limp at the same time. My speech is slurred. I even took naps at work during my lunch hour. I've called off work one day left a 1/2 day early, can't seem to get enough sleep. Be careful if you have sugar problems also because Geodon has a side effect that may raise your blood sugar levels.

I love the medication for what it is doing for my bipolar disorder.  I've never been so constant in my mooods before.  I feel great.  I do suffer from some side effects like shaking hands and sore arms.  But, the side effects are nothing compared to being in my manic or depressive states.  I love the overall outcome of Geodon.  I'm looking forward to when we will be able to receive the generic version because of cost.

When they the dose was raised for 40 to 60 I went to sad crying episodes. back on 40 doing great so far. I better deal with everyday life and my kids with a lot less anger. I have gained 1 pd and have had some heart palpations, extra thirst and I notice diffence asap if I miss a dose.All &amp; all worth the few side affects. Will check with ekg and bloodwork to be safe.Good luck to all!
Bipolar Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	1/15/2011 11:44:00 PM	This is the only anti-psychotic that has worked for me. I went to bed at night, and woke up refreshed in the morning. I hardly ever felt like lashing out and my rage was controlled. However, the side effects were terrible. I constantly felt dehydrated. I shook and twitched all day. And eventually, I had a seizure and was directed to stop. Even now that I have been off of this drug for over a year, I still twitch on occasion. The ER doctor said it is still in my system and that I just have to wait it out. I am back on Depakote and unfortunately, it does not work as well.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	1/10/2011 10:09:44 PM	My boyfriend was taking geodon.  At first it was working great!  There were a few side effects.  He was sluggish in the mornings, and had mild muscle aches.  Then he was told to up the dosage from 80mg a day to 160mg a day.  As soon as he did, he stayed dizzy, had a sense of hopelessness, felt sudden dread.  This went on for 3 days.  He just sat and cried and said he didn't know what to do.  I took him to the ER because of the dizziness.  Dr. ran blood test and took a CT.  Everything came back normal, so they said it was the medication and to immediately stop taking it.  We got home and everything seemed ok.  A couple of hours later, the dread was back.  He started crying again repeating &quot;I don't know what to do, I just want to die.&quot;  I took him back to the ER and told him he was still having panic attacks and was feeling suicidal.  He is now in a mental hospital for the next 7 to 10 days.  Please be cautious when taking Geodon!  I DO NOT recommend this medication!
Bipolar Disorder in Remission	MichaelTWarren, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	1/2/2011 11:22:56 AM	If you fully read the report, notice that nearly all possibly negative side effects increased, and it appears that none decreased.  Such as headache, speech disorder, slobering or drooling, dizzyness, even hemmoraging that can be extremely painful.  I am wondering why this medication is used at all?  In my situation, of severe schizophrenic disorder, manic depression, or bipolar; my doctor seemed to expirement with ten or more prescription &quot;anti-psychotics&quot; on me.  Side effects were very troubling and long lasting, some even being permanent or not going away for years.  I am wondering why this medecine is being used at all unless it is some form of euthenasia (assisted suicide).  I can't come up with the answers to these problems right here and now, but I propose several problems or issued to think about.  It seems that the class of medication to treat bipolar symptoms, in essence problems that become too big to handle, is only punitive.  Many youngsters used alcohol and illegal street drugs to self medicate for symptoms of violent attacks or debilitating depression; in other words extreme emotional situations.  Subsequently being treated for drug addiction, or symptoms of schizophrenia that were to severe to be handled by having a few beers, going to a higher power or more powerful medication, has thus increased side effects and damage to the human body.  After all I learned to decrease my use of any and all medications, whether it be legal, illegal, or prescription strength, and try to treat symptoms with old fashioned methods of bed rest, comfort, and probably wholesome regular nutritious meals.

For the past month and a half since I have had a terrible time feeling any energy, unable to work, paranoia, racing thoughts, and low functioning with 20mg twice a day and/or 40 mg twice a day.  Need to give it more time but not happy with Geodon overall after 2 months.

When I started taking Geodon, I noticed a decrease in my symptoms as well as weight loss and no more muscle movements. I think it is a wonderful drug.
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	12/16/2010 5:03:44 PM	Geodon is the worst medicine I have ever taken. I take two 60mg capsules at night. I am &quot;zoned out&quot; and sleepy all day. I am too tired to do anything. Also, I have never been so paranoid in my life. I have many seriously irrational fears. I am scared of doing anything or going anywhere. I was not like this before Geodon. I spoke to my doctor this morning and told her I wanted to stop immediately; but, because of fear of withdrawal symptoms I must taper off the medication. It can also raise blood sugar and cause diabetes. I would not recommend this medication to anyone except, maybe, as a last resort.
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/14/2010 5:51:02 PM	I have been on Geodon since around 2003. Started out at 80 mg and it worked great. However, once my body got immune to the medicine, I had to take 160 mg of it. Just recently, I had to up it again because my depression was getting out of hand. My doctor upped it to 240 mg (which is the highest you can be on) and I feel like myslef again!! Only problem, what's going to happen when my body gets immune to this much? The only side effect is that it makes me very sleepy. I take all 3 pills at night about 2 hours before I go to bed and I sleep throughout the night no problem. I've been on every kind of medicine out there and Geodon seems to be the only one that works for me. Unless my body gets immune to it. That's the only thing I'm worried about.

Have not experienced any weight gain with it but it does make me tired.  I take the maximum dosage (160mg)- 40mg in AM and 120mg at night.  If I don't take it I can't sleep as my mind races.  I take it to prevent psychotic episodes which have been a part of my bipolar experience.  Took awhile to get used to this drug as the sleepiness side effect really effects me.  Fortunately, I have an understanding employer who lets me come in to work late so that the meds effects can get out of my system.

The voices in her head have stopped and she is thinking clearly.  She seems to be calmer and not as &quot;manic&quot; as she has been in the last 3 weeks.  She was diagnosed 8 years ago at age 20 and has been moderately functional for the most until early this summer.  Graduating with her second college degree, I think the stress did her in and then failed her clinical board on top of that! (low self esteem and severe depression)She has tried a variety of meds (Concerta, Zyprexa, Lexapro, Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Cymbalta) combined with Abilify. At present she is on Celexa(20mg)/Geodon(60mg)/Topamax(25mg) in AM and Topamax(25mg) in PM.  We will continue to monitor her experiences with this med and post weekly.Just a thank you to everyone who takes the time to review these meds.  It does help!

Geodon is the only anti-psychotic I have taken.  I have been on a 60mg dose twice a day for 2 or 3 years now.  The only problem I have with it is weight gain. It was just a little bit at first then earlier this year out of nowhere I put on 30 pounds in a matter of 6 months.  My weight seems to be holding steady now and has been for several months.  The dosing schedule was really hard at first too cause sometimes it makes me sleepy.  I finally got it down to a science and I take one at 3AM and go back to sleep until 7AM and I take my second dose at 3:30PM.  The only thing that REALLY BOTHERS me about this miracle drug is the cost.  If I didn't have insurance, a 30-day supply would cost me a little over $1,700.00 which is NOT affordable!  It is RIDICULOUS!!!  People depend on this medication to function as a &quot;normal&quot; human being yet the drug company makes it impossible to afford it... THANK GOD FOR INSURANCE when it comes to this pill!!!

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	11/5/2010 4:46:03 PM	My first and only dose: I took a 40mg tab at night and went to bed three hours later. First my restless leg syndrome went into overdrive, then I became disoriented and experienced tremors throughout my entire body for three hours until I popped an extra Requip (RLS med). I fell asleep then woke up the next day in pain, confused, sensitive to light, seeing floaters, and I felt like I had bricks tied to each limb because moving was very difficult. I had to call out of work and I slept for the next 26 hours. I am sensitive to a lot of psych meds, so I don't suggest taking Geodon if you also have medication sensitivity.

However, when I was introduced to it by a different dr than I have now.  She had me on really high dosage which made me lethargic in thinking and just plain tired all around.  Now I have a better doctor who monitors my meds better.  I haven't really had side effects except gaining of weight some.  But, I am trying to remedy that by walking more which I should do anyways.

He was on this drug for about 5 months with very little benefit when he suddenly started having a tar-dive type symptom with muscles in his neck and jaw causing problems with his bite. After going off the geodon his bite improved back closer to normal but he still has a little under bite left over from the episode. I Can't recommend this drug.

I was started at 40mg but the drug is slow to affect the individual.  I have found the split doses of Geodon to level out my day.  My mood swings have diminished and my control in life is better.  I no longer have very depressed days then followed by highs like when I was on Zyprexa zydis alone.  I now take Geodon coupled with a 5 mg zyprexa tab.  everyday with great results.  Life is worth living to make a difference not to be a place holder!

I was dropping things and I was walking as if I were drunk. I was sent for tests I don't know what happened except if states the geodon shouldn't be taken with medication the opens blood vessels in your brain. Imirex does just that.

I am now able to talk to people again and feel like a person instead of a zombie walking around.  My bills are getting paid again (no follish money spending) just by far the best.

Plus I have been becoming delusinal due to the high dosage. I gained 10lbs. in five days. Does anyone else have nightmares? Cause at 80mg I can't sleep.

My doctor tapered my dosage down and as soon as I was off it I got very sick. Diarrhea,vomiting,stomach cramps,headaches, changes in vision. The only thing that remedied these symptoms was taking a geodon pill. I have tried multiple times in the last two months and each time I go below 20mg I get sick again and it doesnt go away until I take another pill.I dont know what I am supposed to do, I have contacted pfizer and they refused to give any sort of advice, I guess my next step is to contact the fda.

The sedation was the most severe.  I was asleep about an hour after taking it every day.  I was in an outpatient program at the time, and kept falling asleep.  I couldn't drive myself to therapy.  My doctor asked me to give the med more time, the side effects would pass;  I just couldn't function and finally had to switch to a different med.

I had tried several other antipsychotic drugs with horrible side effects and this one has the best result. It has completely gotten rid of the voices and reduced other hallucinations to the background. Still a little paranoid though.

(over $1000/month).  I take 60 mg at night and 40 in the am but I really don't understand why it has to be so expensive. Yes, I know that it still doesn't have a generic, but there really should be one... then it would be much cheaper... Because omg i went to the pharmacy and it was $11 per pill! But it works wonderfully anyways. I was really depressed a few years ago, now I take Zoloft and Topamax with Geodon and its a great combo. But it is SO expensive =(

His buddy brought him back to our house having a severe convulsive reaction. They thought maybe to Geodon. That seemed odd to me because he hadn't had any reactions before or had any med since last night--that I knew of. He looked like he was having a stroke or an overdose reaction to either RX or possibly illegal drugs. (The only other thing his friend admitted to was a Native American cigarette he had given him, Smoky Joe. An ER nurse searched the ingredients on the internet. He found no real medical concern.)  The main ER doctor is pretty certain our sons reaction was to the Geodon, based on the good response to the &quot;antidote&quot; they gave him. It was not an allergic reaction but another type. He explained the meds (which he had already been taking for 3 weeks) caused some type of misfiring of the nerves.    He had been unable to speak understandably, or control his muscle movements. His hands &amp; neck  muscles were involuntarily contorted, &amp; his heart rate was dangerously high. He was having convulsions, different than a seizure. He was awake, alert &amp; responsive. I guess seizures are an in-&amp;-out reflex of the muscles. Something I hope to never have to learn more about.They were originally going to give him Cogentin to counteract the Geodon, but it would take too long to get from the pharmacy, so they gave him a shot of Benadryl, which worked in about 30 sec. to calm him &amp; take away all pain. Both the ER doctor &amp; the psychiatrist say Geodon could continue to be taken in conjunction w/another medication (possibly Cogentin?), but our son didnt want to, nor did his Psychiatrist advise it. He prescribed a higher dose of Zyprexa (15 MG) to try, but our son is too apprehensive about having another reaction, so he chooses to take nothing &amp; deal w/the voices.*Every persons body make-up is different, but if it's helpful to 1 person, its worth the time to post it.

At 40 mg my face twitched and I was very sleep and very scared. At 60mg less sleep help me sleep at night. Take 60mg at night to sleep by 11 am the next morning have severe anxiety. Have to take 2 anxiety pills to relax me. I have given up on this pill. Only thing I liked about it was very small weight gain.

I was taking this on top of a number of other drugs, including 200mg of Lamical daily. I have since lowered my 80mg daily dose to 60mg and now I'm at 40mg. This medication has the same sleeping coma effects of seroquel...church bells in my room couldn't wake me up. So, needless to say I don't have the ability to have a normal job and life because this stuff just takes over any ability to wake up. Since I reduced my dose to 40 mg, I am experiencing serious withdrawal symptoms &amp; feel like I'm crawling out of my skin....similar to Lamical withdrawal. My advice, don't start taking on top of another bi-polar med if you don't absolutely need it!

This medicine gives you narcoleptic like symptoms, where I even fell asleep at work and ended up hitting my head ouch.  I sleep for 12 hours a day on this drug and I feel lethargic.  Not the best drug, but I recommend it if you don't mind sleeping and are fearful of gaining weight.

It must be carefully taken and administered for proper therapeutic use. I take it for the negative side effects of my illness and it works quickly and well. However, the startup side effects are very uncomfortable and can be nasty. I was started on 60mg at night and it knocked me out and made my manic the first 3 days. After this period it made me sleepy at night and not too manic. However after about 8 hours it would clearly begin to stop working and made me agitated. So now I am on 60mg morning and 60mg after supper. It works very strangely with food. If you eat a high fat/carbohydrate meal it can make you seem a bit lethargic so I eat high fiber (fruits and veggies) and it is milder. In all it has been a lifesaver!

It has really helped with my mood swings and manic part of my bipolar.  I tried several other medications such as sequel, effector er, depokote but none have been as effective as geodon.  It does make your blood sugar go up but this is tolerable with diet and exercise.

I started out at 80 mg at night and was bumped up to 160 mg at night about six months ago due to a severe depressive episode.  Since then I have gained 60 lbs - about 10 lbs a month.  My cholesterol is also very high.  I have had withdrawal side effects a couple hours before my dose is due.  Have developed weird finger movements and a constant sense of restlessness.  Have also experienced leg pain.  Finally convinced my psychiatrist that geodon does indeed cause weight gain for some.  I'm in the process of weaning off now.  Am down to 120 mg a day.  Going to see how low I can go and still be stable.  Have tried other drugs but geodon works the best for my mood.  I just can't take weighing 245 lbs.  
Bipolar Depression	Roy G Biv, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	5/16/2010 9:00:27 PM	Overall, I feel that this is a good medication, The Depression has faded, and the only real problem is that I sleep too much. Currently I am on a low dosage, and expect it to be raised next month. I am glad to see this med work, but I have a problem with the cost, my first month's dosage has cost me over $200.00, so if they raise my dosage, the price will rise accordingly. So I guess I will just have to find a way to deal with the price along with the sleep? I have tried about 20 other depression / &quot;atypicals&quot;, etc type medications and nothing else has shown any promise, until Geodon. Currently, Geodon seems to be the only medication I have taken that shows any real promise, I am looking forward to the next few months....If it continues on this path, I will just have to deal with the cost and the sleep issues.

Other	indianamac88, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	4	Male	19-24	5/15/2010 6:34:37 PM	I am using Geodon for &quot;autistic headbanging&quot; and autistic mood disorder. I have high functioning autism (Asperger's Syndrome) and have problems with over stimulation. I was started on this drug while taking Zoloft, Effexor XR, and Ativan. The firt few days it knocked me out about an hour after taking it (at night after a meal) and made me manic during the day. It also had a numbing sensation all over my body it also makes me shake (or feel like moving when I am not moving). This has slowly decreased however, around dinner I feel symptoms again and the subside after my next pill. It has stopped my head banging about 98% but has some nnasty symptoms. Of course, I need this medicine because headbanging is self harm and could kill me faster than the medicin could. So all in all it has been a life saver, but I may try something else someday because the symptoms are a bit unsettling at times.

I feel 100% better!

I was unable to move my tongue or speak. It was as if I was having a stroke, or a seizure, it was awful. When the paramedics came they gave me a massive dose of Benadryl, and that brought me out of the problem I was having. It took about an hour for my face to unfreeze. Hospital said it was a typical allergic reaction to a medication.No more Geodon for me.

This drug is a God send I take one twice a day and that's it, just one pill twice a day instead of 3 to 5 pills twice a day.d I also have to applaud Pfizer, they have a customer care program that I qualified for my prescription costs $750 a month even with insurance (which I don't have) its still almost $200 a month, their customer care program sends my monthly prescription to my Dr.'s office free of charge not even shipping.

Within 15mins of being in the house, my tongue started to swell up, and I couldn't talk. It twisted from both sides, and it looked like I was talking through a hole. 911 was called, and it took a big dose of Benadryl to get me out of it, and they took me to the hospital, where they described it at as a severe Dystonic reaction to a drug. The tech on the ambulance, said it can cause the eyes, tongue, face, neck, arms and neck to freeze right up. The hospital said I must never take any of these drugs again.
Schizophrenia	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	4/12/2010 11:42:16 PM	I have had very good luck with drug but I do think I get a side effect of some agitation and difficulty concentrating in the late afternoons.  We have treated this with Symmetrel 100 2x and Inderal 40 2x.  I have also found that taking 150 mg Wellbutrin twice per day has helped ease this problem.  The only problem I have had is this side effect my doctor calls akithesia.

My first night i took 80mg and then the second and from there one I will be at 160mg. The side effects hit me bad! runny nose, sever drowsiness, dizziness, and weakness. Besides that my mood has been really good! I'm totally more motivated and excited about the day. But hopefully these side effects will wear off. I can't go another sleepless night.

Recently I sat with him durig the duration of the meds (7pm-12 midnight.)  He becomes frozen in mid stride.  I can guide him, but he is unable to move at all on his own.  Lock jaw - you bet!  He cannot speak, or even swallow.  My concern is choking.  This stuff scares me, what are the options?

Shortly after that there was a tragic death in the family but this drug kept me feeling happy and positive. After a while the effects started to diminish so the doctor would keep raising the dosage. With that I noticed that the side effects effected my sleep if I did not take it early enough in the evening. This brings up the only problem I have with this drug; if you miss a dose youre going to notice. If I forget to take it I will not be able to fall asleep at all, and if I still havent taken it after 12 hours of when I usually do I will get really sick.

I lost 30 pounds in about three months. I have kept the weight off. I had some muscle tremors that effected my handwriting, but they have almost gone away. Overall this is a great medication, and has really kept my mood stable.

I started off on a lower dose but had to increase it about a year ago due to a breakthrough episode.  I think that it causes my sugar to be out of whack sometimes as I now have some peripheral neuropathy but I am not diabetic.  This has  been a great drug for stopping manic episodes and with the increase stopped some visual sensations that I get before an episode.  It is the first thing that I take when I get out of bed in the morning.  I was taking this with Lamictal but had to discontinue that due to a rash, but I have been fine for quite a while.  It does make you sleepy at first (I take 2 before bedtime) but that does wear off after a while if you can stick with it, it is well worth the benefit.

I have had hallucinations (Diagnosis: atypical psychosis) for four years and was previously on Abilify with horrible side effects. The Abilify even made it worse! My doctor prescribed me Geodon and I've been on it for four days with wonderful results. I know that four days isn't all that long but my psychotic symptoms have cleared up completely and I have had no side effects. I just take 40mg after dinner and I'm good to go!!!

I slept for 18 hours missed work and couldn't wake up to get my child to school. When I tried to walk I would fall into walls or anything near me. I was so dizy it made me vomit and I felt like the room was throbing. If your going to take this drug for the first time I would take it when you don't have anything important to do.

I am on 60mg, in the am and 80 at night. I am wondering if the 80 is too strong, as I fall alseep without warning. I aonly weigh 86 lbs, so will cut down to 60 for both day and night. I must admit, this has been a god send for me.

Once I figured out that geodon was causing me to be extremely agitated, intensely distracted, inorgasmic, hyper sensitive, then the physical stuff started!  Bloody noses, blurred vision, chronic diarhhea, severe abdominal cramping to name a few!  That was enough for me!  I'd rather go back on Lithium and be a little chubby and much, much happier than to continue to take the 5 meds I take now (geodon, lamictal, topamax, celexa &amp; kolonopin) and feel like garbage!  So , I decided to stop the 80mg of geodon - &quot;cold turkey&quot;...I DO NOT RECOMMEMND THIS TO ANYONE - EVER!  I stopped taking it 3 days ago and have been so I'll, I'm in bed 24/7!  Nasuea, vomiting, no appetite,  can't keep food or liquid in, headach, bodyache, flu like symptoms, horrible cramping - so painful that I stay in the fetal position most of the day!  This medication SUCKS!  I read that it's not even approved by the FDA for the treatment of bi polar!

I have been taking lithium, lamictal, emsam and xanax without much, if any, relief.  Last week I thought that I would be going into the hospital due to the irrational sense of dread/doom that I was experiencing.  I was terrifed for no reason, could not sit still, I was nearly unable to speak and I had no idea why or what to do about it. I was on the verge of an emotional, mental and physical collapse. Within 30 minutes of taking 40 mg of Geodon I could literally feel the hyper-anxiety/panic draining off me like water in the shower.  Today I am feeling great but like I am on speed that has been dosed with extra speed.  I also have had insomnia for 3 nights and a depressed appetite. But I'm not unbearably tired, I don't feel &quot;high&quot;, my hands are not shaking any worse than usual and I feel mentally in control for the first time in a very long time. Maybe the other side effect is I can't stop talking.  But anything is better than what I felt last week and for the past years.  I don't know what will happen in the next few days or weeks but right now, this minute, I am happy with me and with my life.  I don't remember the last time I've felt like this. I'd like to sleep tonight but if I don't, that is okay.  The me that was lost is back. I am going to say a prayer tonight that I never lose her again.

I am having several side effects and I am trying to shell the storm to see if it works. I have stomach problems such as nausea and vomit; I have allergy reaction: itchie eyes and nose and waterly eyes. I have sinus problems. all these problems I did not have before I started taking this drug. I noticed that females seem to react better than males to this medicine. Has anyone done a study to see if if this med is gender oriented? I have taken several meds and nothing seems to work for depression, mood swinging, anxiety, paranoid, and other related symptoms. I am not too please with this med.

Bipolar Depression	Bipolar roller, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/18/2010 8:38:02 PM	Ive been on Geodon for a year now just increased to 200mg. Of the three medications  serequil rispordal and Geodon, the geodon has worked the best. Some side effects for me are Ive lost 40 lbs , sweat alot when active and dizziness when medication is wearing off. But its a small price to pay for the good that it does.  Ive been stable for a year now no relapses. It has helped me to focus and calms me down from be anxious. The one thing I can say bad about the Geodon the my copay for the two scripts that I use each month. Can't wait for the generic lol.

My initial psychosis lasted for 2 years!; my doctor was trying to bring me out of it with Zyprexa - it failed. He then tried Seroquel - it failed. Risperdal Consta brought me out of it, but made my depression worse, plus, I gained 30lb's on it. I went off of it [Risperdal] for these reasons and ended up having subsequent episodes until finally trying Geodon. I had a minor episode on Geodon at a lower dose (80 mg) and finally worked up to 240 mg. The psychosis went away and I have absolutely no side effects! No weight gain (even lost what I put on on Risperdal) and no worsening of my depression. In fact I even think my depression has improved! What's confounding is why Geodon sales lag behind everyone else. I know why, but it shouldn't be in my opinion. I think I'll be staying on this one. Don't know what I would do without it.
Bipolar Depression	jdesm0c, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/6/2010 4:01:28 PM	Geodon was very easy to take, which is great when I have so many other things on my mind. It has made me slightly more emotional(sentimental), but this is the first time in years I haven't thought of killing myself. It did however cause many unpleasant side effects, like twitching, inability to sit still, cried a bit more frequent, didn't help with my inability to sleep cause of racing thoughts, but very good for my depression. I am now on Lamictal....hopefully I can get the plus's of this medication...and be able to sit still lol.

I have had BAD side effects, most likely from this drug. I have almost every symptom that the side effect list has. My doctor told me to take 2 pills a day,a total of 80mgs. He did not give me enough to get to my next appointment and I could not get a hold of him. SO I had no choice but to change my dosage to 1 pill a day,40mgs. Three days after I did this I started experiencing these bad side effects. Bad anxiety, I am VERY shaky inside and out, muscle twitching which includes my whole body and face (T.D), my mouth is moving weird, my breasts hurt very badly, cant sleep, nausea, etc..... This started 5 days ago. The first day was the worse my symptoms slow down a bit but have seemed to stay where they are at. I have been calling all over to ask for advice since I could not get a hold of my doctor. I even went to the ER. Everyone told me I had to talk to the doctor that is treating me and there is nothing they could do AND NOT to stop the pills because my symptoms could get worse. I cannot wait to get off this drug and I would never recommend this drug to anyone. Needless to say I have to find a new doctor to help me off this drug since the doctor I have obviously  does not care about his patients. I am very afraid to get off this drug. I do not like the way I feel or felt. But I am scared to stay on it...............

I was numb - again down one leg and in some finger tips.  I have wierd vision at the moment.  Lsat night, I thought I was high on acid or something (never tried such drugs) while I was driving home, and I was scared out of my mind.

I thought I was doomed to taking Risperdal since it fixed the mania's, but it made me more depressed and overweight, until I tried Geodon. Geodon controls my bipolar problems with no side effects! It's wonderful.

The nurses had to start doing bladder scans before and after I went to the bathroom, well at least tried anyways. I was a few cc's of fluid short of having to be catheterized thankfully. By the third day the doctor thankfully took me off of it. Yeah it was only three days, but these three days seemed like forever with the pain of the pressure I was having from not being able to urinate.

I've been Bipolar for 6 years now, and have used Abilify since my diagnosis. Being on Geodon now has been terrible. The side effects are intense, and often overwhelming. Insomnia, weight gain, headache, and lethargy have been my biggest adversaries. My moods still flux at random, often making me feel as though I'm not on medication at all. I'm extremely dissatisfied with this medication, although I can say that the pills go down easily. Other than that, it's awful.

Bipolar Depression	laBohem, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	11/23/2009 12:39:15 AM	I took this drug over 6 years ago for manic depression, nothing else had worked. As I am very sensitive to psych meds, my Dr. started me @1/2 the starting dose. Within 48 hours I was in the ER with a concussion. The medication gave me the worst vertigo ever and I fell over cause I stood still for too long. My BP on arrival was 80/55(was normally 115/70)and my blood sugar was so high, one nurse asked me how I could be awake. Over the course of the four months I was on the meds(w/ one decrease in dose)I suffered at least 2 injuries a week due to either vertigo or passing out without warning. I was always so weak and stiff, I didn't want to sit up, none the less get out of bed. I gained 30lbs in the first 5 weeks, despite eating very little (mostly applesauce and other things that I could drink/not have to chew. I was really just too tired to chew).My limbs felt so heavy, like they were cast in stone, that I took to sleeping on the couch just to avoid the stairs.My boss made me take FMLA time after I was rushed to the ER(for stitches in my head and burns on my hand)for one of my fainting spells (I was a line cook).When I talked to my doctor about all this(over the course of those 4 excruciating months)he told me it was impossible, those symptoms only happen to one in 10,000 people. He refused to take me off, citing that I also wasn't taking even half the starting dose. I talked to my family doctor and after what seemed like a gallon of blood's worth of tests, all negative, took myself off Geodon.All my symptoms went away within 48 after I finished weaning(except the weight I had already gained).Throughout this time, I never felt the tiniest bit less depressedMy advice: If you experience severe drowsiness, vertigo, nausea, fainting (or any other side-effect severely) stop taking it right away. Its not going to get  better. I only mentioned the largest effects of the drug on myself I didn't mention the headaches (from dehydration) or the stuttering and tremors, etc

I still have a lot of trouble sleeping.  If I miss a dose, I get very upset and scared and sick.

Before geodon I was on zyprexa witch made me gain about 30lb so I was switch to geodon which is just effective as zyprexa maybe even better. Hopefully now I can start to lose weight which I already starting to.

Bipolar Depression	Eva, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	11/3/2009 7:10:14 PM	This medication changed my life. I felt great, more energetic, clear headed and productive.I felt hope. Then I began to experience severe jaw clenching, headaches, stiffness, and what I termed a buzzing throughout my body.  My doctor put me on Cogentin for the symptoms which caused blurry vision and severe dry mouth.  I was told I would need bifocals.  I also began to use laxatives weekly to combat the severe constipation. After getting a second opinion I switched back to a low dose of Abilify.  I feel defeated.  Weight gain is an issue for me on Abilify and on the Geodon with the aide of diet and exercise I lost 40 pounds.  It somehow seemed to lower my appetite. I feel okay with my somewhat controlled mood swings and thinking disturbances. But nothing like the stability I experienced on Geodon

After three years of depression, agitated dementia, delusions and hallucinations I was given an injection of geodon while I was in the hospital being treated for a separate medical condition.  Within twelve hours my mind had cleared, I was lucid, I no longer had delusions and hallucinations.  I was ME again.  I thank God and my doctor for this medication.  I've been taking it for over two years now, and have had no recurrence of the problems listed above. My memory has greatly improved, as has my general cognition.

We will have to continue to monitor this as we are concerned about heart problems.

The water balance is tricky with not too much water to flush lithium and preventing water loss with geodone. Overall works well.

I had so many highs and lows in a week it was insane. I noticed a big difference the first day I took this medicine. I have been on it for over two weeks and I have not once felt depressed. I advise taking it at night bc it made me very drowsy about 4 hours after i took a pill. I am more forgetful, have muscle twitches, and sometimes its hard to express my feelings when i speak....the side effects are worth feeling happy and normal again :)

My dr. is slowly doubling the dose (weekly) and taking me off two anti-depressents; paxil and effexor.  Yet i have not experienced any extreme depression!  I exercise at a gym and find that i can concentrate better thus relieving myself of associated pain)  I have fumbled from med to med for 30 years, if Geodon continues to relieve my symptoms, I have found my grail at last.  ps.  this stuff is quite expensive, i pay 65 a month because its a tier 3 drug on my health plan.  Oh well, it works! lillian jackie ps ps i could not have written this post before Geodon (amazing)

I noticed weight gain in the abdominal region and this concerns me.  However, my moods have been much more stable.  I also take two antidepresssants (Wellbutrin and Lexapro) in addition to taking Klonopin for anxiety.  What I noticed after an incident in 2004 is that I cannot handle the stress of a demanding job and was very concerned for the future.  I took assessment tests and found that although my inteliigence was intact, I realized that my capacity for stress diminished alot.  I sometimes become easily frustrated and cannot always follow direction very well like I used to.  I still worry about where my career moves will take me and financial stress is common.  It has been 5 years since I have been able to work a regular job.  I have held down at least 3 jobs at minimum wage to make ends meet, which took a very bad toll on me.  Currently, I am very concerned as to my future and what my career options are.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	2	3	Female	45-54	9/30/2009 6:17:16 PM	My 18 year old daughter was prescribed Geodon 20mg twice a day to go along with her Lexapro 20mg. After a month of not feeling better, her psych increased the dose to 40mg twice a day. After a few weeks, she is sleeping all day if she takes the morning dose and can' sleep at night if she forgets to take the evening dose. If she doesn't take it all day, she experiences &quot;withdrawal&quot; like symptoms. Headache, anxiety thru the roof, etc. Gradually, she has become nauseated, experiences dizziness, feels like her muscles are 'clenchy' and twitch, has restless leg syndrome, gets red splotches on her face and feels as though she cannot relax. Because it was gradual for her, we didn't realize that the symptoms could be from the Geodon. But the more I read, the more I think that they are from the drug. She has a med/eval with her psych tomorrow and I hope to get her off of this. Even though she feels like it's the best MENTALLY so far that we've tried with her Lexapro, the side effects are incompacitating her and she cannot function on a daily basis. This simply is unacceptable and I will try to find her something else.

The only side effect I seem to be having is the drowsiness. There are times I could drop to sleep in a blink of an eye. I don't like that when I am trying to drive my grand-daughter to school. But the benefits outweigh the side effects.

We don't always eat right at the time suggested by my doctor, but we have made good changes to help with that and taking it on time makes a difference. I have experienced a side effect with it, I wake up around 4:00 a.m. and go back to sleep but I keep waking up until it's time to get up. However, it makes me tired and I go bed around 9:30 or so, so I get anywhere between 7 and 8 hours total sleep, so I feel fine. I have only been taking it for four days, so I am hoping that the side effect will go away and that there wont be any others.

I started out at 40mg, then 60mg, then moving up to 80mg.  The side effects are horrible.

My only complaints are that I am having trouble staying asleep.  I've been up every morning for the past 10 days between 2 and 4.  I'm hoping this is a short term side effect.  I haven't met my new psychiatrist yet but will definitely speak with her about it.  I hope this will pass.  I don't want to get off this drug it is too effective in all other areas with minimal side effects.  I also don't want to add a sleep aide to my nights.  I've also experienced an internal feeling of tremors in my right hand and arm but they do not show externally.  Hope this helps.
Additional Medications to Treat Depression	Suzanne, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	8/26/2009 2:22:52 PM	My 20 year old son was taking this medication for 2 weeks to help him with his mood swings and depression. After 2 weeks of taking Geodon he started hearing voices telling him to kill family members, and was seeing bloody images on the walls. He came to me to let me know something was very wrong as he was hearing the voices. He had been becoming very upset and hostile after the first week, and not able to sleep. He ended up hurting his brother and having a panic attack. The doctors at the ER said to not let him take it anymore. His med doctor called the next day and asked us to increase it double which I refused. I would NOT reccamend Geodone to anyone unless they are under complete supervision and care of a professional for that first 1 month time frame. This is a very scary drug.

My 1st expereince was very scary for me. I ended up getting the side effect tardive dyskinesia(prob spelt wrong)I went to the ER and they dismissed me saying I had an anxiety attack. I went the whole weekend unable to sit still. The good thing I had alot of energy. I am currently taking Lithium, Depakote, and Seroquel the combo is still not helping thats when my Dr. recommended the Geodon again. He knew about my previous experience and he thinks the other doctor started me on too high of a dose. So I've been takin 20mgs at bedtime and it will be increased little by little. I read some of the comments and today I fell not sure cuz of med or jus cuz i was clumzy. So far Today I feel really good. Better than I have in a really long time so I hope it keeps going that way.

I advise taking it at night because it causes severe drowsiness. Overall this drug has helped me alot. It puts me right to sleep which I believe is a neccesity for good mental health.  Side effects are worth the benefit of this drug.  No more highs (which I miss kinda) and defenitely no more lows.  A cool balanced medium. It has negative affects on my tryglycerides, and cholesterol.  Causes faint feeling upon standing. Blurred vision also.

I think I actually may have felt &quot;normal&quot; for the first time in my life! Then about 3 weeks into taking it I started getting extremely sleepy during the day - to the point of falling asleep while driving my child to school. Very dangerous. I was at the time taking 40mg in the am and 40mg in the pm. I called the doc and mine was on vacation - the doc on duty cut out my daytime dose so I was just taking the nighttime 40mg. This did not help the sleepiness for the first 2 weeks, but made me go berzerk! I started feeling depressed again, I was irritable, had the racing thoughts, the whole bit. This week the sleepiness finally went away and I saw my doc today. She upped my dosage at night to 60 mg to see if I can handle it without being sleepy during the day to try to work back up to 80mg but take it all at night, hopefully without the sleepiness during the day. I hope it works, because the drug itself was doing wonders for me - but I can't be sleeping every where I go!!

I've been on it for almost 2 years and my only complaint is that occasionally it makes me extremely tired. However out of all the meds I've been on this one seems to work the best for me with the fewest side effects, though I know my experience isn't the same as everyone elses.

For me it causes sleepiness and sleeplessness...thought that was a little weird. It causes some jitters but not any worse that I've seen lithium do to people with bipolar. Benefit of Geodon is much greater than the side effects.

I couldn't sleep with out this medication and when I did take the medication it put me right to sleep.&#160; Now to the better part.&#160; When I would wake up in the morning I wouldn't have any of these side effects, however I was my normal self.&#160; Very unusual, to say the least.&#160; My recommendation is to not start on the medication unless you are really in need of a change.&#160; But if you begin and need to go off for any reason expect to be up all night and for several nights with flu symptoms and severe anxiety.&#160; Hope you found it informative.

Had an anxiety attack,but cont'd to take the medicine. saw my psych. and was told to go to 80mg starting that nite. Did so, got really restless. took 80mg last Friday, had another anxiety attack in which after I felt like a total zombie, called my psych, and was told to go back down to 60mg. Did that up until 2 days ago when I decided that the med. was too much. Then came the with drawls. Not pleasant at all! Sick, felt like I wanted to vomit, couldn't sleep, etc.. Now I am 2 days off of it, not 100% myself. The dorn zombie feeling won't/haven't pass. While on it.. it made me very paranoid, sensitive to sound (esp. birds), major racing thoughts, anxiety,lack of appetite, dry mouth, and over all was not good.

I take the Geodon to help treat my PTSD and associated mood disorders. I have not been on it long and I can already say I am tired more. I am in a drug fog. And I feel that my moods are just on flatline. It feels as if I am still on the Depakote on Halodol. The only difference is my liver is not in as much danger as before.

I am getting to where I am finally not so tired anymore, and my concentration is getting better, but still not 100%...  But now that everything is getting better I feel as though the depression is going back in the wrong direction and I am having sucidal thoughts at times..  Hopefully it will all level out soon!

When we got there, my bus driver couldn't wake me up. I remember flashes of my teachers carrying me into the nurse's office. I then remember drooling and hearing their voices asking me what was wrong. I was trying so hard to answer but I kept falling asleep mid-sentence. I ended up going to the hospital and sleeping for 16 hours straight with an I.V in my arm. bottom line: this medication was dangerous and detrimental to my health. Thank God I didn't drive to school that day.

He is also on Celexa and this was added to his treatment program. They started him out on the 20 mg/day program. He was doing OK at that level. Almost immediately after they increased him to 40 mg/day he arrived in hell! He was constantly nauseous and vomiting. He constantly complained about feeling dizzy and &quot;just not himself&quot;. He met w/ his psych today and told her he's not messing around with any more meds other than his Celexa. His sugar levels are all screwed up and he is nervous and shaky and can't even relax to sleep at night. I can't wait until this is out of his system. I'd rather deal with him being on-edge than have him throwing up all day!

Well, it helped me sleep. A lot. If I didn't get at least nine hours of sleep a night, I was drowsy (almost unsafe-to-drive drowsy) for the whole next day. If I missed a dose, I couldn't sleep at all until I took it again. I had to stop taking it when my insurance ran out and I couldn't sleep for several days. Definitely not worth the price to me.

( out of 100).  Over two time the level of triglycerides appropriate for the body to be healthy.  I could go on and on.  I flushed the geodon out of my system for 7 days, had the blood tests repeated, and the results came back with everthing normal.  I will never let another doctor talk me into taking geodon again...ever.  My doctor told me that if this was not caught as soon as I asked for blood tests...I had a pretty good chance of forming leukemia (white blood cell counts above 30,000).  Please be careful with this drug.  It is so new and there really needs to be more information available to potential patients.

We thought it might be helping; however, on day five she had a terrible reaction - her head was turning back over her shoulder with severe pain in her neck &amp; back and her mouth was drawing... we thought she was having a stroke.  Benadryl and a trip to the ER corrected the problem, but we immediately stopped the medication. Very scary!!!

My blood glucose levels were off the charts, and if I was even half an hour late taking the dose, I would experience withdrawal symptoms, as though it was a street drug! This past August and September, I refused to take the medication anymore, and I experienced 19 days of severe withdrawals, even after having lowered the dosage over the course of more than a month. I have been down the road of kicking drug habits in the past, and getting off of Geodon was worse than anything I've ever dealt with. And the worst part of all is that I haven't had a single psychotic relapse in the time it's been since I stopped taking the drug, but my former shrink had refused to even lower the dosage, even after I showed her what it was doing to my blood glucose. If I could, I would ban this drug from the entire planet. The &quot;benefits&quot; not worth going through the withdrawals and the worsening of Diabetes.

From the very first day I took it I felt dopey and giggly and strange- it scared me because I felt sort of &quot;out of it&quot; but the worst part was my legs at night- felt like restless leg syndrome that I've seen on tv!!  I've never had this before and it was horrible! I was kicking in my bed all night.  Also, I was becoming increasingly nervous because I couldn't stand the TOO HAPPY and dopey feeling.  I have 3 kids to manage and I have to be able to function.  I stopped taking this drug after only three days but I still felt the strange effects in my system for two more days.  I wish I could just find a regular anti-depressant that works.  No more anti-psychotics for me!

It stopped my racing thoughts.  Then after a couple of weeks, I began to have severe panic attacks.  Felt like a heart attack, like I would die.  These attacks increased in frequency and severity, until I was in the ER every week, with dangerously high blood pressure.  I now have permanent heart damage.  After my last anxiety attack I took myself off of Geodon, and within a few days, began to feel better.  I have been off it for a couple weeks and have no anxiety, no panic attacks, no more insomnia.  I can actually take care of my toddler now.  This medication robbed me and my family of enjoying my child's first year of life.  It has been hell and we can never get that time back.  But I am lucky to be alive.

I experienced a side effect called AKATHISA.. where I felt physically jittery both inside and out.. had to take deep breaths even though I wasn't short of breath, couldn't stop chewing the inside of my mouth and cheeks as well as tensing my jaw and grinding my teeth. Knees, propped up on the balls of my feet, were bouncing up and down faster than I could if not in this condition..and my mental state was foggy at best.. found it hard to express thoughts.. type emails.. even put in an emergency call to my Psychiatrist.. who told me to take 100mg of Benadryl and assured me that the feeling would pass and was temporary. He has taken me off both Seroquel and Geodon. Having gone through this, I can understand how someone could become self destructive..it felt like I couldn't stand being in my skin.. I repeat this was a PHYSICAL feeling.. I was not 'imaging' it or 'out of touch with reality'.. Patients should be warned of this. I don't ever want to experience that feeling again.

Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	22kcarter,  Female  (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female		12/23/2008 1:49:13 AM	I am 25 scared about female side effects. I have been on geodon for two months now, taking 80mg a day. much better mood control, and no racing thoughts. I feel alive again and in control. I was on abilify for two years and this doesn't make me a robot. however, I was put on depakote a few years ago which made me gain 80lbs in two months,and gave me polycystic ovaries, as well as making me prediebetic.all of which went away. but i am concerned because I have  skipped a period and seem to be gaining weight rapidly. having read that it increases prolactin in females, It makes me sad because this drug really works for me mentally, but it might not be worth the risk. 
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	12/22/2008 9:28:32 PM	I was put on Geodon at age 24 after a suicide attempt.  First I was put on Zyprexa 7.5mg, that worked great but I gained almost 40lbs in less than two months. Not cool since I am or should I say was really fit. I was switched to Abilify.  That did NOTHING at all.  I couldn't even tell I took anything. No change at all. So then I was put on Geodon. I was told it was good for me and would lower my cholesterol.  Not that that was an issue, but anyways. I started taking it, and became very very very very very ill.  I was throwing up all day every day. I pretty much lived off of freeze pops for over a month.  I was in and out of the hospital because of dehydration once or twice a week. Sorry to say I lost all of the weight in less than a month. I asked if it was my geodon and he said that that was not a side effect. I actually was sent to the cancer unit and tested for lukemia, hepatitus, lupus and even HIV!  Very scary but none of which I had. I finally stopped taking it because I thought since I was throwing up so much that it was not even staying in me.  Immediatly I got better. Dr. said I had to take it again.  So I did three days later after feeling wonderful. And within 2 or three hours it started again. I called my Dr again to tell him I wanted to stop taking it. He said it was a coenceodence (spelling?)and to not stop it! I waited a day or two, I was fine.  Took it again and got sick AGAIN! He still thinks I had a stomach bug. I refused to take it, and he refused to see me. My new Dr. said that it is a rare side effect but it is listed.  I'm glad someone listened!

I have bouts of restlessness during the day that only seem to be getting worse. I am also on trileptal. used to be on lithium but the side effects + weight gain were too much for me. My doc says I am having tremors inside my body. used to take Inderal with the lithium to stop from shaking. Now she gave it to me again to help with this type of &quot;inside tremors&quot;. Just started today with that. Hope it helps. This stuff makes me want to jump out of my skin. But every other med of this kind make you gain weight. I have gained 60 pounds in the past 1 1/2 years due to meds. I also have spinal problems and arthritis so I cannot weigh this much and its hard for me to exercise to lose it. So I will stay on the geodon and hope the upped dosage of trileptal and the Inderal help me.

I took Geodon for 2 days and felt miserable on it. It made my arms feel restless and ache so bad I couldn't sleep. My arms and legs felt very heavy and I was very weak. On the morning of the second day I started having trouble talking, felt like my tongue was numb or enlarged, Had difficulty swallowing and I was experiencing spasms so bad on the left side of my face I couldn't keep my eye open. Ended up in the ER because I was having such a hard time swallowing I thought my throat was going to close off. If considering taking this drug just make sure your aware of the side effects because they are brutal. Not the drug for me.

At first it worked wonders. For the first time in almost two months he was laughing, joking around and being himself that we all missed. I noticed a huge differnce right away and it worked. Although it made him anxious and jittery. When he was relesed from the hosptial he was doing well. That night though, he started getting really aggitated and anxious and couldn't handle anything. He kept complaning of feeling heavy, having panic attacks, confused and hazzy, ect. I took his car and drove him home. The next am at 7:30 he called and said he was feeling funny, worse then the night before and that he was having more attacks. He came over about 10am and hardly could walk up my stairs and was exausted. He kept saying he couldn't breath right. I took him home and his step dad and I took him to the ER. He was having reactions to the medication and was dehydrated. He felt better when we left and we went on with our day. Again, at dinner time he started acting the same. He went to bed real early and got up again real early. The third night he got really irritated, annoyed, panicy and anxious and kept saying he was going crazy. It was really quite scary. His mom called the the dr from the hosptial stay and said to stop taking it immidently. That was last night. Today he is still very stressed and anxious and feeling like crap. This is the 7th or so med he has tried in the last year and a half. Nothing has worked. But this has had the most noticable side effcts. I've read lots of horror stories from people who have had to take this med long term and I am so glad he is off of it after a week. It costs a fortune. He was wonderful health insurance and it cost 80bucks on top of the other expensive meds he is on. I do not reccomend this drug.

Originally was on Geodon for a long time with no side effects and excellent results. Went off due to cost but back on again with help from Pfizer. A little dizziness the first day but at 120mg now everything is fine. The best medication I have been on for manic depression. It is to note, I use this medication with lithium. I have been on the lithium for many years but always needed something extra to help.

Geodon has been amazing compared to Zyprexa, Risperdal, and Seroquel. I have been on it for 1 and 1/2 years so far I don't feel as tired and lethargic as I did on those other medications.  I also don't eat as much as I did on the other medications.  That also might be due to other medications including Lamictal, Neurontin, Vyvanse, &amp; Prozac.  I did have an episode in March of this year but I haven't had an episode since then. Geodon is a must have when compared to other medications in its class.

I had a few side effects when I started bt they subsided. I take 40mg in the afternoon and 120mg at bedtime. Over the past 5 or 6 mos I been having problems with constant mouth motions which is very noticable.  I never connected this with my meds.  While visiting my Internist today she advised me to see my Psych right away because this is a form of TD and could become permanent. I've also noticed that I have a hard time speaking -can't grasp the right words and my memory is awful.  I use Cymbalta to control depression and after trying Wellbutrin, Litihum, Tegertol, etc etc  I was happy to have found this combination that seemed to be working.

It was very helpful for my symptoms, though, and I really don't care how I look. I will always be different from everyone else. I am being weaned off of it due to increased paranoia (not from the Geodon) and the weight gain. Mind you, I've been on it since it first came out, so the weight gain was not sudden. But like I said, it changed my life and I am now in college with a great GPA.

I've only been on Geodon for a week and I am me again! Yahoo! I am going through an ugly divorce, was forced out of my own house and had to move where I had sisters in another state. So, my depression was worse than it's ever been. To the point I had suicdal idiation and admitted myself to a psych hospital where I was for 8 days. They put me on Lithium. I couldn't function AT ALL on Lithium. Almost wrecked my car; fell asleep sitting up during family get togethers; couldn't manage my finances; I couldn't think straight. I threw the Lithium down the toilet. We all have different body chemistry, so maybe it works for some people (Lithium) but, not me. The combination of meds I am now on are really working for me. Geodon; Lexapro; &amp; Klonipin. Now I have energy, good clarity, and I can sleep at night. I literally pop out of bed happy in the morning. Before, I couldn't get out of bed or my house and felt totally hopeless. I hope my experience helps someone else.

Stepping up on the medication takes too long. My Dr. is having me go from 20 to 40 to 80 mg over 3 weeks and I'm just getting to 80 mg starting week three. SO MANY SIDE EFFECTS! I can't stop moving/bouncing legs. When I get the restlessness feeling, I feel like I need to be doing something. I'm anxious and paranoid. Sitting in place for extended periods of time are impossible. It also gives me fevers/sweats. My hands are almost always clammy. Sleeping is very difficult as well. BUT, enough about bad stuff. It did level my moods. It also made my sex drive go down to normal as well. Driving is a much safer and happier experience now too.

At first it was horrible, there were so many uncomfortable side effects such as muscle rigidity, having to constantly move, shakiness, and some parkinsonism. My doctor actually had to prescribe Cogentin to help with the side effects. For some reason, I stuck it out. About four months later, the side effects disapeared completely. The following two years the Geodon prevented episodes well with no side effects. However, two weeks ago I have a full blown manic episode despite my compliance with my medication. Since then, I was taken off of the Geodon and put on Seroquel. The Seroquel has many undesired side effects. I miss the Geodon. So anyhow, give Geodon a shot... it worked for over two years for me.

After terrible side effects of Lithium tx. and awful mood swings. My Dr. gave me Geodon to try. The first day I was a bit sleepy, but starting with my second dose, I became very clear minded and actually felt like I had energy of a normal person. Not manic energy.  I have been able to sleep consistantly with out sleeping meds.  This has been the wonder drug for me. with no side effects.  I think if you are in a mixed state it works.  No side effects at all. I only take it in the evening with dinner, and lexapro in the am. I was scared of all the side effects but they never happened. I am so grateful.  Maybe this can help sombody else.  thanks

Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/11/2008 10:36:31 AM	My pdoc gave this to me to use in conjunction with weaning off of Lithium.  I am also on Lamictal currently.  It is the first time in nine months and eleven different medications, that I feel like myself again.  I am actually able to leave my house, enjoy my life and have energy.  I am incredibly sensitive to rx's, so to find anything to relieve the side effects of going off of Lithium and not have any reactions is a Godsend.  Every body is different and this drug does target a certain pathway and chemical in the brain, so it won't work for everyone.  For me, I actually have hope now that I can live with this illness.  Oh, and I've been stable for almost a month now, the longest that I've gone.
Schizophrenia	trebe, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/9/2008 11:01:26 PM	When I was started on geodon the side effects scared me.  The only problem i had in the beginning was sleepiness which went away in 2 weeks.  This drug changed me from a zoombie to a fully functioning human being.  I was even able to eventually wean off my trileptal and zoloft, which made me feel even better.  This drug has changed my life for the better, I think with true clarity and can't imagine going back to those zoombie drugs like seroquel ever again.  It makes me so well that non-compliance will never be an issue.  In fact the opposite occurs, when low on pill count i replace as early as possible.  I take 160 mg a day and the hallucinations fade to the background, and i can live a good life now.

Started at 120mg now on 40mg in conjunction with Tegretol. What negative side effects are from Tegretol or Geodon I don't know but I have a lack of energy now, finding the right words is tough, loose balance sometimes, and most of all is scary that my heart feels like it races at times and a slight crushing pain in the rt side of chest now and again. It feels different than anxiety symptoms. I have been on it for 6 weeks. Considering switching but all have some side effects like weight gain and severe drowsiness. I am a light weight on drowsiness. I hate to change again and miss more summer or risk paranoia.  I take it for bipolar I (affective) disorder with psychotic features. Hope that helps.

I am truly happy and I have to say that for me Geodon has been a miracle drug.

I've dealt with depression and anxiety for years and have been on Lexapro 40mg for 2 yrs. It worked great, but the 2nd yr into it, I began to feel extremely anxious. I was on klonopin for it, but hate the way it made me feel. My doc put me on Geodon and within days, I felt great! I'm happy, cheerful and energetic, which i haven't felt in a long time. My brother is now on it and he is pleased with the medication overall, too. The only side effects I had was weight loss, mainly because it curbed my appetite. I also noticed it made my hands sweat alot, but that isn't that bad!! I recommend it to anyone who is depression or has anxiety problems, not just bi-polar or schizo.

However I do take it at night and am kinda groggy in the morning but overall I've had good success with this meidcine so hopefully the rapid heart rate wont come back again.

This drug made me have to go to the ER. Which I'll skip the details here but it was scary. Never having the sort of reaction I did have scared the living mess out of me. I had to go to the ER because I had my eyes rolling back in my head and I had my tongue making me look like an idiot. What fun. I hated this drug and will never take it again. When they give you this drug they hope that the benefits will out way the side effects. Losing control of your facial muscles are serious and scary side effects. I didn't see a benefit. Those that are taking this drug please just be careful and those that are considering taking this drug I can't tell you that it won't work because who knows it very well could and work out to be the best medicine for you but just please be careful. Not that anyone asked but I ended up in the ER less then 3 days of first taking it.

I am happy, lots of energy- feel like a new person.  I am afraid that it is too good to be true... can't afford eyes rolling back in head, lock jaw, inability to talk when I am alone all day and most nights with a 3 year old and 7 month old- Don't know what to do?

One thing I wanted to mention...his doctors have warned that this drug is INEFFECTIVE if not taken WITH FOOD.One psychiatrist stated that he needs to ingest at least 500 calories when he takes it. So possibly a few of the patients with reports of failure haven't taken in enough calories with their geodon.

My daughter is 10 and has been diagnosed with MR and high functioning Autism. She continues to be very aggressive and has outbursts and mood swings at the drop of a hat. We just started taking this med a month ago and have mixed feelings. Often she has come home from school and we hear stories about a rough day or a portion there of and she is very sleepy after the afternoon dose. Does this medication get better or are we going in the wrong direction and should try something else? any suggestions?

I took it for 4 days one of which I wound up in the emergency room with palpitations, high blood pressure 148/108 , stupid doctor told me I had coffee jitters.  I slept 6 hours in 4 days. I had restless legs unable to stay in any one position for more than 3 minutes. Eyes rolling around in my head during the day! Horrible horrible horrible medicine! My worst nightmare ever!

Is this drug used to treat insomnia or am I taking something I don't need? It works sometimes to help me sleep, but at other times it doesn't. When it does, I am fine while I am awake, but the next morning, it is impossible to shake the feeling of wanting to sleep all day, but that only happens sometimes, so that makes me even more confused!!!

I take 240 mg and it organizes my brain and takes hallucinations away.  This is the foundation of my treatment for Bipolar and Borderline PD. I take other medications too, but this is the one that helps the most. Will make you sleep. I took it when I was pregnant with no harmful side effects to my baby.  
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	Annon, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	19-24	2/20/2008 9:11:08 AM	After first two days I felt much better for part of the day--was even feeling happy. Then I began feeling extremely anxious. At night I felt clobbered, so extremely exhausted. Then, after about a week, when I was up to 100 mg/day, I had a distemic reaction which landed me in the emergency room. After a few days off Geodon, my Dr. reintroduced it with a medication to counter the distemic reaction. At this point I am up to 40mg/day.I still feel awful and then 2 days ago I began hearing voices. Has anyone heard of this happening? Could I be having the opposite effect from the Geodon--could it be causing psychosis? I am also taking Depakote, and was on a small amount of Clonzapin but only for a week, and my Dr. was having me go off of that. On the day the voices started, I had only taken .25 mg of the Clonzopan. (I had been taking .5/day for most days and at the beginning of the week had taken 1mg/day for two days--I have a history of benzo abuse, so this was all a very low amount for me and I have never suffered from withdrawal from other benzos I have taken.)My doctor thinks the hallucinations could be from Clonzapin withdrawal, but I don't see how that could be. I would appreciate any feedback.

I had my best day ever yesterday! If I stay calm after my dose at night I will sleep, like a log, but if I get moving(like in the a.m., I make myself go!!),I get over the hump and am fine. So if you're like me , you may need to practice deep breathing and stretches for your night dose, and some lite stretching and gentle motions for keeping going in the a.m. 1/2 caffeine coffee helps, too! This drug is tough, but I see light at the end of the tunnel! If that changes, I'll let you know. Hope this helps someone, and thank all of you for your thoughts and reviews!
Manic-Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	2/13/2008 10:55:23 PM	In terms of ease, I had to take three 40 mg pills at different times each day.  That was annoying.  Rather than preventing anxiety, Geodon caused me to undergo extreme panic attacks, tremors, and twitches.  After a while these twitches began to involve half-second blackouts where I'd become entirely disoriented and my torso would twitch very hard.  After a conversation with my doctor I discovered that this was a type of seizure.  WOAH.  That scared me away from antipsychotics FOREVER.  If you have this twitching sensation please alert your doctor IMMEDIATELY or it could become a permanent problem.  Overall I was extremely frustrated by both the drug and my doctor's 'beat-around-the-bush' attitude about it.  This is a serious medication and should be treated with extreme caution.
Additional Medications to Treat Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/7/2008 8:38:06 PM	I feel like I am having the opposite effect re: sleepiness.  I feel almost like I have had a whole pot of coffee - a little too hyper and feel like the tremor that I know I have (from Paxil) is worse, even though it isn't.  My mood is very up, I have TONS of energy, I pay NO attention to negative thoughts.  All of this is great but, as a nurse, I am a bit worried about TD and wondering if any of this jittery/hyperness is TD, early. I am not concentrating as well as I would like and am wondering if this will tame down.  I am on a low dose, 1-20 mg tab daily at night and have only taken 3 doses. I have been told to increase to 40 mg in 2 weeks and I can't even imagine how I would feel if I did that.  Any thoughts anyone?

It works very well and I am overall pretty satisfied so far.

The other 85% I was stuck with a constant sense of severe anxiety, restlessness (esp. in my shoudlers), still waking up in the middle of the night despite the tranq effects it had.  Good drug but VERY strong - be prepared to set aside a few days to get used to it.  I was just too sensitive for it.

I had experienced panic attacks in the past, but this time it was more severe.  We had to rule out lung or cardiac problems.  It was determined the medications had triggered excessive anxiety, prompting the migraines, extreme panic attack and chest pain.  This was an uncharacteristic reaction to this medication (so they tell me).  But the first few days, I felt ok.

I take 40 mgs in the morning and 80mgs at night. My only complaint is that the 40mgs seem to wear off around lunchtime to early afternoon and I'm not due to take the other dose for another few hours. I'm sure a dosage change would fix it. Otherwise, no complaints (other than cost).

It has helped with some of my general anxiety, phobias, and taken the edge off my depression, but has done nothing for my insomnia. About a month ago, my pediatrician tried to take me off, and I was sobbing uncontrollably in school and having up tp 20 panic attacks a day. As soon as I told my psychopharm. he put me back on and I'm back to normal.It also actually helped with a slightly odd problem I have as well; I get visual hallucinations, but do not have schizophrenia, psychosis, borderline or epilepsy. Geodon is the only thing that helps with this, and I find it to be amazing, even if it doesn't help with my insomnia...

I've since taken every class of drug, at least 40 drugs including MAOIs, tricyclics, SSRIs, aphetamines like adderall and ritalin, even hydrocodone had some limited effect, but all to no avail. After reporting some psychotic symptoms to my doctor recently, I was given Geodon in addition to Lamictal (somewhat helpful) I already was taking. Rather than being sedated, I have more energy now and the voice is quieter and I'm less paranoid, all good things. I have some hope now that I can be treated effectively after 16 years of frustration and hell.

Other	Jared, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	25-34	12/21/2007 1:32:25 AM	Geodon works well to control symptoms of schizo * bipolar.  i think I have a mild case of schizoaffective which is schizo + affective (a mood disorder like major depression or mania.  I am much less agitated, /w less motor activity, I think clearer, and I am not as paranoid or suspicious over things so much  This is the closest thing to a panacea (cure all).  My complaint, though, is that some doctors prescripe aggressively instead of trying to find the right dose.  The best dose is usually the lowest dose that works well.  For instance, the 80 mg x 2 a day was making me very tired, so i switched to 60 x2 and i am doing much beter now.  Interestingly, it also helps treat OCD and tourettes, although it has not been approved by the FDA for that.  My OCD symptoms are less.  I think it augments (makes greater) other drugs.

I also missed a period altogether.  I take it with Lexapro, and the combination works for me, though with the weight gain that Lexapro causes, I'd like to try something else.
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed		5	5	4			11/2/2007 4:55:26 PM	Lamictal, Cymbalta and Geodon. Excellent combination.  Thank Goodness I am off the Risperdal.  That was making me gain weight immensely.  The only side effect I had from Geodon is mild sleepiness and for some reason I have this taste in my mouth like I swallowed aspartame or something sweet like it. Other than that I lost 8 lbs and I am in control of the anger/mood swings. I highly recommend Geodon.

After a year I was put on Zoloft, then Lamictal.  The combination of all three are wonderful.  The only bad thing I had to say about Geodon is that I lacked emotion and had no motivation...that's where the Lamictal came in handy!!  I don't want to take any other drug.

It really stabilizes me without the weight gain I experienced on Zyprexa.  I have no side effects other than a little sleepiness either from the Geodon or the Depakote or both which is easily remedied by drinking a couple cups of coffee.  This has been a wonder drug for me.  I highly recommend giving it a chance.
Manic-Depression		5	3	4			10/26/2007 9:02:58 AM	After manic episode with psychotic features 2 years ago placed on 160mg of geodon and depakote.  After 1 year I was taken off depakote and geodon reduced to 40mg for maintenance.  Doing well with no side effects.
Manic-Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	10/25/2007 7:00:18 PM	I was on Geodon for over six months. I struggled to get out of bed, and felt the need to hide all of my emotions. Lost any feeling of motivation and passion. Became very depressed, had the majority of the side effects. Took me almost a year, to find confidence in myself again after getting off Geodon. Everything is different for all of us, and I don't believe that Geodon was the right drug for me.

He took it in the evening and fell asleep within one hour, was unable to wake up in the mornings to function at school and was agitated by afternoon.  Dosages were increased and decreased but produced the same effect.

This medicine caused me to break out in cystic acne, so I took myself off of it. I stick to Lamictal, Seroquel, and Elavil.
