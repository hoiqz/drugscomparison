For some reason the last 6 months I was losing my memory. I told my doctor and she said go off of it for 10 days and see the difference. I did and within 48 hours I was a new person. I havent gone back on yet and fear that I may have problems later. I need to come up with something.

I am always tired, trouble sleeping,and in the past two weeks have noticed that I am unable to taste my food. I could not figure it out until I researched Simvastatin. Yes, that is a rare side effect. I took my last pill last night and will see my MD next week. I sure hope this side effect is not permanent. I too wish I would have done moreresearch.... I am upset!!!!

Was lower with the Lipitor, but my Dr. is pleased with this. Since I can get a 3 month supply for under $15 with no insurance, I am staying on this.

It finally got so bad I couldn't eat much and in 2 months I lost 21 pounds. After 3 doctors and numerous tests, no one could tell me what caused this problem. While talking to a friend, he told me of his bad experience with this pill. The next day I quit taking it and have been pain free for the last 6 months.I almost believe this medication should be taken off the market.

Everything OK except for a lot of waking up at night.  Then it happened- a rash that slowly started on my neck and spread to my arms and legs.  Super itchy and weeps when I scratch it.  Stopping the drug.  Only 2 days and the rash seems to be not as itchy.  I'll deal with diet and exercise instead of this pill. No more statins for me.
High Cholesterol	Bonnie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	4/20/2012 7:07:57 PM	I was prescribed 80mg. Simvasatin. It seemed to do the job and I didn't notice side effects at first.  About 6 months later I felt like I was in a fog. I passed out, hitting my head, went to hospital for stitches. Heart, brain, blood tests didn't show anything wrong. Felt awful, afraid to go out for fear of passing out again. 3 months after that I got muscle cramps in my leg and my shoulder hurt so much, I could hardly comb my hair.  I saw a report on tv about dangers of taking 80 mg simvasatin. I stopped taking it because of the muscle problems.  They eased and to my surprise, the fogginess I felt lifted also.  I still don't feel I have strength back in my muscles.  During this time I was in the hospital twice and doctors kept telling me that my medications were not causing this.  
High Cholesterol	rjl0727, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	55-64	4/19/2012 7:26:08 PM	Took 3 pills.... arm pain, shoulder pain, back pain, leg pain.... Stopped, however Doc said &quot;need to take&quot;, waited 1 week this pain continued, but I was convinced I needed to work through it... (wrong decision)... took for apx 6-7 more days and this pain increased, Has not decreased yet.have been off this for 2-3 weeks now and will not take another pill... Doc says does not believe simvastatin is the cause... considering new Doc.  Why take a pill to prevent heartproblems if it makes you feel like $*&amp;%#, or wish you were dead already, after stopping the symtoms have not gone away, and from what I have read may not be likely to.

Normal dose is 40-80 mg daily. He started me on 5 mg and the only side effect was a slight itching. So he increased me to 10 mg. after three weeks I developed significant muscle pin nd joint spin. Worst of all, I developed intolerable itching from head to toe; eyes, ears, nostrils---everywhere including my back and stomach itched like no tomorrow. I'd rather be dead than try to tolerate this terrible it. I stopped the drug on Sunday night, Apriln1, 2012---the next day the itching completely disappeared, never returned, the pains disappeared as well. This is the worst drug I ever took. Even when I was taking it, my cholesterol nd triglycerides INCREASED. Do yourself a big favor and try something else. Today my doctor prescribed 5mg Crestor. I'll let you know how it works in a month.

Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	TBF, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	65-74	4/7/2012 10:41:29 AM	I'm now on Simvastatin (last three months) after being on Lovastatin for a year. The latter was so debilitating, I stopped taking it.  Tryglicerides shot way up.  I'm also disgusted with Simvastatin and ten days ago started taking half doses.  I could not walk any longer, right shoulder pain, extreme leg fatigue, and I've gained 15-20 pounds although my diet is almost perfect 'recommended'.  I can't excersize, I can't even even go grocery shopping.These statins besides turning me into almost an invalid, have caused memory and congnitive issues that have essentially changed my personality completely.  There are other side effects, but I can live with those.  I'm comfortable with the normal progression of aging, and expect as I age to be able to do less...but I did not expect to become 'elderly' virtually overnight.  Although the muscle weakness and pain is supposedly a rare side effect, I have recently discovered that two good friends (in different countries) and my ex-husband have completely stopped taking them...in his case, he had to completely give up playing golf which is his passion.  They have all decided, as have I...that they are just not worth taking, even if they do work.  All four of us had side effects that forced us to completely surrender the lifestyles we were living.  Besides the golf thing, one friend had to quit working, another invested in a scooter thing...and I have no life anymore.  I get nothing done and every time you turn around...I'm napping.  I do not know if suddenly stopping the Lovastatin caused a rebound effect making the tryglicerides shoot way up, so I'm weaning myself off of Simvastatin.  Regardless...I'm not taking statins anymore.But I'm wondering how many folks have also refused to take them, and stopped doing so.  In my case, everyone but one person I know have stopped except for one who does not appear to have any side effects from Simvastatin.  My mother (85) who is more mobile then I am.

After 4 months I started having back ache problems. Went to the Dr and he sent me to therapy. $750.00 later, back still ached so I went to a different Dr. I told him that I had muscle aches in my forearms. He right away said &quot;Simvastatin&quot;. Stop the drug for a month and see what happens. Well I have been off it for 16 days and my back has all but quit hurting and the muscle ache in my forearms is going away also. This stuff is poison. Will not be going back on it.

Problem is extreme muscle cramping in my legs.  Mostly thighs.  Some days it hurts to walk.  I am 63 years old and can't possibly imagine this kind of pain for the rest of my life.  I am seeing my physician as soon as I can get an appointment.  This drug should be off the market.  I have hot flashes and heart palpitations and fluttering. Heartburn and head pain.  I wake up in the morning and count the hours until I can crawl back into bed.  I don't even want to face the day.  I feel just plain lousy.  Wish I would of read these reviews prior to taking this for the first time.

Dizzy to just turn head from the left to right. Was put on simvastatin for a second go round of statins....after awhile same thing, this time I didn't wait until it got that bad. stopped and the same thing happened pain and dizziness left.Now am on niacin.They wanted me to go from 250 mg for a week and increase each week by 250 until I am on 2,000 mg per day. I said NO, check after I had been on ONE 250 mg pill a day and see FIRST. and my lipids is already down. I do not need 2k a day....sheesh.

After 2 days my mussles hurt everywhere. I started coughing and it's been a month and hasn't gone away. Exstream exhaustion. I quit after 4 days and had to be tested for mussle damage. It's not worth it. Change you diet.
High Cholesterol	JMdestiny, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	11/24/2011 2:39:33 AM	I have been on Simvastatin for several years.  When I walk, I have pain in the upper right leg.  It's still there.  I believe the muscle has been affected.  I also have been experiencing heart palpitations, irregular heartbeat and sometimes my heart would just race.  Wore a 24 hour holter monitor.  Results were normal.  I stopped Simvastatin and after about 6 weeks, my heartbeat returned to normal.  Plus...just found out Simvastatin should not be taken in conjunction with Diltiazem.  Negative results.  Yes, I was on both.  The possibility of dangerous drug interactions is real.  My doctor took me off of Simvastatin and I'm now trying Pravastatin.  Will see how I do.  Also, my doc suggested I add fish oil to my regime daily now for triglycerides.  To be young again!

Reduced to 10mg, symptoms went away. Added a fiber supplement. In 2 months, total cholesterol dropped from 295 to 190. Not sure which to credit, meds or supplement, but since the dosage is so small, will probably stay on both.

While the medication has done a good job with my colesterol, it is destroying my body, and I have just now figured it out that this drug is the reason why. It started with tingling from toes up my side to my face, joint aches and pains, then it really started getting bad. I had such pain in my left shoulder that it felt like my muscle was ripping apart. I was sent to a sports medicine doctor that said it was a frozen shoulder and gave me exercises to do. Not working and now I am having the same pain in my right shoulder. Coinsidence, I don't think so. I am also having pain in my right back muscle near my kidney. I thought I pulled a muscle but it comes and goes. I am tired all the time, and thought all of the hot flashes and night sweats were due to menopause from stopping my primerin. But these systoms are continuous and dibilitating. I am urinating less and a darker color and odor. After reading all of the comments on this website I have called my doctor and I AM taking myself off of this medicine! I just hope I am not too late. By the way the memory issue is crazy! Actually I thought I was getting alhezeimers at 56! I even had my doctor check my memory with a test. Not bad but not were I should be at my age. Wish me luck!

I immediately gained 10 pounds and gradually 10 more pounds. I am a runner and this slowed me down considerably. Several months after being one the drug I experienced muscle cramps in my legs and sometimes feet. I read where CoQ10 would help this symptom. It did for about 2 months. I told my doctor and she took me off and I immediately lost 10 lbs and have gradually lost 8 more. Leg cramps almost immediately subsided. My running times have immensely improved.

Caused high cholesterol.Took simvastatin 20's for 3 months, then 40's for 3 months.Started experiencing muscle fatigue,insomnia, shortness of breath, hot flashes, chills, fever, lowered system defense against colds, flu, etc.,lowered effectiveness of thyroid medication. This, in turn, increased cholesterol. Caused resumation of low function thyroid problems. Have stopped drug. Will have a full blood panel in 30 days. Found out Fish oil, flaxseed oil, red yeast rice,garlic, proper diet and exercise are probably best way to go.Also good multi-vitamin, but no extremes on vitamins.People with over active thyroid have been frequently prescribed statins to lower same.People with low or no function thyroid should be very careful about statins. Should always try to take natural derived drugs and no synthethics either.

I had shoulder pain and the reason I stopped taking it was a very bad pain in my back. I had been on 60mg once a day.  The Dr. confirmed a reaction and said this is so common with Zocor or Simvastatin.  He said more people have reactions to this drug. If you hurt in your joints and you are taking this drug, that could be the problem.

I got on this site when my Dr. switched me to Rosuvastatin with no warning (Veterans Administration). I am shocked.  Symptoms I have been experiencing and have been to pain management specialists over the years for with little results are the exact symptoms I am reading here over and over again. I thought they were side effects from other disabilities I have, now I wonder.  Thank you for all the helpful reviews, only wish I had found this site earlier! I am taking immediate steps to see if statins are causing these problems.

I have a constant backache, and my face is full of little spots/sores that are not pimples/acne.  I stopped taking this medication two nights ago after reading about the serious problems many people experienced.  I have also had a headache for the past week.  I see my surgeon today and will tell him I will not take a statin medication.  I will try other options, like diet/exercise/herbal supplements/fish oil instead.

What I exprienned was a slow onset of severe rare reactions:  higher than normal blood sugar levels (I'm a type II diabetic), connective tissue pain, weight gain, stomach swelling, inflammation and overall fatigue.  Those symptoms went away immediately after not taking a dose.  I was on it for six months and will not continue taking this drug.

Within the past 1-2 months, have been waking up in the middle of the night, unable to swallow and my throat feels so tight it's hard to breathe.  I've been to Urgent Care twice, and they tell me it can't possibly be simvastatin.  However, I stopped taking it on my own and after nearly two weeks, can sleep thru the night without feeling like I'm choking.  Will never take it again despite my doc's saying it's perfectly safe.

I took simvastain in a low dose and it nearly crippled me.  My legs grew weak and my right hip had such pain after taking the medication for just about 2 months.  I got up one morning and had to hold on to a wall to walk.  I had read all the warnings and knew this had to be the problem.  Doctor disagreed of course, but pain and weakness went away.  However, I have been left with a hip joint that &quot;cracks&quot; when I walk.  I started taking a non-statin called fenofibrate and started the exact same symptoms in my left arm.  Lost all strength in my bicep and couldn't lift a coffee cup.  Doctor telling me it is arthritis.  I have no history of arthritis and when I stopped the medication, most strenth returned.  Still have severe pain in the shoulder joint on occasion - and for no real reason when I pick up something.  I have also read that the &quot;mix&quot; of a cholesterol drug (not necessarily a statin) with other meds you might be taking can cause problems.  I'm now thiking that may be the issue with me and am shopping for a new doctor.  Give me another 10 years of life with low cholesterol and dealing with not being able to function normally, or 1 or 2 good years feeling &quot;normal&quot; - I'll take the 1 or 2 good years thank you very much.

Since taking this med I have had muscle weakness, fatigue, nausea, headaches, back pain, fluttering in my chest, muscle twitches and insomnia.  When I do fall asleep, I wake up hours later sweating, then get chills. Chest pain and shortness of breath was the last straw.  I stopped taking it 3 days ago and feel better except for some chest discomfort.  I'm calling my Dr tomorrow, this is bad stuff.  I'm glad I found this forum for information.

High Cholesterol	condoline, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female		7/29/2011 5:31:03 PM	Statins damaged my lungs (healthy lungs Nov 1994; fibrosis all four lobes and an area which looked like possible cancer - which it wasn't -on Xray ten months later). Quit statins shortly afterward; don't know why. Was off statins for many years because I traced my peripheral neuropathy to the same time period as the lung damage. No change in lung condition for years. Put on Simvastatin May 2009; May 2010, lungs much worse than before after being unchanged for a long time. Now permanently off statins.  Have researched what the cell biologists say about statins and it isn't favorable. Should have been taking at least 400 mg of CoQ10 while on Simvastatin, but that would only have helped me avoid the heart damage and additional lung damage the Simvastatin caused; the stirring up of a gene called Atrogin-1 is responsible for the leg muscle cramps I had while on the Simvastatin and the muscle weakness I still have. Wild horses wouldn't induce me to recommend statins to anybody - especially not a lipophilic statin like Simvastatin! Dangerous. By the way, interesting that the blog lines for people damagedby statins are many and long, over 400 documented deaths from statins 1997-2004 have been recorded - and yet every piece of statin research (mostly paid for by drug companies) says Simvastatin and other statins  are &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;mostly safe&quot;: doesn't this strike you as quite interesting? Also, research by cell biologists is now coming out saying that cholesterol isn't even the problem - but of course the drug companies can't put the Mediterranean diet in a capsule and sell it for a high price, or exercise, or a serene outlook on life, while they can put statins in a pill and sell them for plenty - and easy to scare people into thinking they need to take them. However, don't drop your statin on a moment's notice: you have to come off it gradually or risk serious harm to yourself. It takes 6 months for your body to adjust to no statin anyhow, so take your time coming off.

Been on Simvastatin 3 years, few side effects, and then within past 6 mos. bouts of diarreha, that lasted 2 weeks(no evidence of problem), and then the leg pain came. Can't sleep at night AT ALL! Excercise doesn't help. Quit the meds last fri. after reading what you all have written. Thank God for consumer feedback.  The drs. will surely not tell us these things. Will NOT take statins again.  will have to live with the high cholesterol (actually have read many articles now in med journals that it isn't as harmful as THEY say it is anyway.

I don't recommend it at all.

My legs ached all the time, my right side of my face drooped and I was having air and speech problems, that seem to come and go,  but all the blood draws and tests seem to show nothing, and I have even been to a speech therapist.  I have been so frustrated because my job requires me to talk on the phone.  Oh yes, I almost forgot the terrible, terrible rash on my legs that itched so bad it bled constantly.  I have had no luck with Dr's figuring it out so I quit taking sivastatin about 2 wks ago, and some things have cleared up.  I'll see how long it takes to get out of my system.

I have stopped taking due to so much muscle pain in my back and legs. I have been so tired I can't focus on any task. Memory loss has been drastic, especially short term. The benefits are not worth the pain. I'll take my chances with another heart attack! This should be taken off the market.

While on this medication, I felt pain in my arms and in my legs, and occasional pain in my chest.I also felt more tired than normal. I chalked it up to possible anxiety, however, I wasn't aware of anything that would cause anxiety. I ran out of this medicine two months ago, and the doctors office couldn't get me in for over a month. I just started taking this medicine again this evening, and noticed pain in my chest as well as my arms. I haven't had this pain in awhile. I didn't realize that this medication was causing these symptoms. I will be calling the doctors office Monday morning for sure. It is not worth the muscle pain and feeling exhausted all the time.

After one month liver function was checked as OK. Now it is being realised that greatly increased rate of memory loss is occuring with short term being seriously affected.  This did not occur with Lipitor. Also there is an increased level of diarhea and some muscle weakness. Time to change back to Lipitor!!

Doctor started me on Simvastatin.  Been taking it for a couple of years.  Muscle weakness is still present but not as bad.  Complaints to my PCP have been ignored.  Questions about this drug not answered.  I will be looking for a natural way to lower my cholesterol.  Ironic that exercise is recommended along with this drug but muscle pain and weakness keeps me from climbing stairs, walking, pretty much any form of exercise.

Due to arthritic problems I can no longer jog (I used to run 25-35 miles/week until 4 years ago). My cholesterol slowly crept up and it finally hit 253 and my MD suggested simvastatin which I started 10 weeks ago. After 6 weeks  on this med my cholesterol dropped to 172. I have experienced no side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, muscle pain, weakness, etc. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with this drug.

I am a very active person and it has been very difficult to even do my walking exercises due to discomfort in my legs. I had extreme gas for several months and then the diarrhea. I tried to stop the med and then resume, but the pain, gas &amp; diarrhea was just to much. I am going to try a natural product. I hope to have success with that.

I do follow Doctor's advise - No salty and fatty foods, and  work 30-minutes daily, I feel obsolutely healty. I cheat sometimes by carrying about 10 pounds of groceries, my wife hated me for cheating like this so I stopped cheating when I mentioned that I felt pain on my back below the shoulders, sometimes felt sour on my chest left side. She reminded me I should NOT carry weights during my 30-Minutes walk. They seems lite, but for a 1-mile walk, that is very dangerous, it could create problems for the Stents. Agreed

I took this medication for almost 2 years and had chest pains that would wake me up at night, also leg cramps so severe it was difficult to walk. Ask my doctor if this could be from the medication he advised that it wasn't and ordered venograms and arteriograms of both legs and all the while told me to continue taking the medication. Venograms and ateriograms all came back normal. Was told to continue to take medication. Finally, when the day came that I could barely walk do to the muscle cramping in both calves, stopped taking simvastatin. Within 3 days starting feeling better, stopped having cramps in my legs and no longer had chest pains. Switched doctors also. If your doctor will not listen to your symptoms, stop taking the medication and find a new doctor.

I AM VERY ANGRY THAT MY DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE PREEXISTING CONDITIONS INTO ACCOUNT. SO BE SURE AND DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK! I WAS LOOKING FOR MUSCLE PAIN AND WEAKNESS, BUT THERE ARE OTHER MAJOR SIDE EFFECTS. MEMORY LOSS, AND TROUBLE WALKING. CHEST PAIN (ANGINA TYPE) THAT WAS THE SIDE EFFECT MY WIFE EXPERIENCED. SHE HAS NOT HAD ANY ANGINA PAIN SINCE HER SURGERY 5 YEARS AGO, BUT ONE WEEK AFTER STARTING ON THIS MED, SHE HAD TO TAKE HER NITRO TABLETS. WE ARE GOING TO LOOK FOR A MORE SAFE APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM. BUT FOR THOSE WITHOUT SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, THIS DRUG DID LOWER MY NUMBERS DRAMATICALLY, AND OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

Beginning nos. were total chol 275 LDL 157 TRIG 194. After 3 months , total chol 174 LDL 71 TRIG 53. with diet,no exercise.After 5 months, started experiencing dry eye symptoms (burning,sensitivity to light and weather,seeing flashes of light, difficulty watching tv and doing computer work). Also my legs would ache after just 10 minutes of working out. Stopped medication after no improvement in my condition for 2 months. Its been 3 weeks since , my eyes feel 75% better and my legs are back to normal. I have done searches on the internet and found out that some people really do experience these side effects from taking simvastatin.Right now I'm in the process of figuring out what alternative supplement I can take. Hope this helps.

High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	55-64	2/17/2011 9:43:56 AM	I started taking med in April 2010.  After several months I started having pain in my right leg and often the pain radiated thru my whole leg.  Got so bad I was having problems walking and sometimes would be so bad that the pain would wake me up. After reading some of the comments of effects I stopped taking med about 2 1/2 weeks ago and the pain in my leg is almost non existant now and I feel so much better.  I also have a liver disease and was afraid of the effect.

At first, it was OK. Then I started having headaches and ear aches from hell. I thought it was stress, it was simvastatin. Then I started getting muscle aches and pains especially in the shoulder. I stopped taking the meds 2 days ago and the headaches, ear aches and shoulder pain have stopped. The side effects of this medicine are too painful to consider taking it further.

Now after 3 months, not so much. Also some numbness in my toes. Also better now. Had high cholesterol and tri's. At 40mg/day has knocked my total and LDL down to the lower normal range after only 60 days. Great job on that.  Hasn't done much for my tri's though, still 100 pts too high..

I started taking Simvastatin on Dec. 29, 2010...from the get go (12 hrs after taking) my heart was pounding so fast.  it would come and go all day long.  Even when I would get up during the nite to use the restroom my heart would start racing.  I couldn't believe it.  I truly thought of calling my dr. last week and asking for an EKG I felt like i was going to have a heart attack.  I did  not take this med. last night before going to bed and today i have had NO rapid heart beats at all!!  i plan to call my dr. tomorrow and let him know the side effect i had.  Please, anyone, just because you don't have any of the side effects that people have listed, listen to your own body and contact your doctor.

I took it for about 4 weeks with no side affects whatsoever. Then all of a sudden I had a body rash that was unbearable.  I wasn't expecting this and looked up possible side affects and there it was.  Now taking Crestor.  I've only been on for a week but concerned.  We will see.

Made changes in diet  and exercise. I slowly weaned myself off but started again lately and couldn't understand why I had unexplained weight gain. My knees and feet and then my hips began aching. I figured it was stress of extra weight but then I started the generic simvastatin and was having terrible cramps in my legs especially the insides of my thighs. I also have achy feeling between my shoulders. Decided to look it up and saw all these people with the same problems. I will wean myself off again and go back to omega 3 and try cholest off. Hopefully my workouts will improve also. (kickboxing and Zumba. Probably more benefits and less side effects. This other stuff is scary.

Muscles hurt too but did not attribute that to medicen. Then I had a pancreatitis attack. Since there is a small chance that was caused in part by Simvastatin, I am now off the drug. Never will go on it again.
Treatment to Prevent a Heart Attack	taw3, 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1		55-64	1/9/2011 10:11:32 PM	I was started on simvastatin in the hospital after a complete blockage of my right coronary artery which was relieved by angioplasty and a stent. In the beginning I didn't notice any side effects from the 40 mg. dose. It lowered my total cholesterol level from 301 to 147 which was great!. After 10 months it went back up to 201 which was probably due to my bad diet. So the doctors (both family doctor and cardiologist) recommended upping the dosage to the maximum of 80 mg. Immediately I started having muscle spasisms in my back that were so bad I was leaning sideways when I stood up to relieve the pain. Then I noticed pain in my left knee where I had never had any in my life. I had been experiencing this pain on and off for several months but attributed it to switching to a lower-riding vehicle and the manner in which I put weight on that knee when I got out of it. Finally, right after I started the higher dosage of Simvastatin I started experiencing shooting pain in my right upper arm when I reached for things behind me. Then I noticed that the range of movement of my right arm which I had never had any problems with before was about 60% of what it was previously. After an MRI scan was done I was diagnosed with a &quot;frozen shoulder&quot;. I have been doing some exercises to try to fix my back,knee and shoulder pain by strengthening surrounding muscles and stretching the tendons in my right shoulder which have helped quite a bit, especially my lower back and left knee pain. However, now I limit what I do considerably to avoid causing any more pain or muscle spasisms which has diminished my quality of life tremendously. I am going to try the CoQ10 to see if that helps and, if not, then I am going off Simvastatin and just try to improve my diet by limiting my intake of sugar and saturated fat.

The first night I started taking 40 mg my legs would not stop tingling. They tingle all day. I even got a charley horse the other night and now my knee hurts. All this is just from being on this medicine for 3 weeks. If I cut the pill in half, the problems are greatly reduced. My younger sister is on Lovastatin and has no side effects, but the reviews from others on that drug are just as ugly as Simvastatin. Statins are awful drugs.

I stopped a couple of days ago and it has all eased up. I noticed a difference even the first day off. I also had loss of hair which is getting better. I like so many others will have to really watch my diet and excercise because I won't go through that again.

My hair starting breaking off on the ends and coming out really bad.  I didn't think about the medicine could be causing this until recently.  I also started having pain in my right knee and again just thought I had pulled something.  I am now having pain in my left elbow joint as well as my right one. I do have numbness and tingling in my hands sometimes when I wake up.  I didn't attribute any of this to this medication until reading all of the reviews and looking at the side effects on the web site.  My dosage is 20mg daily.  I go to the doctor for my checkup next week and I plan to address this subject at that visit.  My cholesterol numbers have dropped considerably (way below 200), I could never get my numbers below 240 something before I started taking this medicine.  I don't know if I can continue on this particular one if the problems continue to get worse and this medicine is the reason.

Lungs stayed at same level until 1 year Zetia, which worsened the condition; then no change until 1 year of Simvastatin, which put me on supplemental oxygen and also started heart arrythmias and suddenly intensified peripheral neuropathy.

It has effectively reduced my high cholesterol. In addition, I was also taking taking Gemfifrozil to lower my tryglicerides which were over 1400 when I started. The combination allowed me to lower LDL to below 70 and triglicerides to below 40. I quit Gemfib after a few years (slowly!) and have restarted it just to tweak my triglicerides. Am taking 1/2 tab twice a day. Simvastatin is now being replaced with Crestor. I don't think I'll like it nearly as much.

Treatment to Prevent a Heart Attack	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	55-64	8/30/2010 1:18:29 PM	My father started taking this drug after a minor heart attack at the end of July. He has also a chronic disease of the heart called congestive heart failure (chf). About 15 days after been released from the hospital he started complaining about muscle pain, shortness of breath, weakness, and nervousness. We thought it was because of his heart failure, but then when he went to see his Doctor again the muscle pain had grown severe, he was hospitalized again to get the effects of the Simvastatin out of his system. The problem now is that to do that they put fluids in his body to clean the medicine out and because of his CHF his heart and lungs are full with fluids that do not let him breath well and he has not been able to sleep for almost 5 days even after taking a sleeping pill at night. He was following a very strict diet before and during the time that he was taking the Simvstatin, but at the end I think the side effects were not worth the pill.

High Cholesterol	Chelsea, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	8/26/2010 12:34:35 PM	I started taking this medication in March and a couple of months later I started feeling sick to my stomach, tired, and then developed aches and pain all over especially in my knees. It got to the point that it was extremely difficult to even walk. I really did not know what was wrong with me. Thanks goodness I did some research and also found this Web, MD page and read so many of the comments. It was looking at myself in the mirror. I finally stopped taking it about a week and half ago and am starting to feel a little better. My doctor agreed that I should stop taking it also. I am going to carefully watch what I eat and try to get in some needed exercise. My numbers were not that high so hopefuly all will work out. Please talk with your doctor if you experience any aches or pains and don't wait like I did.

High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	55-64	8/14/2010 12:19:57 AM	I am writting this to let others know it is possible to take simvastatin for a long period of time and out of the blue start experiencing problems. I've taken this med for close to two years. My cholesterol went from 289 to 145 within weeks, other numbers looked great too. No side effects at all. Thought I was home free. But no such luck. The past two months one thing after another, stomach problems, back aches, pain in my upper thigh, now my arms hurt just to blow dry my hair. Speaking of which, emailed my Dr. last month asking why my hair would be falling out. Her response was normal aging. I could go on and on. Finally it dawned on me, maybe the statin drug could have something to do with all these crazy things. Went to this web site and sure got my answer. Way too many others have same problems to be coincidental. After another email my Dr. tells me to immediately stop taking it and come in for lab work. So the onset of side effects don't always happen right away. I was so happy with the way it worked but guess I will have to resort to the old fashioned method (diet and excercise). Can't deal with the pain.

Now, I've begun to understand why. Muscle's support your skeleton. Muscle &amp; joint severe pain.  Tired,  most of the time, feel groggy. My doctor is thrilled BUT I hate this medicine.  The side effects do not justify the lower LDL levels.

Although his cholesterol was within the high normal range (below 200) his doctor prescribed it to prevent heart attacks.  Since that time, he has experienced ringing in his ears, headaches and fatigue. After 60 days, his cholesterol was exactly the same.

My MD upped the dosage to 20 mg in January. I also have been taking 2000mg Flax oil, 2000mg Salmon oil, 800mg VitE, and a multivit. No side effects, and I'm active , go sailing, go to the gym, cardio and weights, eat soy products primarily ( not a vegan, though). So I noticed some patches of light skin (I'm cauc, but tan well) on my neck and a small area on my chin- looks like mild vitiligo---thought it was razor burn, but I wonder if it had anything to do with the increase in the statin, which is the only med changed in 5 yrs, I'm 64, male and in good health.Anybody experience anything similar with this drug and /or interactions with Omegas 3 supplements?

I got contacts, started coloring the gray, and decided to start walking three to five miles a day.  I got debilitating &quot;charleyhorses&quot;, severe leg cramps in my calves. I would literally have to roll out of bed, and put my feet on the floor to get rid of the cramps.  I ran out of simvastatin, and the cramps stopped before I could get another refill.  I have gained 20 pounds, because I haven't exercised in about three weeks and haven't taken my pills.  I go to my doctor's tomorrow.  A friend suggested WebMD. Thanks, I didn't know a lot of other people who were taking this drug also were getting calf cramps.

Since that time, I developed a horrible pain in my left shoulder and ended up with frozen shoulder and many hours of physical therapy. I even had a manipulation done in the hospital to release my shoulder. I read user reviews on another website and many of the people also had frozen shoulder that were taking this drug. I stopped taking this pill 2 days ago and my shoulder hurts a lot less already! This drug needs to be removed from the market or doctors need to know that frozen shoulder is a SERIOUS side effect of this medication!

Increased Triglycerides and Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/10/2010 2:09:23 PM	I have taken Lipitor for years with no side effects.  Insurance changed and does not cover Lipitor, thus my MD started me on Simvastatin.  I have taken it for 2 weeks and am experiencing horrible joint pain, muscle cramps in thighs, calfs, upper arms, lower back and neck.  I have headaches every afternoon and in the mornings the last 3 days.  The joint pain and muscle cramps have made sleep difficult and pain severe when I change positions from lying down or sitting to standing and trying to walk.  Walking is painful and stairs are almost impossible.  I feel like I've aged 50 years in 2 weeks.  Additionally, my blood pressure has increased dramatically in the past 2 weeks.  I have taken BP meds for the past 8 years and recently was taken off by my MD as my pressure was doing so well.  I have arthritis that I used to take Motrin for twice a day, but with a new nutritional supplement that includes Omega 3s and fish oil, I have not required any Motrin for over a month.  Since I started Simvastatin, all of the gains with BP and arthritis have been negated and I feel horrible.  I've called my doctor and will see him tomorrow.  Meanwhile, I will not be taking this medication again!!
High Cholesterol	peppermint, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	5/8/2010 12:31:11 PM	Took 1 pill before bed - within an hour I developed a terrible itching - didn't sleep at all (not like me).  Got up early with stomach pains, weakness all over, headache, tingling - couldn't pick up my morning pill due fingers being numb.  Vision was blurry - it felt like an asthma attack.  My skin was on fire and hands trembled.  Needless to say I'm taking another pill and have left a message for the nurse.  Other statins gave me severe chest pains, but this is terrible.  Yes my cholesterol is high (LDL 206, HDL 65) but I'd rather take my chances than live with these horrible side effects.

High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	5/3/2010 12:47:04 AM	After starting this drug I started to have cramps in my calf's and feet.  I also have Crohn's Disease and on med's for it.  I am having problems with the Crohn's and it won't go into remission.  My Doctor advised me to go off of the simvistatin as it could be causing me problems.  I did so and it helped alot.  It is not the answer to my problems with Crohns but definately helped me.  I was changed over to Niacin for the high cholesterol but having the bad flush and rash and it lasting for a couple of hours.  Not sure what to do next!

I have severe muscle aches. Sometimes the pain is debilatating. Makes me feel like I am a hundred years old. Also the last bloodwork I had done showed liver damage. The Doctor cut the dosage in half, but I still feel weak and achy all the time. I am going to give this medicine one more month, then try something else.

Treatment to Prevent a Heart Attack	yellowrose, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	65-74	4/28/2010 6:08:40 PM	By the third day on 10 mg I itched all over and had neck/shoulder pain, foot/ankle pain and low back pain.  Gave it up when I fell while out trying to walk it off.  I stopped taking for a week and started again on 1/2 tab.  That one dose was worse than the previous three doses.  This time with shaking chills, a brain-busting headache, and stomach cramps with diarrhea within 2 hours. All of this having been on CoQ10 for the 4 months before starting.  My numbers were all within normal ranges, but the doc said over 60 everybody needs a statin.  The study says statins improve survival rates.  If I had to survive even one extra day feeling like that I'd do myself in today.  This one is off my shelf!!!  Nobody 'survives' this life anyhow and I chose to survive my time feeling good.

I went off simvastatin in Dec and noticed no improvement, after 3 months my legs were still so bad I was afraid they would never get better, after reading some reviews here I decided to try taking Co Q 10 , Ive been taking 300 mg a day, the cosco kirkland brand and I cant believe the difference I have had imediate improvement and I feel like myself for the first time in along time, I would encourage anyone suffering the effects of this nasty drug to give it a try, it worked wonders for me hope it will for you.

I also have had severe back and knee problems for years. I'm in pain all the time even after injections, could this to be related to this medication?

I am dissapointed that I had to find out about side effects prevention on my own; doctors didn't offer any ideas on how to prevent side effects (about taking Co Q10).

I had a physical shortly before retiring. I started taking this drug at that time. During the physical, the optomitrist told me I had a small cataract in my left eye and a spot in my right that was probably the start of a cataract. He went on to say that it would be years before I really had to worry about it.  18 months later, I had hazy vision and went in to have my eyeglass prescription changed. Turns out that the prescription had not changed, but I now have full blown cataracts in both eyes and they have progressed to the point that I need surgery. I read the side effects of statens and the main severe effect is rapid cataract growth. I was 57 years old when I started taking the drug.

Had incredible lower back pain that was crippling, when I woke up. Thought old age was catching up, non OTC pain releivers would touch the pain. It took me 4 weeks to finally attribute taking this med at night and the morning pain. Stopped takning and the pain is slowly getting better. 
High Cholesterol	informed, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	3/31/2010 9:41:04 PM	I've been on simvastatin for a few years.  Yes, it has lowered my cholestrol, HOWEVER, I have suffered from muscle ache and pain the whole time.  I made no connection tothe drug and attributed it to &quot;getting old&quot;.  (I'm a very active, in good shape, 61 year old female) This past week I have been suffering with severe, crushing pain in my legs, hips and lower back.  I thought it was the flu, however, after seven days of terrible pain that would not subside with any over the counter pain killers I went to my Dr. knowing something was terribly wrong! After full examination and many questions, he determined that this crushing muscle pain I was experiencing was a reaction to the simvastatin.  I have been off the drug for three days, and still I am in pain. Although it is beginning to subside I continue to have trouble getting up from a sitting position, and feel pain and weakness in my legs while walking, especially up stairs.  Sitting or laying down for more than thirty minutes is extremely painful, relieved somewhat by moving and slowly walking around the house. I am not a whinner and have always prided myself in the level of activity I enjoy, but I must say that this pain was so severe that it has stopped my dead in my tracks!  I am hoping that I'll be back to normal again within a few days and no permanent damage has been done.  What I do know is that I am going to attempt to control my high cholestrol  with diet and exercise. THIS Simvastatin is SCARY, SCARY STUFF and I am sooo done with drugs!

My doctor told me to take co Q 10 supplements along with my dosage.  I have never had any pain or problems reported by others and I have been on it for over a year. I believe that the CoQ 10 supplement has prevented the side effects of pain and stiffness.

Have been experiencing severe leg and knee pain on my left side, night sweats and extreme burning on the bottoms of my feet and numbness in my toes. I am also extremely tired all the time.Just went on a trip with 3 of my girlfriends to NYC to see a broadway show, could barely walk the several blocks necessary to get to the various things we wanted to do - we are all about the same age, and I was the only one having difficulties (totally embarassing and painful!). Came to this site to get some honest evaluations from other people using the drug - and I had an &quot;aha&quot; moment. Will be discontinuing use immediately and making a DR appt. Need to figure out a better way to deal with this cholesterol!

For the past week and a half I have been experiencing a strange fulness/lightheaded feeling in my head, a shaky feeling in my muscles, dull ache in my kidney area, and very vivid dreams.  I contacted my cardio doctor who suggested I either cut the mg down to 20mg. or to stop the meds completely.  I have decided to stop for 10 - 15 days and see what happens.
High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	3/17/2010 5:01:55 AM	I HATE hearing that generics are the &quot;same&quot; as brand name.  They are not.  I was prescribed Simvastaten, instead of Lipator.  Between the high insurance premiums, and prescription co-pays that we pay, I would love to take a generic.  I'm not prone to experiencing side effects from meds, but this one gave me severe muscle pain, and unpredictable weakness in my right arm/shoulder.  I could not lift my right are without a lot of pain.  Sometimes I would go to pick up something that I usually had no trouble picking up, and would drop it from sudden weakness.  My arthritis was also greatly aggravated.  I thought it was the natural progression of the disease, but now, seeing the difference, I'm quite sure the Simvistaten was making the pain much worse.  It took me a year to figure it out.  Talking to friends, and finding that 2 of them had to quit taking this (the only drug that we had taken in common) for the same reason.  What are the odds of 3 out of 3 of us experiencing the same side effect, that they list as &quot;rare&quot;.  I wonder how many other patients out there are having debilitating pain, and weakness that they can't explain?  It's so simple to fix....just stop taking this drug!  I've been on Lipitor for 3 weeks now, and although there is still some pain, and restricted range of movement, there is definite improvement.  I am afraid that the Simvistaten may have caused some permanent damage, as I never had pain, weakness, or limited flexability before.  The Liptor website offers coupons for one free month co-pay to new patients, and a $10 card towards your monthly co pay after that.  Hope this helps someone out there

I had panic attacks, heart palpitations, hair loss, memory loss, severe back and leg pain. No energy. Loss of breath, chest pain , itchy rash,hot flashes. My knees would buckle for no reason and without pain. I thought I was at deaths door until I found out what was causing all these problems. The doctors had me on so many pills to correct the problems that they didn't find the real problem. I found it on WebMd. and I quit immediately taking this drug. I was better in 3 or 4 days. I can live without the side effects of this drug. I have also reported this drug to the FDA. I still have reoccuring symptoms from time to time, but I have been off this drug since Feb. of this year. In other words about a month. I will never take this drug again.

Felt much better after skipping just one dose however it's been about a year and I still have burning pain in my right thigh which I'm thinking is permanent damage. DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THERE IS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT HAPPENING FOR THIS DRUG??  I can't work due to the pain and stiffness.  Pain lets up some if all I do is lay around for weeks at a time to rest it.  Unable to do any of the fun things that I used to because of the pain.  Has affected my marriage, too.

Switched to Vytorin 10/20mg in 2004 due to elevated triglycerides and saw excellent response.  On Medicare as of Sept 2009, so chose generic simvastatin to reduce costs.  Upped dose to 40 mg to offset loss of Zetia.  My cholesterol has jumped 80 points since April 2009 and triglycerides ~50 points, while diet and exercise remains essentially the same?  Did I get a placebo instead of the real medication?

I took this drug for 2 months until I was having a hard time walking and had a severe back ache.  I felt like I was 110 years old.  Nothing would alleviate the pain until one day a light bulb went off-its the simvastin.  I quit taking it and 24 hours late the pain was going away.  I would rather live with high cholesterol than not be able to walk or function period.
High Cholesterol	wanderer, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	2/28/2010 11:51:32 AM	I've been taking 10 mg dose for over a year. My cholesterol dropped over 60pts within the first month... even had blood analysis done with Berkley Heart Lab, which showed how my triglycerides, HDL and LDL rates had improved. Was very pleased and satisfied with that. But side effects are painful: the leg pain. Both legs, particularly the calves and feet. Have talked to my DR. She checked for PAD and ruled it out. She has no other explanation except possibly weight. I started working out in a gym to lose weight, leg pain persisted. Quit going to gym. I bought an elliptical machine. Use it daily, leg pain is subsiding only somewhat. Will give it another two months to see if the leg pain goes away. Feels like cramps, or the pain you feel after having a leg cramp. Hard to get up from sitting down position. Walking hurts when I first stand up. Stairs are very difficult for me. I'm only 56 and I'm a school teacher. I think I must look like at 75 year old when I walk down the hall. Have bought arch inserts for my shoes. That helps a little. I'm going to show my doctor this website so she can read the experiences of others on this med.

Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	Chanel, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	3	2	Female	45-54	2/23/2010 7:12:02 PM	I take 20 mg of Simvastatin daily. I have high cholesteral in my family and I have not been able to lower it through diet and exercise. I eat healthy. I'm very busy and I exercise daily. I've only been taking this for one month and I've noticed a significant weight gain - I'm gaining weight like it's going out of style and I eat fish and vegetables. Has anyone else see this side effect? Please respond.

Complained for years about muscle burning, exhaustion and flu symptoms. Was brushed off by Dr. and until finding this site in 2009 thought I was the only one with all these symptoms.I stopped the Simvastatin the very next day and switched to Cholestoff. Took nearly a month for the muscle pain and burning to stop.My last blood test was 190, but I'd eaten a double cheese pizza the night before the test. I'm now making better food choices and I'm pretty sure my results will be even lower this time. I feel better than I have in years. I will do what ever I have to (except take a Statin drug)to get my cholesterol levels down.

Take 40mg dose. Was very leary of taking this drug after reading the many negative posts. cholesteral was 298 at start, after 30 days of taking simvastatin it dropped to 123. i thought that was it but doctor said if i stop taking the drug my cholesteral would go right back up within 3 days. that part was a surprise. After 2 months still no side effects. At least i can get this prescription at Sams Club for $4 a month.

I had been taking it faithfully until I learned that a lady went out of her mind temporarily while on it.  When she was taken off of it, she got a lot better.  I don't know if this is due to the fact that she is in her 90s, or if she can't take statins.  I need to talk to my doctor about this, because it's been a couple months since I took it.  Now that I read other reviews, I think back on the fact that I got a LOT of leg cramps while on this.  I never made the connection with that.
High Cholesterol	LKHinOKLA, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	1/29/2010 8:48:05 PM	Within a few days of starting Simvastatin 20mg I began to have extreme calf muscle pain. I had ultrsound for possible leg blood clot, not the problem. Dr. can't find other cause, so I began to research my Rx side effects, and other testamonies are exact to what I experience. My LDL is now within normal range, tryglyc still high. BUT I am not willing to suffer daily with this med.  I stopped taking it and the cramps and fatigue stopped in a day. I will control with diet and exercise, no this Rx.

I just started this med (40 mg) last night and all day today I experienced weakness, jitters, muscle aches, joints hurt...could barely take my normal walk.(And I'm in good condition).  Definitely could not do the treadmill.  Called doctor who had me cease taking it.  I guess I don't understand how this could be on the market if so many people (and such an apparent high percentage) have these side effects.  Doctor is giving me some Crestor samples. So now that I have 89 more simvastatin for the trash..I'll have to pay a high price for Crestor (if it works).  Ah, modern medicine.

My only issue now is that I am very reluctant to take this drug again.

That is when I went from filling like I was 47 - straight to 90 - in 3 weeks. It was an awaful time. The doctor told me to take half a tablet, I did that for 4 days with no relief. I then quit taking them. It has been about 2 weeks and i feel somewhat better. The severe muscle pain has lessened. It is still difficult to get started in the morning. I am going to give it till monday, if it is not better, I have got to get something for the pain.

I am an active 45-yr old and suddenly felt like I was 75!! Fever with almost debilitating joint and stomach pain. I couldn't even walk properly--kind of had to do a shuffle-walk. I did not suspect the medicine for the first 3-4 days but my symptoms kept worsening and no one around me was sick. I was scared. I finally thought to check this website and I'm so glad I did! So many others have experienced exactly what I did. The good news is that 24 hours after taking the last dose, the scary side effects are almost gone. This was a very frightening experience--be careful taking this medicine!!!

Within days of introducing this drug into my body, I felt like I should have never started with this treatment. Have stopped meds as of 11/20/09!! I'm a &quot;natural cure&quot; kind of person and will try an alternative such as Omega 3 fish oil and keep a closer watch on my diet to see if I can lower the cholesterol on my own, without meds. My reported chloesterol was 244, not that far out of control. I'm glad I did the research!!!

I took that for about 1 1/2 years. It didnt do the job. I took Pravastitin and havd an allergic reaction. I've been taking Simvistatin for about 6 months. It has gottern my choleserol under control. I have other conditions that cause muscle tightness so I cant say that is a side effect for me. I am very satisfied.

I spoke with my pharmacist, which told me to cut it in 1/2 and take it every other day. Since I began doing this, I have felt somewhat better, but not 100%. This medication makes the left side of my body feel EXHAUSTED and as if I was dragging my entire left side of my body. It's an aweful feeling. I honestly thought I was having a stroke or heart attack. Think carefully before taking this medication.

Thanks to this Web site I know why I have suffered increasingly severe pain all over, muscle weakness and constipation. I am happy that it works for some people but this is not for me due to the side affects.I will call the doctor tomorrow and will not be taking any further doses.

As a result, I had rhabdomyolosis and almost died.  Simvastatin may work for some people, and it did reduce my LDL and trglycerides, but I am unable to take any &quot;statin&quot; drugs as a result.  However, there are other ways to reduce cholestrol including proper diet and other non-statin drugs.  If you are having problems with statins, I recommend you see an endocrinologist at a Lipid Clinic such as the one at UTSW Medical Center in Dallas.

I go to the bathroom at least 7 times a day and I am afraid to wander too far from work or home in case I have an accident.  My insurance does not cover Lipitor any more and I was switched to this medicine.  My feet hurt all the time, my back hurts, my neck feels like it is broken, my legs and knees feel like they cannot support my weight and I am so fatigued that I cannot even think of exercising.  I am taking myself off of this medicine so I can get my life back.  I am going to make an appointment with my doctor to discuss these side effects. I am so relieved to read that other are experiencing the same side effects.  Thanks to all for their help.

However, I have had severe side effects, mainly hip and knee joint pain and loss of flexibility.  Also hair loss.  My Dr. downplayed the joint pain as a side effect.  But thanks to many evaluators, this seems to be a common problem.  I am taking myself off this drug and see what happens.

I could not for the life of me figure out why, then I realized it might be the new meds. Decided to check WebMd, sure enough saw others were having some of the same problems. Talked to my doctor and he is asking that I give it a few more weeks to see if the side effects clear and wait for blood work. I will see how it goes, but if it gets worse I am going to stop.

I missed doses here and there, since I had to take it at night. I started noticing that I was sweating excessively and my hair would be soaking wet within 2 minutes. I didn't put two and two together until I started looking into side effects of all my medications and started reading  about Simvastatin. Reading about sweating, nausea, extremely hot flashes, extreme fatigue, increased muscle pain, and hip pain...among other symptoms. I have all of these and thought I was just getting more health issues. I am going to quit this medication starting today! And I hope to God that most, if not all of these horrible symptoms go away! I'm only 34 and feel 90.

I never told my doctor unitl a later visit and he said that this drug wouldn't cause that so he put me back on it. Within a week the same stomach pain which would keep me up nights and keep me from functioning normally during the day so I dropped it again and I will not go back on it ever. I haven't told my doctor yet but he insist that this can't happen but funny after being off of it for a few days the pain goes away.

High Cholesterol	Big &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	45-54	8/18/2009 11:08:59 PM	Started taking this medication over three years ago and have experienced severe fatigue, muscle cramps in arms, legs, hips, and neck.  I have also experienced hot flashes and severe insomnia.  In July of 2008, I stopped taking this medication.  In August of 2008, My cholesterol level was 288.  Extremely high!  Knowing the side effects of this medication, and knowing I needed to reduce my cholesterol, I started taking Cholest-Off by Nature Made.  This product contains all natural ingredients including plant sterols to help reduce cholesterol.  The difference with taking Cholest-Off was that I had to take 4 tablets daily with a meal.  I took two with breakfast and two with dinner.  In February of 2009, I went back to my doctor for lipid panel/cholesterol blood tests. When I got the results three days later, I was blown away! My cholesterol level had gone from 288 down to 181.  The Cholest-Off worked beautifully with no side effects!  During this process I changed my diet and started going to the gym at least three times a week.  I still take Cholest-Off and will be tested again in early September of 2009.  My doctor was very happy with the results even though I never told her I stopped taking the Simvastatin.  Had she checked my medical records, she would have seen that I had not refilled my Simvastatin presciption for over six months!  I would advise anyone on cholesterol medication to try Cholest-Off as an alternative to Simvastatin.

Found out my dr. presc. it even though he has given me LOPID for year, I have a thyroid problem and I have a liver problem.  It is three months later and am still having pain, especially at night and when I stand up in the am.  Throughout the past months I have also had frontal headaches and eyeaches.  Saw a opthamologist last week---that's okay.  Am going to see an orthopedic and liver specialist within the next weeks.  My Alkaline Phosphotase level is still elevated even though I quit taking Simvastatin 2 months ago.  Why did my dr. and the pharmacy not see Lopid as a contra-indication as everything I read lists that?At this point I'm not only angry but also scared.  My new pharmacist said that since this happened I should never again take another statin. (prior to this I had been taking Lipitor with success, but alas I could no longer afford it).

One generic causes me no GI side effects, while another has a lactose filler and causes an enormous amout of abdominal pain, gas and diarrhea every morning.  If I get a little round pill from the mail-order pharmacy, I know I'm in trouble.  If I get the triangular shaped pill from Walgreens,I feel fine.  The drug itself lowered my cholesterol 100 points in the first three months and it is maintaining that, but the side effects on my stomach are miserable.  I'm going to have to try something else or go back to Walgreens!

I complained to my physician about all the symptoms that i've encountered since taking this med such as severe muscle aches, memory loss, back &amp; neck aches, sweating, feet swelling, legs giving out while walking, neck cracking, many sleepless nights, constipation, thinning hair,headaches, you name it i've got it! It's very disheartening but helpful to read some very similiar comments and now I am convinced that it's the medication. I couldn't pin-point what the problem was and recently shared all my concerns with my Dr. and was taken off the med for a month with her confirming that ALL Cholestrol meds have these side effects. What I cant understand is after being off the med for a few weeks, i'm still experiencing some of the side effects! My Cholestrol went down with me changing my diet, exercising more and I WILL NOT take this med again!! I'm only 35yrs and feel like i've aged by 20 years.

One month ago I developed severe hip pain that I really could not pin point an episode of trauma to cause it.  My doc diagnosed it as piriformis syndrome.  The pain is incredible and nothing seems to mitigate the degree of pain.  This web site makes me suspicious of the statin.  I will discontinue and re post in a month with results.  Thanks to all who posted.  You have been a great help.

Zocor worked fine had no problems with it. Recently since I started Simvastatin I have became sleppy all the time, always tired, pain in lower back, legs &amp; hips, walking is painful due pain in my legs and hips. I have itching on back arms and legs very badly. I have memory loss. Had cataracts removed 3 yrs ago both eyes no problem vision was very good, now I am also having problems with my eyes. After taking my 20mg dose at night, I wake up feeling full in my upper stomach I am bloated, sometimes I have diarear, sometimes constapation. Went for tests for stomach yesterday have not got results yet. I have always beleived it was the Simvastatin doings this to me. It is hard for me to do anything around the house my motavation is gone, I don't seem to want to do anything anymore, I guess it is depression too. I will stop taking it for a while and let my Dr know and see if he can change to something else. 
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	TexasAnnie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	6/26/2009 2:36:01 PM	Started Simvastatin 4 months ago. Within 2 months I started having constant muscle pain in my upper arm, but didn't relate it to the medicine. Thought it was muscle strain due to relocating my computer &amp; mouse-- so moved it again &amp; was waiting to see if the pain went away. A month went by with no change so thought maybe I was sleeping wrong on my shoulder &amp; arm-- made a conscious effort to change that.  Still no improvement.  Went into Dr. this week for standard lab work &amp; follow up for high blood pressure, cholesterol &amp; triglycerides. Initial lab work showed a great improvement in both choleserol &amp; triglycerides.  But then I mentioned the muscle pain-- the Dr. examined the arm and told me to stop the Simvastatin immediately and sent me for CPK labwork (awaiting call for those results now).  In the meantime, switched me over to Crestor, and in 3 days I've developed a bad sore throat. I was just thinking allergies until I read the Crestor info today, and now I wonder about that.  Seems like the cure is worse than the disease on many of these meds. :-(
High Cholesterol	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	6/26/2009 1:19:02 PM	Simvastatin has been very effective for me. My cholesterol was high and this medication has brought it down significantly in the last month I've been taking it. The only side effect it has on me is the loss of hair. For the past (almost) 2 months I've been taking this medication I've lost a lot of hair. It might not be mentioned on this page as a side effect but it is mentioned on my prescription information slip that comes with my medication. So for those who are taking this medication please watch out for loss of hair and contact your physician.

It has kept my cholesterol and triglycerides extremely down.  Works great for what it was prescribed for.  I take every night before bed but after reading other's comments I too have experienced memory loss, sleep problems, aching and itching in my feet and calves at night and itching balls plus reduced sex desire and perfomance.  Also, I found that I have sinus problems and hoarse throat and have been coughing a lot.  I have seen all of the above mentioned by those taking simvastatin.  I may ask my doctor to try something different.

Within two weeks, I could barely walk. My knees were killing me, unble to walk without severe pain.  My back was getting worse. My feet and legs were swelling. Everything hurt. My doctor said to cut the dose in half. I refuse. Does this illnes caused by statins ever go away. I do know that it leads to a disease Rhabdomyolysis can even damage you kidneys. I am devasted,I have MS as well and stayin mobile is life or death with me.
High Cholesterol	Dmac, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	25-34	6/24/2009 1:24:59 PM	Sorry to hear so many people are having muscle cramps and memory loss. I just ordered 400mg CoQ-10 to supplement while I try out this statin. I just started using it or any statin for that matter last night. I was prescribed 40mg but I cut them in two to make #60 20mg pills. My lipids have always been off the chart: low HDL, high LDL, high triglycerides, etc. I am a 33 yr old male, 6ft, 190lbs. My problem is not with high cholesterol because it runs in the family with no history of heart disease. I am trying it because I do have fatigue, headaches and possible bronchiectasis (lung scarring caused from possible IgG deficiency leading to mutiple lung infections), and most importantly I might be the person that gets heart disease in the family. I giving the medicine 3 stars to begin with and will take away or add more in 4 weeks. There is a lot of misinformation out there about statins. One thing is true, cholesterol is part of the problem with plaque build up in the arteries. Don't forget that. 
High Cholesterol	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	2	1	Male	35-44	6/23/2009 11:39:21 PM	20 mg just over 60 days.  I started having lower back pain almost the same time I started taking the meds.  I didn't realize it at the time.  I read on this web site to advise your chiropractor that you are using this type of drug.  I went to the chiropractor today because of my lower back pain. After his evaluation he advised to stop the drug asap.  I am getting blood work tomorrow and then will go back to my md.  Not sure if it's meds or not, but will re-post after blood work and meeting with my doctor.

She gave me simvastatin.  After only two weeks, intend to go back to Lipitor.  I have had frequent headaches, nausea, explosive diarrhea, abdominal pain and general malaise.  Also have swelling of hands and feet and muscle aches.  I'll pay the bigger copay and go back to Lipitor.

Very good Cholesterol results for many years. Within last year, rather suddenly knee pain, back pain and unsteady gait occurred. Thought to be just aging. Then I heard about others and started looking into the symptoms. Sleep problems, Sleep Apnea etc. For my age otherwise in very good shape, Will stop taking Simvastatin and see what happens.Can't blame the Med at this time, just suspicious considering other reports that seem to parallel mine.
High Cholesterol	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	6/17/2009 7:40:25 PM	Where to start. I had been on simvastatin for years, also lisin/hctz. for blood pressure. Never had any problems and they both did their jobs. Then this year I started to exercise every day, and eat better, and I lost 40 pounds.  I mentioned to my dr that I would like to get off of meds as I was healthier now, but he wanted to wait and see, make sure the next few blood tests were good. The end of march, i started having severe constipation, laxatives were hardly helping at all, or they would give some results but not much and seemed like nothing on my own, only with laxatives. I was thinking I had a blockage or something. three weeks into this problem, start getting sharp pains in shoulder blade, right side. Then burning pains in stomach. doctor sent me to have a colonscopy and ultra sound and injection test to have gall bladder checked. both came out fine. this took weeks and I could not exercise like I was, turning down extra hours at work, all kinds of co pays to specialists and tests.My last visit doc said it could be pancreitis, brought on by medicine. sent me for blood, but I stopped medicine that very day. one week goes by, burning stomach stops, end of three weeks, shoulder pain is much less often. I was supposed to go back last week, but I postponed apt to give me more time to see if things were still getting better before paying for more tests.will update in a few weeks.
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	Mark, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	35-44	6/17/2009 2:52:26 PM	I have been on Zorcor (Simvastatin) 10mg for over a year now have have had overall good results. My total cholesterol dropped to well below 200. My total cholesterol was almost up to 300! In addition my good cholesterol increased, and my bad cholesterol dropped to to values where it should be. My triglycerides dropped as well. Many people on many of the cholesterol meds complain of developing aches and pains. Thankfully I have not experienced any aches or pains. The only problem I have with this medication is always remembering to take my medication since I am instructed to take it every night at bedtime.

In the first three months of use my LDL lowered by almost 100 points. I did however start taking asprin and a multivitamin daily at the same time I started this drug. Which might have enhanced the efectiveness or offset the side effects, I don't know. All I know is that I'd rather have a healthy heart and take some pain pills and vitimins if I had to than have the risk of an early death. 
High Cholesterol	charlie, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	45-54	6/13/2009 8:03:05 AM	I've been on medication  for 6 months. constant neck cracking, headaches and tiredness. Dr. told me these are not side effects. May stop taking .
High Cholesterol	maurose, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	6/12/2009 8:01:22 AM	I have been on this medicine for about 6 weeks. I had been waking up every single morning with a dull headache and neck and shoulder pain. I also had muscle aches all day long &amp; felt like I had aged 20 years. I even bought a new pillow &amp; was considering buying a new foam topper for our bed since I felt so horrible upon waking. Thanks to reading the reviews on MD, I now know that it was the Simvastatin. I have been off it only 2 days now and the headaches &amp; pain are completely gone. My cholesterol wasn't too high so I'm going to try to just watch my diet and exercise more since it's not worth the side effects.

After reading some of the other reviews, I was scared to take it, but so far I have seen nothing different.  My doctor put me on it to reduce my bad cholestorel (she wants it under 100, right now it is 115). I will probably only be on it a few months.

Went to dermatoligist and he said is probably the simvastatin since I have done nothing else different. I am miserable..

Have had back, hip &amp; knee pain for several years due to osteoarthritis.  Have noticed a definite increase in muscle &amp; joint pain, especially in lower back during the night.  Have been experiencing misc. muscle spasms/cramps throughout my body since starting the med.  Difficulty sleeping due to back, hip &amp; leg pain during the night.  Occasional night sweats.  Either diarhea or constipation; it varies from week to week.  And the weirdest symptom of all, an occasional feeling that washes over me that my skin is crawling.  It starts in my shoulders, travels down my arms to my torso, then down my legs.  It only lasts about 5 seconds.  Haven't been on med long enough to have blood tested yet, so don't know if it's doing any good.  Don't know if I should wait until I get my first blood results before telling my doctor about side effects I've been having.

But after a week or so, my lower back,arms and leg muscles hurt so bad, I was going to see the doctor again. Then I read these reviews and realized it wasn't me and the greater majority had the same symptoms. I was relieved and sad at the same time that it just worked so well  for me (over 90 points lower)!So I stopped and I'm not sore as much. Well it's back to the doctors again.

I have stopped taking this drug but would like to know what the half-life of this drug is.  I will not take it any more, but do need something for high cholesterol, and am considering diet alone, including almonds, dark chocolate and green tea.  If anyone has any other suggestions, I would welcome your response.  Thanks.
High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	5/27/2009 7:48:54 AM	I started using Simvastatin because Lipitor was getting too expensive.  I did have muscle pain with Lipitor, reported it to my Doctor, told it was a minor side effect for what it does.  When I started Simvastatin I felt really good.  Then things started:  swelling and painful hands and feet, very tired, painful leg muscles and hips, stomach pain.  I thought it might be the Simvastatin because of all the side effects.  Last week I stopped taking it for five days and I felt great on day four and five;  I started using Simvastatin again on Monday evening - so I've taken two doses (40mg each day) and all my pain and swelling are starting to come back.  I'm done with this stuff.  I'll start to exercise more and change my diet - this isn't worth it.
Other	MaryM, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	5/23/2009 1:13:50 PM	My physician switched me from Lipitor to Simvastatin due to the costs of Lipitor. He told me he would have to increase the dosage as Simvastatin took higher dosages to be effective. I immediately noticed a severe reaction to sun and heat. I have Rosacea and therefore take great care protecting my skin when outdoors, but nothing I do since beginning Simvastatin inhibits my burning when out doors or reddening up inside when the heat is on. I also have begun to perspire even when I am sitting. Any type of activity begins an onset of heavy persperation and facial reddening. I also am not sleeping as well as I did before and plan to ask my physician to switch my back to Lipitor.

High Cholesterol	immokalee, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	5/5/2009 4:07:04 PM	I tried this drug once and became extremely sick, throwing up for a couple hours and also having diarrhea. I also couldn't sleep after the ordeal. The only other time I became this nauseous and sick was when I had food poisoning several years ago. I took this drug about 3 hours after I ate, not directly with food, which possibly could have been an issue. However, the lable on the drug didn't say to take with food, nor did my phamasist say it was necessary. I also became extremely nauseous when I took Vytorin, with food, but did not get sick, and also became sick when I used another statin, but don't remember which one. This was my third try with a cholesterol drug; all statins or part statin. I read about 50 reviews, and no one seemed to have my experience, but I felt first timers should know this could happen.  I might just have stomach reactions to stations, so if anyone has other medicenes to look into, please let me know. I'll also be speaking to my physician soon.

A friend suggested I look up this drug and boy and I glad I did.  To see that others were going through the same symptoms leads me to stop taking the drug. I was doing fine before and am sure I will be doing a lot better again.

It is very effective in lowering cholesterol and triglycerides for me.  However, I have experienced many of the same bothersome side effects as many of the commenters, eg lower back pain, pain and weakness in my hips, trapezius pain, etc.  I thought it was just me, but many people are complaining of the same issues.  I stopped taking this medication and the symptoms have improved.  I'm in good shape, but his is killing my golf game.I'm trying something else!

Eventually, my hip and finger joints become intolerably painful.  The doctor has always changed me to a different med or combination drug.  The last was a combination with lisinopril/naicin and I couldn't tolerate the flushing.  I went off, on my own, as my hands had gotten so much more painful.  I did find a time-release naicin in the same dosage as the above med contained and I could tolerate that just fine.  Told the doctor of my action, so she put me on simvastatin.  Within days my finger joints were getting more and more painful.  And just the past few weeks, my hips have become painful whenever I try changing positions in bed.  It should be noted that I am quite fit, working out with a trainer twice a week and treadmilling/walking the other days of the week.  This hip pain disturbs my sleep and my peace of mind.  Anyone else had these problems?

I'm already taking Tricor but my doctor said I needed this medication too.  OK, I took just one pill; later that same day, I started having diarrhea and I became terribly nauseated.  Wanting to give it a second chance, I took it for the next 2 days; each day the sickness got worse.  I finally quit taking this medication and I will never take it anymore!  I'm calling my doctor because &quot;WebMD&quot; said &quot;if you experience diarrhea and/or get nauseated then notify your doctor immediately and and quit taking these pills.

High Cholesterol	littlebuddy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	4/8/2009 4:36:24 PM	I took Simvastatin for 14 days. Before srarting my total cholesterol was over 230. Throughout all of this I was never got a breakdown between teh LDL and HDL. It has been high for over a year and was hard for me to keep it under control. My 2 brothers and my dad have been eating meds. for high cholesterol for years a decided to give it a shot. After 2 weeks of taking one 40 mg tablet at bedtime my cholesterol dropped to 161. Knowing that it dropped over 70 points in two weeks I immediately stopped eating the drug. Hopefully now I can keep my cholesterol in the 160's now by maintaining a proper diet, exercizing properly blah-blah-blah so that I don't have to be prescribed this stuff for a long time. There were some side effects that I read about and was aware of what could happen. What happened with me was muscle aches more than anything almost like I was a bit dehydrated all of the time. Also my liver area felt like it was swollen and my urine got really dark. The only other thing that it hit me with were headaches. Once I stopped the drug the side effects went away pretty quickly. Like I said, I just hope that I have enough will-power to keep living right so that the cholesterol level will remain in the 160's and not get jacked up again.

Am a bit concerned with some of the side effects.  Having the dark urine and the stomach issues and nausea.  Not sure if the stomach issues is related to the virus going around or not.  Will monitor that.  Liver function was checked and that is fine.

High Cholesterol	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	3/28/2009 10:20:36 PM	I have been on a 10mg dose for 3 months with a 10 day lapse in the middle when I had 1 terrible achy night but had also come down with a virus that day for about 4 days.  Stopped for 10 days just in case.  Last blood test showed a decrease in cholestral level but not as much as Dr wanted.  Lately I have had muscle pain but particularly painful lower back and between shoulders.  Always have worked out but now am achy a few hours later. Not scheduled for another blood test for 3 months from now.  Based on reading others post will be very careful to monitor myself and stop meds if achyiness continues or other symptoms start.

High Cholesterol	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	55-64	3/26/2009 1:10:40 PM	I have been on Simvastatin approx 1 year with loose bowel movements, sore muscles, loss of feeling in left little pinkie, what appears to be arthritis in right hand so contacted dr. Switched me to Pravastatin this week. Will see how I do on that. Simvastatin lowered my colesterol to acceptable levels but made a negative impact on my quality of life. 
High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	3/25/2009 11:19:52 AM	I took Lipitor successfully but was switched to Simvastatin because of cost (insurance Company).  I immediately developed shoulder pain, neck pain, and pain in my legs and hips.  I stopped taking it, but went back on the medicine after about 8 months when my cholesterol was raising.  Once again, I am experiencing all the pain from before, but also having constant heartburn, sleeplessness and vertigo.  I had vertigo before when I took Simvastatin, but didn't realize it was from the medicine.  I am stopping the drug and trying more exercise and watching diet closer.

I stoped the treatment and returned to my normal self. A true blessing, 6 months later my Doctor prescribed pravastatin, so I will try this approach, just started the Med. I will never again take Simvastatin, It was not a type of life I would want to prolong.I have always been concious of my diet, I will now also add an exercise routine to my therapy.

High Cholesterol	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male	55-64	3/13/2009 2:12:38 PM	  I am writing this for my husband because he has experienced the side effects of this drug.  He had taken a 10 mg dose for about 6 months.  He developed so much pain (including spasming) in his feet that he could hardly walk and it would keep him awake at night.  (But he did not associate it with the drug).  I had been on a 20 mg dose for a very short time and discontinued it because I had developed numbness in my hands, fatigue, hair loss, significant edema in my lower legs, and increased appetite.  I kept telling him about the things that I had been reading about this drug and he just wasn't willing to discontinue the medication, until he couldn't stand the pain anymore.  Finally, he gave in and stopped taking it.  The pain and spasms have resolved (within 3 days) and have not returned and it has been over 3 weeks since he did it.  This is one time when a husband is glad that he listened to his wife.  ; )

My doctor put me on Lipitor for preventative measures with no appreciable side effects. Sinceswitching over to 40mg of Simvastatin I have had a terrible time with memory loss, gas and bloating. Until reading some of the other reviews I wasn't aware of the memory loss side effect as it is not listed when purchasing the drug. I mentioned it to my doctor and he said he was unaware of this side effect.My next step is to check with the pharmacist and change meds.

I could barely drag my feet to move step by step.  Then the Dr. switched me to simvastatin 40 mg which I've been taking for 4 years now.  I've had all the side effects described by others.  Most importante ones are tiredness, muscle pain and weakness, and memory loss.  I taught I was not tough enough and I kept going on with the drug.  I hope I found this site much earlier. It is time to quit all of this now.  Our parents and grand parents did well without this drug.

I've taken myself off of this drug, and no more back pain or heavyness in the chest. My doctor just put me back on them.  Damm the problems all returned. The doc said that the drug shouldn't have caused these problems.  I guess I'll go off them again to see what happens.  Kinda like playing russian roulet isn't it

I just refilled prescription and figured to take it a week or so longer and then contact my physician until I read these reviews. I have had lower back pain, upper leg muscle pain and now flu like symptoms for over a seek and it is definitely not the flu. I am discontinuing use of this med and contacting my physician tomorrow. I haven't had blood work yet to know the effectiveness but side effects far outweigh any effectiveness. Thanks for the reviews.

I have never felt worse in my life.  I felt like I've had the flu for 2 months, no energy, headaches, can't sleep.  This is my 3rd try on statins and I am done!  These things are killers!  What a money making scam!  I have not only paid for this I have been to the Dr. every month to complain only to be put on more meds to cover the problem with this med!  I am so mad after reading all these reviews to find out that is what has been wrong with me all along and I was borderline having to take this crap to begin with.  I can't get to the trash fast enough!  Beware!  I would like to thank all of the people for there reviews this probably saved my life.  I'm glad I know I am not going crazy at age 46!

High Cholesterol	MitchinNC, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	35-44	2/9/2009 5:22:17 PM	After many months of using this medication and having my doctor increase the dosage, we finally achieved the cholesterol numbers we were targeting.  Unfortunately, about a year after I began using it, I was experiencing significant muscular pain and weakness in my lower back (pain in muscles around my hip too).  I was in significant pain when I sat for more than a few minutes and the pain even affected my ability to sleep and exercise.  This pain came on slowly and steadily got worse over time.  Any physical activity would make the pain even worse.  I had difficulty straightening my back and bending over. My quality of life was terrible and eventually I was moving like an 80+ year old.  It took some time to figure out what was causing the pain because I was working with a spinal specialist and physical therapist and I trusted their judgement.  They asked what medication I was on and were not able to identify this as the cause.  Finally I figured out the cause on my own.  I did not correlate the two for so long becasue I had been on the medication without pain for many months.  Within a day or two of stopping the medication, my back pain began to subside and my strength began to return.  Two week later I feel back to normal.  I will never use this drug again.

High Cholesterol	75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		1/27/2009 7:09:19 PM	Over the past 2 years I've noticed a steady decline in my 79 year old mother's health. Knowing that during this period of time she she has been seeing her physician every 3 months, without a negative report, I attributed her dulling wits, increasing fatigue &amp; loss of mobility to aging.  4 days ago my mother was displaying all of the symptoms of a stroke victim (incoherency, loss of mobility, etc). She had to be rushed to the hospital via ambulance. A cat scan and other test were run and the doctors determined that she did not have a stroke but instead was reacting to cholestorol medication. Until I heard the diagnosis, I was unaware that my mother had been taking Simvastitin for 2 years. Fortunately she rapidly responded to IV treatment &amp; 3 days later she was placed in a skilled nursing facility where she will be undergoing both physical and i.v. therapy to regain muscle use, rehydrate &amp; flush her kidneys.

The first time I took this med I attributed the reaction to perhaps something I ate. I was able to try again 30 days later following the same pattern resulting in the same reaction, only much more severe, only minutes away from 911. I am frightened of what might have been. This is my first experience with a drug reaction!

I went to the Dr. for blood work and said that the pharmacist suggested that I go on generic Zocor, much cheaper and the same drug, so I did not have my bloodwork done.  Started generic Zocor three days ago and immediately having terrible stomach cramps and diarhea.  I am not taking it anymore and will go back to Lipitor.  Will follow up.

High Cholesterol	Karen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	12/29/2008 4:56:16 PM	I realized that the muscle pain &amp; weakness I have been experiencing seem to coincide with the time I have been taking Simvastatin. I work out 4-5 times a week but have actually been getting weaker instead of stronger. I can't sleep at night because of progressively worse lower back pain and recently leg &amp; hip pain. Most days I feel like I have a mild case of the flu. Today I looked up the side effects of Simvastatin on this website. I immediately left a message for my doctor &amp; will NOT take my daily dose of Simvastatin tonight!
High Cholesterol	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	45-54	12/27/2008 11:41:28 AM	I'm thankful I found this chat site.My Dr. first put me on 20mg generic. I experienced hand pain.  We tried 40mg and the pain got so bad I told him I couldn't take it any more.  I love to golf and I had no strength to hold the clubs. He changed my prescription to Lipator but the paharmacist called me before I picked up and told me how much more the drug was going to cost me, about $110 more for a 60 day supply.  I called the doctor and told him if have to do something else.  I'm back to the simvastatin 20mg dose.  Still have hand joint pain but not as severe as the 40 mg dose.  I can't wait for the generic on Lipator to come out.  I've heard that the side efects are less severe. I'm calling my dr. after the first of the year and seeing if there is anything else I can try.

About a month after starting the drug I developed bad joint pain, then back pain with tingling and numbness going to my feet. If I sit for any length of time I am so achy Ican hardly move. Kinda flu like symptoms. I keep a headache.  After reading these reviews I am going to stop taking to see if this is my problem.

HOWEVER, my cardiologist upped the dosage from 40mg to 80mg because he said the generic was only half strength.   True?   If true, what about FDA saying generic is sAME?
High Cholesterol	woody, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Male	45-54	11/26/2008 6:03:11 PM	I took simvastatin for 4 months. It worked great for lowering my cholesterol, but the side effects were too much.I'm a tough guy like most of you so the headaches, leg cramps and fatigue didn't stop me. Then I started to have a problem with ED. The last 2 weeks I took the drug I had zero sexual desire! The doctor told me that I was getting older &quot;51&quot; and may need something to help. He was very sure that ED was not a side effect of simvastatin. Liar!After stopping the drug for a couple of weeks things returned to normal.
High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	11/26/2008 12:30:46 AM	I have been on a 20 mg dose for 6 days, because my doctor thought that Simvastatin would be more effective than Zetia.  Zetia caused no difficulties for me and had lowered my cholesterol, just not enough to satisfy the physician.  I have already experienced edema in my lower legs, increased fatigue, significant hair loss (which is rarely mentioned as a side effect), increased appetite, and numbness in my hands.  I found this site when researching the side effects of this drug, and I am glad that I did.  My decision to contact the doctor regarding discontinuing Simvastatin had already been made, but after reading all of these reviews, it justifies it even more.  I am a nurse and realized that the probable cause of my symptoms had to be the medication, as that was something new that I had only recently started.  But, my heart goes out to those of you who have suffered with the side effects for so long, only to find out that it was the medication that had caused the problem.  It is important to remember, that when a drug has a list of significant side effects that is as long as this one, you need to monitor any changes very carefully and follow up before more serious complications develop.

Increased Triglycerides and Cholesterol	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	65-74	11/21/2008 9:24:07 PM	I went to the Dr. beecause my hands were going to sleep and/or tingling many times a day.  She thought it was carpal tunnel.  I did have a little improvement treating it as such.  Last week I went because my legs were so weak and painful I could hardly navigate.  She took me off Simvastatin.  My legs are better -- however I wonder if they will ever really be OK again -- and wonder of wonders, my hands are remarkably better.  It didn't dawn on me that both issues were from the same problem.  Also severe diarrhea, and gastric/ulcer type pain, that is gone in less than a week. Simvastatin did an amazing job of lowering my  high cholesterol and dangerously high tryglicerides, but I'll take my chances without it. This has been a totally miserable experience. Bravo to those who can use it without side effects. Good on ya'!!

The nights were so bad I could sleep my legs were cramping so bad. Went off the meds and three days later all of the symptoms went away. Now the doc has me on parvastatin and we shall see since the reviews are even worse for this one.

I thought I was going crazy! I had been on this drug for about a year, and never really connected the dots.Knee pain, tingling in lower legs and feet -- then hands, later. Lower back pain, then pain in the kidney area that eventually started waking me up at night, to now, SEVERE kidney and back pain that also includes my neck and between the shoulders. My heart palpitates and races now, especially at night. I went to the Dr. yesterday, and she said none of these symptoms are associated with this drug and almost laughed when I told her what I had read on WebMD. I stopped taking the drug yesterday after 4 days of pain so bad I could barely BREATHE!Thanks for sharing your experiences, and maybe everyone who has written here should report their symptoms to the drug company so there would be a record to track.

I took it for 4 weeks. During this time I started to feel like I had a sore throat coming on. Then I had trouble swallowing. Next, I started getting an acid taste in my mouth. I then developed headaches from hell and finally stopped taking this crap 2 weeks ago. Last week, my doctor told me I had serious LPR, acute acid reflux. Since I quit taking this medication the headaches have gone and reflux (which I had never had before taking this) is beginning to get better.  I would not take this med again.

Good cholesterol in the cellar.  Taking 20mg per day.  No side effects whatsoever.  Also taking Fenofibrate 160mg per day, so I need to watch out for muscle pain (damage), but so far, no problems in that regard either.  As far as effectiveness goes, guess I'll have to wait for my next bloodwork.

I've had both knees and left hip replaced.Since replacement, I've been walking 5.5 miles a day for 3 years.I also have been taking 1200mg of omega-3 fish oil capsules every day. Now since I've been taking fish oil capsules , my cholesterol has gone from 170 to 240 (doesn't make sense)! My doctor has put me on 40 mg of simvastatin, which i just started last night. This morning i've got bad stomach cramps and heartburn.I also have GERD (reflux disease).I don't know if I'm going to be able to tell the difference between RA joint pain and additional joint pain from this med. However, one vital thing I learned from terrible side effects of RA medicines( failed kidneys,torn retina, cataracts) is to listen to your body first and then the doctor second. I'll inform on progress of this drug.

The reasoning behind this was not given but I suspect the manufacturers of Zocor (the non-generic form) managed to win a court case against Simvastatin because it was cutting into their profits. This has been happening with many, very extensive medications recently. It is very unfortunate because Simvastatin has worked so well for me that my cholesterol levels since I've been taking it have been at or near the bottom of the acceptable range.

I have experienced some of the side affects others have mentioned. I had developed an annoying cough and thought it was sinus. I went to the dr.recently and asked to see my bloodwork results and was concerned when I saw my AST and ALT was extremely elevated. When &quot;I&quot; pointed this out to the Dr. he told me to stop taking the medication immediately.  Apparently this drug is very damaging to the liver. Please make sure you always ask for your bloodwork results and discuss with your doctor.

Stopped taking med two days and ago and symptoms have decreased greatly. Will be seeing dr. next week.
High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	55-64	9/16/2008 12:01:47 PM	This drug caused deep muscle and bone aches. I did not recognize the cause, so suffered for many months. When I stopped, I felt much better after just 48 hours.I did a good job at lowering cholesterol, but I have to try something else. The dr. has now put me on a lower dose of pravastatin, so I will see what happens with that.Another good side effect of simvastatin was that my fingernails got much stronger and hair was thicker. Too bad it caused such pain.

Not a good look for a woman! Other women told me their hair had fallen out when they were on statins. My doctor said it couldn't be the statin as there's no record of statins causing hair loss (is that because no doctors report it?). My cardiologist changed me to a differant statin (crestor) but the hair loss became more worse &amp; worse.After two &amp; a half years I have stopped taking statins, I stopped two weeks ago &amp; my hair stopped falling out after a couple of days. I am now trying a 'natural' cholesterol reducer &amp; hope it works for me (blood test in two months). I also hope that my hair grows back!!!

I was put on it as a preventative medicine because I am a diabetic and diabetics tend to run with high cholesterol numbers. And it was also hoped to help regulate my irregular heartbeat. At the time I was prescribed simvastatin my cholesterol levels were good and they are even better now to where my doctor says I can take it every other day instead of every day. My heartbeat is still irregular so it has been ineffective on that - but so far no major problems except I really miss grapefruit.

I started having stomach problems i.e. had to be near a bathroom ASAP -- then cramping would disappear for a couple weeks...I figured i could live with that affect because it was lowering the LDL considerably ...then a friend described gall bladder disease and i wondered if these pills could have affected the way the gall bladder works (??) -- went to my internist but she said no..has anyone else experienced this problem... I have D/C'd the drug for 6 weeks and the stomach problems have subsided some but not totally..

I've been on it for two months and informed my Dr. that I'm taking myself off. I feel fatigued constantly, not mentally sharp, loose stools, swollen throat. It feels like it is re-activating an old thyroid problem I had years ago. I'd rather take my chances with high cholesterol. It makes me feel that lousy.

I developed terrible fatigue, itchy skin, I felt like I was going to itch my ears right off of my head... rash, bloating and sleep disturbance.  I called my cardiologist who put me on the drug to begin with and got an immediate call back from his office and told me to stop taking the drug.  I did and within a few days, all side effects were almost entirely gone, thank goodness. Why oh why do we have to suffer with these terrible side effects??  Doctors should be more aware of what they are prescribing. I actually had one doctor tell me that ...&quot;physicians are way too busy to be reading about side effects of medication...we don't know about these things until a patient has a side effect.&quot;Well, HELLO!!! Some of those side effects are deadly!!! So what they are saying is...if people die, they die...now we know a little more about what the problems are with a particular medication.  People need to educate themselves...Look on the internet...Look on WebMD...Look up everything before you put it in your mouth and digest into your body!! At least my cardiologist had the good sense to stop my Simvastatin immediately and didn't tell me I was imagining things as my PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN seemed to think! Primary care physicians are basically useless...I have no faith in any of them and I obviously have good reason.

The next day after that, my eyes were swollen and red, my finger tips were itchy, the insides of my ears itched and my top lip was started to swell. As the day went on, my lip got bigger and bigger. Called the doc, he said when symptoms go away, take again. If it happens again then you are allergic to it. After my work day, When I got home, my lip was H U G E!!!!! I called doc again, the nurs told me to go to ER. Went there and the doc told me to stop taking it. I told him I only took it once. He said there was no way this reaction was from this drug because &quot;no one has problems with this drug&quot;. Take again when symptoms go away. NO WAY will I take this again! I will take a bottle of fish oil pills before I take this again. Has anyone looked into a call action suit for this drug?

High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	6/27/2008 12:54:32 AM	I have been on Simvastatin (40 mg.) for 3 weeks and took myself off them.  I was having such severe back pain to the point I almost had my husband take me to emergency.  Since going off this medicine, I am MUCH better.  The pain in my back and shoulders is getting better every day, and I have more energy.  I am going back on Crestor (10 mg.) with a blood test in 6 weeks and another one in 3 months.  (I am tested every 3 months for lipids and muscle enzymes.)  I listened to my body this time!  My doctor told me to get off them immediately.  I couldn't even roll over in bed without my back hurting.  I'm waiting until the Simvastatin is out of my system before starting back on Crestor.  Please listen to your body....I have learned over the years to know when something is just not right.  And it only took 3 weeks for my body to become &quot;not right.&quot;  Good luck to all.

I've been on a low dose (10mg) for a year because my doctor was concerned about my cholesterol because of the diabetes, even though it was only 180. Even though it's a low dose, I still have lower back pain as well as well as pain between my shoulder blades, and I don't have the same level of energy that I had prior to taking this. However, this medication is very effective, as my cholesterol is down to 164. My next doctor follow up is in a couple of months, and I'm going to discuss these issues with her.

I am a 62 yr old male, in good health. I exercise and watch my diet.I have had little to no side effects from this drug. It has lowered my Cholesterol from 212 to under 125 and still dropping. If I have to take a med. for this condition I don't know what other med I would take. Happy with the results &quot;SO FAR&quot;.
High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	55-64	6/10/2008 2:11:41 PM	Since being put on this medicine, I have been ill the whole time.  Dizziness, light headed, muscle spasms, loose bowel movements, headaches, no energy, want to sleep all the time, depression, etc.  I never thought it was the medicine until I read some of the drug ratings.  I don't get blood tested until August.  I was on Crestor with no problems at all.  My ins. company recommended this drug because of the cost.  I do like that it is cheaper since I will be retiring soon, but I don't want to keep feeling like this either.  Whatever is wrong with our ins. companies and the drug companies?  If Crestor works for me (and I have been on 3 different kinds)then why don't they let me have it for the same price?  Any why don't they want to listen to my cardiologist?  I'm appalled that the ins. company would play Russian Roulette with my health!  I will not stay on this medicine if I continue to feel the way I do right now.

My cholesterol went from 205 to 159 - so THAT worked. Also will start taking med at bedtime - was not told to do that. See if that works.

High Cholesterol	sue53mn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/23/2008 6:31:28 AM	I was on Simvastatin 10mg the past month. Within 3 days of taking it I developed severe rashy red blothy hive-like skin outbreaks covering front neck below chin, upper chest, forearms, top of hands and severe dry skin overall. I never had skin problems, even acne as a kid. Knew it was the Rx. Clinic refused to believe it's the Rx and told me to see a dermatologist for a possible biopsy re: raised welts under my chin (????) and drop using it for a cople weeks. Have been off it a week. Skin cleared up 100% -- it's the drug. Also, I too had severe foot cramps at night and lower legs hurt so bad with edema/feet feeling like they'd burst from pressure again due to this drug -- as I realized 2 days ago that I'm actually living without any bodily pain whatsoever today. I told the MD re: dropping Simvastatin - I didn't want to go back on ANY statin drug. She insisted I stay on track with them and try another one: CRESTOR which I picked up but refuse to take now - that Rx appears more lethal/fraught with issues than any and is extremely EXPENSIVE. Am insisting on natural means or non-statin rx. Geesh!

Dropped my 230 cholesterol to 180 in four months, but I began having problems I never had before. A severe yeast infection, other skin problems and psoriasis in my scalp.  My hair began gradually falling out over a year. I kept asking my dermatologist if Simvastatin could be the problem.  He incorrectly told my no.  I have lost so much hair over time, I have bald spots.  I revisited the side affects of this drug, and yes, there it was, hair loss.  It took me over a year to discover this.  I am reporting this so that overs will learn from my bad experience with Simvastatin.

I also experienced head ache and increased muscle cramps. I am not going to take it anymore and I am going to call dr. to see if I can take something natural or go back on Lipitor. I had to go off lipitor because my insurance changed, but I am going to see if I can get it again. I just may have to pay the price, since I had very good luck with Lipitor and no side effects whatsoever. It really lowered my cholesterol and triglycerides. I would not recommend this drug. Too many scary side effects. beware!!

High Cholesterol	schnog, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/30/2008 1:24:43 PM	I am a 42 year old male, struggling with a family history of high cholesterol...and NOT wanting to take medication.  started taking on Decmeber 1, 2007.  On January 10th, 2008 my numbers dropped from near 300 to 160.  I test again in June.  Taking them at night is easier.  Puting them in a pill organizor is easier.  I am also looking at taking other vitamins and suplements at the same time.  I am looking for some information that would identify any couteracting benefits of taking vitamins/suplements with Simvastatin.
High Cholesterol	CaptKidd, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	55-64	3/27/2008 5:23:22 PM	I am a 61 year old male. I started taking Simvastatin a week ago, per my Doctors orders. I have stopped taking it because of a side effect, extreme fatigue. A side effect NOT mentioned was, it increased my depression so bad that everyday, I was almost at the point of crying. I am already diagnosed with severe depression and I do not need anything that will increase it, so all BEWARE.

High Cholesterol	saddleman, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	55-64	3/21/2008 9:59:37 AM	Not much to write as I have just started one (1) 40 mg tablet at bedtime. I'm hopefull that treatment program will provide benefit without side effects.  I'm 56 years old with a very active lifestyle involving cycling 5-6 days for and average of 2.5 to 4.5 houra a day.  My primary care physician started me on simvastatin due to my LDL's tracking higher the last 3 years.  from 128 to 134 to 145.  HDL's ranged 64 to 70 back down to 58 the last fasting blood check.  I can't yet rank the effectiveness of the drug because I just started taking it. Will find out in June.

Immediately began having soreness in muscles and difficulty sleeping at night. When I stopped taken meds and called dr - he put me on another statin. After reading reviews on that one - decided to diet and exercise my way back. Also had hair loss, went to dermatologist who made the connection. Am being treated for that - another pill!!  But no side effects and hair is coming back. Hate getting older!!

High Cholesterol	flugels417, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	19-24	3/1/2008 8:41:03 AM	I am 21 days into a 30 day script.  After reading many of the reviews posted here I am beginning to become concerned with my own possible side effects.  I have been complaining to my boyfriend about marks on my body which appeared to be &quot;body acne&quot;.  They look similar to a spider bite and itched the same as well.  The marks on the inside of my thigh (where they rub when I walk) have large red rings of irritation about an inch in diameter.  I have also noticed a lack of energy and feel constantly tired.  Lastly, I feel as if I have been fighting a UTI for the past week; scared to drink cranberry juice.  My follow up testing is not until April, I hope I can hold out long enough to see the effects it has on my rather high cholesterol.  I know my comments are similar to those before me however no one has mentioned the red marks on the body.

Increased Triglycerides and Cholesterol	X,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male		2/4/2008 9:19:13 PM	I have taken this med for 5 wks.  It has lowered my cholestrol significantly, 154.  Strangly enough it increased my Triglycerides by about 70 points.  I have, however, experienced weakness and pain in my right hand from my sholder to my elbow.  I have also experienced muscle sorness in my back and also had direa.  I had no such experience with Crestor.  However, the insurance company does not want to pay for Crestor because it is more expensive than Simvas. My dr says she can make a case now that I have tried the cheaper drug and had adverse reactions to successfully swich me to Crestor.  Hope this helps.

Wal-Mart Pharmacy did not tell me to take at bedtime. I was suffering from severe muscle cramps and knots in my calf area and soreness of knee joints that started working toward my hips. I went off this med and symptoms have subsided. Talked with my coworkers and they said that I was taking it wrong and to try taking it at bedtime with crackers or a piece of fruit or cheese.  Well - so far I'm on day 4 and the side effects have not come back. Why doesn't the Pharmacy's put &quot;TAKE AT BEDTIME with FOOD&quot; ON THE LABEL! Stupid, Stupid, Stupid!

Was put on prednisone for the auto.  Can't take Hep C drugs.  Predisone caused diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis. Have had hip replacement surgery and two arthroscopic surgeries.  I've been on Simvastatin for about 9 months and I noticed that my arthritis and muscle pain is progressively getting worse.  I take Trazadone at night to help me sleep.  I also get muscle cramping, especially in my calves.  After reading many of the other reviews on this site, I'm now wondering if the Simvastatin is playing a part in the exacerbation of my overall pain.  However, I've had excellent results on blood tests for cholesterol and it (along with other high blood pressure meds) has lowered my blood pressure immensely.  Plan to talk to my dr. at my next appt. next week.

Unlike, many others however, I'm able to sleep through through the night without any difficulty. For which I am thankful, but to awake without use of my hands really isn't much of a trade off.

Rated first and third sections a one, not sure if it works or if I should be happy yet :)  I am currently taking medication for hypothroidism, high blood pressure, Gout and acid reflux along with this one.  Im sure the hypothroidism also contributes to the high triglyceride levels, my hdl is low, around 20, but total is 154.  Have lost 15 pouds in the last 2 months, changing my eating habits, no soda, have an alcoholic drink once a year maybe (wont do it on these meds), and have never smoked, I wonder if losing weight puts more fat into the bloodstream.  Should be interesting to see how this all works out. Have to be careful with losing alot of weight too fast because of the gout.

My cholesterol level has dropped dramatically along with my triglycerides, however, my good cholesterol has still not risen.  It is still only 25 and for women should be 40 or above.  Also I was hoping that it would significanly lower my C-Reactive Protein Level which has raised 3 points higher since beginning simvastatin.  I'm hoping with the higher dosage that I was put on 30 mg. per day instead of 10mg. my C.R.P. level will drop and my good cholesterol will raise.  But overall, it has done a great job lowering my triglycerides and cholesterol.
