Before that I had poor results with Aciphex and Prevacid.  Nexium cuts down on my stomach acid and gives me almost complete acid reflux relief.

Never did we discuss my diet or do a test to see if I had enough or too little acid in my tummy.  I slowly waned myself off the medication last year and it was painful, much worse than the little heartburn I started with years ago.  I have had digestive problems for years now and was just diagnosed with a Microscopic Colitis.  Long term use of Nexium is now considered a possible cause for this Colitis, according to the Mayo Clinic website.  Nexium is supposed to be used for only 8 to 12 weeks only.  I so wish Big Pharm had to take the oath, &quot;First, do no harm&quot;.

Then we went to Nexium which really did the trick, over the years I have gotten used to the cost and faithfully taking the pill one hour before morning and evening meals. Recently I went in for surgery and a short rehab, my doctor suggested Protonix. Because of the price difference I did try it for a month...wow within two weeks I had a lot of acid and those old memories of nausia came back. I went back to Nexium and within one day I was back to feeling better and eating what I want. I will stay with Nexium now even with the $100+ co-pay. I strongly recommend Nexium for anyone who has acid refulx and Barretts Esophogus.

I took Nexium since Highschool. I found that If I missed a dose , I would get more stomach acid, then take more Nexium. Vicious , never ending cycle. Anyways, If I would miss doses for more than 3 days at a time . I would start to get severe cramping, muscle spasm pains right where my ribs join/where the esophagus goes into the stomach. Which ends up leading to me having to vomit to relieve the pain (not just from having acid but the muscle spasms too) Then.. every time the acid fills up, Its even more painful and causes me to vomit again. Needless to say, I end up being hospitalized for this. Its excruciatingly painful. This happens every time I missed a dose for more then 3+ days. It is not just from an increase of acid , its much more than that. Hard pain to explain.Anyways, I decided enough is enough. and I stopped taking Nexium and started drinking Pure Aloe Vera juice from the Healthfood store (not gel juice from grocery) and used tums and store bought ant-acids to help. 3 weeks later, It got better .. and better. and not , I am acid reflux free but occasional heartburn, less than what I would have gotten using Nexium.Most ant-acids PPIs are really the cause of the acid if you have been tested and no cause is known, thats your issue. I HIGHLY recommend getting off PPIs , stick through the pain for a month and you'll be free.

I am 60 now and found that my bones and muscles are not as strong as I had hoped so my doctor told me to stop the Nexium and start Betaine Hydrochloride I did about a week ago it was horrible I thought I was having a nervous breakdown and felt like I was having a heart attack I couldn't think straight I couldn't even leave my home. My stomach hurt so bad I couldn't eat and when I ate,  the pain was worst I finelly realized that I needed to stop the Betaine and go back on the Nexium. I don't know if this is a normal reaction but it's one I don't want to experience again. Has anyone experience any of this?

Stomach Ulcer from Aspirin/Ibuprofen-Like Drugs Prevention	Dee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	4/4/2012 9:18:55 PM	After about 3-4 days of use, I experienced relief from my stomach symptoms.  But after about two weeks, I began to experience personality changes--aggression (with aggressive compulsions that frightened me), depression, and anxiety.  At three weeks, I thought I was losing my mind.  By nature, I'm very balanced, gentle, and mild-mannered with no aggressive tendencies whatsoever.  The only new thing in my life was the Nexium, so I searched for information.  I never dreamed a stomach medication could cause something like this, but the FDA website reports post-clinical trial information and it listed those very things as being rare side effects.  I quit immediately.  After three days off the drug, I'm about 90% back to normal.  I felt much better within 24 hours.  I reported the experience to my doctor and he immediately put it on my list of allergies and said I should never take Nexium again.  I am reviewing on this site is in case somebody else experiences this type of side effect and is searching for answers as I did.

I took Nexium for a few years, 60 mg. Twice daily. It was a miracle drug for me, but I had severe stomach problems with thousands of dollars in testing to find out what was wrong. My doctor took me off Nexium and within a couple of weeks no more problems. Ive been back on it for 6 weeks and most of the time it works to relieve my heartburn, but I have had episodes with severe chest pain that have sent me to the emergency room. I would continue to use this medication but the side effects I am experiencing are not something I choose to live with. My side effects are:-bloating-lots of gas-stomach achesThe gas I experience is severe and has a horrble odor, it is uncomfortable and painful.If it didnt have this effect on me I would definitely continue to use it.

I have stayed away from nexium for almost 4 months now.  any reflux recurrence(usually in my sleep) i drink half a glass of water to neutralize the acid in my stomach.so far, it is working.

Unfortunately, the acid had also caused Erosive Esophagitis along with stomach ulcers from years of uncontrolled acid reflux.  I had used OTC medications such as Prevacid, Prilosc and Tums with little relief. Due to the extent of the damage, I was prescribed Nexium to help treat the acid reflux and heal my esophagus.  Nexium, along with diet change, has decreased my acid reflux which has helped my esophagus heal.

I had taken nexium for 6 years and then stopped after I changed my diet. I stopped getting acid reflux, but I started having debilitating fatigue, chronic sinus infections, and depression after having mononucleosis. I was put on antibiotics for the sinus infection and antidepressants for the depression. I was recently diagnosed with a systemic yeast infection (candidiasis), quite possibly brought on by the extented use of nexium and on and off antibiotic usage. Unless you have dysphagia, caused by the ulcers, I highly suggest a diet change. Because candidiasis is much worse than than acid reflux, and is extremely hard to cure.

W/O Nexium and Reglian acid reflux so bad can't even drink water.  Broke elbow in March, Nexium may be to blame as it helps delete calicum and Vit D per MD.

We were involved in a car accident and she had several vertebrae damaged beyond repair while I and our son in law walked away with very little injuries. If you take Nexium, be careful. It can weaken bones so if you get banged up it could be alot worse than it would be if you were not taking it. Other than that it helped her ulcers like no other pills on the market, OTC or Rx. However if she stops taking it or misses a day shes instantly vomiting blood now. I just wish if she had to be hooked on something it could be cheaper than $1.75/pill with bad insurance. I think an illegal drug addiction may be a bit cheaper. Thanks AstraZenica for making a bad ailment worse you greedy jerks.

My perscriptions would be for 90 days or 6 refills at 30 tabs. I hope I do not get in trouble later on in life.

I have had excess acid since childhood, I'm 74. I hope the FDA warning is another bogus government study.

Stomach Ulcer from Aspirin/Ibuprofen-Like Drugs Prevention	Tracey P, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	5/1/2011 5:59:20 PM	Started taking over 2 yrs ago for a duodenum ulcer [ibuprofin usage]; Nexium stopped the pain, healed the ulcer, all was well that first year! Go Nexium, right!Except a new endoscope showed I had developed Barrett's Esophagus, and that I had to keep taking the Nexium [for life, apparently]. I acceded, but due to expense, I took it only every other day. All seemed well with that for another year.Then 4 months ago (into my 3rd year of Nexium use) I was told to take all my meds as prescribed without fail (Ativan and Nexium)  PCP was 'appalled' I took Nexium irregularly. So I started taking it regularly. Only big deal was the money (or so I thought).Within a month of starting to take the Nexium daily, I was nauseated all the time, lost 20lbs, and ended up in the ER with intense stomach pain. (I'd thought it was a new bout with pneumonia, or a new ulcer!) They told me to DOUBLE UP on my Nexium, tested my gall bladder &amp;c, and eventually scoped me again. The day of my scope I didn't take any Nexium, and that night I noticed my stomach was feeling a lot better. On a whim, I didn't take Nexium the next day.. or the next; I kept getting better! I was excited!Unfortunately, I told my success story to my 2 docs (PCP and Gastro), and they said I MUST take Nexium due to Barrett's Esophagus. So I went back on it, and that very day had the nausea and stomach pains again. I decided to try Nexium just every few days (like I used to), but now just one dose makes me nauseated, and gives me stomach pains and cramp for days!I simply can't take Nexium anymore, although I give it high marks for short-term ulcer repair. The nausea and pain was too much to bear long-term. Guess I'll just lie to my doctors, use Tums, and hope for the best (since the doctors don't believe my stomach pains and nausea come from Nexium).

Other	Last Bastion, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	3/16/2011 12:11:25 AM	I am a 46yo female. I tried several maintenance GERD drugs before finally being prescribed Nexium. NO SYMPTOMS OF GERD OR HEARTBURN AT ALL! However, after approximately 3 years of taking Nexium, I am suffering from something else now. I cannot digest food at times. Severe stomach pain (worse than the heartburn) which is only relieved by drinking several 8oz glasses of warm water to get things moving. The nausea associated was horrible. Vomiting was useless as I vomited the food WHOLE after eating it HOURS previous and not all would come up. I have an appointment with MD soon and I am hoping I just need to be lowered to the 20mg and it isn't something more serious.

I would wake up with my stomach feeling funny, actually would have to get out of bed because of the uncomfortable feeling. so i tried taking it b4 supper which was hard to remember sometime 20 min b4, but i soon learned that it didn't really matter if i took it b4 or during or after super it all worked out the same, very well. I have been on it for over 3 years daily now.But I am very concern on the side effects. especially because i have broken many bones in my body over my life. So am concerned about the increase of  osteoporosis side effect.

I quit taking it and my hair quite falling out so bad for a few months the Doctor said take at least once daily and my hair is falling out again. It works great for the reflux bad for hair and bones.

I'm going to stop this medicine.

However, I have experienced multiple side-effects mentioned in other's reviews. I experienced a grand mal seizure after exercise in May of 2008 (not blaming Nexium)while rehabbing from knee surgery. I did more than a year of medical due diligence with no conclusive cause for the seizure. However, after some follow-on lab work it was discovered that I have a B-12 aborbtion issue; (necessary for nerve cell function). So I now take Flobic to maintain my B12. But over the last 1.5 years I have developed a nasty chronic cough that I can not get rid of. I have to change meds to stop this.I have also experienced issues in my arms and legs (weakness and numbness)that may be due to another condition in my neck with C4&amp;C5 and C5&amp;C6. But still many other have noted some of these same symptoms, so I cannot be so sure. I am a CPAP sleeeper, yet still awake almost every night at either 12, 2 or 4 a.m.and frequently cannot go back to sleep. I am looking forward to getting some relief soon from what just might be side-effects of this drug and I may be a poster child for several of them.FYI to those comparing Nexium and Prilosec. It is my understanding that they are basically the same formula manufactured by the same company less one difference, so I am left questioning the differing outcomes noted.

I'm very pleased. Prior to using Nexium, I've used Pepto-Bismol and Rolaids. While I won't say those meds don't work, I will say they don't work for me as well as Nexium.  There were times when I didn't have my Nexium and boy oh boy did I suffer, even with the others mentioned above.  The only thing that disturbs me is the idea that it decreases my stomach acids. So I'll have to do more research on that.  But on the whole I am VERY happy with Nexium!

I am able to eat a bigger variety of foods that I could not eat before. I have tried to go without the Nexium and within 12 hours, all of my symptoms return.  IE:  pain in shoulders, chest, neck, throat - feeling like I cannot swallow and am choking. The list goes on and on and on...However, I am greatly concerned about the possible side effects that I have been experiencing while taking Nexium for the past 18 months.  I am confused about what might be side effects from the Nexium and what are actually symptoms of the GERD that I experience.  I am also concerned about how long a person can take Nexium without harmful side effects - when is it ok to stop???  How can the doctors tell if you are &quot;better&quot; and do not need the Nexium any longer???

But, started having headaches everyday and gained 7 pounds in 2 months that could not lose.  Went off of drug 1 month ago and headaches are gone and have lost 3.5 pounds so far.  Staying off Nexium. Too bad because I liked how it worked, just not the side effects.

I no longer have heartburn, but still have persistent cough. This drug is very expensive (taking 2X daily) and am concerned with bone density loss. I continue to take it - lesser of two evils: treat Barrett's vs risk of bone density loss and vitamin deficiency??

By the time I go to bed I'm tempted to take a second 40 because the pain is back.

I am often bloated and burp all the time. When I am having problems which seems like all the time now, I wake up in the morning with severe back pains and bloating. I just changed to Aciphex to see how that works.

Also hoping to help bad breath issues.  I had some relief but felt being on a drug that is recommended for a short treatment cycle was not something that I wanted to continue.  This was over three years ago and since my treatment I have noticed I have much more flatulence.  I wonder if I no longer have enough acid in my stomach to completely digest my food and it now has an effect on my colon.  I am wondering if anyone else has had this experience.

However, within the past year, I have had a severe iron deficiency, vitamin d deficiency, bone loss in hips (and I'm only 44!), potassium deficiency which I already had has gotten worse and they can't figure out why. I don't seem to be absorbing anything even though I take a multivitamin, calcium, drink milk and eat yogurt every day, and eat lots of fruit and veggies. After reading some other reviews, I think I might stop taking the Nexium and find something else!

I've recently had a compression fracture not related to any injury and found out that even though I take calcium and Vitamin D supplements, it is not being absorbed due to the Nexium.  In addition, I have gained weight since starting Nexium and was told that it is your stomach acids that break down fat from your diet and Nexium interferes with how that fat is metabolized.  Wondering if there are still more clinical studies being done on this drug?  These side effects are not mentioned in Nexium's official list of side effects.

However, after reading so many of your reviews, I realized that my  signigicant iron deficiency could be due to this long term use of this drug. I also suffer from serious restless leg syndrome which has been linked to iron deficiency.  I also want to note that I recently took benefiber to increase my fiber intake and after two days my reflux was back with a vengence.  It has been two weeks and I am still feeling the effects.  I would caution anyone with GERD not to take benefiber.  It seems to have undone all of the good the Nexium does.  I have the symptoms of a heart attack with pain high in my chest under my arm and into my jaw.  It is very scary.  I now use Maalox on a regular basis.

Works good for reflux. Can't stop taking it or symptom's return worse than before. They say it is only an 8 to 12 week treatment. They lied. I was also diagnosed with severe vitamin B12 deficency. I was getting muscle cramps, tingling and numbness in my hands and feet. They never did a study on long term use of PPI's, but they are now warning people about the vitamin deficency. A little too late for me. I have permanent nerve damage in my left foot due to the B12 deficency. This pill works good for heartburn, but is poison for your body with long term usage. Anybody who has been taking it for a long time should get there GI doctor to check their blood work often and ask about vitamin supplements. Astra-Zeneca should have put some better warnings on this poison before they would let Dr's prescribe for long term usage. Good luck with your insurance company paying for this overpriced pill.
Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	10/31/2009 8:36:37 PM	While Nexium worked very well for treating my GERD, there is one rather serious side effect that is not advertised anywhere: sleepwalking. I started sleepwalking about three weeks after I began Nexium and looked for anything that could have caused it. I finally went to my gastroenterologist who told me that new studies that have been shown that Nexium can cause sleepwalking among those who had experienced sleepwalking at some point in there life (for me it was as a small child). It is very important to talk to your doctor about taking a different medication if you have any history of sleepwalking.

Tried prilosec previously -- it just aggravated my symptoms and I had an allergic &quot;can't breathe&quot; reaction to it.  Nexium works well on my GERD symptoms.  I probably have a bit more gas, though, while using Nexium, and it has affected my bathroom habits.  First few days it did cause diarrhea.  Now it's more like a combination of constipation and frequent trips to the bathroom, i.e., I find myself having to go more frequently but not as productively, if that makes any sense. Not happy about that because it has aggravated some hemorrhoids.   Most significant side effect seems to be muscle achiness and cramping, esp in legs, but occasionally in my back. I guess time will tell if this goes away.  Like most drugs, Nexium solves one set of issues while bringing on a different set of problems.   Overall, though, effective on GERD symptoms.  One last thing I have not seen mentioned:  since being on this drug for a few weeks, I am having very vivid dreams.  May or may not be related, but it is odd.

I've gained over 20 pounds. Every time I try to wean myself from the drug, increased acid reflux occurs, especially at night. I'm trying OTC meds, but they don't work. How long before the withdrawl symptoms of excess acid go away? Now I see others also have excessive flatulence and joint issues. Were any long term studies done before hooking the public on an addictive drug with quality of life issues thrown in, too?

I was on Protonix and felt great until my insurance company wouldn't pay for my medication any more- wanted me to try a generic- made me very ill and prilosec is useless. I was put on nexium. I gained 45 pounds- Nexium is Magnesium salt- sodium- you gain weight people- it also isn't strong enough-I ended up having a severe allergic reaction hives arms back shoulders from taking this salt! It also makes you run for bathroom-Protonix is not salt- this works great for me! I had my Dr tell the insurance company I cant take Nexium anymore! and my life is so much better-I dropped 13 pounds of water in two weeks!I also reported the severe allergic reaction to the FDA- If you have problems with drugs tell the FDA!

My diet has not changed since I started taking this med and I gained weight.  I started a rigorous exercise program in April 09 and improved my eating habits and I am having a hard time losing.  I believe the weight gain is because the acid in our stomachs break down the food we eat so that our bodies can digest it. Nexium decreases acid so our food isn't being digested like it should.  That's my opinion.

I do get occasional flare ups (due to poor diet esp. during holidays!) but overall this drug does the job very well with no notable side effects.  I noticed lots of reviewers comment on weight gain and I think the reason people are gaining weight is that they can finally eat what they want!  If you start gaining weight, keep a journal of what &amp; how much you're eating and I think you'll notice why the weight is packing on.  My weight has fluctuated over the years but I know it's because of my eating habits and not the Nexium. *I also tried Protonix for 6 months and it did not work as well as Nexium.

It's a shame because I felt it was beginning to work.

I first took protonix but had a tremendous amount of bloating. Because of a friend's recommendation, I asked to be switched to Nexium. This was about 9 months ago. It worked so well that for a while I didn't give it any thought. For the past few months, I have been fighting depression and I have gained over 25 lbs. I have gone from a size 12 to a size 18 and that size is becoming tight. If I stop taking Nexium for even one day, I am in terrible pain.  There as to be a better answer because I have no intention of being on this for the rest of my life.

In the beginning had severe heart burn, chest pain, nausea, constant feeling of hunger. Tums helped a little and then GI diagnosed hiatal hernia, erosive esophagus, prescribed nexium. It works and i cannot get off this poison. Symptoms return immediately if i miss one day. 40mg every day or alternate 40-20-40 if i can get my hands on 20mg. Gained weight, 65lbs overweight, appetite is still not under control so i eat small meals often. GI can't explain weight gain but says some ppl gain wt. I also get panic attacks, although not every day and only in situations that call for panic. Have developed depression, anxiety, constant fatigue, still occasional nausea, rare but very severe vomiting every 2-3 years (can happen, according to my GI). Not sure if side effects of nexium or because i'm stuck with it for the rest of my life. Taking Citrical because PPI blocks calcium absorption. Who knows what else is not getting into my body because of nexium. GI is against PPI, recommends surgery. Fundo is very risky, irreversible, for those who suffer same condition. I don't know how i'll be able to afford this purple crap for the rest of my life. AstraZeneca has got us hooked on this pill. This purple addiction ruins my life one pill at a time.

Some people say it gives weakness or they lost weight, this or that! Man you can not trust this patient review stuff, that is why they have controlled studies, that look at side affects statistically. If you believe the side effects cited in these reviews occur often your a dope, look at the numbers and the cited side effects on the SIDE EFFECTS page.    For me Nexium stopped my acid but gave me gas, stomach pain, constipation, so I switched to Aciphex.   Brian A Rational man

My dosage was upped to 40mg after I was sent to the ER for &quot;chest pains&quot;, which turned out to be related to my reflux.

My back muscles, well i can only stand and clean and cook for about 30 minutes before i am in tears from the pain in the middle of my back.  Sounds like it maybe from Nexium.  which that sucks and sucks bad because it has been a miracle drug for me.  I have GI bleeds and this has almost stopped the bleeds completely.  I feel as if i am between a rock and a boulder here, do i want my stomach to hurt and bleed or do I want my back to hurt this bad.  About typical for drugs, they can make one part feel great or normal but totally make something else hurt just as bad as the orginal pain..

Now I read this med causes excess stomach acid whenever you stop taking it. This appears to be a trap to guarantee the continued use of Nexium, and all PPI drugs.

It caused terrible stomach cramps so my doctor switched me to Nexium.  I tried to go without medication but what had been mild, occasional heartburn had become continual unbearable acid reflux.  The Nexium relieved my symptoms but I've gained 10 pounds without changing my eating habits.  The weight will not come off no matter how hard I try.  I think I would rather deal with my symptoms than the weight gain.

I just had some symptoms of Gerd. My initial side effects were intense bouts of nausea, which eventually passed. I took Nexium for 2 years and gained over 15 pounds which I could not get rid of, and I am a VERY fit person with very healthy eating habits. Not only did I gain weight, but I developed a strange belly that made me look pregnant! When I realized that I was probably a guinea pig for long term effects of Nexium, I stopped taking it. When I went off the Nexium, I had severe heartburn (for the first time ever), but it passed and now I feel great. I've also been able to lose the weight.

I spent approximately 4-1/2 years with an aggravated cough that grew worse at night which kept me from sleeping. These symptoms were miserable and unbearable. I spent years going from doctor to doctor and specialist to specialist trying to diagnose the cause of these symptoms. I was finally prescribed Nexium and these symptoms went away. This is a miracle drug, but unfortunately, I cant afford the $188.00 per month to continue the use, even with my insurance the cost was $158.00! I am going back into all the miserable symptoms I had for the last 4-1/2 years and not looking forward to it. I give the purple pill an A+ for effectiveness, but I give the company an F for not allowing their purple pill to be more consumer friendly and available. I dont believe that ones health should not be decided by ones wealth...

I have been having consistant severe stomace pain for a few days and finally went to the dr. It doesn't come and go, it's always there, but really bad after I eat. The dr. told me he thought it was an ulcer so now I'm on Nexium. If anyone could tell me how long it takes to start working I would appreciate it. I'm still in awful pain and hoping that it doesn't last much longer.

My dr. at that time prescibed prilosec and then prevacid both with short term help. Then zantac was prescribed which for years did help; but that stopped helping the reflux also. Then nexium came out and so far it is the greatest medication for reflux ever! I don't even have to take it every day. I take it every other and can eat and drink anything I want. Without being sorry for it later. MIRACLE DRUG!

My hands felt as though I had a bad strain.  These symptoms first occurred after several years of using Aciphex.  I needed to get off of that because I was not digesting my food well enough for absorbsion.  With serious erosion of the esphogus, I went on Nexium and the hand problems reappeared within 3 days.

I developed anemia earlier last year, and had all kinds of tests to determine the cause. It seems PPI's inhibit the body's ability to absorb iron, so females, please tell your Dr. asap if you feel any of the symptoms of anemia (one of my symptoms was a sore tongue). Your iron level can get dangerously low. My current insurance doesn't cover Nexium, so I am looking for alternatives, but I would rather not give it up. I take it at night right before sleep to avoid weight gain, as it can stimulate your appetite. I've also experienced fast heartbeat, but it has been after consuming alcohol.

It worked at the beginning, but the side effects were nasty. I can't believed the amount of gas my body was producing!! Extreme fatigue and belching,muscle aches,lightheaded, short of breath, diarrea,lost 9 lbs.in 2 months. Also, needed Maalox and Pecpid AC.I finally stopped taking it in my own,after 4 1/2 months.I read the reviews, a lot of females suffered from fatigue, it seems that males do better... What else is in Nexium that causes so many side effects??

Excessive Production of Stomach Acid	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	2/25/2009 2:02:49 PM	I have suffered from acid reflux/chronic heartburn for over 6 years, starting at the age of 16. I have tried every over-the-counter medication, including Prilosec, and modified my lifestyle to the point where I do not engage in ANY activities that would worsen my symptoms (eating meals at scheduled times, no citrus, no alcohol, no anti-inflammatories, etc.). Nexium is the ONLY drug that provides me with PREVENTITIVE relief. Prilosec did not have this effect, as I had been hoping. Nexium stops my acid reflux right away in the morning and I no longer have to live my life to accommodate this issue.

When Nexium was introduced my doctor prescribed it.  It has been 100% effective for me.  Occasional problems with my Medicare supplemental prescription insurance but my doctor has argued and won on that one.I take one 40mg daily and it is truly my miracle pill!  No adverse effects for me - ever.  I'm very pleased with Nexium and buy it no matter what the cost!  And it is very expensive - but for me - worth every penny.

I took it for about 3 years and in that time I gained a lot of weight.  Last year, my ins. co. changed me to Protonix.  I lost about 15 lbs over about a year and felt it did a good job. My ins. co. changed me back to Nexium about 45 days ago and I have already gained about 5 lbs. I wish ins. cos. would let the Dr. decide what suits each individual. I noted that one responder mentioned weight gain.  I'd like to hear if anyone else has experienced it.  I also wonder if Nexium interferes with my thyroid meds which is supposed to speed up my metabolism.  Nexium does work thouhg.

Prior to using Nexium I was experiencing sleep apnea, vomiting, stomach pain and loss of appetite. I had tried prilosec OTC and Prevacid prior to using Nexium without success. After 1 week of using Nexium I seen a clear difference in my sleep patterns, appetite, stomach acid production and over all daily health. I would recommend Nexium to anyone that is experiencing problems with acid reflux or related stomach problems.

I take these for severe Rheumatoid arthritis and Osteo arthritis in my lower spine (spinal stenosis).  Would not be able to tolerate these drugs without the Nexium.  Thank God for this drug!  If I make a mistake and run out before my new prescription is in I suffer terribly with my stomach.  These drugs are very hard on your stomach.  However, I would not be able to walk, turn on a light switch, care for my own personal needs, etc. without them.  If you are on a lot of drugs that are hard on the lining of the stomach, this is a wonderful drug to prevent ulcers, etc.

I could eat normally again, but now after so many years the medication is not working as well as it had been it still keeps my food down which is a plus but the frequent heartburn is too much for me anymore. this medication should be doing better now that i am taking Librax too.

I love it. Helps with cough, coats esophogus, calms acid back track. Insurance companys frown because they claim Prilosec which is OTC now is just as good. Have had problems with upper &amp; lower GI for years. Been on and off many products and am glad I am back on Nexium. For me this is the best. If there are any side effects, I do not know &amp; if there were? nothing could compare to the way it was without it. If you just have belching, may I suggest you to learn how to breathe in &amp; out of your nose. The only way air can get into your stomach is if you breathe thru your mouth. Solved this problem now can concentrate on the rest of digestive track problems

It helps my GERD due to a hiatal hernia.  I've tried to get off the medication couple of times, but when I do, I start feeling out of breath and a tight chest, like asthma symptoms, and the acid reflux returns. This pill does not give me any side effects.  I've asked my Gastro doc how long do I have to continue taking this medication, and for now, it seems indefinitely.  I dont know what long term side effects these protonix pills cause.  I hope the remedy is not worst than the current condition

I started feeling better within 2 days. I took it once a day for 10 days and I felt great. I stopped taking it and synptoms returned. I tried protonix this time with no good results. The protonix does absolutely nothing for me. So I am going back to nexium. It costs about the same as the protonix but the results with Nexium are tremendous. I had no more heartburn, no more stomach pain and no more nausea. Kudos to Nexium all the way.

When I do take it regularly, it works well in controlling my GERD. I tried taking it first thing in the morning when I wake up and then have a later breakfast, but then it made me nauseous. If I don't take Nexium, my acid reflux symptoms reappear.

Increase in  &quot;attacks&quot; following scope in 07. Doc tried Nexium to see if it will help and also heal erosion at top of stomach. First 2-3 weeks it seemed to be helping, but now i feel much worse. Stomach pain at top of stomach, much burping and reflux, spasming of throat muscles. Feel the need to clear throat constantly. After reading soem of these reviews, i think I will stop the Nexium for a few days and see if the Prilosec will take over and maybe help more. Don't want another scope as i feel that is what caused the increase in symptoms since last July date of scope.

I had a hiatal hernia that was repaired in 2000 using the Nissen surgery. I was off all medication for a year. Then my symptoms returned,I was put on Prilosec, after being on that drug, within a few months I was having 11 side effects of the 12 that were known. I was then put on Nexium starting a 40 mg daily, I did fine for years, about 2 years ago I started having chest pain, back pain, numbness, tingling in my arms and hands and heartburn again, went to the ER, My med was not enough, I was given a gastic cocktail in the ER (100% effective) and followed up with my Doc.... Now I take 40mg bid, the results are wonderful. On Dec 20, 2008 my RX was under eval, and I was left without my Nexium for 10 days, after 2 days (using OTC prilosec) I started to have back and chest pain (like in the past) Nausea, and general weakness. My RX was delayed because of insurance, I have gotten my Nexium back, Now, I have taken my 80mg and 99.9% of my pain is gone. I would like to know if anyone has had a withdrawl symptom like the one I had. The pain in my chest and back was intense, but now I feel almost normal. I am a Fire/Medic and in my 40's, I have seen alot of suffering, If something works, why are we being treated like children? We protect the ones who can not protect them self, and when I have issues, I feel like I mean nothing... MEDICARE....I pay, but I will never see that. MEDICADE---GET A JOB, I do understand that there are somethings that cannot be helped, and I am glad that these are in place..... ABUSED.... and it is abused.. I really do not know what the long term side effects of Nexium are, or the effectiveness of the surgery.  According to my new GASTRO, I should not have had the surgery...

After curing my gastric ulcer it is now helping me living with a permanent GERD caused by a hiatal hernia. Unfortunately my cholesterol went high and that is why I am not satisfied. I am sure this is a long term side effect due to the fact the stomach acid cannot properly adapt to the food ingested.

Once for GERD and once for an ulcer. It seemed to work but I could not handle the side effects. It interacted with some meds I take for bipolar disorder. When I took it the first time I found it difficult to come out of a depressive episode. Then I switched to Prilosec and I felt better, but I didn't put 2 and 2 together. So a few years later I decided to try Nexium again. Within a week I was feeling depressed and very anxious like I wanted to jump out of my skin. As far as effectiveness for heartburn etc, I would have to say it's not significantly better than Prilosec and definately not worth the side effects.

My symptoms have recently gotten worse again, I have Barretts Esophagus, so they are trying the Nexium again...I have many symptoms from another medication (Synthroid) I'm on, so I'm not sure if I'm getting any symptoms from the Nexium or not. I just don't want esophagal cancer, so, I'll keep taking the Nexium in hoping it will help the eroding in my esophagus, but so far, so good.

When I was between 6 &amp; 8 years old I was put on Zantac 75. For something (I can't be sure it was for these exact problems though I did have them at the time) and it kind of worked for me. However I was taken off it after a short time. When I was 13 I was put on Prevacid. I worked for a little while and then it didn't do much at all. I stayed on it for a few years. Then when i was 18 I just gave up I was taking it for so long and for no reason it wasn't helping. A couple weeks ago I started seeing a new doctor. My mom has been worried about me and asked him to try something. I've had tests done and they come back just fine. My stomach is so bad there are many days I can't get out of bed. I'm only 19 years old. If I get up and sit in my moms room or at the computer for a while thats a good day for me. I can't work and my problems worry my mom, because she can't help me. When I started Nexium 40 mg I have had a good improvement. I have a few problems with my stomach and a few were listed in the &quot;What is yor condition&quot;, but I picked other, because it described me better.

I have 7 ulclers nexium works the best for me.But now I have the trouble with my doc. filling out the paper work for my insurance company to keep paying for it . I guess it is time to find a new doc.My doc gave me a sample of prevacid and it didn't work at all I would wake up at night with heartburn.

Works great but can't skip a dose. Side effects are extreme fatigue, bloating and gas, hot flushes. I'd like to know what causes the terrible fatigue but I'd still rather have the side effects than the extreme pain in my stomach and esophagus. The cost and fighting with insurance may take me off of it. I've tried all other drugs and nothing worked like Nexium. We need a generic!

Yes it is pricey but effective and worth the $$ at least to me. On a rare occasion at night I have had to chew a pepcid, but only because I didn't watch what I ate or it was too close to bedtime.

I think it totally shut down all acid production. Started getting severe memory loss. Thought I was going crazy. Couldn't remember peoples names, conversations, etc. people should be aware that these drugs cause B12 deficiency if used for a long time. Lack of B12 can cause several neurological symptoms. One of them memory loss. Also numbness and tingling in the extremities. I'm going this week to be tested. I have numbness in my left arm and several other symptoms of B12 deficiency. Everyone should be tested if you stay on these drugs for a long time.

I really thought I was getting alzheimer's and I'm only 44. I know other people who have had the same effects. Had to stop taking Nexium because insurance woldn't pay any longer. Dr. put me on Zegerid and it worked great for a while. No memory loss at all. Now it doesn't seem to be working any more and I'm going to start on Protonix.Hope it works.

At first it worked really fast in terms of stopping my heartburns but nowadays I've been feeling some back pain and extreme tiredness and shortness of breath. I missed 2 days and out of nowhere I was sweating and my heart raced and til this day my left arm feels heavy and my heart races too fast sometimes. I only had 1 diarrhea occasion which left me lightheaded I thought I was going to pass out. But my stupid dr. tells me there is no side effects and my insurance is a pain with getting this approved. Overall it helps my heartburn but I am not liking how my body is feeling lately.

However, it gives me severe uncontrollable diarrhea.  Mornings are spent at home so I can be near the bathroom.  If I get out in the afternoon I must take two to three doses of diarrhea.

Lately I have had heartburn no matter what. I have also had muscle waekness, headaches, lower back pain, trouble swallowing, shotness of breath, and other things like easy bruising. My doctor keeps brushing it all off, and I couldn't explain it- especially loosing 100 pounds without trying (not complaining about that one). Today I read an article in my local newspaper abput side effects from Nexium. WOW!! I had to come here, and I am so glad to see there are others with the same problems. I will stop taking it immediately!!! To everyone out there- please listen to your bodies. Noboby knows you better than you!! If you know something is not right-it is not right. I almost died from a reaction to stsins because the doctors kept wanting to say I was just having anxiety attacks!! BEWARE OF THESE NEW MEDICATIONS!!!! they are not time tested like the old ones, and they have NO IDEA of the long term side effects.

It got rid of my heartburn, but gave me really bad gas. I literally burp every 5 seconds and its really embarrassing. Its so bad that the gas built up in the top of my stomach makes it hard for me to breathe. I personally stopped taking it because I can't deal with the side effects anymore.

While on it, it works pretty well.  Though taking it in the morning by bed time I am in pain again.  If I miss a does, I am done for the day.  In serious stomach pains.  I am trying to figure out why I am still taking this medication, when it is clearly working only when I take it.  I was doing great on aciphex, by tricare will not cover it any more.  I just want tis to stop, I am tired of taking medications.

Other	Chief, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/26/2008 8:08:43 PM	I was on Nexium about 4 years ago for heartburn and GERD and I felt great with this pill. I was later downgraded to Prilosec and then Protonix and I started vomiting to a point where I vomited after every meal for 3 years. Every medical test and proceedure came back negative and 3 different doctors were stumped. I lost so much weight vomiting that I was scheduled to have a feeding tube inserted into my small intestine! I finally asked the doctor if I could go back on Nexium just for the hell of it as I was running out of options. My vomiting ceased after only a week back on Nexium and I feel much, much better. Thank you Nexium.
Other	dlover5150, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/26/2008 1:45:59 AM	Was having major issues with eating, asthma, food, vomiting and other issues which caused anxiety attacks and many hospital visits. I took nexium, doctor thought I had pre-cancer in my esophogus and that my acid reflex-GERD was causing alot of my chest pain and anxiety problems. I took up to 4 pepcid a day just to beable to get water and very little food down. Literlly within 2 days I quit taking the pepcid and yet have to take one. I have been taking Nexium for 2 months and I feel like a new person. I have my appetite back, loosing weight because I can now eat right.  All I can say is give it a try, WORKED great for me.!

They just came up out of the blue. I've never had any acid reflux or esophagus problems in the past. But all of a sudden it became really painful to swallow so I stopped eating for about a week and a half. The GI dr. did a scope and found the ulcers then put me on Nexium. In just two days I was eating pizza and pasta and Mexican food. He wants me to keep taking one a day for three months and come back in a month to see if the ulcers are still there. I haven't had any side effects and wam just really impressed how quickly this pill worked. I also tried Zantac and Prilasec before seeing the dr. and that didn't work at all.

PYLORI BACTERIA WHICH IS WHAT CAUSES YOUR STOMACH TO PRODUCE EXCESSIVE GAS AND ACID?  THAT IS RIGHT, BACTERIA, NOT THE GOOD KIND BUT THE KIND THAT EATS AWAY THE GOOD AND LEAVES THE LINING OF THE STOMACH VULNERABLE TO BACTERIAL INFECTION. THIS CAUSES GAS, BLOATING, DIARRHEA, CONSTIPATION, HEARTBURN, ETC.   ACIDOPHILUS IS A GREAT REMEDY FOR THAT ONCE A DAY BUT YOU NEVER KNOW THAT UNTIL THOUSANDS OF MEDICATIONS THAT TAKE AWAY THE ACIDS LATER.  I AM ON NEXIUM AND JUST HAD TO MAKE MY DOC EVEN TEST ME FOR THE H. PYLORI BACTERIA WHICH HE SAYS IS POSITIVE.  NOW HE WANTS TO GIVE ME ANTIBIOTICS BUT CANNOT SINCE I HAVE TO BE OFF OF THE NEXIUM TO GIVE MY ACID TIME TO REPLENISH SO I WONT GET SICKER THAN I AM AND MISS WORK. THREE YEARS TO LATE WOULDN'T YOU THINK...... WELL, WELL, WELL.........

IT IS SUPPOSED TO ONLY BE PRESCRIBED FOR 8-10 WEEK DURATIOINS YET I HAVE BEEN ON IT FOR OVER 3 YEARS.  IT STOPS HEARTBURN BUT IF YOU LAY OFF OF IT FOR TWO OR MORE DAYS THE HEARTBURN RETURNS.  MY LEFT ARM ACHES EVERYTIME I TAKE IT. I HAVE GONE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THINKING IT WAS A HEART ATTACK OR STROKE. THE INTESTINAL GAS IS UNBEARABLE EVEN GAS X DOES NOT TAKE IT AWAY.  THEN THERE IS THE TIREDNESS AND THE FEELING LIKE YOU STILL NEED SOMETHING ELSE FOR YOUR STOMACH TO FEEL AT EASE. SOMETIMES THE GAS CAUSES SHARP CHEST PAINS AND EVEN DIFFICULTY CATCHING YOUR BREATH.  I JUST DO NOT THINK THIS PILL IS AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY MAKE IT SEEM. BUT IF I TRY TO LEAVBE IT ALONE I FEEL WORSE RIGHT AWAY.   I GET BETTER RESULTS FROM PRILOSEC WHICH IS MADE BY THE SAME COMPANY ASTRA SENECA. I AM FEELING THAT THIS LITTLE PILL MIGHT HAVE SOME SECRETS THAT ARE NOT YET REVEALED, YOU KNOW?

I tried Prilosec(really liked that I had no side effects) but it quit working after 6 months and the heartburn returned.  I am back on Nexium but this time experiencing terrible gas and bloating feeling this time. On the upside, the heartburn is non-existant.  Nexium offers the purple-pill card on their website which will allow you to get 6 months free prescriptions if you sign up for it.  I just got mine activated last month.

I do notice some mouth dryness, a slight sore throat, and a gurgling sensation in my stomach, some vague cramping in my stomach. I am going to try taking it every other day to see it that helps any better. It is wonderful to eliminate the heartburn. A friend told me it took him 6 mo and then all his side affects disappeared. Pharmacist says there is also a 20 mg dose, so i may try to see if that works for me w/o the side effects.  Good luck to all.

I produce a lot of stomach acid and have had GERD for 15 years. I took prilosec but it finally did not work very good. Without nex I would be in bad shape. I take 1200 mg of calcium every day as Nex leaches it out of my system. This is the only draw back I know of and I have not had any problems with nex so far. I would start with Prilosec and then if you need to, call your doc for a Nex prescription.

I've tried every OTC remedie out there as well as homeopathic attempts to deal with it. Nothing worked.I had constant heartburn 24/7, didn't matter what I ate or drank or what time of day/night.  I tried Nexium (and of course had to fight with the insurance co) and for the first time in years had total relief!!I'm NOT happy with the price (my co-pay is $55) A smart drug company would come out with a more reasonable generic and make a fortune on quantity sales.

The Protonix was excellent however, my insurance company would not pay for Protonix. There is a generic available for the Protonix and the insurance company wouldn't even pay for that. That is why I am on Nexium. Both of my rx's were for 40 mg. In comparison Nexium is not as effective for me as was the Protonix.

Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	4/9/2008 5:49:13 PM	I was told my stomach produced too much acid, and I was to take Nexium for 3 months.  It's now 3 months later, I've had an endoscopy that shows that my stomach and esophagus are still very inflamed.  I don't feel nauseous after eating every meal anymore, but I do still get that nausea.  I've been given a new prescription for 3 more months to keep trying.  I've noticed pain in my hands at night, and weight gain in the past few weeks.  It works pretty well for getting rid of the symptom of nausea, but it's not helping the cause.

I VOMITTED WITH PREVACID EACH TIME I EAT ONE HOUR LATER.  I HAVE BEEN ON NEXIUM FOR ONLY ONE WEEK AND THE DIFFERENCE IS VERY RMARKABLE.  NO HEARTBURN, NO DISCOMFORT WITH FOOD AND NO COUGHING AT NIGHT.  I AM 100% SATISFIED WITH THIS NEXIUM.  I AM STILL SEARCHING FOR ANY SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS BECAUSE USUALLY A DRUG THAT IS SO GOOD HAS SOME KIND OF NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECT.

I had sever heartburn episodes while asleep.  All i had to do is roll over and the acids hit me like a ton of bricks.  Even though 90 percent of my heartburn occured while in my night time somber..... the Dr. prescribed me to take this each morning.  I was skeptical but what a miracle this has been.  One hundred percent cancellation of previous symptons.

The cost is a concern but Prilosec is the same compound and it is slighlty cheaper and widely available.  I still get occasional breakthrough of acid and usually take 40mg twice daily when that happens.

If taken regularly Nexium works great. I would suggest trying over the counter drugs such as Prilosec since Nexium may be more than you need. When i run out of Nexium or missed a dose, i use Tums 1000 which works as a more immediate and temporary solution until the Nexium kicks back in. Although Nexium works great, it isn't a cure drug. it will only work as long as you take the drug, once you stop taking Nexium, the symptoms do come back so keep that in mind. of course by being on Nexium, any damage to your esophagus will have the chance to heal which is worth it. Overall i rate Nexium as a great drug, i only wish there was a generic version.

Due to this excessive vomiting I was struck witha hiatal hernia and have had stomach problems ever sine. I also have 2 ulcers and severe Acid Reflux. This drug almost always takes care of my stomach issues and very rarely do I have to double dose. I would recommend this drug. Though it says I have been on it for 2 years in total I have probably been on it about 3 1/2. After my first year and a half my issues &quot;cleared up&quot; but later returned which is why I am on it now.

I used to wake up every morning unable to eat anything because it made me vomit. My stomach was sensitive to almost anything with tomatoes, spices, or fried. Now I have a 'cast iron' digestive tract. My insurance doesn't like paying for Nexium. This is my third carrier in a row that considers it too expensive and wants me to try alternatives. In my experience alternatives don't work. I'm willing to pay $200 co-pay for three months worth (90 pills) of Nexium. I do worry about those who don't have this option. Why do the indurance companies hate Nexium so?

None of them work as well for me, even though with my insurance I can get them much cheaper or free, they just don't help me like the nexium does. The only real side affect that I seem to have is diahrea, and that seems to be less of a problem, perhaps as my body seems to be adjusting to the nexium.I am told by my doctor that I will probably have to take it for the rest of my life. That doesn't sit well with me since it is supposed to be the healing pill, but I'm told it will only heal so much.
