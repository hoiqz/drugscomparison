Skin Disease of the Scalp	 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male		7/14/2011 7:28:19 PM	I agree that Olux is great and Olux-E is horrible.  I don't know why they make the Olux-E and I hate that they force me to buy the Olux-E with the Olux in a kit.  I wish they would stop making the Olux-E.

I had this &quot;thing&quot; (dermititis?)  growing on my ankle for 25 years and Olux cleared it in a few days. It occasionally flares up on the same ankle or other areas on that same leg. Olux seems to clear it up in a few days. I get flare-ups about ivery 9-12 months.

Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/12/2010 10:58:44 AM	About 2 years ago I started losing my hair in clumps.  I was diagnosed with alopecia areata.  My dermatologist started treating me with Olux about 18 month ago.  I was applying it in the morning and evenings.  After about 6 months She switched to Olux in the morning and Retin-A in the evening.  About 95% of my hair has come back and new fine hairs are still appearing.  I am told my hair may have come back without this treatment.  I just know the hair is slowly coming back.  There are no side effects from either drug other than a slight stinging when the Olux is first applied. I found a large difference between when I first applied this foam and now.  The foam immediately turns to a liquid when in contact with warm skin.  When I first started using the foam with little hair I went through a can (100g) very quickly, less than a month.  Now that I have most of my hair back, a can lasts 3-4 months.  The foam stays a foam until I rub it in.  By patting the foam rather than rubbing it, it stings more.  I think this is because more of the medicine makes contact with the skin rather than the hair.

About 90% effective. I do need a total of 12 scalp injections to get rid of the remaining inflamation. I use it conjunction with Ketoconazole shampoo.
Plaque Psoriasis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/28/2009 5:17:30 PM	This stuff is better that white bread!! Easy to use, after a few days my scalp is clear of any psoriasis. Works so much better than tar shampoo and doesnt tint my gray hair a funny yellow color.

The newer OLUX  E is a mess...it is oily and the foam does not melt as quickly, and does not cover the scalp area as much, gets lost in the hair.  I used more of the Olux E than the original OLUX, and therefore spent more money...without a prescription plan....IT is an ungodly price!!!

It brought results much quicker than previous drugs my Dermatologist prescribed.

I do find this very easy to use and would really recommend it to people with moderate psoriasis. It did relieve the itching associated with it though. it worked great for that!!

This works great, it's not greasy, it's easy to use and you don't have to leave it in and then wash it out. My hair is color treated and it doesn't affect the color.
