Rheumatoid Arthritis	leegleze, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	55-64	7/22/2010 5:09:30 PM	I started on MTX oral immediately upon diagnosis of RA in 1990.  Due to stomach &quot;bleeds&quot;, my doctor put me on the injectable 3 years later.  I took it for the following 12 years.  Side effects I experienced were dry mouth, mouth sores, itchy rash, dry eyes and some lung problems.  The doctor prescribed Folic Acid 5mg per day to clear up the mouth sores.  It worked well.  I put up with the other side effects because they were the lesser of two evils, the other being RA flares.  Because I was on it so long, the doctor took me off it, without a replacement, and I was okay for a while, but just recently (2010), I had the worst flare of my life!  Maybe it's time to return to MTX.  I use acetametiphen with codeine if I feel a lot of pain because it doesn't bother my stomach as much as NSAIDs.  However, I always have to take them with a stool softener because they can be very constipating.  I also have Fibromyalgia &amp; CFS, and have tried Lyrica and Neurontin for those symptoms.  The side effects were horrendous from both ... I was a zombie and couldn't function. My family begged me to get off them because they were affecting our relationships.  I also experienced short term emory loss while on these drugs, a function I've not been able to recoup.

I also get severe headaches and vomiting.  My Dr. assured me I would not lose my hair but it has gotten very thin.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	19-24	6/5/2009 4:29:45 PM	I was diagnosed with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis when I was fourteen. My doctor prescribed methotrexate, and I had been taking the full dosage for about two years when my doctor halved my dosage. I had been doing really great until recently. I have been having flare-ups more frequently, and my new doctor (I had to switch when I turned eighteen) increased my dosage. She wanted to increase to a full dosage again but my liver isn't doing well so I am stuck at a little above half. I am still having more frequent flare-ups and have talked with my doctor about taking methotrexate with other drugs like Humira or Embrel. As far as symptoms go - I have had painful mouth sores, but taking folic acid had eliminated them. Every time I take methotrexate, I get extremely nauseous and am usually out for the rest of the day. Despite the symptoms, it had been a reliable drug up until recently, unfortunately.

It brought serious stomach pains especially when you had a bowel movement. My hcg never went up and it took over a month to get below ten. I was administered the shot when my hcg was at 6500, the doctors did not believe it would work and that i would need surgery. Iknow my bod and how well it takes to medicine, and how long it takes to recover from surgery, having a son already. Iwent wtih the shot and dont regret it. it was definetly the more painful way to go but i still have both my tubes. I am nervos of the side effects, since the shot i have lost almost all sense of smell, dont see this in the reading material as being a side effect but figured it was good info to put out there! i also have bad indigestion that has kept up now 3 months after the shot. interested in other side effects ladies may have, please make comments if you have had methotrexate for a ectopic pregnancy.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Seeking RA Cure, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	1/25/2009 5:28:23 PM	I have had RA for twenty years and have used Methotrexate for about ten years, both the pills and the injection. The pill did not agree with me, made me sick and my liver was taking a beating.  My doctor switched me over to the injection about 8/9 years ago and I have made major improvement since; however this is with the combination of REMICADE and not by it self. As a result of the RA and the medication I have also developed Sjogren syndrome, which I take Evoxac for. The Methotrexate has contributed to my hair lose, dosage varies from .4cc to .6cc. When I go up to .5/.6 cc my skin starts to breakout in white blotches and itchy pimple like bumps, that when I scratch the skin comes off.  Although my Doctor tells me that I am in remission because I have not had any major flare ups, I tend to differ.  I say this because I am suppose to last six weeks pain free (since this is how often I take REMICADE) but by the second week I start hurting and have to start taking over the counter NSAIDS, by the third week I have to start taking Prednisone and needless to say but by this time, I also look forward and cant hardly wait for my treatment and two weeks of complete pain free. In addition, I watch what I eat, practice yoga 2/3 times a week (even when I am hurting, it seems to help) and seat in the hot tub. I guess ultimately, the Methotrexate works but only to certain extend; however I do wish I could stop taking it.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	11/26/2008 6:42:25 PM	This is my second time on Methotrexate.  We finally went back to it after trying Remicade, Humiara, Enbrel among other injectables. They worked for a while but stopped.  This med is much easier to use than the pill form which made me violently ill. My arthritis has tamed down and I have not had a flare since taking methotrexate.  I have expierenced some strange hair loss that has not grown back even between treatment. I do spend most of the day in bed after my injection. Nausea meds help but I am very tired from the med. I also take folic acid with my injection.  If I had to do it over again I would have stuck with methotrexate rather than try all the other injectables.

The only thing bad I have to say is that I don't feel that the doctors fully explained to me what may happen after the treatment. I had no idea how long it would be in my system. They just said for a while which resulted in me becoming pregnant again and having the pregnancy terminated by the medication that was still in my system.

They had to give her massive doses via iv when she was going downhill fast. It took a while for her to come out of it, but she would not have survived otherwise. She has neurosarcoidosis and hydracephalus. She has been sick since 1986, and has been counted out many times, but has an incredible will to survive and an amazing faith in God. She never complains and just plows ahead, knowing that myself and our (now grown) two kids need her. Maybe she will even become a grandmother next year, but our daughter has illness issues as well and has lost her first two babies, with the third having trouble as well.

My skin problems are back though. It helped a lot of symptoms/ailments:pain,stiffness red face,diarrhea/pain from Crohn's-but caused serious RAWness in my nose tissues/ &amp; sore mouth= Thrush.

I've been on it for 1 year with no adverse side effects. Today I've noticed sore lumps in my right armpit. I guess I'll have to go to the doctor and find out what they are all about.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/7/2008 10:24:42 AM	Methotrexate has worked very well for my RA since starting it over 2 years ago.  I recently started taking injections at the highest dose (1ml). To make the shots easier, I ask for allergy syringes as they are the smallest and work just fine.  I've experienced a lot of hair loss/thinning and find that taking Biotin, 1-2 pills/day (over the counter and cheap!)has really helped. Dry mouth is also a huge side effect for me.  Dr. prescribed Evoxac which works well but makes you sweat alot!  Keep your mouth moist and visit your dentist regularly as consistent dry mouth can very quickly affect your teeth.
