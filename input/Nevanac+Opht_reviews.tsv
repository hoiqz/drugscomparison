Inflammation of the Eye Following Surgery	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/12/2011 3:39:41 PM	I had no side effects from it after cataract surgery.  For a week after the surgery, whenever I felt a dull ache in my eye, the Nevanac seemed to soothe the ache, like an aspirin for my eye. My vision in the surgical eye is now 20/20.

Withing one day after applying the drops I lost visual acuity excepting for response to light and dark and my eyes felt like they had been stuck with a hot polker.A week after cessation of the drops my vision was radically altered and I have cataracts.  the doctor thinks I had a rare allergic reaction.  Two days after the surgery he said my corneas looked &quot;like ground glass.&quot;I am posting this so others will know of the rare, but possible, side effects.
Postoperative Pain in Eye	imanikadijah, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	7/15/2011 5:32:08 PM	After partial transplant,cataract surgery &amp; IOL, this med which I realized later was an NSAID, caused severe stomach upset. By the time I discovered this med to be the culprit, I was practically bedridden! It is extremely expensive!!

This is the same reaction I have to all NSAIDs taken in pill form. I plan to stop taking the drops.

Now after cataract surgery I use Nevanac, Vigamox, and Durezol drops three times a day in my right eye. All is going well except that I feel sick to my stomach after using. I think it's the Nevanac in combination with the other two that might be causing my stomach to feel bad. Wondering if anyone else has had a similar side effect from Nevanac.

After surgery, I have developed laryngitis.  I am not sick in any way and the surgery went fine.

The surgery definitely corrected the dimness of vision caused by the cataract, but it left my visual acuity in that eye very reduced.  The opthalmologist put me on a second course of Nevanac, suggesting that continued inflammation was the cause of the reduced acuity.  After several weeks, with no improvement, I chose to discontinue the Nevanac.  The acuity has neither improved nor worsened.  I think I'll probably need further laser surgery to improve my vision(I would at least like to have the acuity I had before the cataract surgery), but am not sure if I trust the surgeon or the Nevanac at this point (not knowing why my vision is less sharp than when I started, though it is less dim).
