Breast Cancer that has Spread to Another Part of the Body	RegMar, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	45-54	6/19/2012 12:17:40 PM	Orig. dx with mets to spine.Did A&amp;C when first diagnosed and made it through okay, but was very happy when it was over and had a complete response. Took aromatase inhibitors for 1 year, then PET showed mets in chest wall and liver.  Took Taxol with minimal S/E; annoying neuropathy in feet was the worst part but tolerable.  PET after 6 months showed NED! But the very next month an MRI showed tumors in my chest wall again and now, just 3 months later, a new spot on my liver.  So Taxol worked well for me and I tolerated it well, but it worked only briefly. Now I start Xeloda. Hope it works and lasts a lot longer than Taxol.

I developed terrible burning pain all over my body which worsened with any amount of touch.Neurontin helped somewhat but I suffered quite a bit until the treatments were finished. I am still on Neurontin four months after finishing 4 Taxol treatments over 8 weeks. After two courses I asked my oncologist if I could switch to weekly treatments to complete the course, but I did not choose to do that fearing that it would compromise the efeectiveness of the overall chemo regimen. If I had this to do over, I don't think I could tolerate this drug again because of the hyperesthesia.

I have been diagonosed with stage IV spinL nd lymph node cancer. The first treatment seems to be fine; no nausia, no weakness. But, I have had the need to take a bowl movement medication. This worked so well that I feel better and am able to do the normal things a women and loving wife should do - -  no sex however.My husband has been my best friend, is very supportive and very attentive to my needs. Sometimes he just does things that I thought he would never do - he is a great husand! Shirley A. Rexin
Breast Cancer that has Spread to Another Part of the Body	Momma Mel, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	2/24/2011 12:50:42 PM	I was given 12 weekly infusions of Taxol through a port, after having been through 4 AC infusions given every other week.  I first had a mastectomy and axillary node dissection with 2 nodes testing positive for breast cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma.  The AC portion of chemotherapy was pretty horrible, leaving me nauseous for several days each time and resulting in complete hair loss and lowered blood counts.  The Taxol was so much better by comparison!  No nausea, only some neuropathy in my feet that I can handle, especially considering the benefits of Taxol for those of us who are triple-negative.  It has been 3 1/2 weeks since my last treatment and I feel very good, only a bit of remaining neuropathy.  I think a big part of minimizing side effects is remaining active.  I walk vigorously 6 days a week, 3 miles a day, at a local mall and was strength-training 5-6 days a week before chemo, which I hope to resume soon.  I was at my goal weight when diagnosed and was in good health, which I'm sure helped.  I kept walking throughout my 20 weeks of chemo treatments, except for the days of overwhelming nausea.  I also saw my blood counts rebound in a big way when I resumed taking multi-vitamin supplements plus extra magnesium and calcium every day during treatment.  I had been forgetting them, but making sure to take them daily helped so much.
Locally Advanced Breast Carcinoma	Mommyof3angels, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	2/5/2011 6:37:51 PM	42 yo Mother of 3 girls.  Diagnosed with St. 2 breast ca at 29weeks pregnancy.  Held off on chemo 'til after elective delivery at 35 weeks.  Started Taxol weekly x 12 the next day.  Get chemo on Thursday afternoons.  Little foggy on Fridays and quite fatigued 11am for few hours every day of weekend.  Then back to work as usual Monday-Thursday.  Peripheral neuropathy of both feet started suddenly on treatment #6 when I went had treatment while a little dehydrated.  Felt like frostbite for a week.  Got better next week with decreased dosing, then returned to normal dose and now some mild tingling of all toes all the time.  Fatigue was worse with last few treatments.  Mild nausea toward end, never needed meds for it.  Lost hair throughout and finally shaved head after 9 weeks.  Treatments went just as oncologist had expected--overall some fatigue, but with 3 little ones, hard to take naps.  Was not a bad experience or anything to fear!  Going on to A/C and nervous about  possible increased nausea and low white counts.  This reverse order of chemo allowed me to be a healthier Mommy for a while and gave me a little time to recover after my third daughter's birth!  Just finished the 12 weeks 3 days ago.  Went to museums all day with my sister-in-law today in NYC.  Chin up!  You'll get through this!

Taken with steroids that interrupt my sleep the night after chemo.  Neuropathy in my hands and feet has improved from the AC, although my fingernails have continued to deteriorate. Nails and hands are much less painful. I am really tired the third day out and tired (but less so) day four and five. I have flu like symptoms (aches, sweats, chills) most days on Taxol/Herceptin. Tylenol relieves these symptoms.  I also get a slight allergic type reaction. My eyes burn and water, runny nose with an unproductive irritated kind of cough. Benadryl and Claritin help. None of it is too awful. Better than rotting from the inside out with cancer.

My first treatment left me in pain. The reduced it to half dose every week with same effects. I am a year out and have horrible nerve damage, eye sight problems and constant pain in my entire body. My short term memory was also affected. Was told by my oncologist, these are all permanent and have to live with them for the rest of my life. I too am in pain management.

I was told not much time left for me, but if I used taxol it may help extend it.I pretty much knew what to expect because of the first time. What I didn't expect was the side effects from the steroids and other drugs that they have to give you with it, like insomnia, the whole next day and night being wired out and then the fatigue and complete weariness that goes with it, all by the third day thru to the next chemo, but the worse was the depression it was making me fall into because of lack of sleep and how extremely tired I was. It got worse with each chemo, which is once a week for three weeks and one week off. I had no real quality of life for my family and I work everyday. Luckily for me I told my doctor what was going on and she started me on the Taxol with Abraxene instead of the steroids and things have gotten alittle better. I am now starting to sleep better (still have days I can't sleep and I take sleeping pills everyday), I am not wired out after chemo, I still get fatigue and I get tired out very easy but I don't have the depression anywhere near to what I had had. I still have my down days but at least now it is alot more tolerable and manageable than before. My biggest thing is that the doctor has added Avastin to my regiment of drugs and I am scared to death of it, especially after the FDA wanting to withdraw its approval. Any words on this or suggestions?

I made it through 2 treatments sicker than anyone should ever  have to be and ended up in ICU with a heart attack and low red blood count. I got 2 stents and 3 pints of blood. It felt like the worst flu I have ever had and I still have chemo brain from it. I took it in Jan 2010 and fianally had my modifed radical breast surgery 3 weeks ago. It is early June 2010 now. This drug will either kill you or cure you! All in all I would never take it again I dont think but it did do its job they have told me.

I made it through the A&amp;C part with no real issues other than not being able to stand the smell of food cooking and the hair loss was pretty traumatic.The taxol caused my hands and feet to burn it became intolerable after the 2nd treatment. I continued with the treament even though it was hard for me because my Dr wanted to put me on Taxitre which could have been worse for me, I was not going to start from the beginning with a new medication. This was the olnly time in my treatment that I had to take pain meds, Morphine to be exact. I now have all sorts of issues with pain and my hands. I'm a mess but I'm still alive. I was able to get Disability I was turned down twice and then I got an attorney and I got it; it took about 21/2 yrs. to get it but I have it now and that's one less thing for me to worry about. Joining a Breast Cancer group really did help. I suggest going to a group these women know what your going through it's very important to let all your fears and pain.

I took only one treatment and was so sick they had to cancel my second treatment.  I had hives from head to toe, vomiting, diareah, tingling in my fingers, wide eyes zombie looking, lost all of hair, lost 20 pounds, prayed everytime I wanted to sip water, I still live on Immodium and it's been over 3 weeks since the treatment.  Most of these side effects lasted 12 to 17 days.  I refuse to take it again.  I had every allergic reaction possible.  When they were giving it to me I woke from a sound sleep all flush and couldn't breathe.  The put me on oxygen and pumped me full of benadryl and it took 2 hours to pull me out of the reaction and they still gave me the rest of it.  And still want to give me more...no way.

I get the infusions 3 weeks in a row and then a week &quot;off&quot;. The original plan was to follow this for 4 rounds. I am also getting Avastine the 1st and 3rd infusion of each round. At this point, don't know if it is helping.  Initially I had terribly joint pain in my knees and very weak.  This occured 2 days after the infusion and generally lasted 2 days.  With the last 3 treatments, I have not had the joint pain so much, but have been VERY weak, tired, sleepy and short of breath.  Hoping it continues to just last 2 days.  Lost the hair about 2 weeks after the first treatment.  Now I am finding that my sense of taste is failing. No numbness.Heartburn is pretty much constant if I don't take Tagamet and intermittant diarehea that has been controlled with Immodium.I have not gotten a port but it is getting too hard to find a vein so, getting a port next week.  I had hoped to avoid that.If this works, it is worth it....  I have been able to continue to work.

Took treatment on Thurs. and was down thru Sunday. Worked Mon, Tues, Wed. Office Job, with very little energy and found myself forgetting things (very understanding boss).  Already had osteoarthritis in knees before treatment, so it made it worse. Nausea &amp; bloating feeling the day of and day after treatment. Wiped out for 3 1/2 days.  Feet and Toes numb, but medication for neuropothy counteracted my reflux medication, so stopped neurontin.  Four months since last treatment, feet and toes still numb and have spells of feeling freezing cold.  Energy slowing returning.All in all, if cancer doesn't come back, worth it.

Initially, the cancer responded to treatment.  However as time progressed, it stopped responding and my father experienced neurological problems similar to a stroke.  He cannot use the right side of his body.  It is totally weak.  He started experiencing the weakness in May 2009.  Though he did not lose his hair, he lost his functioning and mobility.  Please be mindful when the oncologist recommends this drug.

Other	heartsick, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/17/2009 11:59:47 PM	My husband took this form of chemotherapy for treatment of stage 4 malignant melanomma that has metasised to basically every area of his body. Previously he had been treated with interferon (the most horrible chemotherapy ever invented), DCIT, several radiation treatments and Temodar. He has had nonstop problems with the Taxol but has been told this is the last thing they can do for him. The oncologist is leaving it as my hubby's decision when to stop.He has lost the hair on his head, his beard and mustache and is beginning to lose his eyebrows. His face is swollen but not sure if this is from the Taxol or steroids. He is on major painkillers for the cancer pain.  He suffers from feeling overheated to freezing, severe leg pain (which is treated with short term steroid use)swelling of legs from the knees to the toes, so much pain he can't walk most of the time, pain throughout his entire body, and just feeling like his body is shutting down and dying. At this time he has just hadhis 4th treatment and the cancerous tumors are still growing.  The oncologist said sometimes it can take 5-6 treatments before the Taxol works.While the side effects may be horrible my husband is willing to try whatever is necessary to try to stay alive for as long as possible. He hates the treatments but knows he has to try. All cancer patients on this chemo you have our sympathies but never give up the fight! May God bless you all!

Other	melwork, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	35-44	1/27/2009 8:02:41 AM	I have invasive Ductal Breast Cancer in my left breast.  A 6cm tumor.  The cancer has not spread to other parts of my body.  I just had my 2nd round of Taxol.  My first round, they gave me Dexamethasone and Benadryl to combat to allergic reactions to the Taxol.  I reacted immediately to the Taxol within 1 minute.  I had a sudden flame/torch hot feeling in my head and neck and then my throat started to close up.  They gave me another super dose of Benadryl and the symptoms subsided immeditately.  My hair started to fall out the day before my next treatment.  I was quite a bit of hair and started it seems almost overnight.  My second treatment was yesterday.  I took 20mg of Dexamethasone pm before treatment and another 20mg the am of treatment.  They gave me Benadryl again but we waited 30 minutes for the Benadryl to kick in before starting the Taxol.  Seemed to work, but I started having labored breathing and a weird itch/tingle in my throat about 30 minutes into the treatment.  They stopped the treatment and my doctor prescribed 10mg more of Dexamethasone and more Benadryl.  Restarted the Taxol and I didn't have any further reactions.  Doctor said that once the Taxol is in your system, you will build up a tolerace for it.  So my hopes are that when I go back in 2 weeks, there will not be any reactions at all.

Due to have 11 more. Just finished Adriamycin/Cytoxan, which was brutal. On Taxol, I had commented that this is the first time I have felt &quot;Normal&quot; in 4 months. Went for my 2nd treatment today and it was cancelled because of elevated liver enzymes. Otherwise, this has been a very well tolerated treatment for me. I'll stop back with more comments halfway through. I hope I'm still feeling as well after my 6th treatment as I do now.

I found this drug so difficult to tollerate. I have been off the chemo for a month and my hands and feet remain numb and burn. Also my legs hurt terrible. It was a bad experience. I do not see how anyone could take this and work. Good luck to all who take this drug.

Had a good knockdown of residual nodules and CA125 numbers.  Went to Doxil and Topetecan with dismal results so am back on Taxil alone.  After first dose experienced sleeplessness.  Hope further treatments with this will not cause the same effect.

Experiencing severe breathing problems still after 2 1/2 weeks. Oncologist denies any possibility of a relationship to taxol; pulmonologist says delayed reactions have been documented.

I also developed numbness in the fingers and toes. Later on I developed pain in the joints - particularly the toes, ankles and wrists. Now 4 years later I continue to have severe pain in the ankles and wrists.  If I over work or exercise the serverity of the pain increases.  I have cramps in the arches of my feet and sometimes my hands and fingers.  I wonder if I am getting better or worse. I stopped taking Tamoxifen because I was unsure if the pain was a long term side effect of the Taxol or increasing because of the Tamoxifen. I have been off of the Tamoxifen for 6 months now and the pain has settled in at a non-changing degree which is still pretty high. The taxol caused me so much pain during chemotherapy I would have accepted amputations - no questions asked. Yep it was that painful. Praise and thanks to God that the pain became bearable after the treatments ended. Now if the cramps will just go away I might be able to tolerate the ongoing pain.  This month I am a 4 year survivor.

It made me horribly ill, anorexic, nausea, severe fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, severe Chemo Brain. No one told me about the last 2. Its been 2 years and I still suffer nightly with the peripheral neuropathy, and do still have some cognitive difficulties, including making simple decisions. I also could not work for over a year and unable to get any disability because this is not a recognised disability, (the chemo brain that is).If I had been warned I could have made a more informed decision and the answer probly would have been &quot;find another medication&quot;
Cancer of the Ovary	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	45-54	8/5/2008 7:16:59 PM	I've been treated with Taxol/Carboplatin two times.  The first was frontline therapy after surgery when I was diagnosed with Stage IIIc ovarian cancer.  I went into complete remission which lasted almost 2 years.  When I recurred with a small tumor on the colon, I had another surgery and again received Taxol/Carbo and went into remission.  However this time the remission only lasted 3 months.  The side effects were nasty.  I did not have nausea, thanks to Ondansetron, but I had bad flu-like aching in my joints that lasted anywhere from 2 to 6 days after each treatment (which were once every three weeks).  And of course hair loss.  It was worth it though, to have that time in remission.  I've had two other types of chemo since then and neither has put me back in remission.

Cancer of the Ovary	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/5/2008 5:55:26 PM	I was given 3 treatments of Taxol and another cancer drug for Ovarian cancer.  After 3 treatments and 3 trips to the Emergency Room later that day/night and being admitted each time for severe pain in both legs starting above the knee to my toes. I was sent home with bags full of pain medications that ended up knocking me totally out, I said no more and went saw a different oncologist who referred me to a pain specialist and finished my treatment with a different medication.  I have been cancer free for quite awhile now but as a result of the Taxol I have to take a drug called Methadone for the pain so I can at least function enough to go to work part-time.  This pain will be with me for the rest of my life, I am now 57 years old, and do not know how much longer I will be able to work because the pain is getting worse and if I increase my medication I can no longer work.

Most severe in knees, feet and ankles, but mildly in arms, neck and hands.  Numbness in hands and fingers.  Needed daily naps!  Confusion, would get lost driving or suddenly forget how to drive.  Could not work due to memory loss and lack of focus and concentration

Last week after treatment the site swelled and turned brownish red.  The site measured measurned 6&quot; by 5&quot; Its been almost a week and now the site is peeling.
