Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	10/3/2012 2:04:41 PM	A lot of other websites talk about how &quot;dangerous&quot; this drug is, due to the possibility of blood clots. If any of them actually asked their doctors about it, they would have been told, ANY BIRTH CONTROL, has the potential of giving blood clots, not one is more dangerous than another. I absolutley loved Ortho Evra. My breast grew a cup size, i was eating less, beautiful skin, shorter period, I cant say my sex drive increased, but I was overall estatic about my first birth control being so easy and effective. I kept it on my shoulded blades, rotating it weekly. It never came off besides the edges. I wouldn't recomend anything else.
Birth Control	Mary, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	7/13/2012 2:59:44 AM	I cant say its a safe med, it triggered my blood pressure to go up after 2 months. Plus most insurance does not cover for it, u have to pay the max co pay.
Birth Control	ASquared, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	25-34	6/22/2012 1:53:13 PM	I used the patch for 6 months.  The first couple months were fine and did not notice any changes in my weight or moods.   I've decided to switch methods because my skin is starting to reject the strong adhesive of the patch.  The patch has become super itchy and leaves nasty marks on my skin that don't heal very quickly.  I wish my skin didn't start reacting to the patch, otherwise I'd still be using it.

Birth Control	dbanani, 19-24 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		19-24	4/11/2012 10:04:54 PM	I have never tried anything other than Ortho Evra.  I have used this for 7 years and am very satisfied overall.  My patch fell off on 2 different occasions, but thats not bad at all for a 7 year time frame!  However getting a replacement patch was a pain in the rear with the pharmacey, and my insurance wouldn't cover it.  Other than that, I have ZERO side effects, and would highly recoomend this.
Birth Control	delta, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/12/2012 4:36:11 PM	I have been on this for 6 months. I love, love it. In the beginning I had a little nauseousness. After,the first month I was back to normal. I change it on Sundays. My 4th week I leave off my period will return on that wed or thurs. on Sunday I put on a new patch. It has worked well for me. It's something you don't have to think much about.
Birth Control	Chelle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/15/2012 11:30:33 AM	I love the patch!! I've been on it for 8 years with a planned break of about 18 months to conceive and have my son. The only bad thing about the patch is insurance prices making the co-pay outragious so I have to switch to something cheaper :( The patch is great for skipping periods by appling a new patch after 3 weeks, but insurance put a monthly quanity cap on that now too. There are some side affects as with EVERY hormonal BC but they are all minimal for me. There is not an effective BC that is low mantience, weight curbing, mood stabalizing, period minimizing, and sex drive increasing. Beleive me, I've looked!      
Birth Control	Lux, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	2/7/2012 2:10:25 AM	My breasts have gotten bigger and I no longer have acne, but my sex drive seems to have taken a hit, I get sick to the point of dry heaving at the beginning of the patch cycle, and I've realized that ever since I started using the patch, I have steadily become more and more depressed. However, I don't have an alternative as I have already tried everything else except an IUD (which my doctor refuses to give me). Looks like I'm stuck with depression and dry heaving.

I gained 2lbs while on it and my periods lasted 3-4 days. It also helped my hair and nails grow. It worked very well for the first 5 months but I found out I was pregnant....so much for that. 
Birth Control	cglpl72, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	1/21/2012 5:34:55 AM	i have been on ortho evra for 3 months, i started using it because it is very easy to remember to use but i am not satified with my periods. i have never had a period that lasted more than 4 days be using this product. now they last up to 7 days, something im not used to at all. i also find myself becoming quite emotional at times and i am not a very emotional person at all. i like that i can remember to use the product but if it doesnt even out i may go back to the pill which never gave me any problems.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/10/2012 8:54:04 PM	I have been on the Patch for 8 years.  I have never had an issue with it.  Never had any spotting, or other side effects.  I would highly recommend it. The only weight gain that I have had is due to eating poorly and I am easily able to lose it when I eat right and work out, I don't think it has been related to the patch.  
Birth Control	XSTurner, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	1/8/2012 1:08:03 PM	Ive used the birh control patch for over a year and a half. I took myself off of it because I did begin having moderate mood swings that were affecting my business and personal relationships. I have recently-like a day ago began using this method of birth control again becasue its the only method Im most comfortable with.

Im 24 years old, healthy, non smoker and have been on this since april of 2011 and it's not dec of 2011. My life now has changed...forever. I have to take blood thinning meds for 6 months, I have to watch what i eat (Certain foods I can't eat on this med). No matter when...whenever i get pregnant, i have to take a shot (lovenox) during the pregnancy to avoide blood clots, and i can never take a hormone again. Be aware when taking this, you will be at risk and when you think i will never happen to you...guess what...it will. Just google &quot;ortho evra lawsuits&quot;
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	35-44	11/20/2011 8:07:39 PM	I have been on birth control for 20 years....I have been using the patch for almost a year. IT is easy to use and remember, but I have a problem with the edges sticking to clothing, and it coming off in the pool or the shower. I have severe mood swings and anxiety from it....ridiculous mood swings! I am going to try something else. It may work for you but it wasn't worth it for me. I was very satisfied with Nuva Ring in the past. I stopped Nuva Ring because it injured my boyfriend during sex. My periods have been heavier on the patch than on the pill or on nuva ring and I have had worse cramps. I think I will have to go back to the pill again although it's inconvenient. I wanted to try the Depo shot but after reading/hearing horror stories I will pass.

First, it will stick to your clothes at the edges a little, and I found that the top part of the patch would loosen under the water flow from my shower head.  I solved this last issue easily by wearing a 4 inch by 4 inch bandage over it, but NOT adhering to the patch when showering.  I never had a problem with the stickiness after I figured that out, and I spent about $3 on bandages each month.  My cycle was regular, 5 days, and exactly the same as without the patch.  My skin was clear, but it was mostly clear with only 2 or 3 zits before my period without the patch.  I had some other side effects: moderate breast tenderness, increased breast size by 1 cup :), about 5 lbs of weight gain over 5 years even with increased exercise and diet changes, and menstrual bloating that was much worse than before.  This did increase the severity of my migraine with aura headaches, but it did not increase the severity of my non-migraine headaches. Migraines are terrible anyway, but I had the worst one of my life while on the patch. It did not affect the frequency of my headaches.  My blood pressure remained normal also.  Eventually, the medical community changed the eligibility requirements for combined hormone birth control, thus banning this drug from people who have migraine with aura like me. My migaines are infrequent, and to be honest the increased severity was acceptable to me. Overall, the patch was easy to use once I stopped letting the shower wash it off, the side effects that were constant were manageable if not an improvement (yay extra cup size!), but my migraines were worse.  I could have dealt with it, but sadly it is no longer an option due to my migraines with aura.
Birth Control	RG, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	8/27/2011 2:41:53 PM	This was my first birth control method. I loved the effectiveness of OE, but I hated the stickiness aroud the patch. sometimes the tip would get attached to my jeans. It detached form my skin several times during the 9 months of usage. No side effect for me! My sex drive ramained the same, no weight gain, decreased my acne, periods slightly lighter and for the same amount of days as my regular period, my cramps dissapeared, and didn't experience mood swings. I stopped using it because it burned my skin! To this day, I still have the mark it left on my skin. Now I am searching for another BC method. I would love to use it again but I am afraid it will burn my skin again.
Birth Control	Amanda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	8/15/2011 2:05:48 PM	I loved and hated it.  I felt extremely sick to my stomach for probably the first year I was on it, but only the first day after I started a new patch (so once a month).  I was pretty emotional the first few months as well.  After time I stopped feeling sick and my emotions went back to normal.  I never had issues with it falling off or gaining weight.  Worked great overall, but the queasiness was tough to take.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/13/2011 11:11:00 AM	I've been on ortho evra since 2001 and never had a problem with the patch other than the occasional &quot;get stuck to my clothes&quot; incidents.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	19-24	6/13/2011 10:37:53 PM	This summer I was VERY excited to try the patch, and through a bunch of hoops, leaps and bounds, I finally got the prescription (My OBGYN had left her practice, I had to find a new one, lots of waiting, then pharmacies I went to were all out of the patch, etc...)Anyways, after my long awaited arrival, I started the patch.My first week I placed my patch on my buttox, and the second week, on my shoulder.The reason my rating is so low, is that I had very severe reactions to the patch, which makes me sad because I really do like this birth control.I had severe nausea, and stomach pains that were bad enough that my doctor sent me to the ER (thinking it was appendicitis, or ovarian cysts).I was on the patch for 2 weeks, and even prescribed nausea medication would not kick my reactions to the curb. It was only after a process of elimination this past weekend that I decided to see if it was indeed the patch causing symptoms (I've never had a negative reaction to medicine before, so it was not a thought that crossed my mind initially). Since I have taken the patch off (3 days), I have recovered 100% and my symptoms are gone.Please do not let this scare you away from trying the patch; I really do think that this is a great form of birth control, it just did not agree with my body. So I do HIGHLY recommend trying the patch, I was just unable to rate it higher due to my crazy symptoms.On a side note- after some deep research, I found that Ortho Evra could also reduce your tolerance to carbohydrates. I am currently on a strict all-carb diet due to digestive issue (which is why at first I thought I had the stomach flu with my symptoms, but 2 weeks is a little too long for the stomach flu, especially after being to the doctors and the ER with blood drawn and IV's).To sum it up, Ortho Evra is worth a shot, and I hope it works for those of you that try it. I was sad that my body was unable to respond well. Maybe the increased estrogen played a role?
Birth Control	BL, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/1/2011 5:44:31 PM	I used Ortho Evra for about 5 years and loved it! No additional side effects and it was so easy to use. I'm currently not using them because my doctor had me switch to a estrogen-free alternative because of my migraines. :( Bummer. I was very happy with them!
Other	jmho, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	1/19/2011 9:18:36 PM	First attempt at cycle manipulation so vacation later this year would not be interrupted by cramps, *etc*; was soooo hoping it would work, gave it a good 4 months... still wound up with two periods a month, or early periods :( and I never missed a patch in all that time-frame.  When I did finally take the patch off for good, period was strong as before so my body was simply ignoring the meds.  I'm also well below the weight limit and applied the patch on a very lean spot... I truly did my best to make this relationship work!  Have switched to Sprintec in a last-ditch effort to save my impending vacation... wish me luck.  :)

I was told it could take up to 3 months for my body to readjust from going on. it has now been 12 months, i'm still not pregnant, and i am still spotting for a week before my period!! I think the estrogen levels from this drug have long term effects!

But there are too many other &quot;cons&quot; for me, so I will not be using it much longer.The adhesive is extremely irritant... Ive itched so hard I bleed!  It doesnt stick very well either.  The edges are always peeling back from &quot;gunk&quot; off my clothes.  I tried putting medical tape over the edges, but the tape's adhesive only made the skin irritation worse.  Another minor downfall is the cost.  Even with prescription insurance, I still pay almost $50 a month for the patch.  That is more than I care to pay for something that is such a hassle to use.

My dermatologist has given me mega-antibiotics.  My gynecologist says it's the best thing for Endometriosis; but he's not the one with the headaches, loss of appetite, and itcy patch stuck to him.  If you have acne; check under the patch after a few days... you don't want to end up with the mess I did.

Birth Control	tori, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	13-18	3/25/2010 4:56:05 PM	I am 16 years old and this is the fourth method of BC the doctors have tried. The other three attempts were oral pills and they always made me sick and I developed ovarian cysts. The patch was prescribed to me to help my period, and to stop ovulation to rid of the cysts. I have only been on the patch for four days. I have ripped it off because I am very upset with it. I am sick yet again. My breasts are sore and swollen, my hormones are crazy (I cry so much!) I have no appetite and I have tried to eat and it doesn't cooperate. I am sick to my stomach all the time. I have had a migrane since the first 24 hours I applied it. The patch left gooey substance all around where it was, like a band-aid that was left on for too long. I have found that perhaps the patch is usually more for adult women, considering most of the women who have reviewed are older. My mother was on the patch for years and had no problem, but that was when she was in her 20s. I do not recommend the patch to teenage girls, only because I have noticed that we don't respond to it well. I do not recommend the patch to women who have had trouble with birth control side effects in the past. I hope this is helpful, yet I have yet to find relief from the nausea and headache.

Birth Control	JC, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	2/15/2010 10:56:45 AM	I have/had never been on any types of medication before starting OE. I started it once I decided to move out with my boyfriend of 4 years. I love this man very much! I started on the patch as a contraceptive precaution; my first ever medication to be put on. The hell began after the first month. I'm a gentle/passive person, mood swings aren't me. After the first 30 days my stability was on a roller coaster. I would get furious, then break down in tears. Be bubbily and hyper, then fall into a severe depression and lock myself in our bedroom alone, all within the span of an hour. My poor boyfriend could do nothing to help me, I wouldn't let him. My sex drive was non-existant, and I felt cramps and neasuea 24/7. I stopped the patch after ~6months b/c I couldn't deal with the emotional anxiety it was giving me. It is now a little more than a year later. I never went on any other birth control or meds, and altho the cramps are gone, the no sex drive and mood swings have remained!! It's so bad I can't even stand when my boyfriend tries to wrap his arms around my waist at night. It's like I hate to be touched! Like I said, I love my boyfriend very much, and have tried to force myself to even cuddle with him at night(I love cuddling!). All that ends up happening is me getting angry and snapping. So while this patch may be easy to use, look at all the precautions and realize that some of these side effects may be long term, even if you stop the patch :( It's ruining my life even now, a year or so after stopping it.(and yes, i've gone to the docs, no help there...)

I have been extremely pleased with it's effectiveness however, I have noticed in the last 2 years and increase in the side effects:  I have pretty much NO sex drive, I am extremely moody and excessively anxious, I have been getting headaches more and more (not migraines), I have put on about 20 lb. (not sure if this is all due to the drug), and I have started sweating excessively.  I have been trying to figure out what is causing all of these symptoms and realized, it is the ONLY medication I take and all of these symptoms started about 6-12 months after starting this product and consistently got worse.  The side effects have far outweighed the effectiveness, I plan to ask my Dr. about the Nuva Ring at my appt. later this month.  I would recommend thinking twice before using this product, especially for an extended period of time.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	11/2/2009 11:23:33 AM	While it is extremely convenient, it made my sex drive so low it was ruining my relationship. I now have fibrocystic breast disease thanks to the patch, which I had to have surgery on to remove tumors,  and while taking the patch I had severe migraines. The patch site would hurt constantly, sometimes so bad I wouldn't be able to sit on it. It was convenient, but not worth the severe side effects
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/26/2009 10:28:14 AM	I was on Ortho Evra for 4 years and absolutely loved it!  I had no problems with it up until the last year.  I recommend this product 100%, if used like package states.  It's very easy to use and very convenient, I mean how easy is it to remember to switch it once a week?  Very effective as well!  I used it continuously (with no off week) because I had really bad headaches during my period week and loved it at first, until about 6 months later and I started have a lot of horrible cramping and breakthrough bleeding.  The cramps were more frequent than the bleeding, but just as annoying.  I talked with my doctor who told me I needed to force my body to have a period, so I tried that (took the patch off for a week) and that didn't help.  My doctor said that with this medication used continuously there isn't enough estrogen and the body can't handle that sometimes.  I am currently using Seasonique, which I haven't had any problems with yet.  I wanted to let everyone know of my experience, but that I still recommend the product, just not for continuous use.

But this patch is a pain in the butt(Literally). Im 17 and this is my first time taking a birth control. I figured the patch would be easy considering my friend took it and had no problems. I read the review on other sites and they were nothing but negative. I have been in bed for the past week cuz everytime i get up to do something I feel sick to my stomach and have to run to the toilet. I have lost 6 pounds in the last 3 days simply because nothing sounds good and when it does.. I cant seem to keep it down. I also have pains in my legs every time i switch but cheeks and get constant pains in my chest. I talked to my doctor and even tho it is less convinient I have convinced myself to switch to the pill because I am sick of laying in this bed. (This is just my experience, everybody is different)

However, I did gain almost 15 lbs (mostly in breasts and booty!) and towards the end I had spotting almost constantly. It worked really well for me for a really long time, and I really don't have anything bad to say about it. I had no side effects aside from the weight gain, which was better than having a baby..! I would encourage people to try this out!

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/7/2009 9:18:23 PM	I've been using the Patch for almost 5 years. I love it! It's easy to use, the side effects were minor in my case - I'm 10 pounds heavier than I was when I started using it (not sure if the gain is even from the patch), slight nausea every now and then (not over dramatic), itch and irritation on the patch site (my &quot;cheeks&quot; in my case), my breast size increased a bit and my acne was completely gone within the 1st year. Oh and best of all NO KIDS!! My insurance stopped covering it but it was totally worth saving my pennies for the effectiveness/convenience! I recently discovered that Breast Cancer runs in my family (maternal) so my doctor strongly recommended me to stop using this estrogen-based contraceptive (apparently estrogen increases your chances of getting breast cancer - especially if it's already in your DNA). It certainly didn't help when I recently develop cysts in my breast (non cancerous thank goodness!) So after getting a second opinion (that's how much I really want to continue using the patch), I am now researching other contraceptives that may work for me. I guess this is my bitter sweet farewell to the Patch (thanks for letting me vent!) ;-)
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	7/21/2009 5:41:44 PM	I really loved my patch once I got used to it, however all of a sudden after being on it for almost 6 months I have started to get severe rashes. I take allergy pills nonstop and they just make me tired, without cutting down the itching. I even have tired different regions listed. Otherwise one major advantage was I used to get severe migraines and now I don't get them unless I am off of it for a week, that was a great besides having to remember to change it once a week.

Birth Control	claire1103, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/18/2009 9:02:35 AM	i have been on the patch for about 5 yrs. the first yr i was really moody and i guess i eventually got used to the drug because my moods are normal now. the only thing i dont like are the squares left on my body from the patch. i gained about 10 lbs in the last 5 yrs but that could have been normal weight gain. i am thinking about switching methods though because i had a sharp pain in my chest (sternum) last week and jaw pain this week. after doing research it seems that it might be due to blood clots. i have to get checked out with my doctor and see if there are other methods for me.
Birth Control	survivor, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/20/2009 3:06:55 PM	I was on the pill form of this birth control. I was an avid runner, did not smoke, and ate very healthy; 25 years old.  I was hospitalized in January due to a blood clot in my left leg, starting form my hip bone and going to my ankle.  I also had 4 clots in my lungs.  I had been exercising up to the day I went into the hospital.  I am so lucky to be alive.  Now I am on coumadin (blood thinner) for the rest of my life. Be careful when deciding whether or not to go onto birth control.    
Other	Jenn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/19/2009 1:45:58 PM	I was put on the patch after losing a ovary and the pill wouldnt regulate my hormons. I wear it continously to prevent ovualtion which could cause me have cycst and lose my otehr ovary (according to my MD) I dont mind it means no period lol.  Ive only had one patch fall off and that was the first one I put because I put it on right after teh shower and my skin was still damp.  I love the patch.  I dotn ahve to worry about BC every day. My PMS has improved (and it was horrible after losign my ovary) Ive gain a little weight around my abd but it was gradual so it might ahve been normal.  My breast did grow about a cup size (no complaint there).  I have teh occassional migrain on my off week but not as frequent as I had them before the patch. Ive been using that patch for over a year now. I love it. The lintiness is easyily pulled off or removed in teh shower with body wash . I recommend it to all my friends
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/25/2009 3:04:27 AM	I love these patches. I haven't had any major problems and I used to get migraine's when I was on the pill. This medicine amazingly helped my headaches and hasn't made them worse, like the warnings/precautions always say. I still have no regrets about switching to this medication. There's only one part I don't like about the thing, which is the skin irritation and the redness when you pull them off.
Birth Control	jilliebo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	3/23/2009 7:17:18 PM	I used the patch for 3 years, stopped to get pregnant and went back on about 1 year ago.  I have high triglycerides now as well as high bilirubin and thyroid hormones, dark spots on the skin on my face and chest and I already have depression but it has worsened dramatically.  It does what it says it will do and it's only fallen off once in 4 years but now the side effects are outweighing the benefits.  I finally have decided to use something else.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/23/2009 5:51:48 PM	I have been on this medication for what I would say is close to 5 years and I LOVE it !!!  I have only had a couple of patches fall off, I keep them on my butt and switch cheeks every week.  I wear the patch continuously to prevent periods and it works fabulously.  My insurance is changing their coverage and this medication is no longer going to be covered at a preferred rate.  I am extremely irritated at my insurance company to make this change ... don't they realize that the pill does not work for some people ???  I think that I am going to try the ring ... wish me luck !!!

Birth Control	pennylane5309, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	1/12/2009 3:02:59 PM	I have been on the patch for 10 months and have finally said NO MORE. It's effective and easy but I had severe nausea and vomiting every time I started a new patch- to the point where I couldn't go to work. When I took it off for the period week, the sudden drop in estrogen caused severe anxiety, panic attacks and depression which I've never experienced before the patch. I'm not putting the patch back on because it has just gotten exponentially worse each month. My period stopped last week and since I haven't put the patch back on, it seems to have started again. So allowing my body to re-adjust to self-regulating hormones is still going and I'm still having crazy mood swings, although they are become less often, less severe. I'm slowly getting back to normal but it has be a hard, frustrating road. Everyone is different but if you don't respond well to hormones, I don't suggest trying the patch. I don't ever want to go through this again.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	12/9/2008 10:36:33 AM	I was prescribed the patch as a method of birth control, and didn't make it a whole month with it on. I immediately developed a rash, along with severe headaches. My mood swings became too much. On that not just becaues it didn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't work for someone else... in my experience birth control in itself is pretty hit or miss, you just have to keep searching until you find what works for you.
Birth Control	IT WORKS!!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/8/2008 1:02:48 PM	I have been on the patch for about 10 months now and I love the patch.  I've had a problem with it falling off once or twice and sometimes it makes me sick.  It is very easy for me because the pill makes me extremely sick and.  I would definitely recommend the patch.  It works for me!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/26/2008 11:26:39 PM	I love the low dose of hormones in this drug.  It is the easiest birth control I have taken.  I've been on the patch for a little over 5 years and still no accidental children!!  It works with very little side effects, only a minor rash at the spot where the patch is.  It clears up though when I have my week off.  It is very discret, I put it on my bottom so no one sees it even in a bakini!!  I love this product.
Birth Control	lilbebe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/1/2008 11:36:59 PM	I have been using the patch for almost 5 years.  It's very easy to use.  I alternate sides of my lower abdomen after my period.  There is a sticky mess after, but baby oil takes that off.  No weight gain, no bigger breasts, no mood swings.  I am a migraine sufferer normally.  But I have experienced Major Migraines the first two days of wearing the patch after the end of my cycle.  I recommend this form of birth control.  Everyone is different, so if you don't like it, try something else :) The pill made me sick and I would forget to take it, then double them and that was just horrible!  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	10/14/2008 10:53:17 AM	I have started birth control for the first time because I am sexually active and have had issues with a consistent cycle. Because Ortho Evra is a patch, I find it very easy to use and apply. The first week I was on it, I experienced discharge and tenderness in my breasts, but that was the worst of it. I only had breakthrough bleeding once but it was very very very light. I have sensitive skin and have not been irritated by the patch yet and have only had one occasion of it falling off but have outsmarted the patch. I put my patch on my lower abdomen, more so away from my hip bone and it wrinkles in one spot (because I sit, who doesn't) and it may or may not get lint around the edges.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	9/25/2008 12:56:57 PM	Terrible side effects and patch constantly fell off before it was time to take it off. I gained 30 pounds on this thing. Went back to a low dose pill. 
Birth Control	 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1			9/22/2008 9:51:38 AM	Eventhough Ortho Evra is very convenient, I've experienced side effects that do not make its convenience worthwhile.  It made me very anxious and depressed.  To the point of losing sleep at night.  I felt that I was not myself.  I was in an emotional &quot;roller-coaster.&quot;  Unfortunately, this also affected the people around me.  I definitely would not recommend this product.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/4/2008 12:02:20 AM	I have been on the patch for 4 years now and I adore it! I went off for about 6 months because of the risk concerns but I could not find anything else I was happy with. I weigh a few pounds less than when I started taking it yet my breasts have grown a cup size. It is so easy to use and remember. It does get a little gunky around the edges but neither I nor my boyfriend think it is a big deal. 
Birth Control	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	45-54	8/27/2008 9:46:15 AM	I went on the patch after my daughter was born because I had trouble with nausea taking pills.  Big mistake.  The nausea was nothing compared to what I got with the patch.  I didn't like the lintiness and the irritation the patch caused my skin.  I have since switched to the ring and have had NO problems.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	8/2/2008 8:12:57 PM	it's easy to use and remember. I love it for the most part, the only thing i don't like is it can sorta hurt your skin after awhile
Birth Control	DianaUbetcha, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	7/17/2008 2:06:21 PM	I had some issues with replacing my IUD, so I opted to give &quot;the patch&quot; a try.  It's been nice as far as only having to replace weekly, however, as a long distance runner there have been a few close calls in losing the 'stick' several days early. I have also been experiencing an increasing itch and rash area both while the patch is in place and for as much as 2-3 weeks after it's removed (they always go on a different area).  My butt is beginning to look like a checkerboard of red rashy squares. :0(  No other physical side effects noticed. Sensitive skin be ware...if not, give it a try.  Very convenient!   
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	7/16/2008 1:38:48 PM	I was on the patch for 2 yrs.  I took it continously.  I had breakthrough bleeding about every 3 months and very heavy bleeding.  It worked for birth control &amp; the patch stayed on good.  I would rotate butt cheeks every week and it would leave some irritation on my skin.  
Birth Control		5	5	5			7/1/2008 10:39:00 PM	I have been on the patch now for three years and love it. I find it easy to use and remeber. I have never had any break through bleeding, never had weight gain or mood swings. I also have not experienced any patch falling off for no reason. Something that I have experienced is a slight headache on the off week, which is easily fixed with advil. 
Birth Control	JillValentine, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/16/2008 5:27:19 PM	I ended up gaining 10 lbs (about 5 of which are water because I gained them overnight!).  I took this medication for 2 years and only had 2 patches fall off, and I tend to exercise and sweat a lot.  I normally keep them on my lower abdomen in front by my hip bones.  If you keep them in a place where you won't sweat very much and they don't constantly rub against tight clothing they will stay on better.  I had morning nausea for the first day or two, but other than that, no real side effects.  I'm going to start on the ring this week, but I'm happy I can always come back to the patch.
Birth Control	LittleBird, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	5/27/2008 12:09:55 AM	Overall, I loved that I only had to change the patch once a week.  However, it left a sticky mess on my body in between changes and gave me horrible nausea and vomiting during the first day of the first patch.  The nausea improved, and so did my acne.  The only down side is that the patch killed my libido.
Birth Control		5	3	1			5/26/2008 11:37:14 AM	The patches don't stick the way they are supposed to, they wrinkle and warp and fall off for no reason, and they get dirty around the edges. I can't wait until my supply is gone so I can switch to something else.
Birth Control		3	3	3			5/10/2008 9:40:46 PM	I was on the patch for about two months. the whole time I was on it my breasts were tender and my mood swings were so bad my husband and kids hated me. So it may be easy but not worth it.
Birth Control		5	5	3			5/1/2008 11:50:18 PM	i have been using the patch for over a year. it is really easy to remember. however, my hair thined alot and i did gain weight. to be honest i didnt notice some side effects till i read the other reviews??? the sticky egdes are grose also.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	4/9/2008 12:07:52 PM	I have been on the patch for almost 3 years now and have loved it! The patch is easy to use, effective, and my breasts grew a whole cup size w/ little to no other weight gain on my body! My only complaint is that lint tends to stick around the edges, giving it that old band-aid look - gross! 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/3/2008 7:53:34 PM	I never had a good experience w/ any birth control pill I have tried.   I tried the patch and loved it.  I had a increase in sex drive, lost weight, mood was great, and when it was time for my period it came w/ no pms.  My reason for stopping it was only because of the controversy aroudn it.  I tried loestrin fe and became a emotional mess after a year after I stopped it I went right back to my old self so I knew it was the pill.  I just got a pres for ortho tri cyclen and if that one doesnt work for me I will go back to the patch... I recommend it highly, give it a try.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	3/26/2008 12:04:28 PM	I was on the patch for approximately a year and a half. I had to stop b/c it gave me severe migraines consistently. I didn't know what was causing the migraines at first but after talking to friend who had the same issue and stopped the patch I decided to stop the patch also. It turned out it was the patch causing the migraines. I did not have a good experience with this.
Birth Control		5	1	1			3/25/2008 2:27:44 AM	After using the pill for many years and always having trouble taking it consistently I decided to try the patch. It seemed easy, but once I put it on I was constantly worried it was pealing off. I changed it many times and that was quite expensive. I also experienced very tender breasts and  other side effects. Finally I gave up after a few months. I switched to the Ring and I am very happy. Now I worry about BC once a month and I haven't had any of those horrible side effects.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/20/2008 7:27:23 PM	I've been on the patch for almost 2months now. The patch is great because i dont have to remember to put it on everyday. However, i gained 10pounds in less than 2months of using it. My breasts, inbetween my upper thighs and my lower abdomen itch a lot. I've been miserable, i feel like i'm pregnant constantly even though i'm not. I'm always bloated. I was highly upset with the weight gain. I would recommend trying the drug but once you start having the symptoms quicly find another replacement birth control. The pill is annoying to remember but i had less issues with it. I guess because it has less hormones. 
Other	Rachel, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	13-18	3/10/2008 1:36:31 PM	The patch itself is kind of hard to keep completely flat and connected to your skin if you lead a fairly active life. I found that I would take the patch off the day it would tell me to and I wouldn't start for three or four more days, only allowing my period maybe two days before I had to put another patch on. I switched over to the pill because of this. I was not taking it for contraceptive reasons, rather for hormonal. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	3/1/2008 6:36:34 PM	Pros: easy to use and easier to remember than the pill, initially worked great with no side effects, prevented pregnancyCons: some minor issues with occasional low mood/irritability, itching under patch, dirt etc sticking to patch, patch sticking to clothing and pulling off when removing clothing, and after two years of using it, I am having more severe problems including constant spotting and absolutely no sex drive along with some minor difficulty of maintaing my regular weight
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	1/29/2008 10:27:52 PM	I went on the patch after being on the pill for 4-5 years.  During my eight months of using it I developed severe mood swings and cysts in my breasts.  After months passed and the side effects kept getting worse I discontinued use and switched over to the NuvaRing.  Out of the five hormonal birth control methods I have been on, the patch has been my least favorite.  If you have had mood changes with other hormonal birth control methods I wouldn't recommend Ortho Evra.
Birth Control	Strwmattsgurl_01, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	1/29/2008 3:51:05 PM	I went on this form of birth control because I am no longer able to take the pill due to a liver situation. After being on this patch for 4 months I am miserable. My breasts have itch'd since I started to wear it. The site where the patch goes always hurts. The lint from my clothes gets in the adhesive of the patch and it makes it look dirty. I am a very clean person so it really bothers me to see that. The edges do not stick to me well. My hair is slowly falling out. I am a total groutch now. Overall it is super easy to use but the side affects I am dealing with is NOT worth it. The breasts itching is the most annoying part, well that and the decreased sex drive. Ugh, why can't birth control be any easier?!
Birth Control	agar1020, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/16/2008 7:42:03 PM	Easy to remember my insurance doesn't cover it but it's worth the money. I have been on the patch for about 4 years now and I love it. The only thing is that I did gain a little bit of weight, my breasts grew a whole cup size but they are always tender. I also noticed when I went off the patch for 3 months my breasts got drastically smaller. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/13/2007 4:28:50 PM	WORKS GREAT I HAVE BEEN ON THIS FOR 4 YEARS AND I LOVE IT.. IT IS SO NICE TO ONLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT ONCE A WEEK...
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	11/25/2007 2:31:43 PM	Very easy to use but the patch made my period stop for 6 months. I got systs in my breasts and have had irregular periods for 2 years after going off the patch. I would strongly caution people against taking this drug! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/29/2007 11:03:55 AM	With this drug I don't have to remember to take a pill everyday I just stick a patch anywhwere on my body once a week it's very easy for me to use considereing my schedule.
