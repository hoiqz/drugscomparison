Several weeks later I ended up getting PCP (pneumonia) and spent 2 weeks on a ventilator and 3 weeks in the hospital.  Now I am very careful of ANYTHING that gets into my body.  BUT I will still try and work with and around the medications.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	5/15/2009 8:25:15 AM	My first infusion was in July 2006 and it saved my life.  I could hardly walk.  I was getting ready to file for disability and then my doctor suggest Rituxan.  It worked in the first 2 weeks and I have been using it ever since.  I tried every drug used for the treatment of RA and this drug is wonderful.  I advise if anyone out there who has not gotten any relief from all the TNF drugs.  Try this one.  Good luck.

I am going to have my second inifusion within the next month, as some symptoms are returning.  That's 11 months between treatments.  I had no side effects at all.  I take Arava 20 mg. every day.  I feel so good I can barely remember how awful I felt.  Prior to Rituxan, I tried Remicade and Embrel.  Both were effective for a short time but did not last.  I am looking forward to a great summer without pain.   
Rheumatoid Arthritis	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	2/24/2009 9:10:27 AM	I first received this drug for CLL &amp; found it also controlled joint swelling &amp; pain. At that time RA was suspected but not yet clinically diagnosed. I have had RA for several years now &amp; this is the only drug I take. My insurance wouldn't pay for it for a while &amp; I tried 3 other RA treatments of which none worked. Blue Cross of Al now has a policy for moderate to severe RA &amp; will pay for 2 infusions every 6 months. 4 infusions every 36- 48 months worked better.

Rituximab surpressed her immune system so much, she became infected in the hospital with MRSA blood stream infection and died from septic shock.

I had the IV in Sept. 2008 and still experience pain, fatigue and weakness.  Other complication include diabetes, HBP, high cholesterol.  So I do not if this was the most effective treatment for me.  I also take 15-20mg prednisone, plaquenil, methotrexate, vicodine and iburprofen.  I feel like I am loss this battle after only 2 years.

I was given Rituxin three times.  There was no improvement, so the therapy was stopped.  I did develop a bowel obstruction 3 months after the last infusion, but no one indicated a connection between the two.  A review on this site by a Lupus patient who had the same thing makes me wonder.
Other	foxythedog, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	35-44	11/4/2008 11:08:51 PM	Prescribed for SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS / SLE / LUPUS. Rituxan worked as great as it did terribly. It eliminated my severe symptoms but also triggered a life-threatening bowel obstruction. If the bowel obstruction had not happened, I would absolutely still be on it. Other than the bowel obstruction, I didn't have any side effects. I wish I could find something that works as well as the Rituxan did, but obviously, I can't take the Rituxan again.

I only have maybe 9 months to live. I would have rather died with NHL than to be like I am now. I am paralysed on my left side &amp; and totally disabled. I've used this medicine for about 3 years. Sure it made my NHL go into remission, but I am now dying from the treatment.

I'm more active, have lost weight, am happier because I feel like me again, the me that disapeared when I got this disease. I even had to warn my grown kids that they were seeing a side of me they'd never experienced. That's a good thing.:) I've had two sets of two infusions 6 months apart. I've been taking 500 mg of Sulfasalazine daily, but not sure if I really need it. All my labs are normal now. Wow am I happy.

My hands were crippled and I was in severe pain.  I felt better after the first dose, but after my second dose I was in remission.  I have had no pain or side effects from this treatment, and I have not had to take this treatment again.  My RA factor is zero.  I would recommend this treatment to everyone who had rheumatoid arthritis.  The only problems I had right after taking the treatment was nausea and hair loss.  The nausea went away in about 2 months and my hair grew back very thick and curly (which I have never had curly hair).
