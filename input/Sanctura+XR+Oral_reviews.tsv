Needing to Urinate Immediately	mlly21, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	8/28/2012 8:29:54 AM	I used it for three days and it made my condition worse. I had more frequency and felt pressure all the time. I stopped taking it after the third day. Waste of time! 
Needing to Urinate Immediately	joiz, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	8/11/2012 7:05:36 PM	I thought I had found the miracle cure for my urinary urgency.  Santura was working really well and I was recommending it to all my friends who also had issues.  I had taken the medication for about 2 1/2 months when I started having trouble reading fine print at work and needed to use my &quot;cheaters&quot; all the time.  I also noticed that my distant glasses that I use for driving did not work anymore as they made the distance blurry and I had to take them off.  I am assuming that my vision problems are caused by this medication and stopped using it about four days ago.  I will not use this again as the vision problems far outweigh my urgency to urinate problems.  I only hope in time my vision returns to the way it was before I started using Santura.  Has anyone had permanent vision issues?

And I'm taking the prepackaged samples given to me by my doctor.  So it's not of a case of having a counterfiet/fake drug, it is the REAL thing.

I have inestital cystitis of the bladder and have had several procedures done to help with the pain, santura worked better than other meds. The only thing that really bothers me is the dry mouth and constipation.

Santura XL is the first relief I've gotten in the last 12 years.  Benefits far outweigh the side effects.

Dry mouth most annoying, as my jobs requires a lot of talking... not as annoying as all the problems it has fixed!

Before I would go 3 times a night and while at work was finding it very difficult to get through a meeting. I even wetted my bed once, and I'm 38 years old. Prostate check out to be normal, just an overactive bladder. Still don't know why I have this condition, but this medication has returned me back to normal. Side effects include difficulty reading fine print and makes me a little groggy in the morning since I take it before I go to bed.
Frequent Urination	formeng, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male		10/15/2009 5:23:54 PM	I have had urinary urgency and frequent urination (getting up sometimes 6 to 8 times a night) for several years.  I have been taking Sanctura XR, 60 mg for about a month.  I have noted a moderate decrease in urgency, but no significant change in frequency.  
Overactive Bladder	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	8/22/2009 2:34:02 PM	I have had severe side effects with this drug.  I was sent in for abdominal CT scans and no one was able to find the cause of the pain in my gut.  I finally went to WebMD and discovered on my own that my intense stomach pain, dry mouth, dry eyes and blurred vision was caused by this drug.  I would not recommend it.  Sometimes the side effects are just too bad to justify taking the &quot;cure&quot;.

THIS MEDICINE WORKS WONDERS! Within 2 days I no longer had to RUSH to the restroom, no more 'accidents', no more 'frequent' trips to the restroom and finally I sleep at night without 'bathroom interruptions'. Now the downside is when trying to read fine print (newspaper), my vision is blurred at times. But the benefits of this medicine far out weigh the side effects, so I have chosen to keep taking it!
Frequent Urination	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	35-44	5/25/2009 3:04:42 PM	I have been taking this medication for over 6 months, after taking Detrol for a year.  Some days it seems to be working, but that may be due to not drinking much fluids. If I drink even a mere 4oz of water, it doesn't help the frequent urination. 
Other	4kenseth17, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	35-44	5/24/2009 12:53:02 PM	Prescribed Sanctura XL by urologist for dealing with excessive bladder spasming following CYSTOSCOPE SURGERY for removal of KIDNEY STONES.  Have always had trouble with terrible spasming with the &quot;stint&quot; that remains for 7 days after surgery!  Unfortunately, I didn't get much relief from Sanctura XR at all.  It also constipated me.  Best medication I found for this condition is &quot;B &amp; O Suppositories&quot;. Don't need many B &amp; O's, but they'll slow the spasming from the stint.  Use caution though...too many can cause diarrhea &amp; it's a narcotic.
Frequent Urination	ConnieDB, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/25/2009 10:51:42 AM	I took Detrol LA for 5 years then quit because it stopped working.  I finally found a doctor who gave me something that works.  This medication worked within  3 days and is working perfectly now.  I am back to doing my usual yard work, gardening and other physical activities and feel normal again.  I continue to wear &quot;light days&quot; pads just in case I push myself too far but that doesn't happen too often. I do have dry mouth and eyes and my throat gets really dry but I drink a lot of water and take Colon clenz, a natural supplement for the constipation.

It's working for me! No constipation, no more dribbling before I reach the bathroom. I do have dryness in my mouth but that's minor as far as I'm concerned. My doctor gave me 2 weeks worth of samples and I just called her to get a prescription so I can take it regularly.

I saw results the 2nd day.  I don't have dry mouth or dizzy spells like I did with Vesicare, and I'm not horribly constipated like I was with Enablex.  Sanctura XR is the best.  I'm so excited that it is now once a day!  AND my doctor told me I don't have to worry about taking it with all of my other medications like I do with the other kinds.  Everyone should be on this one!

Overactive Bladder	Eagle Eye, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male		8/5/2008 12:38:20 PM	I first started using it 9 months ago, and found it very helpful. Gradually lately however, the overative bladder symptoms and frequent urination have returned. One side effect was, and is, constipation. I'm going to discontinue it for a week or so and see if the symptoms change any. It may not be for everybody.
