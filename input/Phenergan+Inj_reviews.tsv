Additional Medications to Treat Pain	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	5/27/2012 3:07:39 PM	I received this injection when I was 6 weeks pregnant and has a migraine for almost 24 hours with worsening pain. I went to Urgent Care and they gave me the shot. Although it worked fairly quickly, I am now 32 weeks pregnant and still experience pain at the injection site. I think I have some bad nerve pain and have not gone to me primary care doctor about it yet. This is very bothersome especially being pregnant with limited mobility. Laying down does not relieve the pain. I use a heating pad but because of the pregnancy, I cannot use high heat. I wish I would have known about the REAL side effects of this drug before it was administered to me. I have received Todoral injections in past for severe migraines and never ad any side effect. I also think that the person that gave me the shot was not well experienced as it was administered in my lower back in the muscle. Usually these type of shots have to be administered in a fatty area (i.e. buttock or hip), but this was not the case. I WILL NEVER GET THIS INJECTION AGAIN!
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	1/1/2011 8:13:33 PM	I have been given this medication in injection form to treat nausea related to migraines both by physicians &amp; to give myself at home.  It takes a BRAVE person to give this to themself.  This is a PAINFUL shot.  It burns upon injection, it creates knots, it is sore to the touch for weeks and tender/bruised feeling for weeks after that.  The only thing that seems to lessen the length of time the pain/sorness/tenderness may take is to take your fist immediately after the injection, place it on the injection site and rub in a circular motion.  Some nurses know this, some do not.  If your nurse does not know this, or if you have to self administer, do it yourself.  It will be uncomfortable, but I have been receiving these shots so long that I have so much scar tissue in my hips that I rarely even feel the pain any more - I've started having to take the shots in my thighs (you REALLY don't want to have to do that!) so take my word for it, this is the only thing I have found that may help any at all.  If there is any way you can keep down phenergan, and your doctor will allow it, request to take it orally long enough before you are given any pain shots so that it will prevent you from becoming sick.  If I had it to do over, that would have been my request.  It does help with nausea, and it does seem to have a magnifying property to narcotics and seem to make it easier for me to sleep after a narcotic shot, but the scar tissue is making it hard for anything to help me anymore.  The narcotics can be delivered via IV, but phenergan via IV is a NIGHTMARE!  It feels as if your veins are being burned out of your arm.  Ask if there is anything that the doctor can give you that is just as affective as phenergan, but less painful.
Nausea and Vomiting	jch, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	11/2/2010 3:00:01 PM	I just received this injection 4 weeks ago and I am just now having injection site pain. I am having a horrible time sitting down, and I feel as though my leg has nerve pain running down it. I know it helps with nausea, but I will not get this shot ever again. By the way, you can get the same drug as a suppository. Guess nobody thought it was important enough to tell me that before they gave me the shot!!!!!  I do not give this medication and stars.

Nausea and Vomiting	annette, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/16/2010 6:32:39 PM	When i had my shot my whole arm swelled and 2 days later I had slurred speech and numbness in my left side of my body.  I went to 2 different ER's for it thinking I had had a stroke.  I had 2 CT scans and 1 MRI and all said no stroke.  The last ER I went to the doctor gave me another nausea medicine in my IV and Morphine. Almost immediately I came back to myself able to speak properly and a day later the numbness left.
Other	jjyjbad4, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	12/18/2009 9:58:26 PM	I was given this medication with Toradol and Decadron.  It was the worst experience EVER.  I started shaking and having uncontrollable muscle tension my hands were shaking and would suddenly just tighten up. I could not sit still and could not move my legs to any position that they were comfortable.  I felt like I was on a BAD drug trip.  I was given Benadryl to counteract the reaction I was having and was told it would stop in 10 min.  it did not and I had to be given Morphine.  My husband could not believe the reaction I was having.  I'm sure he thought I had completely lost my mind.  I will NEVER let them give me this medication again.

Nausea and Vomiting	beachkrz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	35-44	7/1/2009 12:53:52 AM	Received an injection in my backside for nausea due to a migraine. Two days later had numbness down hip and side of upper leg. Went back to Dr and he tried telling me the medicine had nothing to do w/ the numbness. He gave me a topical cream to put on numb spot. Four months later went in again to Dr's office for migraine and was given antother shot of phenergan for nausea, this time on other cheek, and sure enough three days later numbness on hip and upper side of leg. I now have numbness, pain (by touch and by movement), tingling and the feeling of tiny needles poking my skin. I do not know if any of this will go away but I do know I will never get this injection again.
Additional Medications to Treat Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	5/14/2009 1:13:57 AM	I went to the ER with a severe migrane and nausea and got a shot of Phenergan along with migraine medication. I instantly started to feel okay enough to stand up an walk, but after about 20 minutes I began vomiting uncontrollably. After I threw up, I felt fine and went to sleep very easily. I was also prescribed Phenergan oral, and I have never experienced the same effects. It works very well to control nausea with migraines, and also to help fall asleep.
Nausea and Vomiting	mommyof4atyvq8, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/21/2009 4:35:35 PM	I currently use phenergan inj everyday to control my Nausea &amp; Vommiting during my pregnancy.  I agree with everyone that says that if not properly diluted it can cause serious tissue or nerve damage, but this drug has been my life saver.  It instantly takes away my vommiting, and I feel like a person again.  It is unfortunate for those that have a terrible reaction but I don't think it should be taken off of the market.  When diluted properly, and given slowly it works very well.  
Nausea and Vomiting	Jan Harrington, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	3/4/2009 4:52:53 PM	Was given phenergan IV in hospital.  VERY hard on your veins and if you have a sensitive IV site, using this med more than a couple of times will likely cause the IV site to fail or infiltrate, causing a new IV site to be found.  The exception is when the nurse gives this drug, they need to 1) dilute it with saline--very important and 2) administer it SLOWLY.  This is a very painful drug in your IV line not just when it hits your vein, but you can often feel it as it travels through your system, burning all the way.  Please, for your own sake, ask the nurse to dilute and administer it slowly both for your own comfort and for the longevity of your IV site.  I am a very difficult stick for getting an IV line in, so I have learned to do whatever I can to preserve one that is in.  Anything beats them having to go to an IV in your neck.  Not a pleasant experience!  Hope this helps!
Nausea and Vomiting	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/26/2009 1:51:09 AM	i have had 14 surgeries in 8 years. this the only med that works for me. if the nurse pushes it slowly it does not burn as bad.
Nausea and Vomiting	sc, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	1/26/2009 3:12:44 PM	I was given this drug in the ER for vomiting caused by Menieres Disease.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  I had spasms, could not sit, stand or laydown. and my skin felt like it was crawling. The injection site was very painful for several days I honestly would never recommend it to anyone.  Not stars at all
Nausea and Vomiting	45-54 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/19/2009 11:24:50 PM	after reading all the reviews of people having horrible reactions (some as bad as my Mom's) I cannot understand why it is still on the market!  Mom didn't come out of her drug induced state for almost 24 hours.  It was terrifying and nothing they gave her would bring her around, it just had to wear off.  The involuntary muscle movements were unsettling to watch,  especially since she had a broken hip and didn't know she was thrashing it about.  We had to wonder if she wasn't doing some additional damage.  At the very least it added to her pain once she came to.  We'll be buying her a bracelet with Phenergan on it to be sure it's never given again.  How is it that no one in that ER had ever heard of this happening and didn't know what to do for it?  No one should have to go through this sort of thing.
Nausea and Vomiting	Sugar, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	55-64	1/9/2009 10:07:50 AM	I was terribly sick for 2 days and also had a migraine. Was given Benedryl, Phenergan and dihydroergotamine in an IV. When these meds came through I was instantly dizzy, sat striaght up in bed and vomited, then it felt like my throat closed up and I couldn't breathe. Scared the heck out of me. Although after I got home my headache was going away and I felt much better.
Nausea and Vomiting	jeg9699, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	1/6/2009 8:16:43 PM	It made the nausea and vomiting stop immediately. It does make you sleep for hours at a time. However, my injection was in my hip  and it was sore for 4 days.

Additional Medications to Treat Pain	MOM, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Female	35-44	11/17/2008 2:09:02 PM	My 18 year old daughter was given this in conjunction with Nubain for back pain.  That evening she was taken by ambulance to the hospital because she could not move her arms or legs.  It took many hours and a shot of Benedryl to reverse it.  Be careful of those little known side affects.

It has been the only thing that has saved me! I did have some crazy dreams and slept for 24 hrs but i was sick, i needed it!

I am still having pain and burning at the injection site.  Is this normal?  This medication knocked me out for a good 24 hours. In the past Ive ended up in the ER with a IV and morphine to get rid of my pain.  This shot was a lot cheaper and faster.
Nausea and Vomiting	hireger, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	2	3	Male	25-34	10/7/2008 9:05:32 PM	I have had many surgeries over the past five years and with every narcotic, for me comes Phenergan.  It works great, is terrible for veins, and is painful to administer via IV.  Some of the pain can be avoided by diluting with saline.  Most hospitals no longer administer it (IV).  It works much better and has fewer side effects when taken orally, in my opinion.
Nausea and Vomiting	emblel01, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	19-24	8/17/2008 11:45:10 PM	I get severe migraines and end up in the ER with them at least once a month. I am given this along with Benadryl and Toradal(sry about spelling!)The last time I was there, 3 nights ago, the nurse gave me the injection too fast and I thought I was going to die. I shot right up out of bed and couldn't stop shaking. I had trouble breathing and my throat felt like it was closing up. I was so freaked out I was given more drugs to calm me down. The doc said its just part of the side effects. I hate it.
Nausea and Vomiting		1	1	1			7/27/2008 7:31:55 PM	This is one of the WORST DRUGS ON THE MARKET! If anyone tries to administer it to you, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! They gave this to my mother in the hospital and she lost her mind. The same thing happened to my aunt's husband. DO NOT USE!!!I GIVE THIS &quot;NO&quot; STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
