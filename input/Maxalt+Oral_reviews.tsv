Migraine Headache	karena, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	5/26/2012 10:14:12 PM	I have taken the original Maxalt mfg'd by Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme for several years; recently my pharmacare coverage switched me to the &quot;generic&quot; from Sandoz, and now I get regularly parasthesias upon taking a 10 mg dose. They are supposed to be the same (Merck and Sandoz) though I have discerned that the original had 2.1 mg of phenylalanine and the Sandoz version for the same 10 mg. pill contains 3.14 mg of phenylalanine. Could that make the difference?
Migraine Headache	gsdfan, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4		55-64	2/16/2012 3:18:55 PM	I have had migraines since I was a teenager and used a number of medications.  MaxAlt has exceeded all others.  On rare occasions, I may need to take more than one.  There are some negatives.  It is very expensive and either not covered or only partially covered by most insurance.  The patent expires this year and I am hoping for a more reasonably priced generic.  Also, the invidual pill packaging is unnecessarily frustrating to open when you're dealing with a headache.Like others have mentioned, it does make me drowsy and I do not drive within a couple of hours of taking it since I feel my reflexes are definitely off.  It also makes me very cold, probably because it is a vaso-constrictor.I do carry it with me at all times, and I'm thankful to have it available since I toughed it out for years without it. 
Migraine Headache	wildhockey, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	45-54	1/19/2012 7:40:14 PM	I never leave home without this medicine. Also, I keep one next to my bed in case I wake up with the beast migraine! I wish this medicine was out years ago. Life has certainly better ever since. This is expensive, but worth every cent! Thank you. 
Migraine Headache	me, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	1/12/2012 9:49:47 PM	My doctor should have warned me about this since I have had a several verterberbasialar TIAs and strokes &amp; angina.  Talk about making matters worse. MAXALT should not be given to patients with ischemic heart disease (e.g., angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia) or to patients who have symptoms or findings consistent with ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, including Prinzmetal's variant angina, or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. MAXALT should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine.

Sometimes it only last 6 or so hours. At the intruction of my Dr I now take 2 Aleve with it. I have not experienced any side effects.

It has worked every time.  Within 5-10 minutes I feel relief-then gone completely 2 or so minutes later!! amazing!! I never leave home without it!!
Migraine Headache	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	12/24/2011 10:37:02 PM	I love my maxalt, it is a miracle worker. I honestly could say I couldn't live without it. I have had delbilitating migraines since i was in the first grade. i would try everything from ibprophen( taking 4 to 5 at a time) excedrin migraine, even some vicodin i'd been prescribed. Occasionally I's end up in the e.r. cuz they'd get so bad. Now that I have maxalt i will never go back. i take one when i feel a migraine coming on and it works within a half hour easy. It works on any kind of headache. it works by shrinking the blood vesssels that pass thtrough the veins in your head that give you a headache.

This med is amazing. As long as I take it as soon as I feel a headache coming on, I usually only have to take 1 tab. If I wait until the headache is in full swing, I might have to take a second. It works everytime and no side effects. It even works for sinus headaches. Thank you Maxalt. 
Migraine Headache	Kim, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/30/2011 9:58:17 AM	I love how quickly it works and only one time did I need to take two.  It can make me sleepy but most of the time I'm fine. The benefit of the relief is far greater than the worry of if it'll make me feel tired.  Within 30 minutes of taking I can function again - at work or at home.
Migraine Headache	DuhMe, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	3	Female	45-54	9/5/2011 5:27:29 PM	I love the results of taking Maxalt.  It helps my migraines like nothing else.  The problem I have with it is the packaging.  Whoever designed the packaging has obviously never tried to open it when the needed to take it.  With other meds, this packaging may work fine, but trying to get one open when needed is awfully hard.  There has to be an easier way.

Very rarely have to take more than 1. Sometimes it makes me very sleepy....other times not at all! I always have one with me!
Migraine Headache	empressjp, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more	4	4	4	Female	45-54	9/2/2011 11:32:55 PM	Been suffering from migraines (with aura) since i was a kid (but didnt know that at the time)...have taken many different drugs for them over the years...started maxalt about 10 years ago...for the most part, it has helped tremendously with my headaches.  Most of the time, it gets rid of a good part of the pain, where i can somewhat function.  I do, however, get EXTREMELY tired from it.  I take a 10 mg pill and down a cup of regular coffee at onset of aura...the coffee has been an additional help...but,while im exhausted from the maxalt and want to sleep in the worst way, the caffeine has other ideas...thats the sucky part.  there have been a few times when the maxalt has done absolutely nothing for me.  I dont always get nausea &amp; vomiting. There have been numerous times when i'll get a headache, go through the hours of pain, and just when its finally coming down...another one will start, so i take more maxalt...there have been times when i will get 3 or 4 of them in a row...and the day after...not fun either...i call it &quot;the hangover day&quot; cause thats how my head feels!!!!

But Maxalt takes away my migraines usually in 30min. Only downside is i want to sleep all day. And the expense all our copays our usually $1-10 maxalt is closer to $50
Migraine Headache	Mary Dozier, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	1	Female	35-44	7/13/2011 9:19:51 PM	I have been suffering from migraines for nearly a decade.  Took the pill and my headache was gone within 30 minutes however I had horrible side effects.  It made me incredibly sleepy in the middle of the day and my blood pressure shot up from 117/74 when I left my neurologist that morning to 180/123.  My boss had to call an ambulance and I spent 11 hours in the ER.  It did get rid of migraine but I'll take a migraine anyday of a possible stroke or heart attack.

Migraine Headache	Stellabug, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/30/2011 5:16:55 PM	I take the MLT version, and this is the best migraine medicine ever for me! I have tried them all.   Rarely do I need to take more than one.   I will say, it is very expensive.  Because of my insurance, I have to pay almost $400 for a month supply, its over $45 a pill for me.  I have one with me at all times though, as it has saved me from being in bed for days at a time.  There is no generic drug yet with the same properties that I know of.  It is such a lifesavor that at one time, I took an extra job just to have the cash to keep buying it.   It really has changed the duration of a headache for me.  It just doesnt help when its a pressure headache associated with weather/barimetric pressure. 
Migraine Headache	Geraldine, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/17/2011 3:30:09 AM	Works really well and quickly

Migraine Headache	Hnickless, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	19-24	5/20/2011 12:17:20 AM	It completely took my migraine away however I started getting pressure in my neck. By the time an hour rolled around, I had a considerable amount of muscle weakness to the point of tripping over my own feet. Also started getting confusion a bit. I couldn't finish some of my sentences. Definitely won't take it again.

It normally starts relieving my pain within minutes.  (I take the MLT version.)  The only thing I'd change if I could, would be the minty flavor.  It's hard for me to handle anything except water when I have a migraine so the mint is sometimes hard for me to &quot;choke&quot; down.All in all a great choice for me!

Usually ibuprofen did the trick.  Now in my mid 20's I've experienced them like never before.  VERY painful and nothing would touch them.  I refused to take any kind of narcotic or pain med because there's always risk of addiction. Maxalt works wonderfully.  I've tried Epidrin and Imitrex as well.  Epidrin didn't do much for me if I had already woken up with the migraine etc which is normally the case and Imitrex made my stomach hurt really bad.  Maxalt is great and I'm glad I have it but, am very disappointed in my insurance company because they only approve 24 pills a month.  It's very unfortunate...I hear this is the case with most insurance companies even if you give the generic with ALL triptans...I actually have frequent migraines.  I'm in the process of seeing an N.D. (Naturopath Doctor) to work on lifestyle changes and possibly herbal/vitamin supplements.  At 26 I just hate to think I'm going to be depending on a med probably for the rest of my life...I'm going to keep using maxalt for the attacks but, am in the process of trying to control triggers etc...

My headache is usually gone within an hour, rarely do I have to take 2 pills.  Sometimes it does make me sleepy, but I can still function at work.

I have found it to be almost always effective. The times it hasn't worked I think was because I didn't take it soon enough. I can usually cut a 10mg tab in half and feel better on only 5mg within 30-40 minutes. It usually makes me feel a little drowsy, but I'm used to it and can function. I have 4 female friends who swear by it also. I never go anywhere without it!
Migraine Headache	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	2	Male	35-44	1/19/2011 8:22:42 PM	Have had migraines for 17 years and bounced around between medications.  Settled on Excedrine Migraine for years but having 3 or 4 headaches a week the Excedrin couldn't be good for me.  Friends talked about how good Maxalt was so I asked the doctor about it.  Had my first migraine with it yesterday and went through 3 doses and nothing...went to bed with the headache at 6:30pm, got up at 2am took 2 excedrin and went back to bed.  Pretty much still have a bit of one today.  WHAT GIVES!?!  I want a medicine to knock it out in minutes!

Otherwise, I would be down and out for a day or more with severe unrelenting pain.

I have tried everything.  In the midst of a full blow migraine, i have experienced the vomitting, intense pain (like you want to rip your head off your shoulders), light sensitive, can't smell anything or will throw up, can't talk, just want to lay down and die with the pain of a migraine.   I have tried excedrin, imitrex (horrible), relpax, but Maxalt does the trick.  I don't leave home without one (just in case).   It is ridiculously expensive, but worth every penny!!!
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	7/14/2010 4:53:16 PM	Horrible taste!  Have to take with food, but usually relieves migraine pain within an hour.

Axert eliminated my migrane within 5 minutes of taking.  Insurance company thinks to expensive.  Only problem with Maxalt is I get the tingling and numbing sensation with the drowsiness. But would recommend.  It takes longer to work for me but does eliminate the migrane with one dose.

One usually works, but I sometimes have to take a second dose. It makes me yawn and makes me feel sleepy most of the time, but doesn't give me chest pains or make me feel flushed or nausous like Imitrex did. Two thumbs up for Maxalt!

Execedrin worked for many years, then I tried Imitrex which made me feel awful and gave me chest pains. Then Maxalt came around and I love it!!!  The packaging is a pain, esp. when you're in the midst of a migraine, but one usually works and two almost definitely works most of the time. Only negative is the cost -- they're like $20 a pill.  Thank God our co-pay is only $25.  Don't know what we'd do without that.

Pain meds, anti-depressants, and the new gen migraine drugs (Relpax, Imitrex, etc.). Maxalt has worked the best for me - by far!My only complaint is the cost - it's almost prohivitive to use.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/24/2010 10:50:03 AM	Maxalt is a wonder drug that knocks out most migraines in 30 minutes, rare cases you might need 2.....side benefit is it is a great hangover cure.......only negative is the expense, my co pay is 70.00 for 18 pills, 500.00 walk-up with no insurance

I used to get 10 to 18 migranes a month, with Topomax I'm down to 8 or less depending on weather then the Maxalt gets rid of the headache painlessly without side effects and I can still go on with my day.  After years of suffering and wondering which was worse the migrane or the Imitrex, I finally got something that helps and no side effects.

I had migraines for years and doctors tried various different medications.  I take Maxalt-MLT at either the beginning of a migraine or in the throws of a migraine.  It takes a little longer for it to kick in if the migraine has already &quot;set in&quot;.  However, when it does start working, it's like a weight being lifted off my shoulders!  A true God send.

Can't say I enjoyed the drive, but it felt reasonably safe.  My 24-year-old son, however, gets absolutely no relief from Maxalt.

I can now hold a cup and not spill, very scary, It may work for some just not me, I will stick with zomig.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	8/5/2009 5:51:52 AM	I guess Maxalt could work for tension headaches, but I don't know. I tried Maxalt and it didn't even touch the pain of my migraines. With migraine medication, you have to try several before you find the one that works the best for you.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/3/2009 8:21:12 AM	Other than the awful taste of the pill that has to disintegrate on your tongue, this med works wonders! I can use Exedrin if I catch it in time, but if I don't 9 times out of 10 the Maxalt does the trick. Makes me a little sleepy, but the neck, head and shoulder pain goes away.
Migraine Headache	75 or over Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		7/22/2009 8:40:15 AM	At night, one Maxalt pill relieves migraine pain.

Once or twice a month.Taken when the aura occurs helps very much.After using this for 10+ years I've noticed more side effects after taking. Sort-of a hangover type feeling.
Migraine Headache	migraneur , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/2/2009 2:25:22 PM	I had a horrible migraine for 3 weeks, finally I took Maxalt - This medicine knocked me down and made both my arms numb. But I would surelly take this medicine again. A person with bad migraines know that numbness and sleepness is nothing compared to a migraine!!! If you have migraine you'll have to try different medicines until you find one that works! So far, this one worked for me, but all migraines and migraneurs are different.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/29/2009 9:59:45 AM	This drug has changed my life!  I used to just have to sleep in a dark room and try OTC things that didn't really work, for at least 15 years.  Maxalt is amazing!  I get a couple of side effects, including tingliness in my mouth, tongue and jaw, and really dry mouth (like &quot;cotton-mouth&quot;) - I get it every time I use it, but I feel like it's mild so I haven't worried about it.

First I just feel tired and a &quot;bit off&quot;...then nausea, neck and head tension, and finally difficulty with cognition and head pounding.  The earlier I recognize the symptoms, the quicker response I get from Maxalt.  Sometimes I get complete relief in as little as 20 minutes using 1/2 of a 5 mg tablet.  Occasionally I get only partial relief so take the second 1/2 tab. I don't need to hit the bed either.Previously I used Imitrex.  It made me sleepy for hours and I ended up in bed.  I always got rebound headaches with that. My daughter (age 31) has not been so lucky.  She took Maxalt once and her chest pounded, heart rate slowed, and she became too weak to stand.  (She does take a lot of other medications, including an antidepressant,so clearly had a drug interaction.)  Now she is trying Midrin--which hasn't helped so far.

My husband had a &quot;mild&quot; stroke according to the neurologist and Maxalt, according to him, could have been the culprit. According to him it constricts the blood vessels.  He has been taking Maxalt for years.
Migraine Headache		3	4	3			5/18/2009 12:42:57 AM	it ususally helps with the nausea, dizziness, and pressure. unfortunately, it does come back by the next day.  i can however take this medicine at work and still function at least at 50%.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/1/2009 7:44:10 PM	I HAVE TRIED ALL KINDS OF MIGRANE MEDICATIONS, INCLUDING NASAL SPRAY &amp; INJUEC TIONS. FOR ME MAXALT IS THE BEST, THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE MINIMAL TO THE POINT THAT IF I HAVE TO TAKE IT DURING WORKING HOURS, I CAN FUNCTION AND IN 15 MINUTES AFTER MY MIGRANE STARTS, IT IS GONE!
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	35-44	4/29/2009 7:23:58 PM	It will take my headache and nausea pain away for a short period of time, then the next day I get my headache back again, or the nausea will come without the pain. So for me I don't think that this medication works.
Migraine Headache	w2bab, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	4/14/2009 11:26:14 AM	My doctor gave me a couple of samples and a prescription for Maxalt when I told him I'm down about 4 days a month with migraines.  A couple of days ago I was nauseated and dizzy and generally miserable all day. When I felt a headache coming on it didn't occur to me that it might be a migraine, but when it kept getting worse, I decided to see if the Maxalt would help, since Ibuprofen wasn't touching it.  Within 10 minutes of taking it I felt better, and within 20 I was completely fine!  This thing is magic, I swear!

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/1/2009 7:22:28 PM	This stuff is amazing. The ease of use allows me to take it immediately and not prolong the pain. I don't mind the taste, it's a little minty. Within 2 hours my pain eases, and within 1 hour if I am able to lay down in a dark place and relax for a bit. Little to no side effects, just leaves me a bit cloudy headed and drowsy, but a lot more functional than if I were dealing with the migraine itself. Highly recommend.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/20/2009 7:57:57 AM	I love this medication. I use to take the one that dissolves in your mouth which tasted awful and I'd wanna throw up. Then  my doctor gave me the smaller pill verison of it. It works with in an hour for me. That way I can relax then go on with my day. If it wasn't for this medicine I don't know what I'd do

Nothing else has worked (except Toradol injection). Occasionally I have side effects with it, but they pass in a relatively short time (tiredness, tightness in chest, arm tingling). They only happen occasionally and not all together. I find if I eat something before I take it, I don't have them. My only complaint is it takes between an hour and 2 to work. If it doesn't relieve the migraine at that point, I take a dose of Motrin and that will wipe it out. i don't know what I would do without it.

If the tiredness bugs you-- keep taking it! It will subside! This is my lifesaver and the only medication that works for my migraines- and believe me i've taken them all! not even an emergency room shot when i ran out of maxalt did the trick. LOVE THIS MEDICINE!

The first time that I took this medication it worked.  However, the second time I took it it caused my heart to race really fast and hard.  My resting heart rate was somewhere in the 170's.  Last night I took it and it didn't cause my heart to race but it did cause it to pound and feel somewhat labored.  This medicine really scares me and I'm not taking it again!

Maxalt also made extremely tired afterwards. However, the headache always went away. I was just unable to function from the extreme sleepiness. Side effects got to be too much, so I stopped taking. I am looking forward to trying Relpax, which is said to have fewer side effects.
Migraine Headache	jg6271, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/6/2008 12:47:34 AM	I used Maxalt for almost 2 years during the worst of my migraine headaches. I have had migraines for as long as I remember but for a couple of years they worsened to the point where i was having them 2 to 3 times a week. I always throw up from my migraines, and usually I feel like slamming my head in a door just to make it stop. I tried 3 other medicines (imitrex was one, can't remember the others) and none of them worked half as well as Maxalt. I usually had to lie down for it to work the most efficiently, but I would take that anyday over not working at all! After the first year of using Maxalt I did develop a tightening sensation in my jaw and chest after taking it, but it was mainly just slightly annoying, not painful. One note: OTC sinus medications taken within 2 hours of taking Maxalt caused me to get so drowsy I couldn't function. My doctor actually warned me about this but I misjudged the amount of time that had passed and, let me tell you, it knocked me on my butt!  Overall, I would definitely recommend Maxalt to anyone that has migraines. In fact, mine have been increasing in frequency lately so I may be taking it again myself!

I prefer the 10mg tablets, which I break in half, so that I am getting as small an effective dose as possible. Usually, within 1 hour of taking half a tablet, the pain has subsided. If I haven't gotten relief within 2-3 hours, I will take the other half. If the headache returns within 24 hours, I usually take another tablet (or half if the pain is fairly mild), but I try to take as little as possible to alleviate my symptoms (I usually don't get the 'aura' with migraines, but I frequently experience depression, lack of appetite, some dizziness and lethargy, and occasionally nausea). Sometimes, if the pain is severe or comes on suddenly, I'll take the maxalt and also take one or two excedrin tablets. The combination of acetamenophin, caffeine and aspirin really seems to help. Maxalt (and other drugs of its type) are absolute God-sends for migraine sufferers, and I have never experienced any serious negative side effects. Sometimes I feel slightly 'logey,' and if I lie down I'll fall asleep, but if I need to keep going, the drowsiness will last a few minutes and then go away completely. As for me, topamax decreased my incidences of migraine, but I did not like the side effects, so after about four months, I carefully weaned myself off of it.

Dr. switched me to this - I don't find it quite as effective- sometimes I have to take 2 pills - but I can at least function when I'm on it. Works in about an hour for me, but then I feel like I need a nap.  I worry that I take too much of it b/c I get several migraines per week, but couldn't live w/o it.

Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/17/2008 3:23:17 AM	I have suffered debilitating migraines since I was 12 years old; Migraines that would put me out for literally days at a time, make me violently ill from pain, making me sensitive to all sounds, lights, and smells. I would get to the point where I would curl into a ball on the floor and want to slam my head into the door, and nothing would work. I tried Topomax, Imitrex, Propranolol and a vast array of pain medications and &quot;trigger shots&quot;. My new doctor prescribed me Maxalt, and it seemed to make my migraine go away within minutes. I know reactions to this drug depends on the person who takes it, but the only thing I personally felt from it was sort of that &quot;buzzing&quot; feeling in my body that most Narcotics would tend to have on me. I would recommend at least trying this once to anyone who has ever suffered a migraine, because in my opinion, the chance you take couldn't be worse than a crippling migraine.

Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/16/2008 5:13:19 PM	I have suffered with migraines for about 20 years, doctors and I feel it's related to perimenopause, and now menopause.  Need to take it fairly soon after migraine starts,  and lie down in a quiet, darkened place, or at least lay my head down, for 15-20 minutes to work most effectively.  If I wait too long, even Maxalt won't work for me, so I try to make very sure I carry it with me wherever I go.  Usually, my migraines last 1-3 days, and I need two to four doses over those days to keep my migraine subdued.  For those of us who have had migraines for years, you know what I mean--it's always there, even if far in the background, until you know it is finally gone.  Then you feel like a miracle walking--until the next one.  If I am at work, I need to stay pretty busy, or I will get tired from the Maxalt.  It usually makes me feel groggy, so I have to watch it if I must drive, but the grogginess feeling is SOOOO much better than the pain and light/noise/touch sensitivity.  Maxalt has worked the best for me of all the meds I've tried. Imitrex had some really awful side effects, and stopped working for me after a few years.  Have used Maxalt, at a doctor's recommendation, for about 7 years now.  No severe side effects that I can't live without.  Am still waiting for menopause to end, and hope the migraines will, too.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Male  (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	25-34	8/9/2008 10:47:16 PM	I experienced unpleasant anxiety and visual hallucinations at the onset of the effect of the drug. Although my migraine usual have visual 'hallucination'/distortions, these were dissimilar and unpleasant, the anxiety associated with the medication was almost as debilitating as a migraine, I can't consider this to be a viable option for treating the onset of a migraine for that reason. Although my headache didn't persist after the initial unpleasant effects, that lasted up to 30-45 minutes.

I did not know the side effects of this med and toke my Dr's word.  I currently have many side affects and some may be permanent since no Dr can diagnose exactly what is wrong with me.  My symptoms are like that of a stroke. 
Migraine Headache	BaldClay, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Male	55-64	7/5/2008 9:27:32 AM	When I first started taking Maxalt MLT, I began seeing results within 5 minutes but over a period of years (2/3)I began seeing results within 15 to 30 minutes. I highly recommend Maxalt.

Migraine Headache	Lisa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	6/22/2008 2:13:30 PM	I have never had migraine headaches before. I have had an occational stress headache. Or maybe a self inflicted one from alcohol drinks. I've having really bad ones,for no reason. I realized it was a migraine when my usual Mortrin,Excederin,etc.. didn't work. I was sensitive to sound and light. My PA gave me a sample on this. I didn't have to take the second dose, Untill two days later it happened again. I took the Maxalt and sat with an icepack on my head, about 1hr it was better. I could put the ice pack away and get up. I don't feel totally better,but well enough to sit at the computer. I hope it stays this way because I don't have another pill. I amy 37 years old and scared to death because it is so different than the usual headache. I am afraid of the worst. Why all of a sudden is this happening? Yesterday I was fine no stress, or do I smoke, and didn't drink. Just afraid but glad I had a sample.

Maxalt usually kicks in 15-25 minutes after I take it.  I put my tablet under my tounge...someone told me it works faster if you do it that way.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	5/4/2008 8:28:04 PM	It takes about one hour to work. Afterwards, I'm sensitive to heat and cold on my skin. 
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/25/2008 4:18:05 PM	I started getting migraines when I was going through menopause.  Maxalt helps within 20 minutes.  I sometimes get a little drowsy like when taking cold medication.  Other than that, no problems.

I can just pop it in my mouth and it dissolves in a few seconds.

The only concern I have is that ever since I've been taking it (for about 4 months now) I've developed severe anxiety and depression. I have no idea if the drug has anything to do with that, but nothing changed in my life to cause this. I looked on the drug website and it says that Maxalt effects a certain the natural chemical serotonin in your brain. I know when your put on anti-depressants that the drugs are supposed to increase the serotonin in your brain. I'm not a DR just was warning everyone about my side effect. I'm going to ask my DR when I go there next week.
Migraine Headache	N/A, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/24/2008 8:31:26 PM	My only concern is that taking this medicine makes me sleepy while I'm at work. Otherwise it seems to stop the headache in its track.  My other concern is that I get  a headache almost every day and you are not supposed to take more than 3 times a week. What do I do for the other 4 days? 
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/22/2008 12:29:52 PM	Maxalt makes my migraine headache go away within 30 minutes and allows me to continue with my day.  I have not had any side effects to this medicine.

I have been using it for several years now and would not like to be without.
Migraine Headache	PMS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/11/2008 1:09:52 PM	I had been suffering from incapacitating &quot;sinus headaches&quot; on the first day of my period for years.  I was prescribed diuretics, muscle relaxers, barbituates, and have tried every over-the- counter medication available with no relief.  I switched doctors and my new doctor said that my sinus headaches could be migrains.  He prescribed Maxalt, and I have not had to suffer for more than about an hour every month, and I haven't had to miss work or anything else because of these headaches.  Maxalt is a godsend for me.  The medications gives me a weird feeling in my eyes and face, but it is definately preferable to the headache.  
Migraine Headache		5	5	5			1/22/2008 5:36:32 PM	Maxalt is the only drug that has worked for me. I also don't have as much nausea if I take it right away. I've been suffering from migraines since I was 5 or 6 (53 now) and this is a miracle for me.
Migraine Headache	tretreh, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/17/2008 2:55:15 PM	Maxalt is a miracle drug for me.  I have used it for the past 6 years.  I wish I had know about it sooner.  If I take it as soon as the aura begins, my headache never comes.  I tell all my migraine-suffering friends about it.  I should be a sales rep.  It truly is a miracle drug.
Migraine Headache	kbark77, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/29/2007 1:45:11 PM	I have been using Maxalt with great success for about 3 years. Usually within 15 to 45 mins. the pain is under control. Occasionally, perhaps once a year it will not be effective, but that is because I do not take it as soon as I should. It is a wonderful medication for relieving my migraines. I only wish the doctors would have recommended it sooner as I suffered many years before learning about this med.I am very thankful for it.
Migraine Headache	tuftsm, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/22/2007 11:51:32 PM	Finally a drug that gives relief from my migraines. Although I had to increase the dose to 10 mg, it works every time. Only rarely do I need to take a second pill after 2 hours. My migraines are 3-day affairs, so you can imagine the great relief - I have my life back!
Migraine Headache	Dee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	12/20/2007 7:46:40 PM	I have had real success with this drug. It works 9 out of 10 times and because it is not a narcotic I am able to return to normal activities sooner. The only side affect that I have noticed is I become weak and sometimes I get a sore throat.  But neither of these last more than a couple of hours.
Migraine Headache	ivryhny80, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	12/11/2007 3:34:26 PM	The first time I took Maxalt, I didn't notice any relief.  The second time I used it I felt dizzy and my face felt funny.  Every time I tried to get up, I would get so dizzy it would send me back down into my chair.  Finally had to go sleep it off.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/4/2007 10:24:22 PM	This is the first prescription med I have taken for my migraines and I am happy to say that I don't have to look any further! No matter if I take right at the begining of a migraine or after it has turned into a full blown migraine my headache is gone within 30 min, and I can function normally. I have found that it does make me a little spacey but that is a small price to pay for being pain free!
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	11/28/2007 2:23:14 PM	My doctor gave me a sample and the first dose did not provide any relief.  Two hours later I was given the second dose and within 30 mins. my migraine was gone.  It worked for me!
Migraine Headache	llflouviere, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/27/2007 3:18:29 PM	Maxalt has been the one medicine that I can take at the onsite of a headache or even if I cant' take it right away that works almost everytime.  There have been cases where my hormanes and tyrhoids have been so out of wack that it will take a second dose or a shot of turbadall or demoral from my physician.  It even helps with miagranes that I get from my neck injury.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/18/2007 12:07:55 AM	I woke up with a full blown migraine (couldn't even turn on any lights), and I took one pill of Maxalt and within 10-15 minutes My symptoms had started to disappear. By the time I arrived at work about 10 minutes after my migraine way almost completely gone!!
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	11/9/2007 4:04:49 PM	Maxalt usually works, slowly, but relieves the pain. I have had some headaches that Maxalt had no effect on. 
Migraine Headache	ru4real, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/2/2007 3:20:01 AM	i have the most severe form of migraine a person can have. I have tried every medicine possible. After 30 years of suffering, i found Maxalt. I take the 10 mg, that dissolves on the tongue. This is the ONLY drug that has EVER worked for me. 
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/17/2007 1:42:47 PM	After years of pain this drug is a miracle.  I take this right after a migraine hits and in moments the pain is gone.  I highly recommend that you try this medication.  With Maxalt I can take the medication without going down for hours while it works.  Within fifteen minutes I'm back to normal.

Migraine Headache	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	10/9/2007 5:06:00 PM	This is my first time using.  Reduced symptoms by about 80- 90%.  Felt very tired, but who cares when the migraine is nearly gone.

Migraine Headache	vt_yeti, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/26/2007 4:42:32 PM	This drug is amazing. I suffer from classic migraines, so as soon as I get the aura, I drop the Maxalt and it allows me to function. In the past, no other drug has worked for me--I had to curl up in a ball in a dark, quiet bed until it was over. With Maxalt, I can keep going; not as effective at work as usual, since I get a little spacy, but I don't have to stop everything like before. I do get a kind of weird side effect--achey shoulders; it feels like I've been carrying a 50-lb. pack around for a couple of days. Now if only they could come up with something to stop the migraines entirely...

Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	9/22/2007 10:26:30 PM	This medication is great.  It almost always gets rid of my migraines, usually within 20 minutes.  I find it works better if I lay down and rest while it kicks in.  I usually sleep for an hour or two, and wake up feeling no pain, but a little groggy.
Migraine Headache	VooDoo_Daddy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	9/19/2007 10:19:04 AM	My neurologist tried me on a few different migraine medications and this one does the trick best as long as I catch it early enough.  And the best thing is I can take a maxalt and keep working.  No sleepy side effects for me.  That is really great.
