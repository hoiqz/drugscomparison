High Amount of Fats in the Blood	EnjoyingLife , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	6/8/2012 11:45:31 AM	I am going through treatment for the &quot;dumping syndrome&quot; associated with Gall Bladder removal. So far this stuff has worked great. Found if you mix it in Orange Juice the taste and texture is not so bad. For the gas I use Charcoal capsules, found at healthfood stores. 
Chronic Diarrhea	Theresa, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	2/2/2012 9:02:12 AM	Had gall bladder out 5 years ago and on Prevalite ever since.  Once a day, mixed into unsweetened iced tea.  &quot;Dumping syndrome&quot; not the problem it used to be.
Chronic Diarrhea	Diane, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	45-54	1/23/2012 11:49:08 AM	I have been on the medication for one week and am having severe nausea and flatulence.  Not quite sure if the Dr. put me on it for diarrhea after having my gallbladder removed or the fact that he suspects I have a bile duct blockage.  I can probably put up with the flatulence but the nausea is debilitating.

Chronic Diarrhea	Margofran, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	4	5	Female	55-64	9/12/2011 11:48:47 AM	I used to run to the bathroom and many times didn't make it.  I have to take two packets a day, it is not perfect but 100 times better.  For those of you who dislike the taste, put it in orange juice, the one with pulp fools me the best.
Chronic Diarrhea	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	9/7/2011 10:56:30 AM	Dumping syndrome after Gall bladder surgery. It was a godsend!
Chronic Diarrhea	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/30/2011 8:36:05 PM	This medicine has helped tremendously. Before it, I had to be close to a bathroom after I ate. Wish I had known about this sooner.  I do not like the taste at all, but have found it easier to mix with milk (usually skim milk) and sometimes add a dab of caramel syrup and mix completely.
Chronic Diarrhea	Struggling, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	8/24/2011 11:39:23 AM	I have had IBS since I was 10, but haven't dealt with uncontrolable diarrhea until 3 yrs after my gallbladder was removed. I have been battling this for 1.5 yrs and so frustrated. The medicine definitely helps, but isn't consistent.  Still have some problems when eating out.  Will continue to work on dosage, but I usually take Immodium with it.  It seems to help.  I was hoping for a more consistent solution.
Chronic Diarrhea	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	8/11/2011 11:34:06 AM	I'm 32, after the birth of my daughter, I Had my gallbladder removed and had suffered chronic diarrhea for years. Tried avoiding certain foods, but still had issues. Tried this medication, and now, I am no longer running to the bathroom after each meal. The down side is that it taste absolutely disgusting, I don't gag anymore like I did when I first starting taking it, but its still pretty nasty stuff. But it sure beats the embarassment of sprinting to the bathroom!!! If only they could do something about the taste/texture!
Chronic Diarrhea	RNMom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	45-54	6/5/2011 11:36:50 PM	This medication has changed my life. After having my gallbladder removed, I suffered from SEVERE diarrhea, often 6-8 times a day. I felt like I couldn't even go to the grocery store. The DAY I started Prevalite, the symptoms went away completely! I just wish I had known about it sooner. The only down side is it's pretty gross to drink, very gritty/chalky. But well worth it for the benefits!

Hope for better results. I have mild gas but terrible stomach bloating to the point I can't get clothes on. I don't know if this is a common side effect, I read nothing about this.

Chronic Diarrhea	sweetpea, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	55-64	9/1/2010 5:11:58 PM	I have been on Prevalite about 7 months.  It has solved the diarrhea problem but apparently it causes extreme flatulence-I take it in orange juice and it is ok. Any better ideas for taking it? and any ideas for the flatulence (severe)

If there is a treatment to counter act this side effect I would apppreciate the help.

High Cholesterol	 on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	1	1			5/4/2008 11:27:56 AM	this medication is terrible!!!!  It dosen't mix well with water, tastes gritty, and I fight with myself to take it.  Cholestyramine is much better; mixes well and tastes like oranges.  Maybe you should take lessons from their company and change prevalite. I am definitely going back to taking cholestyramine no matter what the cost!!!!!
Chronic Diarrhea	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/2/2008 3:31:17 PM	I have taken other powders that do not have phenylketonuria in them they taste better and work better I would not recommend prevalite to anyone!!!!
Chronic Diarrhea	betterqualityoflife, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	4/19/2008 5:30:00 PM	I have been diagnosised with IBS and was on another medication. After my gallbladder was removed that medication no longer helped. Since taking this medication, once I have had my morning dose I am good for the rest of the day. This has given me a better quality of life. There are still some things that I have to avoid but not having to be within running distance of a restroom that is a sacrifice I do not mind making. I have been on it over a year now and do wonder about the long term effects. And there has been some weight gain but I am on the &quot;lite&quot; so it helps.
Chronic Diarrhea	Black Heart, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	4/15/2008 10:20:41 PM	Doctor prescribed this medication to stop explosive diarrhea after gallbladder was surgically removed.  Product does contain NutraSweet and phenylketonurics.  Oral suspension must be mixed with liquid. Best if mixed with juice instead of water. Gives a &quot;full&quot; feeling after drinking for a few hours.  Product prescribed for a period of thirty days.  Waiting to see overall effectiveness.  Do not want to take this medication long term.  Hoping short term results will solve problem.   
Other		5	5	5			3/24/2008 12:48:49 PM	After years of agony of what was thought to be Cronic Diarrea, it was determined perhaps it was Habbas Syndrome. I can live a normal life now!!!Understand, you will be able to eat out and not map bathrooms there and on your way home. For the first time I can save myself the embarrasement of explosive diarrea. If there is any downside, I have gained a few (5 lbs) pounds because of the newness. I have been on Prevalite for over 4 months with 99% effectiveness.

Chronic Diarrhea	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	1/25/2008 12:23:21 AM	Use it to stop chronic diarrhea after a gallbladder removal. It works very well when taking 1 dose in the morning and 1 dose at night. I take it in apple juice (4 oz). I have been taking it for 4 years with no side affects.
Chronic Diarrhea	karencap, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	11/10/2007 11:08:49 AM	This has helped and its great to be able to eat things out or at home that I would not be able to eat if not taking this medication, the only problem I have had is I am beginning to get leg cramps I think it is because I am also on vytorin for high cholesterol, other wise its been a great help.
