Other	mainframetech, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	65-74	11/15/2009 5:40:23 PM	  I have Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and my vitamin D level went down as it does with CKD.  One doctor prescribed Zemplar at a very high cost to improve my vitamin D level.  I looked up the drug and didn't like the cost or side effects, so I saw my GP and he agfreed that I could substitute regular vitamin D (D3) for the zemplar.  After looking at my lab results we setled on 3- 400 i.u. pills daily, which brought my D level up to exactly the right amount.  Many precribed medications have safer alternatives such as Omega-3 in place of Plavix and so on.  Check with your doctor, but learn everything you can and don't depend on an unknown doctor to know enough.  Remember, 100,000 deaths in hospitals are attributed to medical errors.Good Luck.

Upon taking my first 5 tablets my blood pressure dropped to a very low rate - 74/42 and would not improve over several weeks. My RX was a one month trial, I stopped just before having knee surgery, recommended by my surgeon and health care provider. I did not resume my RX and it has taken me 2 months to regulate my blood pressure back to my average of 120/62.
