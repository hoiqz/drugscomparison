Joint Pain	JimH, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	9/4/2012 11:46:55 AM	I think this stuff is great.  I can not take pain medication for arthritis pain, and tried Capazin. It works.  I can sleep through the night. Note that it is painful on the first application and after the first shower after an application. But on an ongoing basis it is very mild. I recommend it.

Joint Pain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	7/19/2012 10:15:47 AM	OMG - I bought this for me and for my mother. I thought I was doing so good for my mother who is in her 80s to help her arthritis. I used it on my knees and they were ok but my hand was on fire for over 4 hrs.  My mother said her arm was also on fire.  It will go in trash today.
Sprains and Strains	April A, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	7/17/2012 1:51:40 PM	I put the cream on my husbands ankle because he lightly spained his ankel and at first it felt good but about 2 minutes later it it started burning his ankle and my hand, and just kept get getting hotter and hotter it hurt so bad between my fingers it felt like i had  severe papercuts and when we tryed to wash it off it got worse, almost unbearable and almost 16 hours later and the burning sensation is still there I just threw it in the trash and really think they should put a more serious warning sighns about this scorching cream!
Joint Pain		1	1	1			7/13/2012 9:57:40 AM	I used it on my wrist. The horrible horrible burning made me forget about my wrist pain. I'm not going to do a comparison test but I'll bet it's what it feels like to get maced.
Joint Pain	redrobin95060, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	7/10/2012 7:14:11 PM	I'm surprised by all of the negative reviews.  I was in such pain I couldn't sleep and used it as a last resort since I'd tried everything else.  Almost immediately after rubbing it into my knee I felt relief and was able to sleep. At times I've had to use it on my entire leg, gently rubbing it into the skin.  I have had a burning sensation on the bottom part of my leg where the nerve endings are near the top and doesn't have much tissue/fat, but it doesn't last long and the benefits of the cream far outweigh any pain it might cause.  It sounds like this is something that each person should &quot;test&quot; on a small spot before regular use.  I personally don't know what I'd do without it.  I carry a tube in my purse and in the car, just in case.

Pain associated with Arthritis	antipain, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	6/16/2012 9:31:23 PM	It's been 6 hours since I tried this and my hands are still burning. I've soaked them, tried oatmeal bath, aloe, everything you can imagine. I'd rather have my swollen arthritic, unbendable fingers back than deal with this burning. I too threw it out after using it only once. Makes me wonder how the FDA gave it the ok. HORRIBLE!!!
Pain associated with Arthritis	the2blues@aol.com, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	6/14/2012 5:31:02 PM	I applied this medicine to my lower back and legs and it startng burning like I had put a hot iron to those areas.  I immediately wiped the areas clean with an ice cold washrag and then had to apply cold compresses to stop the burning.  I have contacted the FDA requesting they take it off the market. I am staying with my BenGay.
Nerve Pain	MontyFausta, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male		6/9/2012 9:51:04 AM	I have been using another product containing capsacin that works but not for long, so i decided to try this one be because it has more capsacin than the other one. What a mistake! The burning sensation is very bad. When it went away away hours later, it seemed to have helped with nerve pain for half a day --- but then the burning sensation came back! Washing with soap and water doesn't help. It is now the next day. The burning was there during the night and it is still there. I hope it goes away soon. I will not apply it again!

At first you get the warm sensation and it feels quite nice. But then my knee started burning like fire.  I took a shower the next morning hoping that would help but it didnt.  Now it feels like scolding hot water is constantly being poured over my knees.

It felt like I had some type of acid burn.I called poison control and before I finished the sentence she said you must have been using Capzasin-HPThis is a first and the last time I use any product from CHATTEMGuess if poison control was this familiar with it , it should be discontinued .
Backache	healthnut, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	55-64	3/25/2012 12:24:22 PM	I just applied this cream to my lower back and experienced a burning, tingling sensation which soon subsided.  The active ingredient is from hot peppers (which are GOOD for you, unlike hydrocortisone, which is acknowledged as dangerous) so of course it is going to burn somewhat.  Since I consider long-term effects on my health, I plan to continue using this (unless my skin gets irritated) and give this product a chance, as the side effects of prolonged use of hydrocortisone are much worse.

Immediately started burning her shoulders and my hands, washed off several times, but burning did not stop. Later ate and sandwich and lips started burning, nausous all night and next day.  Should be better warnings on the package.  Terrible product.  Will never use again.

I was up half the night (1/2/12) with a burning pain in my left thigh after rubbing this on.  I had to use a cold compress to make it stop just so I could get to sleep and even right now into the next morning my leg is burning.  I'll never use this crap again!

This is bad stuff needs to be off market.The next day I still had a red hot mark. To get it  to stop burning I had to get in the shower and let the cool water run on my back for about 10 min.Please do not use   
Pain associated with Arthritis	KathyG_NC, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	8/30/2011 1:48:24 PM	Very unpredictable treatment. I used it a few times and hardly felt anything, then a couple of times it did feel good, nice and warm, then today it felt like my skin was burning off. Within 20 minutes of application my neck was bright red and felt as if it were on fire.I looked everywhere trying to find some method to use to relieve the burning but I couldn't find anything that could help. Some said they washed the area but it didn't help, some said they applied a cool cloth to the area and while that provided relief for a minute or so, it started to burn again.In the back of my mind I knew that if you ate a hot pepper you could drink milk and that would relieve the burning on your tongue.  So, since I was to the point where I'd try anything, I decided to try this method on my skin. It took a few minutes of constantly dabbing my skin with a paper towel dipped in whole milk to start feeling some relief.  After 20 minutes of this I went and gently washed my skin in cool water and soap.  It's been a few minutes since that and although some slight heat has returned it's so much better than it was before. It feels now like I thought it should from the start. Like I had applied a heating pad to my skin instead of a cream that causes heat. My best advice is to stay away from anything like this product. You just don't know how it will react with your chemistry and you too could eventually have a severe skin burn.  But if you have already used it, try milk, it really helped my skin.

Horribly painful.  Washed it off (which made it burn worse) applied Benadryl, hydrocortisone and took oral Benadryl.  Still in pain.  Obviously having an allergic reaction.  If you want to try it, I recommend trying a very small spot first!  This should not be an OTC product.

Then I went to apply face cream not knowing there was a trace of the Capzasin HP still on my hand and I have BLISTERS and Burns on my face!~!~! I can not believe the amount of pain I am in and I am so worried that the blisters will grow and even scar. I would NEVER recommend a medication that is so DANGEROUS! 
Pain associated with Arthritis	krksvlmo, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	55-64	7/14/2011 5:57:17 PM	I agree with every other comment, and that would be I couldn't put my shoes on because it burned like you were pouring 350 degree cooking oil over them. I washed it off changed my socks and shoes and had to go back to work and lasted less than 45 min. before I ripped them off expecting to see burnt flesh. Experiment with very very small amounts or better yet take the $15.00 that I paid at wxlxrxexs and buy ice cream.
Nerve Pain	anna, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/11/2011 8:05:25 AM	The company needs to give more information on the product package, like for instances warm water can cause it to burn more. Even if time has gone by since you apply the cream and the burning can return just from muscle usage . Its a very intense  burning (like a bad sunburn). It works but its not for everyone only if you have a high burn tolerance. I have had to put an ice pack on my neck to slow the burn down. The combination felt great. I was in a lot of pain and the combo actually relieved it.

After about 3 hours later I had to take a shower to wash it off I couldn't take it... Big mistake I felt I was being burned with hot coals. What the heck... I should looked it up prior to using it, I will never use it again,

Backache	meshelly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	1/4/2011 11:33:33 PM	I wouldnt have gave this product any stars but I guess I had to so I could leave a comment. I just put this creme on and immediatly started buring like I was on fire! My lower back had been hurting the last few days so I thought I would try this and go to bed...forget it! I am in so much pain!!!!! I took a 'cold' bath..nothing! I put vaseline on the area...nothing. I put baby powder on...nothing. Finally I looked it up and found that so far the aloe vera is taking some of the burning away. But it still burning. I looked at the area and it is fire red! Take this stuff off the market before someone seriously gets hurt. I wish the makers would read these comments. It is not fair to the people that are hurting and  try to use something to relieve their pain and they have to go through more HELL by using this crap!

It was to the point that it made me nauseous. I used this cream and it numbed my skin. I did wake up a few times during the night because my back was burning and had uncover my back but my skin was still numb. If you can handle the burning at first from the capsaicin until your body gets used to it it numbed my back completely
Sprains and Strains	55-64 Male  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	12/5/2010 5:27:45 PM	An antidote for this stuff is aloe with lidocaine for sunburns. OMG this stuff burns like the worst sunburn you've ever had and trying to wash it off only seemed to make it worse.

I have used Capzasin for the past week.  Not only does it burn badly, but it is impossible to remove once it is  applied.  I have bathed, washed dishes multiple times and used a variety of cleaners to try to remove it.  Nothing works. It helps my lower back at night but I think I will need to discontinue using it on my hands.  I will obviously need to wear latex gloves to apply it.
Other	Treidsranch, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	7/6/2010 1:41:32 AM	I was have terrible leg cramps and couldn't sleep. When I couldn't find what I usually use I found this caspzasin HP that was given to us through a program our church has.  We can get different things that was donated to the church from store closings and such. I had never used this so I thought I would try it hoping it would work like aspercreme does. I have experienced the worst burning sensation I have ever experienced. Thought maybe it would subsid but continued to get worse. I tried to wash it off but it didn't help. I took a cold bath with baking soda it gave little relief while I soaked but once I got out continued to burn unbearably. Tried aloe to sooth, not much relief. Took benedryl hopefully it will give enough relief to get some sleep and be able to work. This is definately going in the trash so no one else gets a chance to try it and suffer the way I have. Would not recommend this to anyone. I did not realize it has pepper in it. I think I will look up remedies for burning due to pepper juice. Hope to find some relief soon.

Always wear rubber gloves when applying this cream as you don't want to get this in your eyes as it burns.I have a high pain tolerance so keep this in mind when using.If you have a low pain tolerance I wouldnt recommend it.
Joint Pain	buddy shattery, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	65-74	2/16/2010 5:27:37 PM	application from knee to ankle and feet. yes the initial application was uncomfortable but as the burning subsided so, to some extent, did the arthritic pain. be aware that feet sweat and warm sweat and product cause renewed burning and itching sensation. keep ankles, feet and toes dry and be moderate with activities. as heat affects the degree of burning sensation so does cold. don't go for walks in the snow.

A few days ago I used Capzasin HP and had a terrible and painful experience. Within minutes of using this product my hands turned bright red and became swollen and extremely painful. I washed my hands immediately but it didn't help and the pain and swelling lasted for 3 days. I am not a person who has had any allergic reaction before and would never use this product again. It didn't help my husband either.
Joint Pain	steve, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	10/27/2009 11:40:28 AM	I am a professional musician, and the Capzasin HP allows me to continue with my daily work.  BEWARE, if you are considering to use this product, you must know that some people are allergic to Capsaicin in direct contact with the skin.  Also, do not apply to the skin prior to taking a warm bath or shower because it can get down right painful.  I have become used to the topical pain because the result is very much worth using this product.
Other	Sunny, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	6/1/2009 2:32:53 PM	I have a lower back pain.  I used Capzasin-HP and it gave me immediate relief.  Obviously it has to be taken with a little bit of care - like control the dosage, washing your hands after applying hte cream, try to avoid heat on the place where it has been applied.The first day I felt a burning sensation.  I got used to it soon and learned to control the dosage.  A little bit of warmth seems to activate the area and help me to keep my back warm and it feels that it helps blood flow in the region of the application.  Once you control the application, it can be very useful for pain management.  It has helped me a lot.
Nerve Pain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/16/2009 4:25:22 PM	I applied the cream to my husband's lower back for joint and nerve pain. Within minutes my hands felt like I had them on a hot oven rack. I attempted to wash the cream off  - bad idea.  It felt like I turned the oven up 500 degrees. I tried aloe lotions and even sunburn relief cream but nothing helped and the burning continued for 2 days.  When my husband took a shower he noticed the area where the cream was applied wouldn't lather. Unfortunately he kept trying and finally got the water to start getting the ointment off. It then ran down and the burning began in some very sensitive areas - remember I said I applied it to his lower back so you can imagine the areas that it found. This stuff has absolutely no business being on the market AT ALL!!!!
Joint Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/1/2009 12:17:35 AM	When I first put this on my knee and shoulder it was just a warming sensation but within about 20 minute it burned like a 3rd degree sunburn.  I left it for about 4 hours...all I could stand.  So I tried to wash it off and that made it burn ever hotter. right now I wish I would have gotten on this sight and read this before using.  It's time for bed but I can't handle anything to touch that area and I want to cry.  Not sure how I'm going to handle work tomorrow.  this is going back to the store..bad bad stuff...should have a big warning on the front of the box. 
Nerve Pain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	12/27/2008 4:07:47 AM	This product should not be sold OTC or even be on the market!  Tried it for sciatica pain down leg and it burned so bad I nearly passed out from the pain on the applied area.  I will be returning it in the morning and telling the pharmacist  how bad it was in hopes that others will not suffer similarly.  Stay away from this product!
Nerve Pain	nannajane, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	12/4/2008 10:32:19 AM	This cream is worthless, the foot area felt warm for 20 minutes and then the pain was back . Also, the cream is reactivated the following morning by the hot water from the shower, even on the hand that applied it. It is a intense burn which is worse than the pain. I washed my hands after application with no burning but the next day? very absurd.

Joint Pain	Pink, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/11/2008 2:35:32 PM	I used this product for arthritis pain in my neck.  After application, it begins warm-soothing like a heating pad.  It then continues to get HOT, to the burning point.  I could no longer stand it and had to wash it off.  I thought my skin was just sensitive. My husband used it for his knee.  His burning symptoms were much more intense, and it did not help to wash it off.  His knee was still sore, but also burned.  It lasted for hours.  This cream is going in the trash.  Bad joint pain is more acceptable than the severe burn caused by this cream.

Joint Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	10/12/2007 3:13:29 PM	I used this cream on my wrist right before bed, and at 3 am was awakened by a burning, numb sensation in my entire arm, right up to the elbow. I had also lain my face against that arm, and that entire side of my face was red, burning, and swollen. I had to take Benadryl to alleve the symptoms, and the numbness did not leave my arm until about 10 am the next morning. Either there is something in this medication that I am allergic to, or it may have counteracted with one of my medications. Be careful and check with your doctor or pharmacist before using this.
