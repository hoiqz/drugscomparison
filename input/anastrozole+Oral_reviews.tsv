Breast Cancer	Sue, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	10/4/2012 1:09:03 PM	I started taking this drug following chemotherapy and radiotherapy for breast cancer.Like the lady who posted on the 20th August 2012 I have had problems with my arms hands legs and feet. I find it difficult to walk now without pain. When I first stand it is difficult to get moving. The pain in my hands in particular keeps me awake at night. To say I have tingling and numbness is putting it mildly. It is very very painful.I cannot grip things and feel as though I have aged 20 years since I started taking this drug. I also have developed a rash on my arms and legs like goosepimples that dont go away. I have taken the drug for 2 months and my consultant has told me to stop taking it until I am reassessed.

I took this medication for 6 months before discontinuing as I had dramatic increases in blood sugar levels and blood pressure. Even with prescribed medication to combat the side effects, the continued use of this drug was impacting my overall health and my medical oncologist suggested I discontinue it's use.  I will now begin Tamoxifin.
Breast Cancer	D., 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	8/30/2012 11:33:30 AM	I was diagnosed with stage one estrogen positive breast cancer in 2006. After a bilateral mastectomy I chose to not have any chemo and just take arimedex which was so expensive that I changed to anastrozole (1mg daily). I have a yearly Reclast infusion to protect my bones and only suffer from minimal side effects which are preferable to not taking the medication. I have spoken with my oncologist and we both agree that i can stay on the med. as long as I feel comfortable doing so. He has no problem with going past the five year mark with this med.

Very low risk of recurrence. I had taken this drug for 4 months, and had finished my radiation, when I noticed pain and stiffness developing in my hands and elbows. I also have pain and stiffness in my leg joints which makes me walk like a drunk pirate when I first stand. I have trouble holding onto things, don't have the good grip I had before. I don't get any relief from pain medications. My oncologist said my blood tests are all good, but there are other options if I can't take anastrozole; but they aren't as well documented. She wanted me to add a joint supplement such as glucosamine; another pill!!! One of the other commentators mentioned that she tolerated the name brand version better; maybe I should switch to that? I sure don't feel like celebrating the end of my treatments like I thought I would!
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	sprite2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	8/25/2012 9:19:15 AM	Started this drug in Dec 2011, by March I developed severe lower leg pain.  They thought it was a blood clot but in a week I could'nt walk and evern had a hard time holding a pencil.  Went to 4 doctors and was diagonised with Rhabdomyloysis. The fuild left all my muscles and my kidneys were failing. My muscles were so weak I fell and broke my ankle. 4 days after I quit this drug I felt better. Will never take it again.
Breast Cancer	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	7/24/2012 5:00:15 PM	I've been taking the drug since Nov. 2011.  I was diagnosed with first stage breast cancer in both breasts between last week of Aug. and first week in Sept. of 2011.I was told that the left breast definitely had to be taken, but on the right I had an option, either a mastectomy or a lumpectomy.  I decided on a bilateral mastectomy with no reconstruction.  The biopsy showed all the cancer gone and none went to the limp nodes.  The last test show that i was at a very low risk of getting it again.  My oncologist put me on 1mg. of anastrozole, 1 tablet once a day for five years.  As far as side effects go I had several for at least the last twenty-five years, and I wasn't on any medication of any kind. No for me I do not see an increase of any of those side effects.  Th pre-existing side effects I have had past to present are hot flashes they started with menopause, after that I only get them at night.  Trouble sleeping, I always had that since I turned 50.  However, I have been retired for the last four years so I can sleep late, or take a nap in the afternoon. that helps.Thinning hair, again I've not noticed, since there's a gene in my family for thinning hair and since I long ago learned that we normally loose 100 hairs a day, that hasn't bothered me either.  It's better than having to go for chemo and loosing it altogether.  The last is weight gain.  Well I have always had a problem, however, I find drinking eight glasses of water a day plus other liquids, exercising and a good diet that eliminates all fatty foods and sweets does the trick for me.  All in all, I have no complaints about this drug.

They are painful enough that I take ibuprofen every six hours to cope, even through the night. If I don't take the ibuprofen, I almost can't walk or get out of a chair.  I have yet to report this to my oncologist, but I will.  Other than that, I have no complaints.
Breast Cancer	Lois, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	55-64	4/26/2012 11:18:14 PM	My oncologist is in denial about the side effects I have been experiencing (on meds for over a year).  I have trigger finger in 2 fingers and both thumbs, hair loss, difficulty sleeping, tingling in feet, and weight gain.  I developed high blood pressure and am now a borderline diabetic from the weight gain.  My quality of life has diminished and all these oncologists don't care enough to listen.  Can't wait until I reach the 5 yr. mark and don't have to take this anymore!

I thought T would kill me with all fo the side effects such as thickening of the uterous. This med I have been on for 1 year 4 months and it is a God send for me. Still have no sex drive to speak of, but that is a small price to pay. Also, am 15-20 lbs heavier than before BC. That is something I work on everyday. I used to be a size 4 now an 8 I feel great and hopefully will still get great biyearly  checkup in June.

Breast Cancer	kelly, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	55-64	9/2/2011 12:27:53 PM	Early stage BC and the tumor was small. Biopsy Nov 2010, Lumpectomy Dec 2010. Radiation Feb-March 2011. Further test on the tumor showed I was at low risk of the cancer coming back. I had reservations about ANASTROZOLE because of the bone loss. I already have osteoporosis, but the oncologist insisted I had to take it. I started taking this the end of April 1011 and within two weeks started getting bad side effects.Pain in my arms and legs (couldn't stand for more than 5 mins), especially knees and elbows which swelled up. Dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headache (which went away,) not sleeping well, blurred vision, depression, absolutely no appetite, hair loss, affected breast swelled up and was very painful. Then I started to get tingling and numbness in my hand which went up my arm. The patient information says this is an unlikely but very serious side affect and to call doctor immediately.Oncologist said to stop taking it and see if the side effects go away. They did and she said that I didn't need to take it. Said I was borderline whether I needed to or not. She didn't put me on anything else.Anyway I know some are asking what happens when you stop taking it and I am happy to report that all the side effects have gone and I feel better than I have in a very long time. Of course I was only on it for a little over two months.Good luck and bottom line. Make your doctor listen to you.
Breast Cancer	katykate2000, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	8/17/2011 9:39:52 PM	Sept. 2007 I was diagnosed with estrogen postive breast cancer stage 1.  Opted for a mastectomy of the right breast. Took Arimidex for 2 years and as the generic brand anastrozole became available I was switched over.  I have some hair loss, aching feet, at times swelling in my throat, itching arms, aching joints and I'm noticably more tired.  I dislike the drug and disliked arimidex as well.  But don't have long to go to reach my 5 year mark.  However my doctor says they are going to recommend 10 years.  I say &quot;No thanks&quot;  5 and done! 
Other	sophiejean, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	8/17/2011 9:28:27 PM	The drug causes trouble sleeping.  I have felt as though my throat wants to close up when sometimes swallowing, but didn't relate to this as a side effect until I read it.  My tongue will sometimes tingle or have a numbness.  My joints ache like crazy!  I was on amrimidex until the generic was birthed.  Then my insurance forced me to take the generic or pay a high price for arimidex.  The arimidex was not much better except I didn't have the throat and tongue issue.  My feet hurt all the time like I'm walking on broken bones.  I want to quit the drug, but I'm 1 1/2 years from completing 5 years as required.

Side effects that have continued for 8+ months are severe headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, hair loss, anxiety, depression, weight gain, fatigue.  But my cancer has not come back.  I had Stage 2 B cancer with a mastectomy.  Diagnosed 12/2009, surgery 1/2010, finished chemo and radiation 9/2010.  My life will never be the same.

Since starting on this drug 4 months ago I have severe shoulder pain. Not fully accepting my oncologist's answer of a side effect, I saw a orthopaedic surgeon.  I have a bone spur in my left shoulder that is beginning to tear my shoulder muscle. Have a &quot;side effect?&quot; Get a 2nd opinion.   
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer	cje, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	4/1/2011 1:09:42 PM	I changed from tamoxifen to this after finding out chemo put me into early menopause.  It was HORRIBLE.  I had severe headaches all day, every day.  Add to that hip pain, diaherria, and non-stop hot flashes (2 or 3 every hour).  Doc put me back on tamoxifen and all the symptoms went away. 
Breast Cancer	bblatchx2, 55-64 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1		55-64	3/22/2011 3:48:04 PM	I was diagnosed 2009, bilateral mastectomy Jan. 2010.  I first took Femara but due to the extremely high cost of that drug, my oncologist prescribed Anastrozole 1 mg oral.  I have diarrhea daily, some nausea, weight gain, peripheral neuropathy of my hands and feet, joint pain, dizziness, blurry vision, extreme fatigue and now am experiencing nastiness -- much like when I would run out of my Premarin in past years.  I am hoping the side effects are warranted and my cancer does not return.

Worst side-effects have been severe nausea and vomiting and it is for this reason that my oncologist has taken me off the med for 2 weeks.  I've also experienced increased pain in my back, legs, feet and hands (part of my left hand is numb; insomnia.  Unfortunately, it is rather normal for me to experience severe side effects and allergies to medications. I really hope that my Dr. can suggest another medication for me to try as I want to do everything I can to reduce recurrence of cancer!  I cannot imagine spending 5 years on anastrazole.

I was tired, then I ended up in the emergency room with chest pain.  It showed up as acid reflux. As time went on my elbows ached and I felt awful.  This medication is disgusting and it took away four good months of my life.  Thank God, my Dr. allowed me to go back on Tamoxifin.

The worst is hip pain that started two months ago and just found out I have acute osteoporosis which last year I had the bone density of a 21 year old.  My oncologist has talked about a new drug that will replace this so-called preventable drug in June,2009.
