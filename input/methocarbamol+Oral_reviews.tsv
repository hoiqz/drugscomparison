Now I take this med. and I couldn't be happier*!*  None of the side affects of Soma's, I can't even &quot;feel&quot; the drug in my body, but the knots that used to live in my back have dissolved*!* I have Scoliosis, aka Curvature of the Spine; it takes a lovely left turn between shoulder blades and is currently twisting Left at top and Right at bottom. Yes, this is painful, but we Doc &amp; I manage w/time released pain meds and this= Methocarbamol*!* Soma is a very addicting drug and difficult to get off of, all former users struggle with this and those who are dissatisfied because they can't &quot;feel&quot; the drug in their bodies, need to own up to the addictive quality of SOMA, possibly the most dangerous Muscle Relaxer ever made. I've fallen countless times, almost cracked my head open on them. They also shorten and stop your breathing and if you live alone, this is deadly. It always happens at night time! I BEG EVERYONE ON SOMA'S TO GIVE THIS MEDICATION A TRY, YOU WON'T GET HIGH, BUT YOU WILL GET BETTER*!* GOD BLESS &amp; HAPPY LANDINGS, VICTORIA*

Muscle Spasm	NannieK, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	4/27/2012 3:04:44 PM	I am a 50 year old female and a paraplegic due to a car accident 20 years ago. I have had muscle spasms in my legs since the accident &amp; used to manage them with Baclofen which worked fine- no side effects. My spasms ceased so I stopped taking the Baclofen about 7 years ago. Lately the spasms have come back big time. My Dr. Prescribed Methocarbmol. I took 1 the first day. All was fine. The next morning I took 1 pill. Within 1 hour I had such severe pain in my head, I thought I was experiencing a cerebral hemorrhage or stroke. I have had headaches in my life, this was not a headache. This was AGONY. I have a high pain threshold but this was unbearable. And nothing helped. I take OxyContin &amp; that did nothing. Advil- nothing. Later I took Motrin 800- nothing. Only time helped. It took 1 pill @ 10:00 a.m. And did not have ANY relief until 2:00 the next morning. This was an absolute nightmare for me, I thought I would lose my mind with the pain in my head. NEVER EVER AGAIN would I take this nor would I reccommend it. I wouldn't want anyone to even chance having the reaction I had. One of the side effects is a &quot;headache&quot; it should say &quot;mind splitting, suicide inducing, AGONY&quot; as a side effect. Please please do not even chance taking this poison.

I am fused now from L2 to S1. I still have allot of muscle spasams in my low back and don't think the methocarbamol is working for me. It is 500 Mg strength 3 times daily I feel that I need another muscel relaxor to step up and do a better job than the methocarbmol is doing

Other	montrea, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	1/14/2012 4:57:57 AM	REASON FOR USE - Used to alleviate the pain from a strained back tendon/ligament. EFFECTS - Generally getting good relief from 2 extra-strength acetaminophen+methocarbamol caplets; however, my upper back, chest, face and neck have all been incredibly itchy since I started the medication 3 days ago. The face and neck areas in particular feel a bit puffy, though not alarmingly so. Skin feels a little rough there, too.The occasional flushing that occurs is intensely prickly and can get rather painful and uncomfortable, though it only lasts about a second.I have taken Tylenol/acetaminophen in the past and have had no allergic reaction to it, so I assume this is all caused by the methocarbamol.Experienced no other side effect.

I consulted my pharmacist of these side effects because my doctir was unavailable. He said that it was nothing he had ever heard of before and that it was one of the least sedadtive relaxers on the market. Bear in mind the only thing I take on a rwegular basis is omega 3, b complex, and standard multi vitamin. I am twent four years old, no addictipon other than tobacco. No prescriptions. I usually only go to the doctor annually for a physical and blood work. During my visit I explained the side ffects I had been experiencing.I handed over the RX bottle that contained twenty six pills, out of 30 total originally (after three days). Still in extreme discomfort mind you, I asked if there another option. I know the problem of growing popularity on the streets have doctors on edge about writing prescriptions.. I was treated as a Junkie. The pills were counted, placed back in the bottle, then I was asked to return with the pills after three days and let him know if I were still experincing these symtoms. Why do that? I had already stopped taking, and experiencing these things. I simply replied that I was not taking them with me, and walked out never again asking for a medication IE Flexaril, oxycodone, or any other popular street med. After research I find an elder man had these same symtoms in 2008, this is an issue. one that should be addressed. I have no choice but to tough things out and wear a back brace now.....

So many defferent brands that they were not helping the pain. In the very beginning stages they were ok, but 4 and 5 years later they were not helping. The only thing need was something for joints to get to the joints at that time. The take so long that now my feet hurt on the tops, my toes, my fingers and the top of my hands. What has been hurting along has gotten worst. My left hip,shoulder, kneck, across my kneck, lower back and upper part of my arm. It seems to be spreading. But no one would listen. Now I hope they listen when I ask them to test me for Chrons. I it also in my family. I just want my medicine so I can work as long as I can.

Thankfully,I did not suffer any further and will never take this medication again.

So many side-effects I stopped them and went to the methocarbamol only. Relief at night was what I needed and that is what I got! Taking the other meds with the methocarbamol seemed to make this muscle-relaxer ineffective, but without all the side-effects from the others, methocarbamol gave me relief from the aches and pains at night.

It works great with my arthritis also.

This drug, when taken as soon as I sense a spasm coming on, completely knocks them out!  It does not make me sleepy - I can take them and then work a full day.  Thank the Lord for Methocarbamol!

I do not have to take it as often, but it works great for muscle spasms and general tightening of my muscles, ligaments, tendons,etc. The only problem I have had is stomach pain if I do not take it with milk. However, I would recommend rabaxin for anyone who suffers from any source of pain. It also makes it possible for me to use less pain medication for my chronic pain.

I ended up taking the vicodin with ibuprofen since this medication seemed to do nothing for my muscle spasms. However, I was prescribed to take only one 750mg tablet at a time. I now see that a lot of people take an initial dose of 1500mg and then another tablet every 4 hours. Perhaps that makes a difference.

It is the first medication that has markedly relieved the muscle spasms. It does cause a bit of drowsiness, but not enough to keep me from functioning normally. I take 2 (750mg) at night along with 3 OTC pain relievers,and wake up almost pain free. I usually take them one hour before bed, 30 minutes apart. During the day, if I need to, I take them one hour apart to keep from being too drowy. None of the narcotics I have ever used did this for me. Plus, I don't feel lethargic, nor do I necessarily need to lie down when I take them. That is great for me.

Other	psklm, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	55-64	4/18/2008 1:21:21 PM	3herniated discs, scoliosis in upper and lower back,bursitis,age,woman. This was my choice to work with percocet-presurgery.Few meds keep pain under 6-7/10, but a careful blend allows better flexibility.Must keep walking for the LBP etc, stop walking for the bursitis.Water walking still best with careful lean on meds.Attentive doctor inte- gral part of plan. Find out max about meds even when they work. Suspicions about chronic pain meds is warranted, yet we need meds for chronic AND careful introduction for acute &quot;breakthroughs&quot;. My regime: percocet for pain, methocarbamol 500 for occasional muscle tension/strain,IBUprofen 600 for inflammation. Prepare to be tired all the time, eating becomes a chore,watch BMs occur every day (prunes are my new best fruit-friend), food with or after meds. Get out of the house,bath and dress for walk as often as you can. IF depression occurs, ask your doctor for a drug with less side effects for the occasional needs.Make a quality decision to live and do so to the best of your ability...even if house or bed-bound. Be very careful to KNOW what you are inhaling for pain...there are a lot of options. Keep going!!

Muscle Spasm	 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1			4/1/2008 3:15:09 AM	Was given this for lower back pain, after 2 days every joint in my body was swollen and so sore I could hardly move. Started in my upper joints, by the next day, my hips, knees and ankles (even toes) were so sore, swollen and weak I couldn't get out of bed.  JUST SAY NOOOOO! What ever happened to Valium?  Also nightmares, if I slept at all.  After 2 days off of the med, the swelling slowly lessened, was sore for another 2 days.  Don't risk it. As a caregiver for a man with MS and a grandmother raising her grand, it was a frightening and helpless not to mention DANGEROUS nightmare.  I'll take the bad back anytime over this nightmare.
Muscle Spasm	timothi13, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	35-44	3/10/2008 9:53:06 AM	I was give this drug to help with muscle spasms from a back injury. I have to take it when I try to go to sleep. It works great at stopping the spasms. However, I take multiple doses of morphine daily and the combination of the morphine and methocarbamol knocks me out for 8-12 hours, but then it takes another 4-6 hours to become fully awake and functional. I can only take it when the spasms are at their worst and I have no plans for the next day.
Muscle Spasm	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	3/3/2008 11:06:50 AM	I strain my lower back and needed something after a 5 days of pain. This taste bad and is ineffective.

Muscle Spasm	Steph, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	2/19/2008 10:39:38 PM	I had a laminectomy (cervical spine surgery)and was prescribed this. It worked wonderfully....at first. Now, it's just something that relaxes my mind.
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	35-44	2/3/2008 10:00:29 PM	When my doctor prescribed this for my occasional neck spasms it worked well. After my car accident he prescribed it again for my lower back pain. It was not as effective. As a short term fix for minor pain it is ok but for major pain from muscle strains it is almost useless.
Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	2/1/2008 5:14:55 AM	I have Osteoarthritis, Fibromalgia, as well as several other severe medical conditions. This as well as other meds. were prescribed to help with pain, since I began to refuse any more narcotic treatment. I have been taking this every four hours for over a year. Alone this has no effect, but combined with Tramadol and others I still get little relief. Anyone who is taking this medication sould, in my opinion, talk with their doctor about an alternative.
