Endometriosis	CDKR, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/30/2012 2:16:39 PM	I have been on this bc pill (continuous therapy) for the treatment of Endometriosis for 13 years now &amp; I have no complaints what so ever. Since I am on continuous therapy I don't take any placebos, I finish a 21 day pack &amp; go straight to the next 21 day pack, no 7 day break.  I have only had 2 very light periods in the last 13 years, once due to extreme stress &amp; the other due to illness &amp; not being able to keep my pills down.  I have not had any problems with acne nor nausea.  Definitely would recommend this birth control for treatment of endometriosis.

I hadn't had any problems with it up until recently. It was a very good pill, but now my mood swings and nausea have been getting progressively worse with this pill. Time to switch.

I have always had bad mood swings with birth control, but this leaves me gray and depressed. Abnormally low libido, painful periods and tummy problems altogether, not for me. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	7/7/2011 12:43:05 AM	I have been on this birth control for about 1 week, and so far, i am always nauseated, sometimes dizzy and i have mood swings...all of which i didnt have until i started the birth control.

Absence of Menstrual Periods	mombug585, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/26/2010 12:01:09 AM	I have been taking this pill for 7 months now. The last two months my period has been much lighter and lasts 2 or 3 days. My breasts also get tender throughout the month, not all the time though. But hey these are hormones we are dealing with!!! And I cannot complain about a shorter period, I took a pregnancy test and it came out negative (which it has been 5 months since ive been sexually active so I figured it would because I have gotten my period every month, but it recently got shorter and lighter). I also have noticed the last couple weeks my face is starting to break out (I dont have acne normally) and my hair needs to be washed more often, but hey I can deal with all of that.

I have been on it for a yr now and I love it!  I have a shorter, lighter period and no cramping at all.  I highly recommend it.

Now I have heavy break through bleeding and acne which I have never had, cramps all the time, and breast tenderness which I never had. I will never recommend this medication.  Yaz is the best one

I have been using this for about 4 months now; and my periods are lighter and shorter. They have been between 1-2 days. I havent experienced any weight gain. Which im so happy about. So far so good!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/22/2010 8:42:44 PM	I used this drug in the past and had spotting between periods, so I stopped using it.  I recently started using this product again, but use it for 3 months straight upon my dr.s approval, but I havent gotten my period yet.  Pregnancy test was negative, and upon research on the web says that this is a side effect of this medication.  Overall this has been a good pill.

Compared to others I have used it is a little different. It doesn't control acne as well as other birth controls like Apri but I have noticed it is very accurate if you take the drug right. If I miss 2 pills or more I will spot (other pills you can miss about 3) and I start inevidebly on the 2nd day EVERY time after the end of my pack. I had to end up going to the dermatologist for the acne which was frustrating since the last birthcontrol was better at acne (stopped taking Apri d/t breakthrough bleeding ALL THE TIME)

Birth Control	irishIs, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	1/14/2010 9:01:12 PM	I was placed on this medication after having cancerous cells removed from my cervix, as my GYN told me the Depo shot that I was on could cause addtl problems. At that time, I had regular periods(if any), clear skin, and no problems with weight gain. The first 4 months I was on Nortrel I had constant cramps, breast tenderness, and spotting, and my MD told me to give my body a chance to adjust. I have now been on it for almost 2 years(due to ins restrictions) and have 2-3 full periods a MONTH, my face, chest, and back are covered in acne, and I have very large dark spots all over my skin from the hormones. I feel that the only reason this medication has been effective is because I have not been off of my cycle long enough to get pregnant. 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	12/24/2009 2:50:49 AM	I've been using this for about 2 years now, and it's been great.

Birth Control	dlb311, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/10/2009 5:06:45 PM	I have been on this medication for 4 months. I have no side effects, except my breast get sore right before I start my period.  Which is normal with any pill or period I've had in my life.  So far so good.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	teengirl, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	2/17/2009 12:04:12 AM	I used to have 10 day periods on other bc pills, but now they are 3 days. I have few cramps. It is easy for me to remember because i have been taking the pill for 3 years and i am satisfied with the results. I do not have any breast soreness or spotting. If i forget 2 days in a row, however, i tend to get my period.
Endometriosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/22/2009 3:08:25 PM	This pill has made me very ill.  I have cravings from morning until night, gained water weight, my face is breaking out and I can't stay awake!  This has been a very bad experience.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	13-18	12/14/2008 5:00:42 PM	I started taking this medicine, and I am on my fourth pack now. I have had lighter period for only about 2 days, with less cramps. Both of my breast have been sore, but that is understandable. Even when I have missed a pill I have not expirienced any spotting. Overall, I am very satisfied with this birth control.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	9/26/2008 8:58:54 PM	I've been on this particular BC for about a 1 1/2 months. The only real side effect I've experienced is severe soreness in the left breast and what feels like enlarged mammary glands. So for so good I guess.
Painful Periods	Mistitoxo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	12/13/2007 11:38:58 PM	I got sick from it and vomitted.  I missed a pill and started a period with severe cramping and horrible blood clots. 
Other	Deyna79, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/27/2007 10:12:08 PM	I have experienced very frequent upset stomach, sometimes even vomiting especially on the first day taking my pill again after a week off. It makes me feel very bloated, I've gained about 5 pounds. I've also noticed more infections (Beta Strep, yeast, UTI, etc) since taking this pill. I don't know if this is associated with this pill or with the fact I sit down all day at my job, but my left calf is really bothering me - some pain, but mostly it feels like I'm not getting enough blood to my leg. It falls asleep a lot. I feel like I either have a damaged nerve or a clot - I am hoping it's the former, much as that is not good news either.
