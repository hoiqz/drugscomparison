I am currently taking 4mg once daily.  I try to maintain a proper diet; but, my glucose meter levels flucuate between 105 to 155 on the norm. Generally I can expect the higher end readings after drinking a lemonade or soda the night before.  Also, I have friends who are currently taking Metformine in amounts of 1000 to 2000 mg daily.  I do wonder why my dosage is seemingly low compared to them.  I would like some response if possible.  Thank You.

I took 2 mg for months and felt very miserable, my bs did not go down and I did not associate how I was feeling with the drug until my doctor increased the dosage.  I had stomach problems, decreased energy, loss of interest in doing anything.  I forgot to take the Glimepiride one day and felt really great; took it the next and felt awful.  I called my doctor and went off the medication until my appointment next month.  I take Janumet for blood sugar and glimepiride did nothing to lower it as far as I can tell.  I also have high morning readings.

Doc told me to switch to taking it with my usual dosage of 1000 mg metformin in the AM with breakfast - I experienced low blood sugar count of 56 about 4 hours after eating breakfast. I usually can't go under 100. Now the sugar is going too low. Does it work? Yes. Work too well? In my case the answer is probably yes.

I was taking insulin injections to ensure that I would have a good knee surgery recovery.  It started to become noticeable that the insulin was starting to have no effect.  My doc put me on metformin, however, that caused severe stomach pain.  I could not handle even 1/2 of a pill.  He tried Glimperide at 4mg morning and 4mg evening with a meal.  I began to see a lower bs, so he increased it to 6mg twice a day.  I see this is an extreme dose, according to what I am reading here.  My stomach pain is once again flaring up, like an ulcer is developing.  I guess it is time to loose weight.  My stomach is bloated, extended with hard knots.  I am gaining weight.

Now back on Glimepiride 1/2 tablet with breakfast and 1/2 tablet with dinner. Full tablet in A.M. caused hypoglycemia around 11 A.M. Avandaryl caused the same problem about 2 years ago, and was the reason to switch to Glimepiride.  Anyone else experiencing this?

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	chinadoll, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	6/5/2010 7:13:12 AM	Have had type II for about 8 years. Take 1000mg of Metformin twice per day and Januvia at night. Januvia causes some stomach issues in conjunction with certain foods - sugar substitutes so avoid those at night. Just started Glimepiride and had to 1/2 it to avoid low sugars so taking 1 at night and 1 in the morning. So far so good; but, only been taking a few days. It's important to check sugars often to see affects of this drug.

Worked very effectively for first three months. But from fourth month I developed itching  and elevated discolouration of the skin, sour mouth and tongue. I reduced the dosage to 1 mg  and time of dosage to post food hoping to avoid the side effects.  Still after a fortnight  the side effects returned.  I was trying to persist with the medicine due to its effectiveness in controlling Blood sugars levels.  Now I find that I cannot ignore those side effects any more and reluctantly dropping the usage, because even more serious side effects like Liver disfunction etc.  Any suggestions, anybody? Please, post them too my email jmrapaka@sify.com.         Thanks, everybody, in antiicipation.

I am taking other medications unrelated to diabetes. Along with controlled diet, exercise and daily glucose self testing, the medication seems to be working well. I must be very cautious and attentive as I also have lymph node cancer and have had successful surgery twice for bladder tumor removal (both malignant). I have started chemotherapy against the lymph node cancer. My doctors consist of a GP, a urologist and an oncologist. With close scrutiny and communications I will beat the cancer. But, I will continue lifelong with treating diabetes. Glimeperide seems to be working well for me at the present time.

I spent a share of my nights with upset stomach so I went to my doctor and changed to Glimepiride and it has kept my glucose under control. A1c is 6.3. Lost 25 pounds since. Watch what I eat closely &amp; portions. Although I'm outdoors person I could excercise a lot more but I'm generally active and I'm sure that helps. My doctor and dietion are happy with the results so far. I stay away from sweets,candy,sugared soda,beer,bread and ice cream. Use skim milk and diet soda and water in a cocktail and of course more vegies, salads and still like meat.

First my Dr. added Metformin, which helped, but not enough.  The last visit he added glimepiride and my numbers are much better.I am experiencing some weight gain (ugh) and wonder if this new drug might be part of the problem.  My diet has not changed, but my exercise has been a little less.  Any thoughts?

It helps me keep my blood suger in line but the daily exercise is also a factor. I have been on &quot;metformin&quot; and &quot;actos&quot; but this drug is by far the best for me. Actos was the worse causing me shortness of breath, dizziness and sensitive to light.
