Rheumatoid Arthritis	robin0057@aol.com,  Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		7/7/2012 2:45:14 PM	since the oral meds was making me very sick, I was willing to give the injection a try. Once I got over the ease of the needles, it's been the easiest meds I have ever taken. It does not hurt at all,and is is sometimes trouble to get because companys have a shortage of making the drug. I always hve extra,so if they run out I have enough for a few extra months.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Duluthmama, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	2/22/2012 10:44:44 AM	The first few weeks, I had heavy fatigue but this gradually improved after 2-3 months. The med reduced knee swelling and pain - NSAIDs and plaquenil were used previously but had no affect. Was prescribed folic acid 1000mg oral in conjunction with methotrexate on days that I did not take Methotrexate inj. Puzzle:  Continue to have a negative RF/RA test in spite of all other symptoms indicating RA (including an upcoming total knee replacement). The only positive lab test was elevated CPR=all other indications are physical symptoms or seen on xray/MRI. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	christine prince,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female		1/27/2012 12:16:32 PM	Methotrexate has helped my RA but i have a lot of the side effects: nausea vomitting usually for two days after my inj also hair loss, fatigue, and malaise. But after three consecutive blood tests showing elevated liver enzymes my dr wont let me continue. I seem to have trouble with all meds and am AGAIN untreated besides pain meds which are near impossible to get not sure what to try next!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	cadie's mommy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	1	5	Female	25-34	1/15/2012 10:52:04 PM	My 6 year old daughter takes this to help with her juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.  She has been on it for almost 2 years.  She fights at times, which is why it is difficult to use.  Her arthritis has gotten a lot better over time, but recently has been having some side effects.  She gets sick quite a bit afterwards lately and it can last up to 2 days after getting her shot.  The doctor put her on an anti nausea pill to help and so far it seems to be helping.  She had both knees and ankles affected by her arthritis and is down to one knee.  Sometimes though I think her arthritis is better than the side effects from this medication, but we have to do what needs to be done.  I can't blame all the side effects on the methotrexate because she is also on indomethacin and that causes her a lot of heartburn.

With very little results the pain was just a constint thing.  Most days I just wanted to stay in bed I hurt so much.  I talked to my Dr about changing to injectable and she thought it would be a good idea.  I have only been taking it for about a month now and am so happy with the results.  I am stiff in the morning but after a shower I feel great.  I am so happy with the difference.

I still have pain and swelling in my left hand. Very little flare ups, so far. Much of the pain and swelling is gone. I've been on the weekly shots for 5 weeks.
Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	Chuppie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	6/21/2010 12:57:59 PM	I have been on Methotrexate since a year ago. It seemed to be helping and under care of my doctor.  I have developed an inflammed stomach lining and two ulcers due to this drug.  Other meds I am on do not leave me with any side affects.  I have had an ultrasound..am waiting for treatment from the Endoscopy doctor that did the tests.  It will be a type of medicine to heal my stomach.  I have been very sick and vomiting, dry heaves, and am limited to what I can eat.  Please make sure if you have any of these side affects, you inform your doctor immediately.  I am off the Methotrexate for good.  Not a good experience for me.  Thank You.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	robbie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	6/4/2010 5:10:49 PM	I was diagnosed with RA over 12 years ago. I've been injecting methotrexate for several years.  I take ibuprophen and Tramedol for inflammation and pain. I also supplement with folic acid and Vit D. I have my liver function tested on a regular schedule and have been very satisfied with the way my deterioration has slowed almost to a stop. I am very active and healthy! 
Other	Shellyhshell, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	2/4/2010 12:29:37 AM	I have polymyositis and within the first week of diagnosis my Dr started me on metho.  I was taking one shot a week and was on it for about a year and a half.  Why he had e on it for so long is a mystery to because I felt most of the side effects with no sign that the drug was helping.  It is a very hard on your body and almost 5 years later I have yet to get my hair back.

I had no side effects other than PAIN at the injection sites, which lastest about 8 hours.  The pain was somewhat dulled with ice at the injection sites.  Unfortunately, the methotrexate did not work and I needed surgery.  
Psoriasis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	3/22/2009 8:13:52 PM	I have been taking this medication for more than three years and have not had any type of major reaction. I tend to get tired easier and I have developed a sensitivity to eggs and the smell of some plastics(makes me nauseous). I have severe psoriasisdue to extreme indoor and environmentalallergies and had tried everything from creams to uv therapy with no luck. Methotrexate for me has been a blessing.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/25/2008 1:46:05 PM	Was on pills for 2 years and now on injections for almost 1 year.  The usual minor side effects with both pill/injections, but I feel great and have been pain free the entire time I've been on this.  Have had to increase my folic acid due to mouth sores.  Have found that taking Biotin daily really helps with the hair thinning/loss!  Take care all!
