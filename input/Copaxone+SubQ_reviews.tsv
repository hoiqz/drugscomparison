The daily injections are second nature now, but still have site reaction swelling and pain.  Equal to about a bee sting and last for about 5 to 10 minutes.  Icing area after injections helps releave pain.  No side effects except those mentioned above.  Waiting for the day an oral medication is available without serious side effects.  I had to take injection at night due to reaction of Niacine (multi-vitatem) casuing my face to flush.  Now no reactions as I take the pill in the morning and shot at night.

I went off of it for a year and was put on Avonex. I had a horrible experience with the Avonex and welcomed returning to Copaxone. It can be left out of the refrigerator for up to one month. And must be injected in fat, not muscle, which can be painful. The only side effect I have experienced are the indentations or the loss of fatty tissue in areas I have reused over the years. I really like that it does not affect my liver and does not make me feel sick after an injection.

Diagnosed 3 months ago. Side effects include welts, lumps, and itching at injection site. Just started having difficulty emptying my bladder. Don't know if this is related to copaxone. Hope not because this med seems so much safer than the other treatment options. Plus, I love the autoinjector. Keeping my fingers crossed that this works. This episode has improved, but I still can't walk more than 10 minutes a day without my nerves going haywire and causing severe shock sensations. Difficult to cope with this because, up until my episode, I was doing 7-10 miles a day on the elliptical. Frustrated that I cannot work out because I am trying to lose 20 pounds! How long do these episodes last??? It's been like 3 months.

I have never had problems with needles.  Had the rare reaction about 5 times.  Had site reaction and pain with every single shot every day.  I am very slim so I understood that was part of the issue.  Jan 2012 I had a horrible reaction.  The area that I did the shot ended up scabbing over and the tissue all died.  I had to have it cut away - It is 2 mons later and I still have a hole in my thigh - originally it was 3/4 of an inch deep!  Several doctors and all nurses that have been treating this have all said there has never been an infection.  This is 100% due to the injection.  Has ANYONE else had this type of problem?  I am now off the Copaxone.  I really miss the boost it gave my immune system as I was not sick in 6 years even when everyone around me was very ill.

Chose Copaxone because of the lack of side effects such as flu like symptoms, depression, liver function issues. For about a week I had a headache after the shot but that was the only side effect. I take the medication out of the fridge when I leave for work in the morning so that it is room temperature when I take it at night. That is the key for the itching and burning for me. If it's room temperature I have no welts, burning, or itching.I have experience with needles thanks to a year of Lovanox injections twice a day and I hated the Autoject so I just do it myself with no problems.

After researching all the options, I chose Copaxone basically because of the lack of side effects and that it worked with your immune system vs supressing your immune system.  So far, I have no new lesions and am very pleased.  I was very nervous about giving myself a shot everyday, but it is a piece of cake (with the Autoject)!  I get the goose eggs but they go away in a few days, plus I rotate all my injection sites so I don't hit the same site for a week.  I hope that I will be able to stay on this drug as it appears to be working and have experienced very minimal side effects.

Itching starts and continues to it's peak at the 3rd or 4th day.  It continues for 6 days and the itch is not calmed with cortizone cream.  I have applied heat prior, gental pressure after injecting and have applied cold compresses. I am now taking Zertec daily and apply generic preparation plus to the site frequently.This has given me considerably relief but I hate adding more drugs to the mix.  I do need assistance with low libido. Somewhere I came up with a drug called &quot;Filmancerin&quot; but cannot locate this anywhere so I must have the name wrong.  Does anyone have a suggestion?? Help!

It worked great, but ultimately my doc wanted me to try Copaxone, since it seemed that the interferon caused depression for me. I have to say that the ease of use with Copaxone, and the minimal site reactions (in comparison with Beta Seron), for me, has been an improvement. The autoject is really the key - if I experienced a large bump, I adjusted the needle to mimimize the depth of the injection.I have used Copaxone for a year and a half now, and that veil of depression did lift within a couple of months after beginning Copaxone!

It has been easy to use.  Since 2002  I have not been able to manage the symptons of anxiety.  I have found it is best to take this shot in the morning.  The minor irritation at the injection site is also very annoying.  I take St John's Wort...this helps to manage the anxiety.  I use herbal supplements after considering and discussing with my doctor OR pharmacist. Copaxone has been good,  if there was an oral form it would be better.  Do NOT like injections...
Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms Return then Become Less Severe		4	4	4			9/3/2011 11:47:01 PM	I like this much better than betasaron. I hate needles and it took me so long to get the nerve up to inject the betasaron. I use the auto injector with Copaxone. I do not see the needle until I am done injecting and am cutting the needle tip off to dispose. The needle tip has a black cap and the auto injector helps pull the cap off. The best part is I do not feel the needle at all, it does not hurt. The injector has different settings you can adjust based on where you are injecting so only a portion of the very small needle is going in. I do get the bee sting feeling for about 15 minutes but it is very tolerable. I am pleased with Copaxone.

At first, the shots were horrific - horrible welts, shooting pains, they stayed hot/swollen for days. I asked the nurse to come back and she went over manual injections again. Not using the autoject has greatly improved the shots for me. Much less swelling, not as much stinging/burning right after. Unfortunately, my MRI came back with new spots, so my neurologist suggested I change to an interferon. It's very frustrating. I read some of the reviews and for the people that are having trouble with their injections, I just suggest doing it manually and being warm. If I'm not warm and relaxed, the shots are much worse. Some days I don't even feel them go in. They really will improve!

I was started on Novantrone but that really didn't help either. I continued the Copaxone until I lost my cobra health coverage...they claim they never recieved my social security award letter.  I could no longer afford it and not sure if it was helping.  The point that I want to make about the therapy is to forget the heat before injection.  This stuff stings like crazy and for a while.  My solution - ice pack before.  I would numb the injection site with ice pack - towel around ice so no burns - then I never felt the needle or that horrible burn.  Then most of the time I didn't need to ice the area afterward. My only other issue with the tx was all of the calls mainly because if I need you I will call you.  The other main issue with the calls was how they wanted to collect information about any MS symptoms.  I realize this is needed, but could you please ask me if this is a convient time to talk with you about your symptoms.  When you have trouble walking and holding the phone for an extended time it is hard to walk away from ears that you would rather not discuss your symptoms in front of.  So,  if they call realize you may want to ask them from the get go to call later if you have people around you.  Otherwise the service was great no side effedts except itching - buy itch cream and lots of it - and the time to prepare site with ice before and after takes 30 mins is an issue at times.  So bottom line, it will not make you feel bad just the burn at injection and the itching which gets a little better over time.

I had relapses every 8 months until now (better) I modified my diet! I bought the MS RECOVERY DIET by Ann D. Sawyer and Judithe E.Bachrach after my last relapse a little over a yr. ago. I have stayed true to this diet for over a yr. and I lost 30 lbs. feel pretty darn good! I had my annual MRI last month and it showed 1 active/inflamed leasson but doc said no new ones. Doc. wants to change my medication to one of the others, but I think I will stay with copaxone. only side effect sometimes I get a welt a injection site that goes away in hour or so. I use the self injection not autoinjection. I highly suggest the above book, its helped me and it may do you some good as well. Take care of yourselves, cause the Dr. sure a hell aren't going to, they just perscribe meds and say good luck, or treat you when you have a relapse. what good is that. Do yourself a favor and Help yourself, start with diet and whatever activity exercise you can do, it worked for me. I still use copaxone though. Only thing I changed was my diet and exercise. GB

Then at the end of May, I had a relapse. Been to see my doctor twice, have a mri scheduled for next week.  We are now going to start on iv steroids also.  This is going on for four weeks now.  Hard to walk without help.  The Copaxone is the first treatment I have tried.

It worked well then now past few years the company wish to save money by changing how it stored by keeping in warehouse up to 30 days non cool. Pharmacies cool it once they recieve it for patient to pick up and patients are told cool it and leave 5 out for the week. Many of us are having some severe non stop hives. Not a break out this is burning first in area then red raised blotch with non stop itching from dime size to fifty cent piece size. Several from head to toe. Slows down with prednisone but ongoing for weeks into months. Resistant to antihistimines and creams. Company no help or solution for treat for those who react to hiving. They only take vile info numbers. However the viles say keep cool. If you have hiving do not go back on it. If you have allergies use with caution if you develope the severe hiving stop med see doctors and allergist. You may have to stop all meds and will react to any similar ingrediants in foods or other meds. I been hiving for over 3 weeks found MS blog when I typed med and hives found several patients with same attack. Company found a way to cover themselves since the say may cause hives on site and warning but does not specify non stop or contining discomfort. FDA has contact info and forms to fill out if needed. Shared Solutions does not follow up or offer any help. Thought it would be safe to try again after 98. I was wrong.

I've attributed it to a decrease in exerise. I have not talked to anyone that has suggested that the Copaxone could possibily be the culprit of my weight gain. Another effect I have experienced is moderate tenerness near some of the injection sites (mainly stomach area). However, I believe this to be much better than the possibility of what could be without treatment.

On copaxone for one and a half years. All the usual injection site reactions that last at each site for 3 to 4 days. Did gain about 25 lbs but have lost 10 of it so far. MS symptons that got me diagnosed (total loss of vison in one eye), were resolved with the steroid treatment. Still have problems with fatigue, memory and other cognitive problems. Balance, walking is doing ok maby a little better am not as clumsy. Followup MRI showed 2 new notable leisons - Neurologits said it was probily from before being on the copaxone or right after starting. Still not comfortable with the do this for the rest of your life issue. Not enough information out there thats from sources not associated with or directly from the drug company.  Will keep injection till my next MRI.

I was told to F/U with my PCP in 1 wk.to have my INA checked, my PCP ordered a routine metabolic screening, and discovered that my Liver Enzynes are high.I am currently being treated for the blood clots, and my Neurologist has taken me OFF of the COPAXONE.I have NEVER had problems with either of these new symptoms.Make sure you are being monitored for these conditions while using Copaxone. Upon reading the Prescribing Information Sheet that comes with the Copaxone, in section 6-2 with the heading: Postmarketing Experience, Liver Function Abnormality, Liver Damage,cirrhosis of the Liver, and Pulmonary Embolus is listed as being reported under treatment with Copaxone and may or may not have casual relationship to Copaxone, and were reported voluntarily from an unknown number of people.

I was on Avonex for several years.  Never got over the &quot;flu like&quot; symptoms.  I have been on copaxone for three months.  The lumps, and insane itching has got to go.  Today I went back to my Dr. I will be starting the new oral medication &quot;Gilenya&quot;.  This is craziness.  I hope it will be the one.

Make sure the it is room temp. because it does hurt otherwise. The small needle isn't bad but I still apply oral gel on the site I plan to inject. The oral gel turns the prick into a poke if you feel it at all.The location will still be a bit tender after after injection. I personally hate needles but I will be starting and auto-inject soon. But compared to the side effects of the other meds I love this one.Now to find a way to put this formula in pill form. I have heard that people are having problems with their insurance comapanies not wanting to pay for this, but the people who put it out will assist with working with the insurance company.

The Copaxone is not helping with the number of relapses and it is sure not helping to prevent the number of falls I've taken.  I've taken more falls since being on Copaxone than I ever did on my previous disease modifying drugs.

I can have any type of medical procedure done to me but if not for the Autoject I would not be able to inject myself. The side effects are so easy to handle and deal with. The bee sting feeling I only get on my legs and hip / butt area only lasts for approx. 20 min. so I just put an ice pack on it. The bump / swelling no one can see (unless you're wearing a micro mini or you're nude and unless you get hit in that area doesn't hurt. The itching I only experienced on my arms but because of the severity of the itching and swelling (with my dr.s ok) I no longer inject my arms. The abdomen I find is the best. I don't have any side effects when I inject my stomach. I did however experience the &quot;heart-attack&quot; like side effect only once after approx. 5 months of using Copaxone. It occurred about 30 seconds after injecting. My heart started racing like it was going to explode I had shortness of breath and profuse sweating. It felt like what I would imagine a heart - attack would feel like. The intense feeling lasted only approx. 90 seconds max. then dissipated completely within 5 minutes. It hasn't happened since. Overall I am very happy with the results and can't complain about the side effects.

I have been taking it for 7 years and in that time I have had no relapses.  I'm not certain that can be attributed to the drug, however.  I might just have a really mild case of MS.The side effects are really annoying.  The skin at my injection sites was smooth and taught when I started on Copaxone.  Not any more.  I can't inject in my arms because it causes too much pain.  I have welts and bruises all over the remaining injection sites and I itch like crazy (still!).  Oh how I wish there was a way to take this medecine as a weekly injection.  Daily injection is a pain in the patootie.  And there is the little issue of meds on camping trips.  Primitive camping and injected drugs do not mix.Wish I could stop.  Too scared of more damage to my neurons.  I keep jabbing myself with the stuff because it seems to be the lesser of two evils.

I am doing wonderful on it and have only had one minor relapse.  When I was diagnosed in 1997, my entire right side went out!  Steroids returned my right side function.  And I fully believe that the Copaxone has kept the MS symptoms away.  It is so much easier to use now that it comes pre-mixed in the syringe!  I used it back in the day when we had to mix it ourselves.  I only have minor site reactions and I use the Auto-ject.  Without out it, I know I couldn't inject myself.  I can't inject in my arms, way too painful!  Can't do the top of the thighs either.  I use stomach, hips and top of the rear-end!  I love Copaxone! I really hope someday they can make it in pill form!

I have had one reaction, but no big deal.  I find it easiest to inject in my legs and stomach.  Sides are a little harder and show more brusing.  Ive stopped injecting my arms becasue i have little fat and is very painful.  Also, that is where my reaction happened.  Overall, my experience with copaxone is great.  the only problem i have is having to take a shot everyday.  But i have had no relapses or problems other then the 1 reaction!

The injections are better since I stopped using the Autojector. I was getting bruising regularly. Now I never bruise. But the &quot;bee sting&quot;feeling still lasts for at least 30 minutes and I get large lumps that last for 3-4 days.The remedies of hydrocortisone and ice packs don't help with these issues. Overall happy with results.

I had very severe skin reactions at first, because they were telling me to set the injector on 4 or 5 and I had hard knots and when I put it into my arms I had fever in them. Later I just accidently set it on 8 after cleaning it and after that I stopped having the big red knots, but I do not use my arms.I am finding that I am having more and more joint pain. It started in my neck, then went to my shoulders and arms and now I can hardly type for the pain in my wrist. The doctor and shared solutions insist that the skin is the only problem, but my ms comes and goes and even with the copaxone I still have flare ups. I am more and more everyday unable to do my normal activities for the pain I feel.

I do my shot at night after my shower. I notice that there is less burning when your body is warm from the shower.

My MRI shows no new lesions, and no active lesions. Some of the lesions appear smaller. I have very few MS symptoms and most days I forget I have MS. I did have two post-injection reactions in my first year(when med goes straight into bloodstream; pounding heart for five minutes), but they passed quickly. I find that an ice pack pressed on my wrist and neck helped me stay calm while these happened. I look forward to an effective oral med, but am grateful that Copaxone is working so well for me now.

I do want to say one thing which isn't usually addressed here, and I hope it gets posted.  I noticed first of all that copaxone takes a couple of months to build up before you really start feeling better.  When I stopped taking it, my ms felt worse.  It took a couple months back on it again for me to notice it was making a difference.  SO, it does't happen right away I don't think.  It actually seems like to a point, the longer you use it, the better it works.  I have been like that for the past 5 years.  It is starting on the 6th year though and I am starting to slowly feel more symptoms again.  I hope i don't have to switch.  The other thing that is NEVER mentioned that I hope is, is this.  I HAVE ACCIDENTALLY GIVEN MYSELF TWO SHOTS IN A DAY.  Having MS, or just in general, you sometimes get forgetful, esp after taking for so long.  This has happened twice.  The first time I called the copaxone line.  They said it was fine, just don't take the normal shot the next day.  The second time I knew I was ok, and I was.  I also took my shot at the normal time the next day and just kept going.  So,if you accidentally do this, don't worry.  Just don't do it on purpose!  thanks
Other	holmar, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	35-44	12/12/2009 7:12:43 PM	I have been taking copaxone for almost 6 years.  During this time I have only had one exacerbation and it was small.  I think it works great.  There are some downfalls.  The first couple months I lost about half of my hair (YES, it was the copaxone) but then it stopped falling out.  I know this is true because I stopped taking it for about 4 months when my insurance was dropped (I felt much worse btw), and when I restarted it, my hair began falling out again.  Luckily I had a lot of hair  to start with, I have no bald spots, and again after a couple months it stopped.  Also, it left large irreversible dents and most of my shot areas have scar tissue.  I gave up on my legs and arms because it was making me deformed and I had kind of a nice figure, so I just put it in the fatty layer of my buttocks.  This has helped.  I don't get dents there.  Its worth it to me, even if I have to reuse sites, but I do my best not too.  I have had a few reactions, a couple times I turned flush, had severe chest pain and couldn't breath but it went away really quick, just scared me really bad at first, and once I injected it and got chills and felt like I was freezing and achy (like terrible flu with severe chills) all night.  That was miserable.  However, 3 times out of 6 years is not a lot and I shoot myself in the but so I don't get the bumps anymore.  I have had little progression or side effects other then what's mentioned, so I am truly very happy with it.

Unfortunately, my mother ended up with a melanoma, which spread VERY quickly throughout her body.  After having the melanoma and lymph nodes removed in February, a PET scan showed her to not have any other active cancerous areas.  As of August, it has spread to her liver, her back, pelvis and both legs.  While copaxone works rather well, remember, it ACTS as an immuno-suppressant, making you more prone to other, and deadlier disease.

The Copaxone has not resulted in any side effects and the injections are not painful at all, unless I hit a nerve :-).  I have had no new episodes since starting on Copaxone three years ago.  I am very satisfied.

How do we know what we are exactly putting in our bodies? To me its all a scam for TEVA to make money off scaring us into thinking we need it. I have been doing accupunture for 10 years and have had wonderful success-along with all the POSITIVE side effects. We'll have a class action suit before you know it!I have had all the severe side effects of this drug that I or my body wants!

Doesn't take long to become part of daily routine. The main thing is injection site rotation, keeping a record helps.

After a year or so of using Copaxone, I just started to loose my hair. This is devastating!I saw a Dermatologist and he think the Copaxone is responsible.

When I finally began treatment I started using Beta-Seron, which made me sick virtually every time I used it.  After 18 months of no help, my doctor switched me to Copaxone.  I no longer felt ill when I injected myself, but like Beta-Seron, Copaxone had absolutely no effect on the frequency of relapses and did nothing to prevent the quick onset of secondary progressive MS.  So after 6 more months of injections with no relief, my doctor and I decided that I could live a better quality of life without the disease modifying medications.  My depression has lifted and for the last 6 years I have been doing more to help out my wife than while I was on these medications.  Even though the MS has progressed to the point of total disability, I am glad I no longer take anything except what is needed to combat the symptoms of pain and muscle spasms, as well as meds for a few other health problems I have developed over the years.

Never took any medication for it.  My RRMS was pretty steady.  I could feel some slowing down as time went by.  Don't we all.  I would have 2 or 3 relapes a year lasting a couple of weeks.  I lost my daughter in Sept. 2007.  That as you can imagine put so much stress on me and my family.  She had 2 children that we (my husband and I) help care for.  I made the decision to start Copaxone after my relapes increased dramatically.  I don't see much difference.  I have been on it for 13 months.  The first few months I did pretty well.  March 2009 I had a relapse and am stilling recovering 2 months later.  I'm going to continue with it to see if I improve or at least not get worse.  Maybe it's because I've had MS for so long.

I was in relapse when I started the medication, and in the four months since, I have had one relapse.  This is actually a better experience than I had on Rebif when, between April 1, 20008 and December 26, 2008, I relapsed every six to eight weeks.  Copaxone does not make me sick, and I no longer have elevated liver enzymes. However, I did have one bad reaction that involved difficulty breathing, chest pain, extreme lower back pain, and inability to walk for about 20 minutes after one injection.  I experience bruising, hives, redness, and itching after every injection, but I am not yet ready to say this drug is a failure. My only other option would be Tysabri, and since I am steroid dependent for other medical conditions, I am not ready to put myself at the mercy of all that is bad about Tysabri.

Considering my alternatives, the whelps are not a big deal to me.

'04. First months were VERY difficult, as I have long had an intense fear of needles.  (Amazing how quickly one can get over fear when faced with the alternatives!)  Had one outbreak of hives which may have been from Copaxone or Chinese food (go figure).  MRI's show lesions have regressed somewhat, with no new lesions.  Only complaint is that I tend to hit veins when injecting thighs, but that's my fault.  Frustrating that 'they' don't know WHY it works, but I'm awful glad that it does.  Would recommend to new MS patients, and to those looking for an alternative to interferon therapy (potential liver damage scared me away from interferon therapy).

Aug 2006 went on copaxone. Its great,skin indentions are not pretty oh well I can walk and work full time. The hardest thing to except was I am not a super woman now, So I must manage my body and rest when I get tired. Stress gets me fast, so I have to manage by talking to my self alot!! My MRI show no new activity! I am so lucky I can continue to walk. My goal was to be able to climb the stairs at the race tracks agian and I can and I hope to be able to continue to climb stairs with this medication. We travel a lot and now that this medication can be room temp, its so easy! It's a way with my life now, every night around 6:30 it's all about me and my copaxone for 30 min. Shared Solutions and my Dr. are wonderfull. My boss is great too and My hushand is my best supporter. Can't wait for pill form. I wished that everyone could use copaxone.

BEFORE AND AFTER starting Copaxone I've had problems with disabilitating fatigue, short term memory loss, coordination problems, migraines, depression, diminished cognitive thinking skills, partial vision/hearning loss, sensitivity to heat &amp; the strangest dreams I have ever had. I realize the drug does not usually &quot;fix&quot; damage that's already been done. I still have relapses but MOST of the new symptoms that pop-up during the relapses seem to go away when the relapse is done thank Goodness. This may be the Copaxone working to some degree but the day to day problems/symptoms that are always present seem to be worsening. My lesions are not in my spinal cord. They are throughout my brain. This may be the cause of the drug's effectiveness on my body. My private insurance company dropped my coverage one week after diagnosis and my appeal for disability (I was denied because I &quot;have no dependants&quot;). Craziness. Whether it has to do with MS or not, over the last year I've been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism, Hypertension (high blood pressure), Depression, Erectile Dysfunction, hearing/vision problems, Migraines, along with respiratory and blood circulation problems.

I started Copaxone Oct 2007.  My doctor decided on this medication b/c it is the most widely tolerated of all the MS drugs with the least severe side effects.  Since starting the injections I have not had any attacks, the size of my lesions have shrunk, and every now and then I get some mild numbness which usually goes away within a day. In the past month or so I have noticed on my thighs, small dents forming where I do my injections, and I never knew that other people experienced this until reading these reviews (feel a little better now). Will try to stay away from those areas for awhile. I definitely recommend this medication, other than the usual injection-site reactions that everyone experiences, the only inconvenience is having to do it everyday, which in the big picture, is worth it.

I have been on it for 12 years (dx 1997)and have no problems.  Now, occasionally it will feel like a &quot;sweat bee sting&quot; after injecting it but no big deal.  I have had 3 or 4 &quot;chest tightening&quot; reactions but nothing crazy.  The only thing I don't like is the depressions in your arms and legs.  After you take it for a while, you get &quot;dents&quot; in your arms and legs.  I feel great - no &quot;feel bad&quot; side effects.  I take it right before I go to bed.  I strongly recommend this medication!!!!

However I have gone from needing a walker to sometimes moving without a cane. I haven't had any injection site reactions. I manually inject and that may be the reason. Overall this drug seems to be the silver bullet for my MS. I am also taking Baclofen, Lyrica and klonopin.

After about three weeks, I noticed that I wasn't having the very frequent bouts of debilitating fatigue, haven't had double vision or slurred speech at all since starting it, and my gait/balance has improved greatly. told my neuro that, if I had to quantify it, I had about a 30 percent increase in my overall energy. The injection site reactions (burning, itching, long lasting lumps, etc.) started dimishing slowly after about 2 months to where now I can't tell where I injected yesterday. I apply pressure (no rubbing or massaging) to the injection site as I remove the needle and keep the pressure there for about a minute, that seems to work very well for me. The only time the injections seem to bother me (soreness for a day or two) is when I inject the serum deep enough to be, what I would describe as, right on the muscle tissue. Glad to have it..... wouldn't &quot;leave home without it.&quot;

Who knows.  My balance is still pretty wonky and my exercise and activity tolerance is still low - but brain seems to be back to functioning.  I don't use alcohol swabs - I shower in the morning and then inject right after that while skin is warm and clean. This is working better than the alcohol.Shared Solutions is very helpful, and even suggested storing the injection outside the fridge overnight to let it rise completely to room temperature before injecting - am experimenting with that.I inject myself as the autoinjector seems to get mixed reviews but haven't figured out the arms yet.Shared solutions can set you up with travel and other helpful bits of kit.

Rarely do I have tingling, and the site reactions have been minimal, other than bruising. Bump usually gone by morning. I feel very fortunate to have a wonderful doctor who listens to me. Fatigue was becoming an issue, have been taking Amantadine, 100 mg 2 times daily and within weeks I had dramatic results. I usually only take it 2-3 times a week now. I feel I have been blessed with getting my life back to near 80%, will continue Copaxone.

I can say I feel better now then I have in the past several years.  Now that I know I have MS, I take my medicine, rest more, and don't spread myself too thin. It is all about taking care of yourself and having a positive attitude.  Shared Solutions has be wonderful to work with also.

Started with Rebif and it made me very fatigue, stiff joints and depressed. Also, had flu like symptoms some nights. I was always wanting to sleep and some days I had no energy. It made my life harder and I had to cut my hours at work. My Dr. took me off because it made my liver enzymes shoot through the roof. Been on Copaxone since July 2008. Its great, just the itching, swelling and redness. the ice usually helps for a few days. but its given me my life back. before i couldn't feel my legs and feet. now its just tingling and numbing sensations that are tolerable. daily injections are annoying, but at least it doesn't make me exhausted like rebif. i can't wait for the approval of the pill forms and the extinction of injections. God Bless you all, i pray every day for us...:)

The burning after the injection was the worse but I was faithful. The injection site afterwards was like I was bitten by a wasp and just became really itchy. After a month I felt horrible. Went to have the standard bloodwork done and sure enough my liver enzymes were elevated!! Went off and it took 3 months for them to go back to normal. My MRI was great so the drug did it's job however my body couldn't handle it. Listen to your body!!!!

I was having muscule spasms and vision problems.  The only bummer about Copaxone is injecting everyday but to slow down the effects of MS, I will do anything!  October of 2007 the muscle spasms disappeared, everything was great until May 2008 when I started to experience new symptoms leading up to my first full blown relapse. New MRI showed new lesion activity so now my Neuro is switching me to Rebif. I scheduled for the nurse to visit this saturday for my first injection.  I have read all about the nasty side effects of interferons but I will give it a try.

The induration lasts for over a week at each site as does the redness, swelling, itching, etc.  I'm also experiencing stiff neck, excessive fluid retention and general feeling of being unwell.

It took me years to finally accept the idea of shots.  I started with Avonex.  I could not continue with this treatment due to the side effects. I went without meds for a few years.  Then I was put on Copaxone for awhile but the skin site reactions were too hard to deal with.  Then I was switched to Rebif.  I do not respond  well to interferon.   When a fellow coworker pointed out the fact I could not remember anything it was time for a check up.  I was once again put on Copaxone.  That was over two years ago.  Once I started treatment again my recall improved greatly.  My skin site reactions are less now that my husband gives me the shot.  When I was doing the injecting I was pushing on the skin surface too much and that was what was causing those huge red reaction sites that burned for some time.  I just wish that traveling with Copaxone was easier.  Having a packed cooler, getting motel rooms with mini fridges, having to carry a sharps container, keeping a suitable ice pack cold enough to use after the shot was sort of difficult when we were traveling a long distance.  But then again having my memory back, being able to walk without tripping, living life to its fullest doing the above is well worth it.

I had a really hard time starting the injections.  I received the autoject and couldn't bring myself to use it.  Once I started the injections on myself, manually, I found that they weren't so bad.  I do experience bad injection site pain, including a hard lump, for up to 5 hours.  These lumps usually completely disappear the following day.  Shared Solutions, the company that sent my starting kit, has been very helpful with answering my questions, etc.  At first, I was annoyed with how much they called me and asked me questions because I wasn't ready to talk with a complete stranger about my diagnosis.Before starting the copaxone injections, I experieced numbness and tingling, especially on my lower extremities, almost constantly. After being on the copaxone for almost two months, I don't have that annoying sensation.Being a nurse, I highly suggest that anyone who has been diagnosed with MS be proactive about their personal healthcare (unlike myself... starting treatment almost 9 months after diagnosis). Good luck.

I was hesitant to inject everyday and I thought the auto inject would be good but i couldn't always brgin myself to 'push the button' and I started using the syringe to inject myself and it is 100 times better for me. I have had persistent nausea though but I'm not sure if it is due to the drug or anything else.

At some point before I began Copaxone therapy, I couldn't feel my feet, my hands and joints were in constant pain, my skin was numb all the way up to below my ribcage, and even though weight loss was not listed as a symptom of MS, I think because of the fatigue I was having that is associated with it may have been making me so tired that I just didn't have it in me to eat regularly, but rather, just sleep when I could (I could fall asleep standing up on a moving bus). I have only been on Copaxone since May 2008 and the benefits of its use grossly outweigh the discomfort from having to take daily injections. Unfortunately, I did experience a reaction that caused my face to swell and my blood pressure to drop dangerously low. Any other reactions I have had have been minor and/or negligible. I am worried about continuing to take the drug if I have a risk of having another reaction like that one, but if my neurologist feels that it is the best thing for me, then I will have to agree because I can only see myself getting better, even if I'm not cured, with therapy.

With time, it has become much easier; however, I long for something simpler especially when I travel.

I am so lucky to have a best friend give me my shots every day and that makes all the difference. At first had such a hard time especially with my arms but now... The reactions are annoying,the lumps last the full week.With the auto inject we found if you adjust the depth for each sight because the fat is different in each area,the bruises will not be as bad. Within a few weeks I felt my cognitive thought clearing and my strength get better. My balance and muscle fatigue are getting worse but I just had my first follow up MRI and no new lesions and only one active sight so all in all things are great and I will stay on the copaxone. My drug provider just sent me a trial package of copaxone with thinner needles ( it does make a difference)so maybe this will be available to all of us soon. Ask your provider.

I have no new lesions and no excerbations. I don't like the redness, itching and brusing at the injection site but I think that's a small price to pay for the effectiveness.

Within weeks I had the feeling back in my feet, stopped dropping everything I picked up and am able to make it to the bathroom. I wasn't expecting any results since my neurologist felt I &quot;had the brain of a 70-year-old&quot;. I'm not sure if everything is related to MS but I've also stopped having strange dreams where I'm upside down, have less pain while walking and the burning pains in the back of my neck have subsided. I feel the injection site pain (which is generally gone the next day) is well worth it!

I thought that would be it. I continued with the shots w/o any trouble (another 7 mos) but then I started having more bad reactions. The joint pain was increasing each time. I was even screaming out in pain and truly &quot;paralyzed&quot; with the it for at least an hr after the shot. I was at the point of having a bad reaction every 3rd or 4th shot and since it was taken daily, I just couldn't do it &amp; my Neuro wouldn't put me on anything else so I've quit taking it. Has anyone else had excessive reactions to the shots?

Comparing my Jan 08 MRI to my July 2000 MRI showed absolutely no change.  I think my stength and energy level have actually improved.  The drug doens't work for everyone asd I have a friend that feels it hasn't helped him at all.  I would recommend trying it, howver

A LOT OF EAR NOISE NEVER GOES AWAY ALSO A LOT OF PRESSURE FROM INSIDE EAR TO THE OUTSIDE ALMOST LIKE MY EAR DRUMS ARE GOING TO EXPLODE. A HOT SENSATION UNDER MY THIGH AREA. I TAKE SLEEPING PILLS AT NIGHT TO SLEEP AND PROVIGEL DURING THE DAY TO KEEP ME AWAKE. A LOT OF LEG MOVEMENT WHEN I EXERSICE. A LOT OF DIFFICULTY WITH MEMORY SHORT TERM.

I have stopped for a few months at a time a couple of times over the years just because get tired of the whole process, but always go back.

The only problem I have had is the same as most people on Copaxone, the injection site reactions. Sweeling, dents and scar tissue. I went 4 years before I got the Auto-injection kit and it has worked great! Just hate taking a shot everyday. All in all if your Neurologist suggest the drug give it a try as it has worked for me and I am working a full-time job.

Copaxone has been great only one relapse in the last 18 months and it was minor. The site reactions are like minor bee stings which last only 5-10 minutes. It does seem to be the best going right now. 
Other	Lorelei, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	2/29/2008 3:05:33 PM	I have been using Copaxone for 7 years now. It is a miraculous drug for me.  I have only had one exacerbation since starting. Prior to Copaxone, I tried Avonex. Was bed-ridden for 5 days with terrible flu-like side effects. Never tried it again. My only complaint with Copaxone is the lumps it leaves at the injection site. Also, have problems with what I call &quot;pot- holes&quot; or &quot;divits&quot; that it has left in my skin over the years. After discussing with my Neurologist and the Pharmeceutical co., I have changed to ever-other day injections. This was due to running out of sites as the lumps take too long to go away. I am not recommending this dosing schedule to everyone, but it may be worth discussing with your Doctor. God Bless you all.  Positive attitude is EVERYTHING with this disease! Thank you.

Major improvement was seen on my MRI only after four months of use.  The only side effect i've experienced is the injection site reaction of redness, swelling and itching which disappears after 2-3 days. I recommend massaging the injection site 24-48 hours after injection; this really helps with reducing hardening of the skin.
Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms Return then Become Less Severe	PoeticDolor, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	35-44	2/21/2008 6:21:42 AM	I have been on Copaxone for over a year now and regardless of the difficulties I've experienced during injections, this drug simply works great! The bad reactions I have experienced injecting this drug are to be honest, substantially longer than claimed by the drug's maker. 45 minutes of extreme heat and hard muscle spasms followed by 45 minutes of uncontrollable shivering. And while these worse-case reactions are thankfully uncommon events, they ultimately should not become a major concern. After all, the purpose of injecting for me has been NO FLARE-UPS since I've started this drug! Just remember to always rotate your injections loyally and if you do experience difficulty with unacceptably slow injections (which will happen) simply shift to injecting twice on the stomach region - one left and one right of the navel and if needbe, high and low on each of your legs. After a few weeks, you can return to injecting in the sites which were causing you trouble. This fluid shifting may seem troublesome but if you maintain a focused and adaptable injection routine, the benefits can be outstanding! Thanks Teva Neuroscience for at the very least, sucessfully controlling my Multiple Sclerosis!

Of course I get site-reactions and have some scar tissue on the injection sites, but overall this medicine has done it's job for me. In my yearly MRI's, I have had NO new leison's (sp?)

My last exaserbation period has not seemed to fully subside in over a year now. But since using the copaxone for one year now, it seems that my coordination and strength have improved. The biggest problem with the  medication is the injection site tenderness and swelling that sometimes has not reduced sufficiently by the following week when I have cycled back around to that site.
