My third round started at 150 units per day and it got me pregnant. I will definitley be using Follistim when we're ready to try for #2.

Stimulation of Ovarian Follicle	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	10/1/2009 6:41:13 PM	I have PCOS.  I have been through years of trying to have a baby!  First Clomid and IUI Second time Clomid and IUI...Third time Menopur and IVF...Fourth time Follistim and IVF.  Out of everything Follistim has stimulated the most...With just the Menopur I only got 12 eggs (only 6 mature)...With Follistim I got 21 eggs!!!  It was easy to use and I had no side effects (besides completely normal hormonally emotional issues) I would say it was pretty effective but am still waiting on the blood tests for confirmed pregnancy!

Stimulation of Ovarian Follicle	anonymous, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	7/13/2009 1:27:27 PM	I have always had irregular periods and was diagnosed with PCOS. We tried clomid first, two rounds, with no success.  Then we tried Follistim + HCG and I am now pregnant with twins. The hardest thing for me was the injections, it would really help if this was available in pill form.  Other than that there were several blood tests every week to see if my dose needed adjustment and transvaginal ultrasounds (weekly) to make sure the follicles were growing.  I think having a good doctor who will monitor you closely will make a big difference in the success of this treatment.

My only complaint is that it doesn't tell you how much is left of the medicine, so you have to keep track of how much you used, versus how much the vial contained.
