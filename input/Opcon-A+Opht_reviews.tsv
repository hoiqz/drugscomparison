Eye Itching	LindsayJ, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/21/2012 2:57:52 PM	I love this stuff! My allergies are horrendous and these drops are the only thing to give me relief at night. I use them before bed to stop the redness and itchiness I experience. My doctor suggested I store them in the fridge because the cold feeling of the drops will be soothing. He was right! I've never had any issues with side effects (dilation, etc.)
