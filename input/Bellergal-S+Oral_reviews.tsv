Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/2/2008 6:01:41 PM	The drug worked well but like others I was caught unaware when it was discontinued.   What I found out after some research was that the drug can be compounded with a doctors prescription at a good pharmacy.  My insurance will not pay for it so I pay about $50 per month.  Well worth the price. Hope this helps.
