Cold Symptoms	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	11/13/2010 1:43:12 AM	The thing with this medication is to use only when needed. Not for a full course. This is why the doctor prescribes small amounts. I used it on my kids when they were infants in the past I didn't notice any adverse reactions. The benefits outwieghed the potential risk of side effects when I had miserable sick babies in the middle of the night. Everyone is different but their ped has been using this for a long time and she is very against meds for ages under 12 but she was ok with this so it can't be that bad. Always talk to your doctor first besides you will need a prescription.

We are not sure of the damaged it could have done if any, but her new doctors said he should not have prescribed at such a young age.

It controls her cough and let her, at least, sleep 5-6 hours in a row without coughing and then she can rest, which is very important whenever they are sick.  No side effects, she likes the flavor, and I feel I am helping her during this tough time.

However, after his symptoms continued, we took him to Children's Hospital.  The ER doctor took the C-phen from us and told us it never should have been prescribed for him because it is ineffective and has terrible side effects.  Luckily he only had it for a week but we were pissed to find this out.  
Cold Symptoms	California Father, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	5	2	Male	25-34	3/2/2010 11:51:35 PM	Doctor prescribed 1.25ml every six hours for cough.  My daughter is 2 1/2 years old and has bronchitis.  Her coughing fits have caused her to be on the brink of vomiting.  She doesn't seem to be getting worse, although she hasn't improved any with this medicine.  The first night we gave it to her, she was a MONSTER.  It was supposed to make her drowsy, instead it turned her into this loopy, energized zombie that was bent on destroying our house and refused to sit still.  Two days later she doesnt seem to have any side effects.

Then the next night it seem to lose its effectiveness. Some reviews said that it made their kids restless and sick but that didn't happen with mine. It worked ok, he really didn't enjoy the taste but it worked ok in the beginning.

Cold Symptoms	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/19/2009 10:56:49 AM	I'm 26 and have been taking this for 3 days for a cold that I've had for 3 weeks.  This medicine works great although it does have side effects.  I have diarrhea and I feel pretty droggy but I am not coughing and my nose isn't stuffy.  I don't look sick anymore. I would take ask for this again if I get sick.  But like the other reviewers wrote I would not give this to a child.
Cold Symptoms	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	13-18	11/15/2009 11:39:30 PM	I am 18 years old and I went to urgent care on saturday for a really bad cough and the doctor prescribed this...I have the syrup form. It smells good but tastes a little weird. It says to take with food but it makes my stomach hurt so I tried it without food and its even worse!!! and it makes it really hard to sleep at night. I wake up constantly, like every 2-3 hours...and it doesn't feel like its helping! In fact, it feels like my chest hurts more after I take it. I've only been taking it for a couple days so I'll come back in about a week or so to let you know if it gets any better.

Other	krissyp, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	10/20/2009 11:16:47 AM	I am a 26 year old female who was given this medication for the flu. The med did make me drowsy so it was hard to take it in the morning and be productive at work. Along with this med I was advised to take Advil for my fever. My only complaint is that C-Phen made me restless at night after my fever started to break and after reading the other reviews it explains my nightmares. I am still congested so I will be going back to the doctor.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	grenee143, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	9/19/2009 10:30:28 AM	I have been giving this to my 18 month old. It works okay, it does make her a lil drowsy but it does help somewhat and I dont know if the drowsiness is from her catching up on her rest, b/c she cant sleep when she is so congested. I would recommend it. We have used this several times in the past, it works fairly well.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	Zamona, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	3-6	3/30/2009 2:19:06 PM	My son 3yrs old son was prescribed C-Phen for his allergies and had a very bad reaction to it. I had to take my son to the ER twice over the weekend. He started having hallucinations and no one wanted to believe me, so then I looked up his med online and I seen this is one of the side effects. I do not trust this medication to save my life and I wish he was never prescribed it. His ENT is saying it should only stay in his system 2-3 days, so I am keeping my fingers crossed. But I would not advice any child to take this medication and if they do closely monitor them. I am living a nightmare now, my son is claiming to see bugs on the floor  and is walking and acting funny. Really ask your Dr. questions before giving your child this med this stuff is no joke.
Cold Symptoms	Dottie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	12/1/2008 8:00:03 PM	I gave this to my 13 month old.  It made her  really lethargic and tired, but also very restless, so that she couldn't sleep.  She was much more miserable on the medicine than without it. I would not recommend giving this to children.  We were prescribed this at an urgent care, and when we followed up with our pediatrician, he told us to throw it out, that peds don't prescribe this for children under 4.
