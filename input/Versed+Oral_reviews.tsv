Additional Medication for Calming	Silver, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	6/24/2012 8:44:53 PM	Received versed from my D.D.S. prior to oral surgery.  I do remember having to be told, several times, to 'take a deep breath'.   I do not remember anything else.  I do not know what occurred for the next 8 hours.  I do not remember any of my actions.  My husband, thankfully, was with me.
Calming of Pediatric Patient by Administration of Sedative	3-6 Female  (Caregiver) 	4	2	1	Female	3-6	2/10/2012 8:22:51 PM	My four year old was given this medication for an oral procedure. It was somewhat difficult to administer to him (he has special needs which includes a mouth sensitivity where he will not let anyone willingly into his mouth). He did fine once the medicine kicked in, however upon coming out of it experienced extreme agitation, aggression, and rage. He was very violent and it took myself and his grandmother hours of holding him down for it to pass. He was still unable to walk properly for atleast three hours after leaving the dental office (although he was insistent that he could) and we again were forced to physically hold him so he would not injure himself by crashing into walls and the floor. It was a very scary experience for myself as a parent and can only imagine how frustrating and confusing it must have been for him.

Calming of Pediatric Patient by Administration of Sedative	Happy10, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	3-6	8/23/2010 12:59:31 PM	My 5 year old was given Versed oral prior to having some dental work done.  Within 10 minutes she was laying on the floor with unintelligible slurred speech (for 2 hours), loss of bladder control and complete inability to walk, sit, or move at all.  I had to carry her like an infant and support her neck or else she would fall over backward.  She was unable to walk for 4 hours.  Had double vision and told me she couldn't see.  Stomach ache and headache.  We wound up taking her to the ER for several hours while she was observed for further complications and upon checkout we were told not to have her take versed again.  I think the trouble came with the lack of patient education on the part of the providing dentist who simply told me she would be a little loopy and relaxed after taking the medication.  DO your research before taking this one!

Entirely effective, no recollection of procedure. After effect was intermittent memory lapses for about 1-2 hours after &quot;waking up.&quot; However, experienced mild moodiness and feeling a bit &quot;out of it&quot; for 1 week after procedure. Had one incident of significantly more than normal irritation.

My son was given Versed as a sedation agent prior to going into surgery for a deep vein ligation.  I didn't put two and two together for awhile, but six months later, he still has short term memory issues and feels extremely fatigued, little energy which was unlike him, and in what he called a 'fog.'  I took him to an environmental medicine dr. who did a thorough medical history and said he has seen so many similar cases of this after Versed use.  His treatment involved some detoxing to hopefully rid the lingering effects from his system. He is now feeling much better, and unfortunately, he has a condition that will require future surgeries.  However, I now know to ask that Versed not be used.
Calming of Pediatric Patient by Administration of Sedative	woodsykris, 0-2 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	0-2	3/28/2010 7:33:55 AM	My 2-year-old son was given Versed prior to his myringotomy tube placement.  Following the procedure he was very agitated, violent almost to the point of injuring himself.  On the way home he was trying to unbuckle his carseat and kept trying to open the car door.  I will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER let anyone administer this drug to anyone in my family again.  And to think, the local pediatric dentist will no do a procedure without it.  Glad I drove 30 miles to another dentist when my child needed an extraction.
Calming of Pediatric Patient by Administration of Sedative	3-6 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	3-6	11/14/2009 1:12:34 PM	My son who is 5 was getting a very minor broken finger aligned, and was given Versed as means of sedation before they took him to the OR.  He had a complete bad reaction to Versed and was in a complete hyper state of mind yet was not mentally there.  I felt as if my child was autistic.  They had to carry him kicking and screaming to the OR.  After my child awoke from this mild surgery, he went crazy.  He ripped his IV out, he tried ripping his cast off, he wet himself, and he ripped all of his clothes off.  It took 3 nurses and my husband to hold him down to try and calm him down.  I would not recommend this drug to anyone.  Although I was told my son would not remember a thing, I am now scared for life with how horrible this experience was.

It works very well and I didn't remember anything afterward of the procedure.  
Calming of Pediatric Patient by Administration of Sedative	Kristen, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	1	1	Female	3-6	8/30/2009 12:52:40 AM	My daughter was given this to ease her resistence of having a procedure done. She resisted even taking the drug so they had to give it to her nasally which I didn't even know they could do, but it worked. It did make the procedure go easier but as it wore off she fought with us on everything. As much as I hated the after-effects, I think if she were to take this medication before having an IV placed (Because she is very afraid of needles and she will use everything in her to resist it) I would probably have her take it again. She didn't remember anything, even fighting us on taking this medication.

I was daministered Versed at the door of the surgical suite without information about it, or my consent, which I would never have given. I NEVER met the anestheologist, nothing I was told would happen to me happened to me, because I got this drug and cannot remember, and was not told this drug would give me complete and total amnesia. I awoke gasping for sir, with full body shudders that lasted for hours. I had to stay an extra day in the hospital. How can this date-rape drug be given to patients in the United States of America without giving them information on its effects or obtaining their fully informed consent? I had my first colonoscopy in 2006, and when that competent doctor's staff told me the sedation would make me forget, I opted to have the procedure without anesthesia, and did just fine, thank you very much. These guys never gave me a chance or a choice. I was raped once - I remember the endless what-ifs you torture yourself with - what if I had not gone to the club that night? etc. This was the exact same mental &quot;rape&quot; reaction. I keep thinking how I might have averted this horrible experience if-only. How is this allowed???

Calming of Pediatric Patient by Administration of Sedative	0-2 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	0-2	6/5/2008 7:56:12 PM	Versed Oral was used in conjunction with tylenol for my 2 year old daughter just before  her PE Tube Surgery. It was highly effective in calming her, and making the whole experience much easier for her to go through. Used as a pre-anesthetic, Versed allowed her to &quot;block&quot; out the entire procedure.

Sedation with Ability to Respond to Stimulation or Speech	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	9/19/2007 4:27:51 PM	I had an episode with this medication which was administered prior to a needle biopsy.  About 5-10 min after administration I became VERY hot, sweating on my neck, back, etc.  The nurses had to cool me off with wet towels and cloths plus a fan.  The episode lasted about 3-5 minutes during which I was ready to come out of what remaining clothes I had one.  I did not let them give me the IV Versed for the lumpectomy which followed a few days later.  I was worried about what it would do to me.  I have since added this medication to my &quot;allergic&quot; list
