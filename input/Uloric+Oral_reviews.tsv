Take 40 mg daily.My Dr. said to quit taking, but the gout flare started to act up so I am taking the same dose.Anyone out there have the same problem ?

I spent over $1000 and am now in the second worst long term attack of my life. Each attack lasts about 4 months and starts in the summer. The pain is unbareable and to think I wasted over $1000 is very depressing. I am very angry with the makers of this snake oil.

Doc Started me on Allupurinol and I was in the most insane pain for 6 months and felt so tired all the time; hurt all over especially at night when sleeping. Switched to Uloric &quot;Very exspensive&quot; and started feeling better after three months on 40mg. I've been on it now going on three months; very satisfied with Uloric; have more energy and not tired and lothogic with Allupurinol

So far I'm quite happy with the result. I have 2 tophus on my second toe joints of each feet and they seem to reduce in size. I had 2 attacks, one minor (on the toe) and the other quite major at my ankle. I expect such attacks as I knew when uloric starts to dissolve the crystals more uric acid is releasing into the blood. I really hope my gout would disappear after 6 months of treatment. Hope to be able to enjoy again the food (in moderation) which I have been avoiding!!

I used to suffer with frequent gout attacks every 1-2 months. Since I have been on ULORIC, I have experienced fewer gout attacks to the tune of maybe 2 attacks within 12 months. I take it in the morning on an empty stomach with no side effects what so ever. I was switched to ULORIC because allpurinol tore my stomach up and did not agree with me at all. Overall, for me, this has been a game changer for me.

Treatment to Prevent Gout	Bullwinkle Moose, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	2	Male	45-54	3/24/2011 1:03:56 AM	I'm beginning my first perscripton refill of 80 mg Uloric and really haven't observed improvement.  When I began treatment my uric acid level in my blood was around 10 mg/dl and within a week to ten days was just above 7.  This appears to be an improvement but I haven't had an opportunity to follow up with additional blood work.I'm scheduled for blood work to measure uric acid levels and liver and kidney function. However, I've experienced at least four acute flareups over the 3-4 weeks with two in my ankle and one in each index finger.  The flareup in my left index finger was is unique to me in that it migrated from the tip knuckle through the middle and base knuckle and ended at my thumb.  I have never had gout at this location so I attribute the excruciating pain to Uloric.  I also had a flare at my ankle joint that started after an injury.  Incidentially, it seems when ever I injure myself (soccer, basketball, snow removal, etc) I experience a flare up at the joint that's hurt.  Unbelievable.As far as the effectiveness of Uloric, I think it's to early to tell.  Even though I'm experiencing the flare-ups, I think it's a good thing if in the end the uric acid crystals dissolve.By the way, during flares I'm taking prednisone (10 or 20 mg) and within a day the pain and swelling decreased to levels I can manage with pain meds, rest, ice, compression and elevation.  I use prednisone because Colchicine makes me I'll.

For example, after a couple of days of holiday parties this week my UA was at 6.8 (it usually is at ~4.8 on 40mg daily). I took an extra pill for 80mg and my UA tested 12 hours later at 3.9. Love the drug. I give it 4 stars for satisfaction because I have continued joint pain in my hands and feet (not gout) that seems to be triggered by Uloric. It is better than gout but I do plan to cut back dosage if I can lose some weight.

Treatment to Prevent Gout	Dan, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/30/2010 4:22:01 PM	I have been on Uloric 80mg for a little more than 2 years.  Started out on the 40mg which worked a little better than Allopurinol.  I had a high uric acid level (well above 8).  My uric acid level these days is under 5.  The drug helped stabilize my kidney function which was out of control due to the high uric acid levels.  Watch out for certain blood pressure drugs that can cause your uric acid levels to go up.  I had a few mild side effects from the drug, but relief from the chronic pain was well worth it.  I was on Allopurinol before Uloric and did almost nothing to help.  This drug was a life saver.

Treatment to Prevent Gout	tommy snider, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	8/8/2010 8:37:10 PM	Took the medication for two weeks. Passed out at a school graduation and  had to be transported to the hospital in an ambulance.  At first they could not find a pulse. when they finally did they could not find a vein for an IV. My blood was not fluid enough to flow. They ran test for two days too find nothing out of the ordinary wrong. It was the Uloric that did it.  After three days in the hospital and  $3,000.00 out of my pocket I went home and reused to take the Uloric and got better. The FDA needs to evaluate the medications far longer and do more studies before they put them on the market as safe.

Treatment to Prevent Gout	T. Law, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/13/2010 5:19:30 PM	This medication has worked very well for me.  The Doctor strarted me on 40mg for 7 days and then increased the dosage to 80mg for 21 days.  My Doctor said that during the inital month or so I would get some gout flare-ups as the medication lowered the uric acid levels and dissolved the uric acid crystals around my toe joint (where I usually got the flare ups and also where there was significat swelling, tenderness and an enlarged joint).  I did have several flare ups (minor) and for the last week I have not had any attacks and the size of my toe joing has gone down significantly--it is now about 1/4 of the size it was.  I have not had any side affects and am extremely pleased so far.  I have an appointment with the Doctor next week to have blood test to see what my uric acid level is.  I have to believe it is within the normal range.I am concerned about the cost of the medication based on some of the previous comments.  So far I have been taking the samples the Doctor gave me.

Treatment to Prevent Gout	Margaret, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/24/2010 7:55:41 AM	My husband, 62, was prescribed Uloric for gout.  He was the correct weight, fit, watched his diet.  Low blood pressure, his only medical problem apart from the gout was low thyroxine levels which were well under control. He was given Uloric for two weeks and died of a heart attack in his sleep.  On reading the small print I discovered that heart attacks are a side effect of this drug - it maybe a rare side effect and I cannot prove the drug was to blame, but nothing in his background, family or health issues suggested heart problems.  I am sure he would rather had carried on using the pain killers than this.   This is a no star rating.

Treatment to Prevent Gout	Steven, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/18/2010 9:19:16 AM	I have taken Uloric 80mg for almost a year now.  Brought my uric acid levels down to well within the normal range.  The drug works much better than Allopurinol.  I did get some outbreaks of gout while on the drug, but we think that might be due to the gout tophi disolving.  Once the tophi went away, I did not have any further gout outbreaks.  For those of you who have high blood pressure as well, getting the uric acid levels under control also helped in reducing my BP and allowed the BP medications to work better.  One side effect that I believe I have had with this drug is hair loss.  I had a similar reaction to Allopurinol.
Treatment to Prevent Gout	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	2/25/2010 11:35:45 AM	This has worked well for me.  I had continuous gout attacks with Alopurinol.  With Uloric I have had reduction in the size of the joint in my toe where gout had caused growth.  I have also taken colchicine periodically with this to help with slight soreness that you recognize from having past gout experiences.  I take 80mg tablets.  I have had gout from 28 yrs old to 50 and this is my best period in that time.  I have taken it for about 6 to 7 months.  I do not have any stomach problems from Uloric although I did not have any with alopurinol either. I do have tinnitus and it is louder than it was last year.  Not sure if it is increased from this or not. I read that this could be a side effect. My blood pressure has been up and that may be the cause. As you probably know you have to practically treat yourself if you have gout. So this is what has worked for me. Uloric, Colchicine periodically, and stay on a good diet with plenty of water. Good luck.

I keep hoping it will stop as I approach the 7th month.  Additional medication is needed to deal with the attacks.  Most of the attacks are hitting the lower body i.e. ankle or knee. Is there light at the end of the tunnel?

Allopurinol is not even close to providing the same level of capability.  I took 300 mg of Allopurinol which did very little for me and had various side effects.  I have been using 80mg of Uloric since May of 2009.  It has been eliminating Gout Tofi as well.  Took about 6 months to eliminate existing tofi.

Result: no flare up anymore (though I was using allopurinol before). My uric acid level has now been around 4... compared to 16 before I started. Amazing. Only reason for 4* instead of 5 in the &quot;satisfaction category&quot; : it is pricey since it is too new to have generic version for it yet.
Treatment to Prevent Gout	lumber, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	9/23/2009 9:42:11 PM	I was taking allopurinol 300mg daily, and still having to take a SNAID each night because the big toe would throb and I was worried about flares.  I would experience the occassional accute flare up while on allopurinol.  Doc did not like me on the NSAID daily, and when FDA blessed Uloric, on it I went (40mg).  Immediately i noticed that i did not need to take the NSAID anymore (it has been 3 mos now).  Uric acide levels fell, and i no longer live in fear of flare ups.  The only side efect that I have noticed is that during intercourse, and it sometimes takes a bit longer to uh, finish. Whether that is good or bad is a discussion for another board..

From 12.8 to 6.4 in under two months. This caused massive kidney problems, stones and infections. A week in the hospital.

I had tried taking Allpurinol and another older drug (Collchiceen (sp?)) but they both wrecked havoc with my GI system. In short, the cure was as bad as the illness. However, when Uloric came out and my doctor put me on it...I had no more problems. I can't tell that I'm taking the stuff, except that my joint pain has gone away.

She had 3 (2 on her back and 1 on her stomach) large, red, raised, itchy hive-like whelps. She decided to discontinue using the medication until she could inform the physician.
