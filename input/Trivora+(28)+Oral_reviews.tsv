Birth Control	ashbabe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	8/12/2012 12:42:23 AM	I just switched back to a triphasil birth control. I have been on just about every birth control there is. I remembered taking tri-levlen, I think it was, years ago and having no side effects also, weight loss, but they stopped making it, so after numerous types of birth control and horrible side effects, I searched for it again. I found that Tri-levlen was no longer in production but had several generic brands. I read about the different generics and stumbled upon lutera. Rite-Aid tried to give me enpresse, which is a generic, but I stressed that I wanted this drug and would not budge. They order it for me every month now. It is awesome! I feel like me for the first time in years. I have my sex drive back and my appetite is back to normal. Do not let pharmecies try to sell you what you don't want. They still make trivora and not all generics are the same, believe me I have tried them all. This is the only one for me that works.
Acne	arw316, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	7/19/2012 8:12:22 PM	I started Trivora 5 months ago. I have gained 13 lbs, I have mood swings, and severe headaches at least 4 days out of the week. I'm bloated for 2 wks out of the month and start having cramps 2 wks before my period. It did clear up my acne though and I have not gotten pregnant while on it.

Not happy at all. Calling the doctor tomorrow to switch to something else.

UNFORTUNTELY THEY ARE NO LONGER MAKING TRIVORA, AND CHANGING EVERYTHING OVER TO ENPRESSE, I TOOK ENPRESSE FOR 2 MONTHS AND HAD THE WORST MOOD SWINGS EVER, BUT WHEN I TOOK THE TRIVORA I WAS FINE, MY MD NOW CHANGED ME TO TRI SPRINTEC, IDK HOW IT WILL BE BUT WE WILL SEE.
Birth Control	KarenO, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/10/2012 10:54:29 PM	I used Trivora for most of (perhaps) the last five years. I didn't really think about it. It did the trick, preventing pregnancy, moderating periods, and preventing cramps without side effects. Then, I moved and my pharmacist switched me to the generic Enpresse without asking or telling me -- claiming it's no longer manufactured -- and I realized how good I had it. Enpresse resulted in either longer periods or spotting for me, irritability/ increased sensitivity to sounds and otherwise, and generally seems to result in me feeling worse during my period. I've also gained a few additional pounds after having had my weight in the same two-pound range for more than 5 years. Anyway, Trivora was good and I want it back.
Birth Control	Necole , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/8/2012 12:28:07 AM	I have used Trivora for 8 months now. During the first two weeks I experienced some nausea, after that no negative side effects whatsoever. I gained a little weight during the first 2 months, less than 10 lbs. My weight has remained steady since then. My breasts have enlarged from barely a B cup to a full B or even a C. This is a very welcome side effect! Most importantly, I have not become pregnant, and I do have a very active sex life. I have not experienced reduced libido, if anything an increase. My periods come at the same time each month and with much less discomfort. Overall I am extremely pleased with my experience thus far and plan to continue using Trivora.

I loved it, never got pregnant, always knew when my period was coming, and never got cramps, or acne.  The downfall, I am 27 years old and developed blood clots in my lungs from using this birth control.  I spent 8 days in the hospital and was on the worst pain of my life.  I want to say that I loved this perscription, until that.  I was also told that I would have died if I didn't go in.  I would advise not taking this birth control.

I am very unhappy with this drug. I have gained a bit of weight, my periods are significantly heavier, my breasts are swollen and sore all the time, and I have had heavy vaginal discharge since I've been taking trivora.
Other	texasheatwave, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/5/2011 1:48:11 PM	I take bc pills for high testosterone from PCOS. I just had to post my review of this drug.  My GYNO has tried 3 other pills and this one is by far the best!!  She had me on Loestrin Fe 1/20 which caused awful mood swings, breakthrough bleeding and messed with my mental well-being. She then switched me to Loestrin Fe 1.5/30 which again caused the same issues as stated previously. After being on that crap for too long she put me on Low Ovral, but the pharmacy filled it with Low Ogestrel (generic).  I felt okay on this pill, not great, just okay. I would get very moody the week before my period, I always had cramps during week two of the pack.  I never felt great on this pill.  My doctor finally switched me to Trivora and oh my lord I feel fabulous!!  I was hesitant to take it because the reviews have been awful, but I went ahead and started taking it.  I have more energy and I don't feel grumpy all the time.  I tracked any changes according to the phase of the pack and I noticed during phase 2 (the white pills) I got 3 pimples on my face and I was little more sensitive to stupid stuff, but it wasn't anything crazy.  Overall this pill is just fabulous.  Remember ladies, everybody is different so be patient.  I know that's easier sad that done, and lord knows the men in our lives don't totally understand our mood changes, but work with your doctor to get the best pill for you.

Trivora has been amazing! In the 11 months of taking Trivora I've lost over 15 lbs, no breast soreness,and no hair loss! My only complaint is the mood swings but they're controllable, nothing out of the ordinary. HIGHLY RECOMEND TRIVORA! (plus its only $25 a pack, even without insurance)Trivora doesn't help much with acne though.

I get constant headaches, very nauseous, but I was prescribed this medication for Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding because of a hormone imbalance but  it's making the imbalance even worse...I just want the hysterectomy and get it over with! I'm tired of being in pain!!
Birth Control	Raenbow, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	8/20/2011 3:51:18 PM	I have been on Trivora for about 1 and a half years now. I get very bloated right before I get my period. I have at least 1 migraine every month about a week before my period and it has lowered my sex drive dramatically. I hope the new pill I start taking tomorrow reduces the migraines and brings back my sex drive.I don't want to be on Trivora anymore..
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	7/6/2011 9:08:21 PM	I've been taking this medicine for a couple months now to have normal regular periods. It works great for regulating your period but since I've been on the pill I've gained about 5-10 pounds, which is a side effect. Other than the weight gain I've had no problems with the medicine. No nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, which is really nice because I'm very sensitive to most medications.
Birth Control	hma0901, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	5/24/2011 2:45:50 PM	I have been taking Trivora 28s for 5 years and finally have decided to switch. The pill is very effective against pregnancy as I have never had a scare. However, for me this pill cause weight gain (with NO breast size increase) moodiness, a great reduce in my sex drive, I just never thought they were related to my pill! I also experience heavy long periods and terrible cramping, bloating, and PMS related acne outbreaks. This pill is not terrible and clearly I've agreed with it for 5 years but with all the new pill options out there I really want more from my birth control. An okay pill with out ant terrible or scary side effects, I'm just looking for more.

With Yaz I had the following results: extremely sore breast, increase in bra-size, weight gain, swelling and constant bloated feeling, depression and CLEAR SKIN! I am currently on TRIVORA for 3months and at 24.95 a month,I love it! I have no symptoms at all except that I've lost almost 20 pounds and my face is engulfed in acne. I am very happy now and seldomly have mood swings, and best part is that my breasts don't hurt. Problem is, i have acne.  may stick to Trivora for another month to see if it'll help with time. if not, i may try something new

Birth Control	rosieposey, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	2/28/2011 1:00:45 PM	Well, I haven't gotten pregnant... My doctor told me to expect side effects for the first 3 months, which I was expecting anyway. I can tolerate the cramping, that's the least of the problems.  I've gained probably about 15-20 lbs since I started taking Trivora. Even that is alright.. ish. But by far the worst thing is the mood swings.  I absolutely can't believe what this does to me.  I find myself crying over little things that aren't a big deal.  Not just tearing up, but actually sobbing and later I wonder what I was so upset about.  I guess on the positive side it has somewhat cleared up my pimples, and I do like that my periods are shorter and predictable.  Maybe I just got unlucky with the side effects but I'm seriously considering switching to a different pill.
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female		12/16/2010 1:16:48 PM	I have been taking Trivora for about 8 months. Since I've started taking it my weight has fluctuated like crazy when it used to be fairly constant. Also, I've experienced horrible migraines the first two days of my period like clockwork. However, I used to experience very long heavy periods and a lot of cramps, and since taking trivora my periods are down to about 4-5 days and are much lighter. I'll be switching pills to correct the headache problem, but for the most part I was happy with Trivora.

I started taking Trivora after a diagnosis of PCOS. I began loosing weight after about 2 months of starting, and after a little less than a year I weighed 105 pounds and wore a size 00!! It was amazing!! I didn't have to diet or work out- just the fact that my hormones were finally balanced out made me loose weight. The little magic pill that you take and loose weight...I found it!!

I had crazy mood swings and no sex drive. The estrogen content was waaay too high for me. I switched off of it today after almost a year of using it.  I would not recommend this pill to anyone.
Birth Control	behrns89, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		19-24	8/9/2010 10:33:55 AM	Not only do I use Trivora for birth control, but also for the long and extremely heavy periods I used to have, that were accompanied by excruciating cramps. I now have a short and light period with minimal cramps. It has also done wonders against becoming pregnant. Very easy to use, I keep it on my nightstand with a bottle of water and take it every morning before I get out of bed. 
Painful Periods	Not happy with this one..., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	7/31/2010 6:02:36 PM	I have been taking Trivora for 2 weeks now and rapidly experiencing some side effects. Mood swings, Ive been quick on my temper and sad for minor issues. Also, weight issue, gained some weight quick! Not too happy with that as well as feeling sick to my stomach but also a increased appetite the next day which is part of the weight gain while taking this birth control. And one more, yeast infection developed within a few days of starting. So, I do not recommend this birth control at all ALTHOUGH everyones body is different, this is what happened to me, therefore, I will discontinue use. 
Birth Control	BeeBee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	7/30/2010 4:24:16 PM	I have not experienced any major cramps during menstruation or spotting between periods with Trivora. My cycle has become very predictable and shorter since I started this medication. The only downfall is remembering to take the pill everyday when my schedule changes do to vacations or other busy events.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	7/9/2010 8:12:33 PM	Ive been taking this bc for almost 2 years and it has been very effective. I gained a few pounds, however, and I sometimes experience moodiness or get overly emotional.  The worst part is the yeast infections, which occur seemingly every other month. Periods are very regular and light, no cramps.

My doctor switched me to this and in the last four months i think i have lost my mind, i cant eat, everything makes me want to cry, i have to push my self to focus on everything it feels like im in a fog, and not to mention the pain i get when i do start my period. Im talking to my doctor, this pill is not for me.

I have gained at least 2o lbs taking it when I have always had a good metabolism, have severe bloating/water retention for at least 2 wks per mth, extreme mood swings beginning 3rd wk of cycle, low sex drive, and fatigue. I really wasn't sure what was wrong but have determined it is the pill and am never taking it again! Stay away from this drug!
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	6/2/2010 6:47:00 PM	Before taking Trivora, I had 4 day long periods with very severe cramps, heavy bleeding, and mood swings.  I have been on it for 2 months and have experienced continuous mild to moderate cramping, spotting, weight gain, and depression.  My period lasted for a full two weeks, and I'm still spotting even though I don't know how there could possibly be anything else in there. The depression has been the worst thing with a lack of energy, crying all the time, and an overall total lack of control over my emotions.  I'm going to finish this month's pack and will discontinue use if I don't see improvement before then.
Birth Control	Bridget, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/1/2010 2:13:21 AM	Trivora has been a blessing!  Effective, very mild side effects, and good for someone sensitive to other pills. About a year ago I started taking Ortho Tri Cyclen and within days developed a severe allergic reaction.  I had hives on my body for 2 weeks.  I stopped and switched to Trivora after the rash cleared up and have had a wonderful experience since then.  Very little nausea during the first month, and most importantly no allergic reactions!  So if you're sensitive to Ortho, I'd recommend this as an alternative to try!

No weight gain, no mood swings, light periods, no cramping, no headaches &amp; to top it off higher sex drive!

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	4/7/2010 6:34:16 PM	I have been on Trivora-28 for 1 month and 2 weeks.  It is very effective as far as birth control is concerned.  However, in my experience I really don't think it's worth it.  Since day 2 I've been nauseated for at least half of each day.  During the first 2 weeks every month I vomit at least once.  Nasty smells, sights, etc. all cause the same effect at any time of the month.  I've also started experiencing carsickness which has NEVER been a problem for me.  Also, my mind drives me to sudden depression, especially on the days that I'm very sick.  Severe migraines, although I'm not sure if those are associated directly with the pill.  However it has made my period very regular, light, and controlled.  I used to have irregular, painful, heavy periods so it is very effective in that sense too.  It's definitely not the right pill for me, but it seems to work differently for others.

Birth Control	meese, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	13-18	4/3/2010 12:30:22 PM	I've been on Trivora for about a week and have already started to notice incredible emotional ups and downs. For example, yesterday, I was watching a commercial on TV and I just began to cry for no reason.  I've also had some lower abdominal pain, but that may just be attributed to my period. I've noticed that I feel a bit swollen, but this is probably due to water retention, which was listed as a side effect on the information brochure which I received with my pills. I'm planning to stay on this for a couple more months to see if my complaints improve, but if they don't, I will definitely be switching to another pill.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/21/2010 12:15:06 PM	I was on Ortho Tri Cyclene Lo for a year and switched to Tri-Sprintec to save money. After experiencing crazy mood swings and severe depression, I switched to Trivora and it was like night and day.  My mood swings disappeared and I experienced no other side effects from the drug.  I would definitely recommend Trivora, but of course, talk to your doctor since everyone is different!
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/15/2010 11:51:21 AM	I went on Trivora when I had debilitating cramps for the first 2 days of my cycle (no walking, nausea so bad I couldn't keep down water or NSAIDS). I was on Trivora for years before it switched to Triphasil. No problems with either of them for the last 12 years; NO weight gain, acne, hair growth, moodiness, tiredness, etc. No noticeable difference other than the decrease in pain during my cycle, and increase in regular cycles. THEN, the bottom fell out and Triphasil switched to Enpresse. NOT FOR ME!! My body didn't care for the estrogen, and I proceeded to have 5 yeast infections in 4 months!! I hadn't had a yeast infection in over 10 years!!! I did EVERYTHING. Stopped being intimate with my partner, boiled my underwear, threw out all my underwear and purchased new ones, used non-scented laundry detergent, and followed the Candida diet religiously for 5 months, and treated my partner. The ONLY difference was the Enpresse. I cancelled my prescription and, now gun-shy of oral hormones, I got an IUD. So far so GOOD! What a nachtmare. They say it's the same ingredients, but there was no estrogen in my Trivora or Triphasil!! Too much or too little estrogen can result in a yeast infection from what I understand. Enpresse may work for some, I hope it does, but not for me. I'm now starting to finally climb out of my depression and get my life with my partner back on track!

Everyone's body is different and handles medication differently but Trivora definitely works for me!

My periods came like clock work. After 4 years I started to have extreme anxiety and went off the pill because I was told the anxiety was from the hormones. Since then I have tried Lutera which I went off of two months later and now Microgestin.

Birth Control	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/24/2009 6:36:21 PM	I have used Trivora for 18 years and have never had any side effects at all.  It has been great for me.  Everyone's body is different so just because it is great for me doesn't mean it will be great for the next person.  Women have to find what fits their body the best and this definitely did mine.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	7/7/2009 3:01:37 AM	i started this pill maybe a month ago and since ive started my sex drive has completely dropped. as soon as i started i also got a terrible yeast infection. ive gained weight and have become EXTREMELY moody. i was supposed to get my IUD but my doc prescribed me loestrin 24 which causes lighter and shorted periods. therefore i wasnt bleeding heavy enough to get the IUD. im going crazy trying to find something that will work for me until i can get my IUD.

Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	5/14/2009 6:08:40 AM	After being on Ortho TriLo for years, I began having constant breakthrough bleeding, severe breast tenderness, and terrible cramping throughout the month. Two months after starting Trivora, I had none of these symptoms. I am very satisfied with this drug and recommend it to people for the effectiveness and price (the co-pay for Trivora through my insurance is $15 less than Ortho TriLo).

Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		2/16/2009 3:32:09 PM	I have been using this drug non-stop since 1982...yes...that's 27 years!I was originally on Triphasil (brand name same drug) until they discontinued it.I have not experienced any negative side affects. Periods are 4 days &amp; the cramps are pretty weak. It's the perfect low-dose Pill &amp; it has always been popular in the UK, not so much in the US for some reason. I would highly recommend it.

I have not expericed any of the problems that other users have complained about in other reviews I have read. I have a much lighter period and it starts on the same day around the same time every month. I am generally pleased with this product. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	12/29/2008 2:24:03 AM	Yes, this pill has served it's purpose by birth control standards, however, I am a poster child for all the side effects. I've gained a considerable amount of weight, I have acne, I'm bloated constantly, my sex drive is nilch, my breasts are swollen and tender, I have constant discharge and I have severe cramping all month long. The only upside is my period comes like clockwork every month. I am getting off this drug asap!
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	12/20/2008 1:41:10 AM	I switched from Ortho-Trylo to Trivora. For me there wasn't much of a difference. The pills are closely related, but this one is cheaper. I haven't had any cramps, my period is usually only 4 days, and it works for what I use it for. I am extremely satisfied.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	25-34	11/10/2008 5:18:02 PM	I ended up taking Trivora 28 because Triphasil was no longer available; I have been taking it for about 3 years. For the first two years I was enjoying the reliability of the pill. However in the last 6 months, I have had symptoms similar to being pregnant and my husband and I thought we were until suprise I have my period! One time I thought I was miscarrying and ended up going to the hospital! I have lost my sex drive as well. Looking for a new pill b/c don't want the symptoms of pregnancy. I have also had anxiety and depression. 
Birth Control	BeNotUnknown, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	13-18	10/16/2008 12:54:46 PM	I used this Trivora to not get pregnant. It was the first birth control i have ever used and from the very first month i have had mood swings, weight gain, been sick repeatedly, and other things for the last 5 months. Its effective preventing pregnancy but with the side effects its almost not worth it.
Birth Control	nicole, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	9/30/2008 4:32:14 PM	I have been taking trivora for about 2 years now. It has worked as birth control, because I have not become pregnant. However, I hate the side effects. When I first started taking it my hair fell out and I spotted for almost three monthes. I still feel nauseated after taking my pill, I have not changed pils yet due to insurance. I definitly want a new pill.....
Birth Control	dasani, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/25/2008 7:31:00 PM	I have been taking this pill for 4 years now and love it! I am alergic to latex so this pill REALLY works. It made my period lite and very regular. I am a person who suffers from severe lower back pain and extreme cramps. I used to vomit because they would get so intense thay made me sick. Since taking Trivora I have not had any of these problems.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	9/4/2008 12:32:34 PM	I am 25 years old with one child. I started taking Triora almost two years ago after complaining to my doctor that it was hard for me to pay my copays on Ortho TriCyclen. I only have to pay $10 a month and have had no side effects. I hate having to take the pill and forget a lot but I'm scared of the side effects I've heard about from other forms of birth control.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/20/2008 10:33:25 AM	I am very happy with how Trivora has worked for me.  I was previously on Femcon (a monophasic) for about 5 months and it was horrible, had my period for about 2 weeks at a time, and breakthough bleeding in between.  My doctor switched me to Trivora, and I've been on it for about 3 months now and I love it.  No more breakthrough bleeding, my period is shorter (about 4 days) and I know exactly when its going to start.  I still have the mood swings that I did on the other pill, but I can deal with that.  On top of everything else, the pill is effective and it does what its supposed to do.
Birth Control		3	3	1			8/12/2008 8:34:43 PM	I have only been taking Trivora for three weeks and one day. I have noticed considerable changes from major mood swings, to a much lower sex drive, some weight gain and some acne. I am experiencing light bleeding at the beginning of fourth week taking it. I am no longer taking this drug effective after reading the 19 reviews posted.

Other	 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	5	5			7/8/2008 7:48:14 PM	I've been on this pill for 5 years with no problem whatsover. My period always starts on the same day each month and it was very light, lasting 2-4 days. Awesome! I never had cramps, but did have the occassional mood swing. If you take it at the same time each day you shouldn't have any problems!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	7/2/2008 10:05:29 AM	It does what it is supposed to do, but I feel sick a lot still such as headaches and being nauseous. 
Birth Control		5	4	2			5/31/2008 1:04:30 AM	I've been using Trivora for about 6 months now. Sometimes I have a hard time remembering to take it. I have gained a little weight which I was pretty upset about, and it's caused some unpleasant vaginal discharge. It is effective though.
Birth Control		5	5	1			4/29/2008 5:03:49 PM	I have been taking this generic for 1 year.  Recently my period has been coming during the 3rd week of pills and lasting about 10-13 days.  Lots of break through bleeding and ruined underwear!  Other than that, good pill, I didn't get pregnant

Birth Control	Kristin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/28/2008 3:54:23 PM	I've been on Trivora for 7 years. It's significantly decreased my menstral flow &amp; it's nice knowing exactly when I'll begin my period each month. My weight has remained relatively constant. I do get a little moody just before my period, however, I believe that's true for most women. It's also very cost effective. Overall, I am very pleased with this pill.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/4/2008 9:50:05 AM	I have been using Trivora for 5 years.  I think it has lessened my menstrual cramps, but I do still get them.  It has not helped with my moodiness before my period, in fact I think I may be more moody than before taking this pill.  However, it's effective as birth control and is covered under my insurance.

Endometriosis		3	5	1			11/20/2007 3:52:28 PM	I was prescribed this to eleviate period pain by stopping my period all together.  It did no such thing.  In fact, although lighter my period lasted over two weeks!  Did not work for me
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	11/5/2007 12:37:52 AM	My doctor switched me from Triphasil to Trivora 2 years ago. I've been noticeably more irritable, spotting between almost every period, when I'm on my period, I pass a lot of blood clots and never did that on the Triphasil. I'm unhappy with the product and am searching for something different.
