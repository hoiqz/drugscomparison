Calming of Intubated Patient by Administration of Sedative	caregiver, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	4/19/2012 11:02:21 PM	This drug caused extreme sweating, belligerence, extreme anxiety, and the more injections they gave to calm him down, the worse he got until he had a cardiac arrest. 
Anxious	ERIN, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/10/2011 12:26:46 PM	I was in the ER due to extreme abdomen pain from colon and bowels, as I suffer from severe irritable bowel syndrome. I was so badly in pain, that I was hyperventilating and my hands were numbing up and tingling. The ER dr had the nurse give 2 doses of Ativan in my IV, and after about 5 mins or so, I begain to calm down. (IT DOES NOT TAKE PAIN AWAY, BUT JUST CALMS YOU SO THEY CAN SEE HOW MUCH PAIN RELIEF MEDS TO GIVE YOU).  My breathing slowed, and my hands resumed normal feelings. I was then given a dose of Dilaudid for pain.  The fact that they had to do 2 doses is because I was severly freaking out over the pain.  Maybe others require less Ativan, nonetheless, effective enough.   Made me want to go to sleep and had blurred vision as well.
Calming of Intubated Patient by Administration of Sedative	rcarp_smrl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/13/2011 11:59:02 AM	My husband was perscribed this medicine after a serious automobile accident where he was on a ventilator for 7 days. Once the ventilator was removed the doctor continued using this drug. My husband began telling me about his hallucinations, and I realized that whenever he would be injected with the drug in his IV he would begin to hallucinate, become confused and agitated, and forget where he was and why he was in the hospital. After 3 more days he refused the drug. The hallucinations, confusion and agitation went away. This is a serious drug and the side effects should be carefully monitored. Caregivers be aware of the side effects and monitor your loved ones carefully while on this drug. A patient exhibiting hallucinations, severe agitation, confusion and forgetfulness should IMMEDIATELY stop this medicine!

I was having a major panic attack due to a different medication. This put me at ease and I was able to sleep off the anxiety. All in all it worked great for me.

Additional Local Anesthesia	berryj,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		8/5/2009 1:14:13 AM	I feel this drug as any drug reacts differenly with each person.  I recently had a Lower Lumbar puncture and I can not stand needles..I was so relaxed i didnt even know what they where doing!  Which was great for me!!  I did not experience any of the horrible side effects that many of these reviews are stating.  I was diagnosis with pneumonia and now when i really think about it this drug helped calm my breathing also. So once again I feel each person reacts differently to drugs but for me this was a great choice!

My 8 year old had a  servere reaction, he immediatly began to have hallusenations, his eyes began to roll to the back of his head, his pain increased, he saw himself jumping out of the window on the eigth floor, his head was hurting him and his pain caused him to screamed along with the fear his hallusenations caused. Do not let them give you or your child this drug, please.
Calming of Intubated Patient by Administration of Sedative	billsdaughter2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	3	2	Female	45-54	10/22/2008 7:31:09 PM	My 88 year old father was given 2 mg of ativan to calm him to ensure that he could rest and not pull a feeding tube out of his nose. He suffers from vascular (tia's) disease and it took him 4 days before he was responsive again.  Now his age, history of vascular disease and an underlying infection may have very well contributed to his lethargy, however in hindsight I think our family should have discussed another alternative.  It takes the elderly a long time to recover from sedatives especially if there are other complications being treated.

I went to the ER thinking i was going to die. They gave me a shot in my IV and i only remember a few stupid things i asked the nurse. I loved this drug and would get it again if i had that bad of an attack. The only thig is you say really embassing things and can't remember much for about a good 6 hours for me anyway. I would recomend this for panic attacks.

Symptoms from Alcohol Withdrawal	Cherrywood59, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	5/9/2008 8:59:28 PM	This was actually a &quot;heroin&quot; wthdrawl; not alcohol withdrawl symptoms.  It took the person completely out of their misery (flipping, flopping, kicking legs &amp; arms, muscles cramping and balling up, severe pain &amp; agitation).  They were then able to sleep and not destroy their room, possessions, or self because of extreme withdrawls where you don't know what you're doing because you're in such pain and agony and your body is literaly flipping out.  You must have relief for that kind of withdrawls and Ativan seemed to be the drug that gave this person the much-needed relief.
Seizures	Very Outraged ,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		4/27/2008 3:38:36 PM	My sister was given this medicine by some doctors. She has been in a very deep sleep for about 4 hours, and counting.  I believe that it was moreso the doctors fault than the medicine itself, but I really thing this drug should be avoided.  I don't know whats how she is going to be when, if she wakes up.  But the side effects of speech impairment, confusion, anxiety, death, ect. are truely heartbreaking thoughts. This drug should actually be banned.

Then, they used it a SECOND time with the same results.  Either this was never mentioned or WHATEVER, they used it a third time and this third time may very well have caused his deathe.  He could not breathe perhaps because he became so agitated and he had to be resassatated.
