Other	Kim, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/17/2012 10:39:34 AM	I have been treated 3 times over 5 years for a MRSA infection that keeps popping up.  Each time IV Vanco has been used... 3 days in hospital and 2 weeks at home .  Administered over 2 hours (slowly) and no itching, redness or anything.  This drug has been a miricle for me and without a doubt saved my hand and foot....possibly even my life.  It is the &quot;Big Guns&quot;, but all the oral ones failed me and will not clear the infection.

Infection Occurring During or Soon After an Operation	WCP3-2012, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	3-2012	5/30/2012 4:01:09 PM	Started with posterior cervical laminectomy. Developed infection at incision site and had second surgery to clean it out. That recovery more painful than initial surgery. Put me on Vanc initially then switched to ceph? after the debridement. Went home on two weeks of ceph? thru PICC. Six days after PICC removed I was back in hospital with wound drainage. Previous labs (outside Lab Co.) showed MRSA not MSSA but not communicated to hospital staff. Put on Vanc and after four days sent home on 6 weeks IV Vancomycin. I feel like the life is being sucked out of me daily and can hardly function. Could this be the vancomycin??  Incision site healing well, all vitals normal, some pain, but major problems getting to sleep and trying to do anything during the day. Could it be I'm on too much of the Vanc or could it be residual effects of infection?  I'm happy that I'm negative for MRSA but ready to get IV removed. Kinda feel like I've been poisoned!
Infection of a Joint	Happy Camper, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		5/9/2012 3:40:43 PM	I developed a infection of a total knee joint replacement that was done in Oct of 2010. I was put in hospital on an emergency basis because of severe swelling and redness of leg. I was immediately subjected to a ultrasound of leg to verify a blood clot was not present. When this was verified I was taken the next day to surgery where the joint was washed out w/3 gallons of water via laposcopic. I remained in the hospital 3 more days with an IV of Vancomycin. I was sent home and immediately was started on a home admininistered infusion of med twice a day. The dosage was 300 mi every 12 hrs. The med was connected to a &quot;pic line&quot; inserted in my right arm. I have had absolutely no adverse effects of this med. I've had no rashes, no diahrea. No discomfort of any kind. I am told today that I am doing so well that I can cease the IV tomorrow which will mean I have been on the IV twice a day for 40 days and my ability to walk is now about 90% of normal and I expect to be able to start playing golf again in a couple of weeks. I might add that I also was told to take a small container of Greek type Yogurt everyday to combat diarhea and it appeared to have worked.
Skin Infection due to Staphylococcus Aureus Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	5/2/2012 12:35:11 PM	I was given this drug on an IV due to a MRSA infection on my right leg. They kept me overnight on the ER and gave me Vanc on a space of about 2 hrs. I have to say i was given also another 2 oral antibiotics but the mix helped cure the Staph infection.I had no allergic reaction whatsoever.

The eye is better but he is now in KIDNEY FAILURE and DIALYSIS. Never take this especially in hospital when you are getting alot of contrast dyes like CT Scan.  It is toxicity and can wipe out your KIDNEYS.  DANGER. Warning. DO NOT USE EVER&gt;  There are other choices besides this the risk is not worth it.I had to give one star to post but I would give it worst ever rating

Other	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	65-74	3/10/2012 12:16:36 AM	Was treated for unknown infection in knee joint replacement. The replacement knee was  removed, and was in nursing home for 3 months trying to get rid of infection with Vanco injected into port twice a day. I had immediate severe itching of head/burning of eyes.throat/swollen tongue/ringing in ears.itching burning rash over entire body/loss of bladder control and diarrhea. Benedryl did not help.Actually nothing helped all the symptoms I was having. I have been left with colitis which is being treated with Entocort (very expensive). I suspected that I had Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and finally demanded to be taken off this drug. I was told by an excellent Dermatologist that I saved my own life by stopping this treatment. I was very upset that the doctors/nurses in the nursing home did not recognize this as an allergic reaction and continued to inject this into my body. Even the infectious disease specialist did not recognize this and ordered me to continue treatment.I eventually had another artificial knee put in,after suffering and almost losing my life. I try to warn everyone I can, of the symptoms and dangers of this drug...or it can happen with other drugs, as well. This whole horrible episode left me with severe depression, PTS, and other issues.It has been over a year now since this happened, but it will be a lifetime of fear of ever getting into this situation again. The ignorance of the side effects among the professinals who should know better really scares me. I really do believe God was watching over me and I feel blessed to be in as good of shape as I now am, though still left with some issues.

I learned to administer it properly to myself with my sweetheart's  help rather than continue in a skilled nursing facility for once-a-day infusion.  It worked well with no noticeable side effects.

Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	55-64	11/8/2011 9:40:22 PM	I was given this drug thru IV along with 2 other antibiotics for a strep infection in my lungs. This one kept blowing my veins and I had to have new iv sites..although it brought me out of it..once I was home and off sterioids..I broke out with RED MAN'S SYNDROME which had to be treated with more steroids..plus I got a nasty yeast infection that was hard to get rid of.  Weighing it against the alternative of not being cured of the infection..I would take the vanco again..and deal with the aftereffects later..at least I would be alive to do that.  It is a very strong antibiotic!

I was started on Vanco immediately because I was going septic. After my round of Vanco I developed ringing in the ears and severe dizziness. After returning home the dizziness became incapacitating. I was unable to walk, drive or even bathe myself. I later learned from my Dr. that the Vanco had damaged my inner ear and was causing all the dizziness. I now have to endure months of physical therapy to try to strengthen my gait. But at least I am alive. It could have been worse.

This is the second amputation of the great toe (large one).  First amputation was about 10 yrs ago.  I was treated w/IV infususion for about 30 days and then was sent to a infection control spec and he changed dosage and added some other antibiotics.  It responded well to treatment.  The foot was fine for about 10 yrs.  I got new diabetic/ortho shoes and they wore a hole in foot.  Tried wound care and the hole healed.  A second hole developed and Dr recommended removal of the toe (affected bone in metatarsal(sp).  It has been two weeks on vanco and I have had no reaction (picc line).  I am infused twice a day and will continue.  A xray indicated osteo last week however an earlier x ray and nuclear MRI indicated no problem.  Pathological of the removed bone showed no osteo however as stated above it just appeared.  Will update as appropriate.

Time will tell.  I contracted MRSA during spinal surgery and had to go back in to have the infection cleaned out, then 6 weeks of IV Vanco, for 3-4 hours twice a day at the local hospital as an outpatient. It made me very sick, weak, etc - but maybe it was the infection doing that.  Anyway, not fun!

After 3 minutes, I started having an allergic recation. Including red, hot,and swollen upper body and arm where iv was at, breathing troubles, vision problems, heart rate went thru the roof, and the shaking all over. I even told the nurse it was happening and she said it was just because it was new to my system. I sat there for 10 minutes having all these symptoms getting worse finally my husband made a nurse remove it from my arm. I was in the hospital for a week recovering from vanco. All it turns out I had was a major yeast infection; which was made worse. WOULDN'T RECOMMEND FOR ANYBODY. NOT EVEN MY 3 YEAR OLD WHO HAS MRSA SINCE BIRTH.

I was given &quot;vanco&quot; as the cultures did not grow any bacteria. The treatment lasted for 6 weeks until I broke out in &quot;Red Man Syndrome.&quot; The name comes from the very observable fact that it looked like I just got back from 12 hours at the beach. After I cleared up, there were a few other minor complications with skin problems.
Red Lesions of Skin caused by Group A Streptococcus	medicinegirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/26/2011 7:24:46 PM	I was placed on Vancomycin after being diagnosed with Pseudomonas and Strep infection in my left leg. I also developed Cellulitis. I am on Remicade, Methotrexate, and Steroids, so it is VERY hard for me to fight bacteria off. Vancomycin did it in 8 days via IV, then home on Clindamycin and Cipro. I had NO ill effects from using Vanc, and I believe it saved my life. I had some light diarrhea, but it could have been from Clindamycin, which is notorious for that. I would (though I pray I never need it) use Vancomyicn again. I am allergic to Penicillin, Sulfa and E-Mycin. ANYONE can become allergic to any drug at anytime.

Infection of Bone	pfbottoms, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	4/30/2011 4:05:41 PM	I had a severe bone infection in my left index finger and was on Vanc for 6 weeks with a pic line.  Had slight reaction with itching of the head and back which mostly went away after the first 2 weeks. I was always tired and my joints hurt constantly, knees, elbows, shoulders, ankles, even thumb joints.   This condition got worse with extended use to the point where walking was a real chore.  I also experienced chest and head congestion with cough that would not go away. I just got off the meds, so I don't know how long it will take my body to recuperate. Meds helped the infection, and with it only being on it for 6wks, I tolerated the fatigue and aches.  It would have been really hard to be on it for a longer period of time.

Overall it had made me sick the entire time I was on it.  I had to pre-medicate with 50 mg of Benadryl before every dose of Vancomycin(1.5G) in IV infused over 2.5 hours 2x per day.  I had to have a very slow infusion rate because I had Red Man's Syndrome.  Vancomycin ruined my appetite and I lost about 10 pounds that I couldn't afford to lose.  I was exhausted and slept a lot of the time.  My skin tone had gone to a grey color and my eyes had big black rings under them.  48 hours after I went off of this drug I felt 100 times better-- If you are put on this drug and don't feel well please call your doctor immediately.  I am now on nafcillin and feel so much better.  Also make sure your doctors do a culture and grow the staph and test to see which drug will be most effective- I lost 6 1/2 weeks of time and am now losing the disc and the vertebrae involved in the infection are going to fuse limiting my mobility.

Initially it was ok; but then I developed an allergic reaction after 24hrs and was given Benadryl immediately; I was then taken off the Vancomycin the following day. My illness cleared up and I was released from the hospital after 10days. My first week home from the hospital I started to get ringing in my ears; I contacted the Dr. to let him know about this side affect and he told me that yes this is one of the side effects to this medication and it usually happens in children; however most often it usually effects both ears. Since it only affected my left ear I should be very happy I only lost my hearing it could have been my life. I was very upset in his response because this information was not explained to my husband nor our children; if it had been they would have sought out a less invasive medication for treatment. Never the less I can only hear from my right ear due to nerve damage from this medication.

THAT &amp; THE INFECTION CAUSED STAGE 4 KIDNEY DISEASE TO ME. NOT VERY HAPPY! IT ONLY OCCURS IN A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS FROM WHAT I AM BEING TOLD. THE CORRECT DIAGNOSIS IS IGA NEPHROPATHY. NOT VERY HAPPY!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	7/3/2010 2:40:29 AM	I was on this med first at the hospital for 10 days, and then at home through a pic line for 14. The first day on the drug, I had red-mans and so they gave me IV benedril. Worked wonders for me, but being on benedril for a month equates to little functioning. For me, it was more of an error on the doctors part that led me to this drug. When a doctor doesn't know why their prescribed drug isn't clearing up an infection - don't let them just go to the most potent and toxic drug. A good doctor will explore other options.It took me going to the Mayo clinic after 4 weeks of pain and anxiety to heal. They diagnosed me in 15 minutes and I was back at work a week later. The original doctors never even looked at the possibility of a viral infection. And even the most hardcore antibiotic will do nothing for a virus. I don't have any lasting side effects from the drug, but it sounds as though doctors don't use it often for a reason. Skin issues can be hard to diagnose. Just make sure your doctor does a culture for both bacterial/viral infections throughout the course. A secondary infection can show up after the initial tests and if not treated will appear to be a &quot;resistant&quot; bacteria. Obviously just my own case and I am not a doctor. But information is power!

BUT found a wonderful product for people with PICC line. It's a &quot;xerosox&quot; covering which allows you to bathe!!! It's completely waterproof. You can get them at www.xerosox.com and read about it if you think you could use oneOtherwise, this is rough stuff and the treatment is almost worse than the disease but I'm assuming there is a light at the end of the tunnel even though I am still having an itchy red rash a week after cessation of treatment.I wish I had thought to mention my sleeplessness to my doctor so I could have gotten something for that. I know what one reviewer was saying about being like a tightened rubber band!!
Infection of a Joint	Sue, 65-74 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3		65-74	3/31/2010 6:01:15 PM	Medication infused via pic line using an elesticometric (sp?) ball.  This ifusion method was easier than hanging a bag on a hook particularly when infusing myself.  I had many problems with the pic line...I am allergic to most adhesives. My energy level is low; I don't know if it is the medication or the fact that I have had 2 major surgeries (one Nov. 2 and one Feb.17) within 3 1/2 months or that my age is 74 and I don't bounce back as quickly as Ionce did.  My skin feels and looks thin.
Other	tam1966, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/22/2010 3:57:24 PM	I was given this drug while in the hospital emergency room. It was given to me &quot;accidently&quot; as it was actually meant for another patient but we were mixed up and given each others medications.  The nursing staff finally realized their &quot;mistake&quot; and immediately stopped the iv and started me on the antibiotic that i was supposed to been given.  About an hour or so later i was released and sent home but before i could get home i was sicker than i have could ever remember at the time. Severe vomiting and diarreaha over the next 3 days and when we contacted the e/r about it just after arriving home, they seemed unconcerned.  And the worst part about it was that i was to be in surgery just 6 days later. According to what i was told by my surgeon, if I had never been given this drug, i would have healed much quicker from the surgery. But, because i was given it, it took several weeks longer to heal, and lost my job because of having to be out of work for so long.  I now list this drug on my &quot;allergic to&quot; list and will NEVER take it again if i have anything to do with it!

Blood Infection caused by Staphylococcus Bacteria	 Male  (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male		2/10/2010 4:57:15 PM	I was given vancomycin for a staph infection I got after knee surgery. I was put in the hospital and received iv form. After four days of receiving the medicine, my kidneys shut down. The doctors don't tell you that this is the number one side effect of this medicine. Anyway, my kidneys started working after a week of being shut down, but I can't take this anymore or I will have to have a kidney transplant. The reason they take blood everyday is to see if  your kidneys are still working properly. So be careful when taking this medicine cause there can be life long effects.
Infection of Bone	GurlRocky, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	2/6/2010 1:18:39 AM	Because I, like many, start itching at my scalp and it works it's way down to my legs, this is called Red Man Syndrome.  I have been on Vancomycin off and on for over ten years. As long as I can take the 50 ml of IV Benadryl pre and post infust and q tp 6 hours, I do not develop the redness and itching, otherwise I would not be able to take it.
Infection of a Joint	gurlrocky,  Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female		2/6/2010 1:09:51 AM	I have been on IV Vancomycin since 2002 when MRSA showed up in a blood culture.  I does have one downside to it and that is the Red Man Syndrome, where the redness starts at my scalp, then my face and on down to the rest of my body, with severe itching. As long as I receive IV Benadryl pre and post infusion and q 6 hours, it holds the reaction at bay.

I have been fighting this terrible disease for over a year now and I am now scheduled for 90 days of Vancomycin IV pick line to finally, fingers crossed-HOPEFULLY beat it.My symptoms leading up to this decision were severe joint and testicular pain, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Mental and physical instability(felt like I was going crazy and extremely fatigued), although I was fatigued I had a disrupted sleep pattern as well as restless legs and anxiety bouts, blinding migraine-like headaches, Dizzy, nausea, loss of sex drive, and vision and hearing sensitivity amongst other minor symptoms. I really hope the Vanco works and I do not get the &quot;Redman Effect&quot;. What signs should I look for in the case of troublesome effects to me that could be a danger to my health? I want to hear it from someone who has been through it, not just what Web MD has to say based on averages of affects on the whole sum of responses. Thanks and God bless us all. :-)
Infection of a Joint	rockygurl2, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	1/11/2010 7:48:40 PM	I have been on IV Vancomycin for over 12 years due to contractures in my right hand due to total body CRPS/RSD. I have to take IV Benadryl pre and post infusion or I break out with what they call &quot;Red Man Syndrome&quot; and believe me, male or female, when I am first put back on it, I glow bright red all over. Tried taking it with 100 mgs. of oral Benadryl to no avail. Unable to tolerate the Vancomycin.  There are a few bad apples apparently who dump their Vancomycin just to take the IV Benadryl. It does nothing for me except stop the Vancomycin reaction so I can tolerate my doses.  It is a very strong antibiotic, so if you find you are glowing bright red, you might want to ask your doctor if you can be given IV Benadryl pre and post infusion.  I was on it for four monhs, then had hand surgery. The Plastic Hand Surgeon wanted to amputate my right ring knuckle and finger but I said no, and I was glad I did, because after being on the Vancomycin for so long, there was no bacteria found, and he even took a slick of bone, and there was no buggies found. Although I did leave the hospital with a hospital acquired gram negative infection. My new PCP wants to put me on Imipenenem and it has some pretty nasty and possible fatal side effects, and the minute I see &quot;fatal&quot; in a side effect, my internal red flag goes up and I will dig my heels in and say no to it. I am sure Vancomycin may have the words in it as well, but it works well and except for the glowing which is stopped by the IV Benadryl, it knocks out any bug growing in my skin or bone, although, I did learn I have Osteomyelitis in my right hand now and that scares me.

Other	Napoli1986, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	10/25/2009 1:21:03 PM	I was started on vancomycin iv twice daily while in the hospital for steomyelitis.  no problems.  Now I have been on the iv thereapy for almost 4 weeks at home and the problems start. During the iv the itching starts from head to toe and it continues for 2 hrs after iv is done.  Today I had blood drawn - this is done weekly - to determine the vancomycin amount in the blood.  the nusrse said it is possible that the vancomycin may be decreased or discontinued.  Over all the vancomycin has helped alot.  The doctor told me that I will be on antiobiotics for a long time.  The iv therapy will only be for 6 - 8 weeks, after that it will be oral meds,
Bacterial Meningitis caused by Streptococcus	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	10/6/2009 7:24:16 PM	(Unsure the cause of my bacterial meningitis was streptococcus)I was told that I was at a higher risk of contracting meningitis because I'm a college freshman. I read it's spread through saliva/mucus exchange; although neither were a contributing factor in my case, so I still don't know how I got it. Vancomycin worked well for me. It was a last resort because I was allergic to everything else. The only thing I noticed during/after use of this treatment was a feeling of weakness, which passed in less than a week after my release. My doctor informed me that long term use of this drug is harmful. I wish futures patients (hopefully no more with these conditions) the best of luck with this treatment.

No amount of muscle relaxant, anti-inflammatory or pain medication has been effective in alleviating the symptoms, however I can not seem to find this as listed among the side effects - perhaps I am a rare case.  I am also taking Levaquin orally, (Vanco - IV) which may explain the side effect by interaction, however I have not been able to find anything to that effect either.

August 0-9 i developed some pain in my leg and called the doctor that was on call for my surgeon and explained what was happening. he prescribed doxycycline since i am allergic to penecillan,bactrim and sulfas. afterafter 5 days i developed a high fever,chills and nausea.i went to the emergency and they ran test. i had a serious case of septecemia and was held.im diabetic and have a hard time fighting bacteria infections. i was in the hospital for a week and receiving Vanco 4 times every 24 hours by IV along with IV Levaquin.I have to say this is the second time my surgeon has used this medication on me in the hospital and both times it has pretty much saved my life so i really cant complain. i do have a lil hearing problems but IM ALIVE thx God!!
Skin Infection due to Staphylococcus Epidermidis Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	25-34	9/16/2009 7:48:28 AM	I'm a hard needle stick.  The first IV site (in my left wrist) lasted 4 doses before my vein became inflamed. I was able to inject 2 more doses with a warm compress with little pain.  Second site (my right hand) lasted 3 doses and it was unbareable, even with a compress.  My doctor (with coaxing on my part) ordered a PICC line installed.  (I had very few peripheral vein left that the nurses hadn't blown trying to get the IV in.)  I have since had 3 doses with no pain at all!  I have two more doses, with the possibility of continuing another week.Although the PICC line has been wonderful, the invasive nature of the procedure is a concern.  My doctor was hesitant, but listened to my concerns about the pain and the possible inevitability of the line anyway.

I was taken off the drug prior to surgery and given something else so the surgery was delayed because of this. Once i was only allergic to one drug in my life which is penicillin and now I have found out I am alleric to Vancomycin also. Doctors should hav e to tell a patient why they are giving certain drugs before they are given to them.

Infection of a Joint	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	6/28/2009 4:37:02 PM	I was placed on Vancomycin IV for 6 weeks for a serious staph aureus infection in a joint and on the skin.  It was successful in stopping the infection where oral and injected antibiotics had been ineffective. One side effect was a slight itching of my scalp only during the first time it was infused and that occurred only when the infusion rate was increased towards the end of the bag.  I then had a picc line put in and infused the medication myself twice daily for four weeks and once daily for the last 2 weeks.  It was easy to do and I had no problems in using it.  It was mixed for me, ready to use.  I did have blood tests once a week plus once a week checks with my doctor to monitor my body's response to the medication.  These tests showed my body tolerated the medication well and it was successful in killing the infection.  My only real problem was bad diarrhea the whole time I was on the medication, but I do get diarrhea from other antibiotics as well.

I recently went through heart surgery, and Vancomycin was given to me through rapid injection.  I had the severe side effects, which lead to the &quot;Red Man Syndrom&quot;.  The heart surgery was a breeze compared to the reaction I have had from the antibiotic.  I ended up in the ER the next day from the hives and swelling.  Then another doctor's visit with my family doctor to then put me on Steriods.This has not been a very pleasant recovery due to the anibiotic that was given. I was advised that the surgeon should have given the dose through a drip IV 2-3hrs prior to surgery.  Cant get rid of the itching! 
Diabetic with Foot Infection due to a Specific Bacteria	LisaMcEd, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/12/2009 10:24:57 PM	I have been on Vanco for a month and I have at least 2 more weeks to go. The first time after my PIC line was inserted the nurse said she would start the Vanco and that the side effects were Red Man's syndrom and itching, starting at my scalp and then going down from there. They said I would have to have the drip set to 1 1/2 hrs but then they saw that I was getting really red and then POW the itching came on. The nurse slowed the drip down even more and gave me Benedryl 25mg. The itching stopped and the redness went away but about 30 to 45 mins later it started again. The nurse slowed the drip even more. Finally I was able to get all of the Vanco in and I was sent home and I was to give the Vanco once a day at home. About 15 mins before doing the drip I would take a benedryl and that kept the side effects away. After 3 or 4 days I forgot to do my benedryl and I had no side effects and then the Drs. decided to have me do the drip twice a day and I still don't have any side effects. I have figured out that if I give the Vanco at least 2 hrs or more to drip it keeps the side effects awa.

That may have been due to clindamycin, since it has persisted with oral clindamycin follow-up.  No pain at IV site, and no red-man syndrome.  The nurses did inject the vancomycin very slowly, considerably slower than the rate recommended, and diluted it with a huge bag (at least a liter) of normal saline.  Typically it took almost 2 hours to complete, though that did not bother me.  I did have to urinate often, but I think it was due to the all the normal saline they diluted the drug with, plus all the water the nurses were having me drink.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	12/26/2008 11:46:50 AM	Was admitted to local hospital for a ruptured cyst on my right ovary. After being given antibiotics through IV for about 24 hours Doctor decided to try Vancomycin...dont really understand why. But had a severe reaction to it...woke me from a dead sleep. Started as itching on scalp and shoulders and then worked its way down my upper body. After about 10 minutes called in the nurse and she told me I was all red and puffed up...but hadn't gotten up to see for myself. The nurse immediatley removed the Vanco from my IV and gave me a hefty dose of benedril...which of course made me go to sleep. Was still a little puffy the next day....but itching subsided due to benedril.

Vancomycin was the treatment through picc line.  While in the hospital I had 100mg benedryl 3 times daily.  After coming home with infusions 2 times a day developed a severe itchy red rash all over my body. ER gave me steriods and benedryl still waiting for rash to go away.  I will never use this drug again.

Infection Occurring During or Soon After an Operation	mozuri, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/24/2008 1:44:36 AM	I started out needing a hip replacement. Was done sucessfully but had an infection set in. Had to re-enter the hospital again  and remove infection and tissue. Was put on vancomycin and developed &quot;red man syndrome&quot;. Dose was deluted and had no further adverse reaction from the antibiotic. It was a staph infection and the recommended time treatment is 6-8 weeks, depending on the blood analysis taken each week. I did a self administration by picc and found it quite easy to handle. The only side effect I have found is that is seems very hard to fall to sleep. It seems as if I have &quot;restless leg syndrome&quot;, except over my entire body. I was prescribed vallium for sleep and percacet for pain. The vallium did not seem to be effective and was then prescribed Ambien CR to help me sleep. I am hoping this will better the situation. Some of the really noticable side affects is that most of the time, I feel like a rubber band wound up real tight and no one wants to let loose of the propeller,especially when it's time to go to bed. Aside from the infection and the continuous iv of antibiotic, I'd say it was a pretty succcessfull proceedure. The doctor advised me that after 2 or 3 days after stopping the vancomycin, the sleeplessness would no longer be a problem. I hope this has been a helpfull input for those who seek information regarding this.
Infection Occurring During or Soon After an Operation	Bobbi54, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	9/22/2008 10:41:12 PM	This has been a fairly easy treatment period, after the pick-line was inserted.  It's an easy proceedure to hook the iv up and disconnect.  I've been happy with the fact that it's portable, and easy to take with me when I go somewhere.
Infection Occurring During or Soon After an Operation	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	35-44	9/9/2008 12:02:04 PM	I'm currently taking this medication via a PICC line (IV) every 12 hours for treatment of a resistant staph infection I received either during or shortly after my hip surgery.  I have no side effects besides having no appetite and being drowsy but unable to sleep.  It's a bit maddening.  They are still unsure if the infection has gone deep within my bone or is a surface infection, but it looks like I am on it for at least 6 weeks.  I am glad that I am able to administer this drug at home, and by myself and that I am not stuck at the hospital for a lengthy period of time to be given the medication as I would have been 15 years ago.  The medicine comes in a pressurized ball and it slowly deflates over 2 hours, minimizing almost all side effects.  This was the last resort antibiotic given to me at the hospital while I was there (and very, very ill while trying to combat this horrible staph infection).  I am glad for the rainforest and Borneo and the fact that we do have this medication - now doctors need to stop using it unless absolutely necessary so staph doesn't wipe out the entire population of earth.

Bacterial Infection of Heart Valve	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	7/21/2008 7:32:39 PM	My husband is on this medicine along with 2 other antibiotics. Hopefully the long run will outweight the side affects he is feeling now. He feels &quot;drunk&quot; and like he is on sleeping pills. he is dizzy most of the time and very very tired. He will be off of it in 10 more days. He is also on gentamicin which generally isnt used together so maybe that is what is causing this?
Infection Occurring During or Soon After an Operation	Joseph, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	25-34	7/9/2008 11:14:05 AM	I had back surgery and two weeks afterwards I was reamitted back into the hospital because I had gotten infected.  I had to got back into surgery so they could open me back up and clean as much out of me as they could.  After surgery I was placed on vancomycin IV therapy.  They installed a PICC line into my arm and sent me home for me to continue the IV drug therapy.  This drug makes me very nausated so they doctor presribed me anti-nausea medicine to take just before I start the IV, and that helped.  Also drink plenty of fluids when taking this medicine to combat the dehydration, constipation, fatigue, and cold/hot flashes.

When they started the IV I got the feeling that fire ants were on my scalp. I had an uncontrollable urge to scratch my scalp. Even when they slowed down the rate of the IV, the severe ichyness continued. I had to be given Benedryl to combat that. I never want anything to do with this med again!

Skin Infection due to Staphylococcus Epidermidis Bacteria	JOSHSKORN, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/27/2007 9:01:26 PM	When I first had this medication, I had 'Red Man's Syndrome.'  A couple years later, I had a cellulitis infection and the ER doctor told me that I must have vancomycin.  I told him my previous experience with it and he told me that it's pretty common to happen.  However, infused over 4 hours, the &quot;Red Man's Syndrome&quot; doesn't occur.  I'm fighting cellulitis for the second time right now and unlike the first time, 3 weeks didn't kill off the infection, but drastically reduced the redness I was having.  This time, the infection is in the same location but I think I'm having to fight with scar tissue, too which as slowed it down.  My doctor switched the medication and it hasn't helped one bit.  I'm going to beg that I go back on the vancomycin.  I also had a PICC line.
Skin Infection due to Staphylococcus Epidermidis Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	11/16/2007 12:38:00 AM	I was admitted into the hospital with celluitis (a type of staph)on my hand.  I had an IV drip which caused the Red Man Syndrome.  Once the IV was removed the syndrome went away.  I had enough drip in my system to combat the infection.  Overall the drug did not have any other side effects, and was the right cure for my infection.  I'm grateful to my doctor for the correct diagnois.
Skin Infection due to Staphylococcus Epidermidis Bacteria	jkdoan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	55-64	9/23/2007 1:05:15 PM	The vancomycin I took was used to cure a cellulitis infection. I have had 3 cellulitis infections in the last 5 years. Each time I was given vancomycin intravenously (picc line) and the infection cleared up. The only problem was that having the picc line in my arm and having to keep it dry limited me in doing certain things that I usually do daily. I guess I would say it was inconvenient, but it did the job!
