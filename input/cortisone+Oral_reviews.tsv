The only side effect I had after the shot for the first 3 to 4 days was listlessness and fatigue . I was always sleeping as if I had taken a sleeping pill . Now I feel fine , very alert and can't wait to take a walk. I recommend this stuff for knee pain If you don't want your knee replaced or tired of popping pain pills or using ice packs all the time.

Eczema	goducks, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/17/2010 4:53:19 AM	I've taken oral cortisone series twice (prednisone) for severe eczema. The effects are extremely rapid. It's unfortunate that one can't take it often. Side effect both times were euphoria in beginning, depression for a few days when cycle is complete and a backlash rash. It was like clockwork. All were informed by my dr so I was not taken by surprise.

More inflammation was noted and a cortisone injection was administered into each eye.  The injections were 4 days ago and eyelid areas still very bruised and swollen from ointment given before injection; via swab.   The sarcoidosis prevented the numbing drops and ointment from any &quot;numbness&quot;.  Extremely painful!!   Am hoping my &quot;round&quot; face will go down and the eyes will react to injections.  Will return 2 wks for re-exam.  I am also being treated for glaucoma.  Have stints in both eyes and b.i.d. drops (Cosopt and Pred Forte) and post op cataract surgeries in Sept. 09.

High cholestrol, high blood pressure, nausea, fluid retention &amp; calcium &amp; vit D deficiency has been pre-empted by Dr. and medication given to counter these. Not easy but it is working and am now in remission and easing off cortisol 5mg a week.

It has not helped with my big toe, but this is probably due to bone spurs. The only problem is taking it 4x daily and forgetting it, even with written schedule.
