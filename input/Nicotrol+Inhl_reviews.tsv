Stop Smoking	Shannon , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/31/2011 9:49:32 PM	I am a pack a day smoker for over 20 years and have tried many times to quit. This is the only thing I've found that will give me the hand to mouth and nicotine in the same treatment. It curbs the withdrawl and the psycology of it is that I can still have a &quot;smoke&quot; without having a cigarette. The burning is uncomfortable, but that is making me NOT want to smoke. And you can't hold it comfortably like a cigarette so I'm changing that habit too. I am elated to have found something that will help me to finally lose this habit. I haven't had a single cigarette since I started this inhaler and I'm using far less than I smoked in cigarettes.

I have not used this product in over a month and the buring sensation is still strong. I only used 1 cartridge and that was enough for me. My food tastes bad, as does everything else I put in my mouth,even mints,toothpaste, gum, toothpicks--anything!!Not sure if the buring will ever go away-but certainly hope so!!Smoking didn't hurt me as much as this inhaler. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. And I can't find out if this will go away or not either, or if I've hurt myself by trying to help myself!!

However, having an addiction problem to other substances, this may not have been the right path for him.  He is addicted to Nicotrol and has used it for 8 1/2 yrs.  Not sure why his doctor is still prescribing it.  He has attempted twice to quit using this product, but has failed.  There is a distinct, chemical odor from his skin which I believe is from Nicotrol use.

How do I stop the burning in the back of my throat and feel more satisfied with using the product physiologically like smoking did. I am determined to quit smoking but there is a lot missing. 
Nicotine Addiction	Lorraine, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/5/2010 1:59:56 PM	My mother made me promise her to quit smoking on her deathbed, and I told her I would when I finished the cigarettes I had at home (6 cartons).  At my mom's wake, I asked my good friend, who's a nurse, how was I going to keep that promise---I started smoking with her when I was 12 years old, and now I was 58, and had been smoking 46 years.  She recommended the &quot;Nicotrol Inhaler&quot; prescription' I got the prescription from my doctor, and stopped smoking on the morning that I smoked my very last cigarette.  I am within walking distance of a store; and, I was sure that I would buy a pack before the day was over, but I didn't.  I'd tried patches, gum, and pills---none of them worked!I would recommend the inhaler method to anyone that wants to quit and can't.  Believe me, my whole life centered around when I was going to have a cigarette, I stopped smoking in my house because I caused my cat to get asthma, I smoked on my back porch in winter weather of 32 degrees or less in New England while reading the morning paper and drinking coffee, the cigarette cough was most irritating &amp; embarrassing at weddings, in church, or at the movies or a restaurant.I truly don't understand why there is not more publicity about this method of quitting smoking.  It was the best for me!!!

Stop Smoking	Patsy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/31/2009 8:44:19 AM	I have smoked at least 1 pack per day for over 30 years and have tried to quit several times with no suceess until I discovered the Nicotrol Inhaler.  I have not had any side effects. I have not smoked for 7 1/2 months so far.  I did not smoke as many cartridges as recommended and it still worked for me.  The oral fixation was very difficult on previous quit attempts, so this product was very helpful - It gave me something to do with my hands.  Great product and I have recommended to many others. GOOD LUCK!

The want is still there and will be  for a  while.  It's  been  just over 2 weeks but it just will take some time and will power to do this. I know I can for my health.
Stop Smoking	No Smoke, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	4/6/2009 3:36:15 AM	I used the Nicotrol Inhaler in early 1999 to assist with my effort to quit smoking.  I only had to use one full Rx of 42 pellets and half of a 2nd Rx, and I haven't had even one cigarette in over 10 years now, after 47 years of smoking.  I developed moderate COPD in the past decade from my past smoking, but I'm certain the Nicotrol Inhaler has added years to my life, and the quality of my life as a nonsmoker so far is greatly enhanced.
Stop Smoking	Ange, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/11/2008 10:04:47 AM	It only took me 2 months to quit, although I sucked on empty plastic stubs for another month or so.  After 22 smoke-free months, I absently &quot;bummed&quot; a cigarette while at a casino (Sin City, indeed!).  Smoked for about a year.  Started back on the medicated inhaler about a week ago and expect to be successful - and more careful in the future!
