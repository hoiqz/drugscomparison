Other	allygator73, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	9/24/2012 11:24:34 AM	I was prescribed the dose pack to help with inflammation after my endodontist overfilled my root canal. The overfill is sitting on the nerve and causing numbness in my chin, teeth, and lip. I have noticed some improvement in the numbness, but I do not ever want to take this medication again due to the side effects. On day 3, I suffered a panic attack while driving at night with my two small children, brought on because I started feeling dizzy and was experiencing trouble with my vision. I completed the dose pack and am on the first day without it, yet I am still experiencing side effects: chest tightness, heart flutters, and anxiety.

This is one of those medications with multiple uses that an advertisement on television should take more time telling about the side effects it causes than what the medication can actually do.

Bronchitis	snp, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/6/2011 10:49:24 PM	My doctor prescribed this drug for lung congestion due to a severe cold. After taking the med for about 1 day I felt soooo much better! I commented to my coworkers that I hadn't felt so bodily pain free in about 2 years. I was unaware at the time that Methylprednisolone was also helpful in easing joint pain around elbows, wrists and generally the entire body. I have fibromyalgia and had not yet gone on the webmd website to research the medication. Not only did it clear the congestion around the lungs but it made me feel better than the meds I am currently using for fibromyalgia. The only drawback to the drug which I have read in user comments was hot flashes which came and went. Truthfully though, to be pain free for a few days was very well worth it! Will be asking my doctor if I can perhaps get off the current meds I take and go on some kind of Medrol.

My Rheumatologist added 2 mg. twice a day in addition to my other meds, and I was very pleased that even at that low dose, I am experiencing less pain.  So far I am very happy with the results.

Both knees felt almost like new on my second day of taking this medication and shoulder soreness disappeared completely.  Also, my three patches of psoriasis dried up almost completely, and to top it off, I had my best weight workout in years...able to do two sets of 20+ pull ups, which was about a 20% improvement.  It does ramp up the blood pressure and metabolism quite profoundly, so a good idea to engage in intensive exercise of some kind to take the edge off. Truly a wonder drug in the short term.

Doc told me to stop taking it and I actually felt better until the middle of the night.  Woke up felt like my heart had stopped and lungs were not functioning properly. jumped out of bed took one breath and went into what is called an SVT rhythm which I sustained for an extended period thanks to the medrol already in my system.  Had serious after effects from that alone, for weeks! Cardiac labs all elevated and am now with permanent arrythmia problems of many types including SVT and on cardiac meds indefinitely. I was 46 years old when that happened.  Gave the info to the manufacturer and they did nothing about giving me info back, like numbers of others with the same problem.  No help whatsoever!  Shame on the those who monitor this business!  I Never had any of these symptoms before taking this med.

The slight reduction in pain was more than likely due to reduction in activity than the medication itself.  I resumed normal and the pain is still present and intensity of the pain coincides with intensity of the work.

My posiatrist prescribed this for imflammation but I had no idea it would take me for the ride that I am on. About 3 weeks after medrol pack, I experienced STEROID INDUCED PSYCHOSIS. I voluntarily elected to be in an outpatient program to ward off paranoia, anxiety, worry that were over the top. I thought the FBI was following me. I thought my husband was trying to divorce me or having an affair. This could happen to anyone taking this drug as I had no pre-existing disorder. Scary. I am still worried I may continue to cycle with paranoia until the medrol is out of my system.

Other	Justme, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/1/2010 1:36:55 AM	This is the worst medication I have ever been on! A lung specialist prescribed it because he didn't know why I had been coughing for over 4 months and thought it might help.  He did not warn me about the awful side effects.  My face swelled up like a cabbage patch doll, my ankles swelled up so bad, I had to buy new shoes.  It took me 3 months to get off the pills (I went through withdrawls) and the side effects have gotten worse!  Now on top of everything else (I still have all the original side effects), I have been getting such bad leg cramps at night that I can hardly walk(yes, they stayed with me during the day, going on 8 days), I broke out in a rash all over my legs, arms and stomach and I bruise so easily, it looks like I have been beaten.  If my doctor had warned me about any of this in the beginning, I would have suffered with the cough.  This is not a good pill in my opinion.

I have been off and on the Medrol 4mg per day for over 5 years. I also have DJD in all joints including bulging disc in my back and neck. None of the other arthritis medicines have helped much- including Plaquenil (over a year) and every other arthritis medicine available. Celebrex caused stomach ulcers (first drug prescribed). I know Medrol has a lot of side effects and I am able to come off for a time, but I prefer taking it because I have some quality of life. I take an over the counter &quot;sleep aid&quot; from Walmart with the blessing of my Dr. and have no sleeping problems. I am almost 65 years old and have had this severe form of arthritis of my hands since age 40. I know what works for me.

My issue is in my shoulder.Scared, I waited 2 weeks to take this, however after another sleepless night, I started this morning.  I'm on the 6 day pack.  2 hours after taking the FIRST dose, my pain is diminished so much, I'm astonished!I hope this continues...side effects, even if I can't sleep are worth relieving the pain.  It's been a long 6 months.  Will update in a week.  I'm on a 6 week therapy for the shoulder, Medrol is part 1.

As prescribed, I lowered the dose after one week and for three weeks did not take the pill. The pain returned and I also experienced pain in my shoulder, so returned to taking it the second time, with the same good results. I have not seen this anywhere on the web, but Medrol causes me to lose my appetite and weight while taking it, the opposite of what the contraindications suggest. Go figure. Hooray Medrol!

When I went to bed I couldnt sleep had chest pains with abnormal heart beat shortness of breath and abdominal discomfort. I would never take this again its not worth the scary side effects I had. Ive thought about going to ER.

Muscle Pain and Stiffness in Shoulder, Neck and Pelvis	john, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	65-74	5/29/2009 12:00:33 PM	Taking Medrol for post operation shoulder pain apparently related to severe inflammation. Helped almost immediately in reducing  but not eliminating pain. I can hardly sleep however in spite of taking Ambien. Was not warned of that and it is hard to discern that side effect in the literature accompanying the drug. It would be nice if they were written for the lay person as they are the ones who such instructions are intended for???
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Marme, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/20/2009 3:17:20 AM	I had inflammation of the finger joints on both hands, wrists, shoulders, bursa sacs on elbows, hips and knees.  My pain was 24/7, movement was limited &amp; painful.  Stairs were impossible.  My treatment began with (2) 4 mg. tablets twice daily for 5 days, then 2 &amp; 1 for 5 days, and finally 4 mg. taken twice daily.  After 3 days I was basically pain free and movement has returned to normal.  I have experienced no side effects after 1 month of treatment.  This is a miracle drug! 
Eye Disorder	rick, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	5/19/2009 5:54:34 PM	I have used this medicine when my cornea transplant begins to reject for the last 4 years.  It causes E.D. and I feel terrible while I am taking it and several days later.  I have also gained 50 pounds over the last 3 years.  My doctor says the benefit is greater, but I do not like it at all.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	4/14/2009 11:41:07 AM	Works great for me, but in somewhat higher doses (16mg and up), but my case was pretty severe.  Don't stop taking it...they're right...inflammation comes back in a hurry if you all the sudden stop taking it.  Otherwise, it's great.

Bronchitis	Bronch Buster, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	55-64	3/23/2009 5:27:50 PM	In 1982 I had been taking Predisone for bronchits for several years, I began Medrol because prednisone wasn't controlling the bronchial problems well. I am diagnosed with COPD. Moderate then, moderate - severe now. I have been on O2 now for 3 years. I still choose to work 3 hrs. a day. Without the Medrol I doubt I'd be alive now. The side effects are troublesome, but the alternative is worse for me. There is edema and low immune factors that are also treated now, likely related to the steroids. Still worth the toll it has taken. Learning how to boost when necessary and then judge day by day how fast to reduce the dose came easily when I was younger. Now, at 62, I find that the drug seems to stay in my system longer. I am able to skip a day several times a month. All my oral medications clear more slowly now and my blood pressure med (Prinivil) is now at a 2.5 mg dose every other day. I record my medrol dose daily, and monitor my BP twice a day. I also have a spectrum of 3 antibiotics available at home for use when I get a flare-up of the bronchitis.

I HAVE SPENT MY DAYS SINCE STARTING THIS MEDICINE BEING ANXIOUS AND NOT SLEEPING (THREE TO FOUR HOURS A DAY FOR THREE DAYS). MEDROL IS COMEWHAT HELPFUL IF YOU CAN TOLERATE THE ANXIETY AND SLEEPLESSNESS.

Muscle Pain and Stiffness in Shoulder, Neck and Pelvis	Citystar, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	65-74	11/1/2008 1:32:10 PM	I've had two back surgeries. Stenosis of the spine then a vertabrea slipped out of line. For two years I have been in 24 hour pain.I was given a dose pack and the 2nd day I felt 95% better. Hardly any pain. I have had no side effects and really wish it had a more healing powers so that one would not have to stay on it.  It has helped me so much.  The clients that complained of problems must remember that all medicine cannot be tolerated by everyone. Because it does not work on one person does not mean it will not help someone else. It is a very good medicine and that is the reason that advertisers ask you to ask your doctor is this particular medicine right for you. It is very good for me, for which I give thanks. I just wish I could continue on it or, as I said, wish it had MORE lost lasing healing effect along with the pain relief it gives so that after you've been on it for a limited time you could come off it and the problem would be healed or mostly healed.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	10/27/2008 12:11:59 PM	I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and my hand and feet were very inflamed and the pain was so bad I would cry everyday. I hated waking up in the morning because my ankles and feet hurt to walk and my hands were so stiff and painful I could not even put toothpaste on my toothbrush or get ready without pain.My shoulder was also hurting to where I could not pick up my arm wtihout pain so I was prescribed physical therapy but that has improved also. I felt so much better after the first day of taking the 4mg dosepak. I am just wondering how long it will last after I complete the 6 day treatment. I am worried about the longterm side affects and liver damage.Right now I am also on my second treatment of Rimicade but it has not done anything for me yet. 
Other	michbar, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	10/5/2008 9:20:38 PM	I have had terrible heel soreness for a year, and no dr. could figure out what the problem was and how to treat it.  Finally, a new podiatrist told me to &quot;test&quot; the medrol.  After 2-3 days -- my heels are almost normal again!  It has really been a miracle!  Finally!
Other	bill, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	65-74	9/22/2008 10:53:52 AM	I was prescribed this medication in the ER for treatment of pericarditis (inflamation around the heart). I am a non insulin diabetic. Immediately after starting this medication my blood sugar levels increased dramatically from normal around 120 to over 300. I also experienced dizziness and stomach upset. I am now on third day of Medrol dose pack and have contacted my doctor about stoppong medication. I should also mention that the pericarditis symptoms had dissapeared before I started on the Medrol so I have seen no specific benefits - only problems.
