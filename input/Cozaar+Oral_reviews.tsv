High Blood Pressure	leandra, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	8/4/2012 2:45:28 AM	I have been on the green pill for 6 years, suddenly doctors started writing the 10 mg of the white losartin pill and telling me to cut it in half. First 3 days on, massive headaches, dizziness, muscles aches. My bp usually runs 120/75 sometimes lower when on it, now its running 142/88 and up.  I am not sure what to do now. Also, after 6 years I realized I had been having a dry rash on chin, episodes of hives and my hair had thinned dramatically. I did not know the cause since I take no other meds, but I am believing it is the cozar all along. Merik worries me about this white pill - the headache is the very first noticeable side effect - feels like speers going through my head.

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	9/8/2011 9:38:16 PM	I've been taking the blueish/green pill for at least 7 years with no problems. Since Merck has switched to the white pills, my blood pressure has risen and anxiety has increased. Unfortunately most pharmacies do not carry the blue pill anymore because of &quot;suppliers.&quot; (it's not clear whether Merck is phasing out the blue pill or not). For some people, the white pill is not equivalent to the green pill which Merck and pharmacists should recognize and readily offer both rather than restrict production to white only. Looking at other posts, this seems to be a problem for others as well.

Insurance wouldn't pay for brand after it wen generic. My doctor tried me on Benicar which made me so dizzy I couldn't stand up. After fighting with insurance, I paid for brand myself. It was changed to a white pill but still Cozaar brand. This version of Cozaar did not work as I got leg cramps, muscle pain, dizzy, leg/ankle swelling and felt awful. I am on Avalide Oral for 3 months now. It works perfect on BP and I feel great.

Lost most of the muscle tone in my legs (previous backpacker and bicyclist), chronic leg pain and fatigue. Went off cold turkey, no BP spike. Currently need knee replacements (2011, too young yet) due to damage done to joint without adequate muscle to cushion. Bone-on-bone, no cartilage/meniscus left. Bad part is, those 8 years and my knees are lost forever. Find something else... try a far infrared sauna or that breathing machine to lower BP safely and naturally.

Seemed to be working alright except my hair got very thin. I didn't realize it could be the BP med. Went I was switched the generic white pill I coughed my head off. Not good after heart valve replacement. I was switched to Losinpril and still coughed. Nurse finally told me to go back to original (green)Cozaar if I could.  It is very hard to get.Guess what? Coughing stopped in two days. But upper number still a little high so he prescribed Hydrlazine 75mg to go along with Cozaar. Doesn't seem to be a problem at this time.

While taking the white pill my bloodpressure was up and down and I had bad headaches at the base of my head.  Needless to say I reported this side effect to the pharmacy and then to Merck.  Luckily I have been able to transfer the RX to other pharmacies who still have the green pill on their shelf.  I surely hope Merck will reconsider and go back to the green pills.

Also, I started to bruise easy and my platelets dropped with all other bloodwork being fine. This is a rare side effect but it did happen to me. I had to be put on steroids to fix the problem of platelets and was told it might have triggered an autoimmune thing in my body that may never correct.  DO NOT take this medication and if you do make sure if you start to bruise easy that you force your dr to do a CBC on you. No matter how rare the sideeffect it is not rare if it is you.

I initially on a low dose of Enalapril Maleate (2.5 mg), but at the dosage was increased to 10 mg I developed a severe cough as a side effect. My doctor then prescribed Bystolic, which caused severe erectile dysfunction. I stopped taking that immediately and was switched to Benicar Hct, but the dosage I was prescribed (40/12.5) contained Hydrochlorothiazide, which also caused mild erectile dysfunction and left me feeling very light headed. I started taking Cozaar, which after a week seems to be working well with no noticeable side effects. That is the eason I only gave 4 stars for Effectiveness and Satisfaction.

High Blood Pressure	simsdiva, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	10/4/2010 8:22:33 PM	I had been on Avapro 150 mgs for 6 years. Due to the cost, I asked my dr to put me on Cozaar since I could get 3 months worth for $12.00 vs $47.00 from 1 month of Avapro. I have been on Cozaar for 2 weeks now and tomorrow, during my dr appt, I am asking him for my Avapro back. Dizzy, so dizzy I called off wk and felt like I was going to pass out! I hate paying the higher price, but I would rather feel good, and be broke than feel like I have been. It's easy to take, one pill a day, and for some it may work, but not meant for me...

The Benicar worked great with no noticeable side effects. 10 mg kept my bp around 125/75. The Cozaar is garbage. 100 mg of Cozaar didn't lower my blood pressure and it caused me to experience unitntentional sleep. The pharmacy handout described an &quot;extreme fatigue&quot; side effect as rare, said nothing about sleep issues. Went back to Benicar and all the nasty side effects went away, plus my bp went back to 125/75.

The generic Cozaar and the new white name brand version of this drug make me feel awful.  I experience abdominal swelling and have a jittery feeling.  I returned the generic and was given a white Cozaar-shaped pill in a Cozaar bottle.  The &quot;name brand&quot; looked just like the generic.  I was told that it was back ordered and was given a 30 day instead of the 90 day supply which my prescription requested.  The pharmacy had no idea when they would get more!  Bring back the old Cozaar, please!

My blood pressure has not really gone down enough, and i feel tired all the time.  There is one benefit i experience which I have not seen mentoned in other reviews.  My eyesight has improved because of cozaar.  I suppose the tiny blood vessles open up, but now I can see small print better while taking cozaar.  No leg cramps to speak of, or other problems.

This medication works well at 50mg for me, but made me very dizzy at 100mg, which is what was perscribed. It does seem to actually help with erections which I thought was strange until I read more about the medicine...it widens blood vessels. That was a nice added benefit!

Generic Losartan came on the market and the strange thing is the pills are identical to the Cozaar made by Merck. I did inquire about this and pharmacist didn't seem concerned.  Called Merck and reported also.  It makes you wonder why there wouldn't be a possible mix up when filling this prescription. Have back side effects on generic, shortest of breath and tingling in hands. Back to Cozaar and feel fine but of course paying alot more.

Heard Lisinapril worked well for people with MS and Dr said try it. No go. Cough, cough, cough so went back to Cozaar but Ins said give me new generic, Losarten. Cough, cough, cough. NURSE said go back to Cozaar and gave me prescription but CVS gave me same white pills in a Cozaar bottle. I called and said where are thwe blue-green pills like what I took for 5 years and was told that's the way they came from the manufacturer but he had some blue-green pills available and would swap them with me. I paid 200% more for blue-green Cozaar and some how was given the same generic white pill Losartan that makes me cough for $5. Be careful and pay attention to whatyou are given.

I have taken for years and NEVER had a side effect or bad experience.  HOWEVER, my insurance changed, and now I have had my first experience with the generic losarten.  I feel awful, I am jittery, dizzy, hoarse, face is swollen like I have allergies, etc. They call this a generic substitute but it is killing me.  Now I have to beg for the Brand Cozaar and pay the price. How does the FDA clear these types of drugs??!!  I am a nurse and my insurance is denying me what I need.  Go figure...it will only get worse as this nation contemplates what to do with healthcare reform.
High Blood Pressure	CSRQ, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	7/9/2010 3:27:23 AM	Since I havent taken it yet i cant review it...but wanted to share ...I was on Avapro for 5 years and it worked just fine but since I have no insurance  I tried the less expensive... first LISINOPRIL which gave me &quot;the dreaded cough&quot;....Like a feather is in your throat!  Then atenolol which  slows the heart and reduces blood flow ...was a nightmare &amp; it actually gave me nightmares , my arms and legs felt like they weighed a 1000 lbs, I had no energy, it was hard to focus &amp; difficult to drive! Cozaar looks like  it might be next since the side affects for losarten the generic look like something I dont want to chanceI am almost tempted to just go back to Avapro

But Brand name Cozaar is one of the best. I didn't have any side effects.However, generic Losartan Potassium almost killed me. I was having dizzy spells every single day I was on it after about 2 weeks of taking it. I fainted the Sat b4 father's day. I was standing at the sliding glass doors at a friend's house and next thing I knew I was lying on my back looking up at the ceiling and he's yelling me &quot;are you ok? Do you want me to call 911?&quot; And worst of all, I was so hoarse that every swallow was agony. And nothing I drank or gargled with would abate the hoarseness in my throat. I have medicare part D, and if you have your doctor write &quot;dispense as written&quot; , you will get the brand name and NOT the generic from your pharmacy.I hope noone else goes through what I went through taking the Generic!

Over the five years I have been pleased and able to enjoy outoor physical activities like walks with a back-pack. However, much to my surprise, after all this time I have unexpectedly had dizzy lightheadedness, simultaneous nausea and checked in with my GP who has taken me off the drug. Dizzyness is reported as a well known side effect but I am just surprised that it has taken so long to manifest itself in my case. Maybe its only with prolonged use that the drug builds up in my body to reach a threshold where it causes problems? Who knows?Anyway, my doc has now replaced Cozaar and she has given me a combination of statins and Bendroflumethiazide.

High Blood Pressure	Arthur, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	2/13/2010 1:15:19 PM	I am a 32 year old male with no family history of high blood pressure or hypertension. I am a pilot and must pass a yearly physical in order to fly. Recently, I was diagnosed with &quot;White Coat Hypertension&quot; by the flight surgeon who stated this condition leads to &quot;Irreversible Damage Down the road&quot;.  My BP was 140-88 when at the clinic but 125-70 at home. I've been on the Losartan for 1 week now and have noticed a huge decrease in blood pressure I went from the at home average of 125-70 to about 110-50... I've seen it as low as 100-48. The drug definitely works, but the 25mg that I am taking once a day almost seems unneccessary couldn't imagine taking it twice a day or even larger doses. I will continue to take this drug for another week as long as I don't have any adverse effects to it.

High Blood Pressure	paws4parker, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	1/29/2010 3:06:24 PM	My Dr. has had me on 40/25 of Benicar HCT since Oct. of 2009. My BP had been 155/90, and it brought it down to low 100's/ high 60's...sometimes being VERY low! As of Dec 2009, I started cutting the pill in half , taking it in the morning with my other meds. I did this(without informing my Dr., but did my husband) because I had such EXTENSIVE fatigue it wasn't funny. Also had runny nose, dizziness, higher blood sugar, joint pain along with going to the bathroom nearly every hour! Once I cut these suckers in half, it took about a week, I did notice a big difference in my energy level &amp; sex drive and my BP stayed down! At the beginning of January this year, my insurance co. said that they are no longer covering the Benicar &amp; so my Dr., gave me samples of Mycardis...which I researched &amp; decided that the side effects were NOT something I wanted to tolerate.So I started doing my own research on which high blood pressure meds I felt I could deal with, and finally found Cozaar...very few side effects listed &amp; the reviews here were pretty encouraging. I told him what I had done as far as researching a BP med for myself &amp; he said &quot;Oh darling, the BP meds ARE ALL THE SAME!&quot; Like hell they are! Then he proceded to give me more samples of Hyzaar...which I refused...so he reluctantly wrote me a script to start me on a LOW DOSAGE (which I also insisted on!) Anyway I'll be filling it this weekend, so we'll see where this takes me! I strongly urge everyone...DO YOUR RESEARCH!!! ALL BP MEDS ARE ...NOT...THE SAME!!!

High Blood Pressure	NO COZAAR FOR ME, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	1/15/2010 2:26:53 PM	I was one of the &lt;1% who encountered cognitive abnormalities from this medication.  Became virtually non-functional in the ability to complete complex tasks at work. Fortunately, my Family Physician encountered a teaching physician at Baylor College of Medicine who said it might be Cozaar. Took 3 - 4 months to get back to near-normal, but a whole chunk of one year is missing from my memory.

She reported the falls for YEARS to her GP who didn't investigate them. &quot;One minute I was up, the next, on the floor.&quot; Mum repeatedly reported.I moved back in with Mum to get to the bottom of it.After bullying Mum's GP, she agreed to a reduced dose trial (100mg &gt; 50mg) The effect was dramatic. Mum's BP went from the 'upper limit' to the lower limit - seemingly an overdose.Having got her BP WELL DOWN, another doctor agreed a further drop to 25mg. Mum's BP went up again but was still under where it was at 100mg.*I* stopped Mum taking it altogether. For 6 months, Mum never had another fall and her BP was high but below the 'limit' - in other words, she didn't need losartan potassium at all.AT THE RIGHT DOSE IT'S FINE AND WORKS WELL.
High Blood Pressure	cartwrightbride, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	12/10/2009 1:17:49 PM	In spite of being assured this drug had no side effects, I had muscle aches and stiffness, difficulty sleeping, a migraine that lasted close to 2 solid weeks, bloody mucus in my nose and was so tired and depressed I was unable to function.  The 50mg dosage had virtually no impact on my blood pressure either.
High Blood Pressure	Diease better than cure, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	12/8/2009 4:01:34 PM	I am new to this drug  but will now research natural remedies. In reading the 172 comments it makes me scared to take this drug. It seems the bulk of you are complaining of dizziness, dry mouth, nightmares, depression, headache, muscle pain, rash, fatigue, errection problems. I wonder what is worse the diease or the cure. Well luckily my first dose was free so I have a month to decide...PS if you go to cozaar.com you can get a 30 day supply free but it expires 12/31/09 
High Blood Pressure	BOXERSON, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	65-74	12/6/2009 9:39:46 AM	I FIND TAKING COZAAR I HAVE MUSLE PAIN, IT'S PRETTY BAD AND IT'S IN MY ARMS. I HAVE ONLY BEEN ON IT FOR 3 WEEKS SO WE WILL SEE HOW MUCH WORSE IT GETS. I ALSO TAKE 3 OTHER B/P MEDS, HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, ATENTOL AND AMLODIPINE, AM TIRED OF TAKING THEM ALL BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO I DID TAKE LISINOPRIL AND HAD HORRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS, NIGHTMARES, HEADACHES AND COULDN'T SLEEP FOR LONGER THEN AN HOUR AT A TIME. SO AT LEAST NOW I AM SLEEPING BUT HAVE THISMUSCLE PAIN WHICH IS ANNOYING. MY B/P STILL RUNS A LITLE HIGH BUT WITHIN LIMITS I CAN LIVE WITH.

High Blood Pressure	mark, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	12/3/2009 7:00:13 PM	taking 50mg day at night for hypertension,,effective at reducing pressure,,has effected my erections in a negative way-less pressure[blood flow] less erection however id rather have erection problems than a heart attack or stroke,,reduced pressure from 200-210 to 131-140 so it is an effective med,,not covered by insurance which is disappionting however i notice no side efffects besides keeping wood up after 4 months and plan to stay on this med,,was on atenolol which greatly affected my libido, etc. before switching to cozarr,monetary cost is worth the difference..atenolol slows the heart and reduces blood flow which causes erectile difficulties however losartan[cozaar] expands arteries to reduce blood pressure therefore erectile problems are not as common because atenolol is a beta-blocker and cozaar is an ARA type blocker similiar to an ACA inhibitor but without the cough,,hope this info has been helpful to other male users of these meds,,lets keep in mind that these meds save our life and not our sex life,,cheers

Cozzar at night. It has made me really tired in the evenings. Now I am taking Atonel, too, because my bp is still at 165/90. Prior to this I was on lisinopril and dyazide for 6 months and my bp stayed high. Hopefully the altonel will help lower my bp. Don't like reading all the different side effects. Middle age is hard enough without more problems from our meds.May have an enlarged heart due to high bp. Will find out next week after my echo today. Good Luck, everyone.

So my BP is down 118/78, I can tell I feel better, but I am changing doctors and have an appt. with the new doctor today. Not that the Cozaar and the beta-blocker is not working, but I feel I have hyperthyroidism which one of the symtoms is high BP plus I have other symtoms as well. And when I was on BP meds years ago, all I had to take of the Cozaar was just one pill a day and it was in control, so there is something wrong that I have to be on 2 PLUS a beta-blocker! My old doctor said he checked my thyroid when he was checking again my high calcium level, don't see how they can check your thyroid by checking your calcium. High calcium level is another symtom of Hyperthyroidism, so he just tells me to start taking 1,000 units of Vit D after he re-tested me for the high calcium level. I had not been back to him in over 2 years for a physcial, and you would think when he was re-doing my blood work this time, and after I had fasted the night before, he would have went ahead and checked my cholestrol, iron, sugar, triglicerides, etc, but I had ask the nurse when I went back a week later just to check my BP, what test did he run, she pulled it up and all he ran was just to check all my vitamins! So I didn't like that at all. He just wants me to keep coming back to collect my co-payment! Then he schedules me for a physcial and that is when I found me another doctor and cancelled my appt with the old doctor. I had handed him my sugar meter to look at my readings...HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO TURN IT ON!! I had to show him! And he has been pushing me since my last physcial 2 yrs. ago that I needed to be on diabetic mangement,which I bit the bullet since this last visit and told him to call me in meds for the sugar, generic for glucophage(metformin). So wish me luck!

High Blood Pressure	enigma,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female		10/10/2009 11:12:37 AM	I've been on this drug for 6 months.I've experienced dizzyness that I'm really NOT appreciating!As of lately it's getting worse. Used to be just a morning thing now it's an on going thing .And at times periods of feeling tired.I've been on more than a handful of different b/p meds. (I have also been on the one where it makes you cough non stop. As previous reviewers wrote. That was terrible ..and of course another trip back to the doc's.) I guess it's probably time to find another med.Glad this information is on here.
High Blood Pressure	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	2	Male	65-74	10/10/2009 8:02:23 AM	I have been on 25 mg of Cozaar since May.  I have COPD. I am on about 6 other  meds.  The only side effect I have is SEVERE STOMACH PAIN.  I started taking Cozaar around 3 p.m and within an hour started with stomach pain.  Doctor advised me to change the time of med to dinner time.  It worked for maybe 2 days, now started up again.  Put me on probotics, thought that would help,  it did for several days.  Now starting up again.  So bad last night, didn't sleep any.  ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS!!
High Blood Pressure	SFerree6, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	45-54	10/9/2009 8:57:35 AM	Well I am back to give my weekly update for being back on Cozaar. I went back to my dr. for a follow up and BP is still a little high 140/104, but better from last week 170/100. So dr. told me to to take a double dosage from 50mg to 100mg,, so I take 2 pills in the morning. I bought myself a BPmonitor to check it at home and last night before I went to bed it was 133/88 so looks like it will eventually get me back on track. I am to return back to the dr. office to let the nurse check it next week. I had to have some blood work done also yesterday to check out some othere problems I have too, calcium level is high, this is not from taking Cozaar, I haven't been to see my doctor in over 2 years, so just been feeling tired and having no energy. I might have to also bite the bullet and let the dr. perscribe me the pill to take for my sugar, he has been trying to get me to get diabetic management, but i have been refusing, because I know once you start taking meds for this, you will never be able to go off of them,which I also know that high blood sugar can effect my BP. I know with exercise and proper diet, I can get it in control, I have done it before, but just can't get into it as much with being tire, which the blood work, when the results come back, according to my dr. I may have Hyperparathyroidism, which tiredness is just one of the systems that I have. So once we see what is going on with that I will be able to concentrate harder on the exercising.

High Blood Pressure	SFerree6, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	10/2/2009 3:50:27 PM	I am back on Cozzar after several years of being off because I was had lost weight and exercising back then. So now I am older and have gained weight back, not exercising, and was at the dentist getting tooth pulled 3 days ago and they checked my BP and the lowest reading out of 3 was 170/110! I didn't ask what the other 2 readings were, but he was very concerned. My dentist went ahead and pulled the tooth but urgently advised me to go straight to my Dr. to get back on meds. So I went about 2 hours later, they checked it to be only 10 points lower, 170/100. He put me back on the Cozzar, have been on it for 3 days now, no side effects as of today. I have noticed though I am not as sluggish as I was before. I have been eating healthy and exercising again, walking on my lunch break at work and walking in my neighborhood in the evenings, or on treadmill.I am scheduled to see my dr. again in 5 more days to see how I am doing. Also I have another dental appt. on the 20th, so hopefully my BP will be better then too. My dentist called me the day after seeing him asking how I was doing, I let him know that I DID go to my dr. and he has me on Cozzar. I had no side effects at all before when I was on Cozzar years ago. For those of you that are taking something different than Cozzar, if it is an &quot;ACE INHIBOTOR&quot; the cough you have is a side effect. I use to be on something differet before Cozzar, was on it for about 3 and a half years,had the cough, and when I switched doctors, I talked to this new dr. and he looked at my chart and seen what I was taking and switched me to Cozzar, and in 3 days cough was gone!! I hate I went that many years with a cough and never asked about it. WHAT A RELIEF!! Will update next week to let you know what my BP is.

I pop the pill and go on with my day without any hassle. The only thing is a side effect where too much sun exposure while taking this medication tends to make me very nauseous and tired.

Not good.....Here lately  the cough has gotten so bad that it produces flem, I saked my doctor to let me try something different &amp; she put me on cozaar.I have only took one dose but I Swear I feel better already, once again I have only took one dose 50 mg  once a day but I swear I feel better already.I am going to come back in a week &amp; then in a month to give an update of my experience with this drug , I only hope &amp; pray that the cough from that wretched LISINOPRIL goes away.Stay the heck away from lisinopril it does not controll hypertension it only masks the symptoms of it ,makes you cough &amp; fools you into believing it is working.No wonder it is so cheap, they know that you will keep using it to save money, I am sure the Health insurance companies love it, mine does.Wish me luck.
High Blood Pressure	Irma, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/27/2009 1:18:21 PM	No adverse side effects other than things I can change like dizziness if I wait too long to eat in between meals or swelling when I have too much sodium in my meals. I get tired in late afternoon. Switched from Lisinopril - the horrible coughing drug. The switch made my life much easier because the coughing would come on out of no where &amp; be uncontrollable. Today my B/P #s go down if I walk 30 min. a day and eat well but like clockwork, they creep back up, even on Cozaar, when I don't move around (have a desk job) or eat well (late hrs at wk = fast food for dinner). My doctor gave me Lisinopril 'to protect my kidneys' from my other issue (sugar) so hope Cozaar is doing the same thing; I'd rather cough and have healthy kidneys than take Cozaar and diminish their function.

I had been on Atenolol and then Lisinopril (which almost killed me as my lips began to swell).  In reading thru the comments, some of my systems are the same - tiredness and sore joints, but I do have 2 herniated discs so it's hard to say if my back pain is related.  I do feel more puffy and it is apparent in my face, but other than that I think the medication is effective.  I have difficulty sleeping anyway so I don't know if any of it is related to the Cozaar.  Would like to hear other systems - oh, do have a problem if I have a drink.  I really get flushed with just one drink.  Have read others but have not read anything about that.

High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	5/27/2009 5:29:22 PM	I developed tendonitis so bad that I lost the rest of my rotator cuff on the right shoulder.  I can no longer lift my arm above shoulder height. I have RA which had made the shoulder a problem before hand.  I became very ill and in lots of pain. Had to be lifted out of bed because I couldn't lean on the right arm.  I have slowly regained limited use of the arm.  When I complained of my pain to my rheumatoligist, she prescribed stronger arthritis medicine.  When I finally couldn't walk, and stopped all medicines, I learned that they were the cause of the tendonitis.  My experience with doctors has been that their diagnosis is hit and miss (unless some test shows a problem) and most times I must find out what's making me sick.

Blood pressure went from 120/100 to 100/80 after one week. First week, I had dark nightmarish dreams and felt depressed and out of touch with reality, thought I was losing my mind. Loss of apetite and stomach felt full. I take 50mg in morning along with 25mg hydrochlorothize. I also experienced extreme fatigue, sinus headache and muscle aches. Now, after two weeks, side effects are gone. I feel a little tired in afternoon, but it is not troublesome. I'm sleeping most nights with no more dark dreams.

High Blood Pressure	JT, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/27/2009 3:44:33 AM	My doctor recently put me on Lisinipril 10mg  in addition to HCTZ 25mg which I had been taking for a year for pre-hypertension to low hypertension. The HCTZ worked well at first, keeping me around 120/80, but my BP had crept back up. The Lisinipril worked great for BP, dropping it to under 120/80 after 3 weeks, but gave me a cough, dry mouth and made arthritis, heal pain, and pain from a recent knee injury worse. I had horrible night cramps, not just in the calves, but upper thighs as well. He switched me to Cozaar 50mg. Within 3 days, the cough stopped, knee and leg pain stopped, and heal pain (which I have had for 10 years) is minimal. And continual fatigue has stopped. I went for a long hike today, something I haven't been able to do pain-free for years. I called him the other day to complain about the cost - waiting for him to call me back. Well, apparently, it's an anti-depressant as well. I was feeling like every day was &quot;ground hog day&quot;, and that is gone as well. (Might have something to do with the loss of the pain...) Now I'm going to tell him it's well worth the $60/month, LOL!

I have felt ran down and extremely tired. Going to the doctor this week to get my medicine switched. Tired of the side effects and being sick. I am an active person and this medication has taken a toll on me. It has lowered my blood pressure from 190/110 down to 122/78 by taking 50mg once a day. So its doing its job.

Since taking 25 mg of Cozaar not one coughing bout and it keeps my BP around 120/70 before exercise and 115/60 after exercise which I do 4 times a week for about an hour each time. I do get a little light headed if I take it before exercise.

Altase &amp; other ace drugs made me cough till I threw up!  However Altase made me feel like me. All the other drugs made me tired and feel like I had the flu.  The generic for Cozaar can make you cough. This drug has interfered with my ability to loose weight.  Never had this problem before.  Gained weight on other meds and now can't loose it. Need to find med that dosen't block that part of brain, but still works. The Cozaar does work very well.

After reviewing other drugs and all their side-effects, I may just pay the extra &amp; stick with Cozaar. Very happy with it. Open to options if any suggestions. Bottom line, if you are prescribed this, it may be expensive, but might be worth the $$.

BP now 114/70 typically. I have been taking this combination for 10 years.  Before that I was having a lot of trouble regulating my BP.  Since going on this regimen regulation has not been a problem except that I have to take some pills in the evening and some in the morning.  Otherwise I get a BP fluctuation during the day.  This works for me.

High Blood Pressure	Sassy1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	5/9/2008 2:37:21 AM	Had borderline high blood pressure, now down to normal. Also have hypothyroidism (doc misread thyroid blood test in 1987...always ask for blood work copies!!!)which led to 140 pound weight gain over 7 years and subsequently Type II diabetes with Restless Leg Syndrome. Mirapex for RLS coupled with Cozaar can lead to fainting as both have this side effect. For me it is especially bad on hotter days. Have had many UTI's that always travel to kidneys by the time I find out (no pain in bladder). Have almost constant hip/lower back pain since starting this and causes a severe lack of sleep (4-5 hours per night). Have frequent headaches and other muscles tend to get sore/tight very easily. I also take metformin, glypizide and Byetta (have lost 45 pounds since Nov.). I have an increased red rash under the skin from the cozaar and have a rare side effect from metformin which is a severe sensitivity to sunlight/sunburn. Hopefully with a little more weight loss both the diabetes and tendency to higher blood pressure will disappear entirely along with the side effects.

(AND NO ALCOHOL)  i had not taken cozaar for about 5 days because we went out of town before my Rx was ready.  i took 1- 100mg tablet.  OMG! about 12:15 a.m. new year's day i walked into the kitchen for a cookie before bed. well, i got to the cookies~~~ next i knew i was waking up on the floor looking up at the ceiling.  Managed to get myself up, only to wake up to the ceiling again.  this time i awoke in GREAT PAIN!  My husband helped me (gingerly) to my chair.  we took my BP~~~55/33!!!! An ER nurse wanted me to come on in.... on new year's eve???  NO WAY!!!after giving my foot 3 more days to improve i decided to find out what was wrong. well,3 fractured metatarsals in my left foot!after casting, walking in a boot and still complaining about pain with walking at 4 months, i ended up having foot surgery last week to reset the bone with a plate and screws.this is to warn those taking this drug~~~ do not restart the drug at FULL STRENGTH!1/2 the pill would have been safer as i've learned from experience. you can always take more if 1/2 doesn't do the trick, but please don't make the mistake i did!

High Blood Pressure	Whitenight, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	3	4	3	Male	55-64	1/10/2008 9:07:22 AM	For me Cozaar has lowered my bloodpressure, but I have to supplement the cozaar tablet (100mg)daily dose, with a Norvasc 5mg tablet each day. My blood pressure numbers now average the 130's over the 80's. Previous to any medication I averaged the 150's/160's over 90 to 96. My doctor is happy with the new numbers made possibe by the two medications. I am a 61 yr. old, six feet tall, average weight of 195 lbs. white male, with a family history of hypertension, both mother and father. The down side of taking both medications for me is a daily sluggish feeling that can be overcome, but not without pushing myself through it. However, from my hypertension research, lowering my bloodpressure is a fair trade-off to the side effects I experience from taking the combined medications.
