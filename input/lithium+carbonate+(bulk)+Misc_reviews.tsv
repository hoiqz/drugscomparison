Lithium is a non-essential alkali metal, meaning it has no actual biological function in the human body. It can interfere with potassium and sodium which are essential metals that are involved in nerve communication. Lithium completely destroys the renal (kidney) system and many long term lithium users die prematurely from kidney issues due to lithium. Lithium also interferes with thyroid function. Thyroid hormones are critical to the proper functioning of the human metabolism as well as the nervous system. Lithium also interferes with a number of other bodily functions like hormone and enzyme production. In clinical studies lithium has also been proven to prevent the female estrous cycle. Overall lithium is a harmful alkali metal to the human body as well as other Earthly organisms. It is not something that should be recommended to patients. I personally know someone who was harmed by the metal lithium, therefore I am committed to helping others. A substance used for decongestion and amino acid, N-acetylcysteine has been proven to somewhat lessen the effects of lithium induced renal dysfunction (if the lithium is discontinued). If anyone is currently having issues with lithium treatment, ask if your doctor will switch to N-acetylcysteine. N-acetylcysteine has also been clinically proven to lessen the effects of OCD and bipolar disorder. I sincerely hope that this information helps someone out there!

When my health care provider changed me to Lithium Carbonate (less expensive for them), it caused me to have seizures, being generic. The name brand medication of Lithobid worked.

I have issues with my mother who is now deceased. I really don't notice any difference except that my hair is falling out, I am always thirsty and I have more pimples now than I did as a teen-ager.

They placed me on lithium and it has worked very well for my manic bi-polar episodes. I do have tremors in my hands occasionally and my hair has fell out alot moreso than it used to and the weight gain is notorius. So as long as I can work through those issues im doing good. Which I am bc I dont ever want to feel like I did b4 I got help 4 sure.

I was treated in a mental health inpatient facility, after slitting my wrist.  I have a good experiance with the drug so far.  A few side effects, but nothing I can't handle.  I just hope that this is what will finally work for me.
