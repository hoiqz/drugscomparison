My doctor finally ran a second culture (at my insistance) and determined the infection needed to be treated with Rocephin.  It worked I feel as if I have my life back.  The only downside was I had to go into the drs. office everyday for ten days for an injection.  
Lower Respiratory Tract Infection	Jeanine, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	6/11/2012 6:48:25 PM	This injection nearly killed my mother-in-law 3 days ago. After being injected she immediately became lightheaded and went into a seizure,and stopped breathing. Thank God she was at the doctors office! They were able to bring her back. It shot her heart rate up to 150 beats per min,her eyes were rolled up in head and she could barely breath! I thought for sure she was gonna die. She looked horrible and struggled for 5 hours before being able to get her breathing to her normal rate. She spent a day in ICU,and another day in the hospital. I would NOT recommend this medication to anyone. Her pharmacist told me that her son almost died from this medication too,and that it is known to cause allergic reactions in a high percentage of people.
Bacteria causing an Infection in the Joints	PJ, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male		10/17/2011 4:32:33 AM	About two years ago I was diagnosed with Whipples Disease. This is a very rare disease which attacks various parts of your body causing joint pain, vomiting, diahrea, dry mouth, etc;. The prescribed dose was daily infusions to be administered at a hospital or clinic. I chose my local clinic and received daily treatment six times a week for a solid year.At first I was skeptical but after a  few months I could see some results. I completed treatment earlier this year and I'm considered cured, although I still get tired very easily. Overall I'm very happy with the results.

Lyme Disease	Christyn36, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	35-44	1/31/2011 8:18:26 AM	I was on Rocephin IV x 1 month and went to the ER twice the first month for chest pain. They said it was related to the Lymes Disease. Five months later, I am still having the chest pain. I saw my family doctor several times. Finally I got referred to GI for an EGD. I come to find out the med caused me to get Gastric and duodenal ulcers :( The medicine worked but the side effects after teh fact still have me seeking medicaL treatment.

Lyme Disease	send2jayce, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	5/2/2009 7:06:24 AM	I was also diagnoses about 3 years prior to Lyme with MS.  I am GRAVELY allergic to Rocephin but was forced into the ICU for desinsitization to the drug since it was my only treatment option(allergic Penecillin too).So far desensitization seems successful, though initial 48 hours in ICU were a little rough.  2 weeks into another 4 weeks of treatment and the swollen Lyme arthritic knees are healing and I can walk again without tremendous pain.  So far so good.  Just wanted to share my apparent success with temporarily disarming my ROcephin allergy with my immunologist, and a fleet of doctors and nurses to get the treatment I needed desperately.

From my knees down it was the worst, large blisters that left scars. It started as tiny red spots on my thighs. No one listened when I told them it could be an allergic reaction, and all the doctors that saw it said they had never seen a Rocephin rash that bad before.Needless to say it's now on my drug allergy list.
