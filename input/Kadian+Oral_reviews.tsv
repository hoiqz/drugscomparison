Chronic Pain	sick puppy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	8/3/2012 8:30:48 PM	I have been on this medication for about 5 yrs. my pain doctor quit his business suddenly and left his patients high and dry. I have had horable withdraws have been sick for the past week, ended up in the ER. Trying to get thru this and get myself off this medication, it worked great i thought but is not worth it if you ever lose your meds. This is a wicked drug, i have never been addicted to anything before, and don't want to be again. I was sick in bed in pain throwing my guts up and pooping everywhere got so weak i couldn't walk my family doc will have to taper me off of this awful drug. I will certainy research my meds from here on out.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	lilwitchy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	4/11/2012 12:58:00 PM	I have 5 damaged disks, 2 cervical &amp; 3 lumbar. A year after the accident that caused this I was diagnosd with Fibromyalgia &amp; Chronic Inflammation. Im severly allergic to all non steriod anti inflammatories so my dr had no choice but to start me on narcotics. I wast happy about that but if I wanted to function, &amp; I had to be able to move with a severly ADHD child, I had to take them. Over next few yrs I developed a tolerance &amp; the pills just didnt help as much. I was started on Kadian &amp; it has been a god sent. I take 60mg in am &amp; 60mg at bedtime. The best part is I dont have the side effects such as grogginess etc. that comes with narcotics. The down side to Kadian is the expense! Without my insurance 60 pills would cost me $597.00 each month.

Chronic Pain	lolly808, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/9/2012 5:41:36 PM	I was taking 4 Norcos per day and not getting very good pain relief.  Switched to Kadian and its a Godsend.  Had to adjust dosage to find the right one.  Started at 30, went to 60, went to 100, then down finally to 80mg.  I take one pill at night.    I do get vivid dreams though.  Wow!   I usually take maybe one Norco per day for BT pain.    I take magnesium to deal with the constipation.  All in all, I am sooo happy with the Kadian.

They say there is a generic but I am told it doesnt work as well. I can buy the name brand but pay 200.00 crazy. I am pain free with Kadian and MSIR for break through pain. Being allergic to everything else all codones this is all that works for me.

Chronic Pain	Lana, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/2/2012 3:13:12 AM	I've used Kadian for fibromyalgia for several years, with good results.  I have also used other extended relief morphine meds(Avinza, Embeda,). It seems about the same as the other brands.  However, when I was briefly changed to Opana(a different opioid),It was so awful, I only made it a few days and had to go back on the morphine. It seems that the body goes through a wash-out phase(the Dr explained)when the old medicine is getting out of your system and the new one isn't really working yet. I have never felt so awful! I'm sure that going off this med would be terrible (the withdrawal)but it is a life saver for me.  I'm able to work,run my business, volunteer with animal rescues,garden,etc.   I DO get very tired from being so active,and I never sleep well or enough, it seems. I don't think the sleep issue is related because I've had insomnia for so long.  I would recommend this med if you need something every day for chronic pain and want to live a fairly normal life.   Side effects,like sleepiness,constipation usually go away for the most part.  I do sometimes take another med for break-through pain(Nucynta)which is also an opioid.  It is also helpful for pain.     If other meds haven't helped severe or chronic pain, I would recommend Kadian. I use 100mg twice a day.

Her concern is that she has an allergy to morphine, however she doesn't to opiods.  Is the drug safe to take?
Chronic Pain	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		1/26/2012 12:08:56 AM	I am 37 and was diagnosed with debilitating Lupus and RA 5 years ago.  It was after I had topped out of other drugs and started having high liver function tests, that my Rheumatologist recommended Kadian because it's an extended release medication.  It has given me my life back.  I have 2 small children and run a small business.  I don't have time to feel bad.   I took 10 MG 2x a day for about 2 years and then moved to 20 MG 2 x a day about 1 year ago.  I just switched insurance companies and they are making me switch to the generic and I've had horrible headaches all week.  I pray these go away or we are going to have to appeal the insurance so I can get the Kadian again.  I am sad I have to go through so much trouble to get the meds I need...especially considering it's so hard to find what works then the insurance says no.  Ugh! Find the lowest possible dosage that works because you don't want to top out before you're 60!  
Chronic Pain	LadyJayne, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/18/2012 5:34:49 PM	I am allergic to all codones in the pain relief meds. I can only take morphine. Kadian and MSIR have been a God send. I am now hearing that the Kadian comes in a generic and we will either pay 10 for generic or 100 for Brand name. I took premarin generic and it didnt work, I had to take the brand name. I would like to know the ingredients in Kadian versus the Generic? Has anyone taken the generic yet and can you share if the brand name and generic are the same in helping with pain relief? FDA is forcing us to choose what to take, that and insurance companies. 
Chronic Pain	casperbabe, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/14/2012 7:17:25 PM	This drug is really good, although I have to take Morphine IR for breakthrough pain but it does pretty well.  I'm still in a lot of pain though to be honest but it takes away about 40% of my pain away, I still cannot work or walk real well.  I went on Pain Management in July of 2010 as the pain was getting to the point of insanity.  In February I had my 5th back surgery, this time they fused the bottom part, shaved off my bone spurs and fixed the spinal stenosis and I'm still in pain everyday but it helps none the less.  Hope this helps someone :)  God Bless to all!

Dr incorrectly diagnosed problem ergo extreme dosage increase without desired result. Difficult to get off the dependency-took Over 1 yr. Also put me into early menopause, false actually as after stopping I went thru Mpse all over again. Make sure your Dr knows what he is doing and stay at lowest possible dosage. Do not change to a &quot;similar&quot; drug as for me this was apples and oranges and I was thrown into difficult withdrawal. Be prepared to be very uncomfortable while stopping usage. I went from 400-500 mg per day to 20-30 mg per day then just stopped. My pain did not stop and it was two mOnths before I started to feel better-tho still in pain. THINK HARD before starting this drug. You might as well be on heroin. And that might be cheaper these days. Try everything else first. 
Chronic Pain	Robert, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	10/13/2011 6:20:46 AM	I have been taking med. for chronic pain(nerve damage)for 6 yrs. Works excellent for pain but I have agressive bi-polar condition and am on psychiatric meds.I have the typical dry mouth,excessive sweating,constipation and sleep issues(BUT)I have terrible mood swings and go into rages at the smallest problems and unable to calm down.I talked to doctor about this issue and was told that it was not caused by Kadian.I disagree,agitation started around the time I began taking this med. If you have any mental disorders I highly recommend you find another pain therapy other than Kadian.I can deal with other side effects because pain relief is worth it but I am researching other meds. Relationship damages caused by this medicine is unbearable and sadly unchangeable.

Surgery relieved the initial pain, but did not take care of the ongoing pain and numbness. I have only been on Kadien oral for a short time, but the relief has been wonderful.  I am sleeping at night - a wonderful result.  No side affects so far.

I started taking Kadian 60mg with Percochet 1-325 and the difference is night and day thank God i needed some relief so badly! Yes, i have to take a nap in the afternoon but it's well worth the trade off! Thanks to my Doctor's continued refusal to give up and find what works for me!!! I did have back surgery in an effort to relieve pain but it made it worse than ever...I had an ALIF with a synfix peek L4-L5 to S1

Chronic Pain	Sheryl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	5/30/2011 1:43:48 PM	It leaves an awful taste in my mouth for hours and I had the opposite of constipation and was having bowel movements 4 - 5 times a day the first several days.  I'm only on 10 mg twice a day and it's only been for two weeks.  Perhaps it's a low dose after reading other reviews because it has no effect whatsoever on pain but works great as a sleeping pill which I don't need. I wanted to be changed from Vicodin because of all the acetoph... bad for the liver.  However, paying $250 even with the $50 coupon for 60 10 mg tablets and having to visit the doctor every month instead of quarterly is insane.  I still have 2 weeks left until my next doctor's appointment and will continue the meds until then, but I still need to work and drive, and this med may be needed in stronger doses and for a person that stays home. However, for any and every medication, one size and type does not fit all.

Considered coming off because i felt like my condition had improved, but when i cut back the pain returned - that's how well it works. For constipation, mineral oil has been the best help.

The side affects have been constipation and sweating really bad.

Realized while on this drug I would concentrate on useless tasks for hours missing appointments and not getting things important done.  Never put it together that it was the kadian. Also hair loss when showering I'd lose tons of hair.
Chronic Pain	TLE, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	3/5/2011 6:14:35 PM	In 2007 I was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, severe Fibromyalgia, spinal stenosis and sacrolitious all in my back. I first took Oxy 80's 3xdaily. But I couldn't handle the ups and downs. My doctor put me on 400mg of Kadian per day, then lowered it to 200 mg per day. I like that Kadian gives me no ups and downs. The pain relief is constant. But, it doesn't give me enough pain relief so I also have to take percocets throughout the day for break through pain. For the most part, Kadian is O.K. but I have a lot going on in body, I have pain everywhere because of the Fibromyalgia. My doctor wants to cut my Kadian down to 100mg per day, but I won't let him. It doesn't give me enough pain relief as is, lowering it will just make things worse.

After three weeks on this prescription she died in her sleep.  Her drs. and husband said she went into respiratory arrest which both feels may have been a direct result of this drug.  She had tried numerous other pain medications and felt this was the one that finally took her pain away but it may have also taken her life.  As she was on other meds it is hard to say for sure but being that she was only on this one for a short time her husband truly believes this is was caused her death.  Please be careful, my friend was a beautiful, kind and much loved person who died long before her time.  She will be missed terribly.

I  was put on this due to an insurance problem, this was covered.  It did not handle the pain well at all, though could have been due to the doctor not monitoring the pain levels and switching from oxycontin to this, failing to match dosages.  30mg twice a day.  I became extremely violent, to the point I called my family doctor to help get me off of it since my pain management doctor told me to deal with it.  Called my family doc, then proceeded to scream at the secretary because she did not understand me.  I became a monster.  It also didn't deal with my pain levels well.  As I said, this may be due to the doctor not modifying the dose as needed and so my expirience could be due to a withdrawl/acclimation period.(he was a bad doctor, I was worried about switching meds, and he told me to take what he prescribed or suffer withdrawl, then walked out)  I became a monster.  I've been on IV morphine before and had absolutely no problems.  I also became extremely sleepy, I believe I slept for 18 hours several times while taking this meds.As one review said, if you have a mood inbalance, use with caution, if you notice you are becoming extremely violent and irritable, contact your doctor immediately.

I cannot stay awake hardly and i do not sleep well.  I have a mood dissorder and it effects it in a very bad way.  I get so mad so easily and i cannot control it or calm myself down.  If you have a mood dissorder, i would definatly recomend staying away from this drug or any other type of morphine.

But patches are a pain to deal with in alot of ways and just as costly since I needed 2 patches to get the correct dosage.Sam's Club/Walmart prices beat any other pharmacy as far as cost and you don't have to be a member. MS Contin is supposed to be it's generic but to me it really didn't give me the same pain relief for some reason.

If anyone out there suffers from chronic pain I highly recommend that you talk to your doctor and discuss Kadian as a treatment this medication has given me my quality of life back instead of having to be in a dark quiet room when I have a migraine this medication has for the most part prevented me from having such severe ones so I can play with my children and make plans without the fear of wondering  if I will have a migraine and ruin what we are doing. Kadian has been a miracle to me, the only negative thing about it is without insurance it is about 568.00 for a 30 day supply. I hope this review will be helpful

Severe Pain with Opioid Tolerance	MommyLynn, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	7/29/2010 5:20:20 PM	I was finally was prescribed Kadian 60 mg. q 12 hours by pain management after a 3 year ordeal with bilateral pulmonary emboli and bilateral hip replacements (6 weeks apart).  Had been on Oxycontin ER  preoperatively and the same plus hydrocodone 10/325 since surgery.  Finally tried Kadian about 6 months ago and have done well, other than some breakthrough pain when I overdo physically.  Recently tried 12 hour Lidocaine 5 mg. patches for breakthrough pain, and don't see any relief from this.  Kadian has no side effects that a little stool softener each day doesn't correct, and as we have adopted our 4 year old granddaughter, I am required to be very active at 57.  I've decided that I will always have to tolerate some level of pain and if this is it - I will just handle it and feel fortunate to even be here after some of the experiences I've had.  I really don't care what anyone thinks if they find out that I take pain medication to get through my days and even have a life. The med isn't perfect, but at least I'm not always &quot;chasing the pain&quot;.  It would be nice to have something for breakthrough, but I am so opoid tolerant now that it probably wouldn't do me any good unless I took a large dose and I DON'T want to do that.  So you learn to live with it and remember those with worse troubles than you have.  I'm lucky to have strong family and friends to support me through this journey.
Chronic Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/10/2010 2:52:23 PM	This medicine is about the only one I've found that knocks a big hole in my pain. I'm never pain free, but this medicine has given me back quality of life. The one negative thing I can say is that it's difficult to find. I live in a huge city (Atlanta, GA), and I usually have to call AT LEAST 15 pharmacies to find it.

Became very tollerent to Oxycontin and changed to Kadian. Immediate relief, pain level dropped 50% or more. Works great for pain but killed my sex life. Even after using products for ED, still unable to maintain an erection. I'll take the pain with some pleasure instead of having no sex life.

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	BigDog, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	45-54	3/10/2010 8:11:57 PM	I've been suffering from degenerative disc disease for 30 years. Before the scandals involving Oxycontin, I was on 40 mg, 1 per 8 hours. &quot;I&quot; asked my Doctor to be taken offOxy which shocked him. He put me on Kadian, 100 mg, 1 per 12 hours and have been on this for 7 years. However, it's effectiveness has run it's course which I told him in Dec. 2009. 2 weeks ago he put me on OPANA, 20 mg 2x per day. I arrived at the gates of hell! The pain was so excruciating! He then made it 30 mg and, unfortunately, the same results. I can barely walk, cannot sleep or eat. ANY subtle movement is debilitating. It's been 8days on Opana, a trial run for 2 weeks and I see him on the 15th of March. With Opana my back feels as though I'm constantly being hit with a sledge hammer, my heartbeatis reverberating in my ears, I have diarrhea, stomach cramps and a headache that won't go away. It's very difficult to 'try' to explain severity of pain to someone even a Doctor who specializes in Pain Mgmt. No one can understand the hell I'm in. For the time being I'm using ice, moist heat and T.E.N.S. So, psychologically,I'm trying to take my mind off the pain but the persistence is overwhelming. So...I pray!!! I never knew Kadian came in 200 mg.I'm wondering why my Doctor just didn't switch from 100 mg per 12 to 200 mg per 12 instead of going this Opana route ???

I have to forms of arthritis, digenerative bone disease in my hips and fibromyalgia. All this due to an incurable liver disease called Primary Biliary Chrohsis. This medication has been a godsend. It is helping to get me off of prednisone. I take 20mg twice a day and have oxycodone 5mg for breakthrough pain. So far the only side effects are slepiness and some light constipation. I love it.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	4	Male	55-64	2/8/2010 10:19:41 PM	Kadian works great for me -but $$$$.At the age of 52 I'd been diagnosed with severe early onset spinal stenosis and fibermyalgia. The pain was constant and severely debilitating to the point that I could not get out of bed and had to close my business of over 25 years.Ive gone from Ibuprfen 800 mg, to hydrocodone, to oxycodone with poor results.  Finally on  Kadian for the pain along with Lyrica and I am  functioning again. I give Kadian a big thumbs up. BUT, DIFFICULTIES ARISE ... As it is a controlled substance, a handwritten prescription is a needed every month. AND Medicare part D just cut Kadian from their list of approved medications. So how I'm going to wean off is a mystery, as I cannot afford the $560.00 a month they cost without insurance.

Kadian works for me

Chronic Pain	jporter, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	12/22/2009 7:44:17 AM	Originally diagnosed with MS.  Pain, constant pain in the whole body, especially the legs.  I just wanted to die from the pain and when I told my internist how I felt, he placed me on 10mg, then 20mg and finally 30mg four times a day.  This allows me to operate in a moderate faction, although the MS has ruined my life.  I am 68 and still wish I could cross over, however as long as I stay on this medication I am okay.  It is a daily battle and I do not care how it ends, if it will just end.  I do recommend this opiate if you can get a doctor to assist you in getting it. I have mega problems establishing a routine so that I did not run out on a weekend or holiday.  I still have to adhere to a 30 day schedule, thanks to other than medical doctor interference.  Like the government. I am also 80 miles away from a pharmacy.  It is a bitch.

Pain relief has been somewhat satisfactory in the begining but seemed to become less affective as time went on. The biggest problem I experienced the last couple of years was severe constipation. This coupled with the loss of effectivness has forced my Dr. to find an alternative.

Chronic Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	45-54	2/9/2009 6:20:34 PM	After being on Actiq and insurance not paying for it anymore because I &quot;don't have cancer&quot;, this is what I have to take (along with 4 other meds) to just take the edge off of my pain until my doc and attorney can get the ins. co. to pay for the Actiq again (IF they can). It makes me very constipated, dry-mouthed, sleepy, and, for me, doesn't work worth a flip! Doc has had to up my dosage 3 times because of my VERY chronic back pain. I don't know if it's psychosymatic or what but, as far as I&quot;M concerned, it's not all that great and, even since day 1, it hasn't really touched my pain. And I don't like having to be on other meds just for breakthrough pain. The Kadian is OK but nothing to brag about. :(

I was originally given Kadian for pain related to back injuries and RA, but it had a very positive side effect of reducing elevated CPK levels that I was experiencing. I am currently taking 60mg twice a day, with up to 5 10mg/500 Hydrocodone for the breakthrough pain. I have been taking Kadian or another time release morphine for moderate to severe for several years. To prevent constipation I use Konsyl fiber and have no problem. The best part of Kadian is that due to my income and lack of insurance I am able to receive this medication for only $5.00 a month through the manufactures patient assistance program. My other options would have been to stay in constant pain or rob a drug store (only kidding). For those people who are not getting any relief from Kadian I would consider seeking therapy to see if you have been in pain for so long that your mind will not allow you to feel the relief that the Kadian is giving. Changes in blood pressure and other indicators can be used to track if you are getting relief and not able to process it in your mind (I am not saying that it is a figment of your imagination just that sometimes our minds become programed to process incorrectly and feel pain where it is not because it has been so used to the pain being there)

I have Muscular Dystrophy, Scoliosis, Spinal fusion, and chronic pain. I've been hurting for 8 years and nothing totally relieves my pain. I've been on every narcotic in the pharmacy, not including the many NSAIDS and tylenol i consume daily. The Kadian has relieved me so much that I'm out of my wheelchair walking and standing!! I still have breakthrough pain but I take a naproxen to help out with that but I'm totally off the tylenol. Thank you God!!!

Can't get the pain level down to where I can deal with it. When I have a flare up I have to go to the doctor for a shot of moorfeen. Shortly after the shot my pain goes down from a 8 to a 6 on the pain chart. Some times it goes lower. I don't understand why it works like that. It sure feels like heaven when it does take effect. I can't get the kadian to work like that. I take 100 mg morning and one at night. Is there a sub que injectable? There has got to be something that could help.

I ruptured 3 disc in my back in 2000 but no one would do surgery because of my obesity. Now I have degenerative disc disease and my verterbra are like chalk, can't stand for more than 15 min. at a time.  Kadian has killed the pain, I take 100mg everyday and MS IR 15mg for breakthrough pain. still can't function well but at least I don't hurt anymore!!

I've only been on it for 2 months and I can't say enough about it! I take 80mg. 2xday and 30mg. Morphine Sulfate IR 3xday &quot;AS NEEDED&quot; for break through pain, which rarely occurs...I wish Pain Management would have prescribed this treatment first! It would have saved 5 years of my life. I've been on ALL of it and this truly works, Good luck with your treatments everyone!

Before Kadian, I been given and tried just about every pain medication known to man.None of them covered the pain like  Kadian does.I also have an IMPLANT which is a SPINAL COLUMN NERVE STIMULATOR.The Stimulator along with the Kadian, my pain is covered 100%. Of course, there are days that both of these together or seperate do not cover my all of my pain. But, I do realize that there is a certain amount of my pain that I just have had to learn to live with. But, this does not mean that all cases are the same. I wouldn't trade my Kadian XR 100mg for anything at all!

I was given a prescription for stool softeners and it didn't help very much. My afternoon dose of 110 mgs. didn't help very much. By the end of the day, I had trouble standing because of increasing pain. Because of my condition, 5 seperate fusion surgeries, followed by psuedo arthrosis and nerve damage, my pain Dr. is at a loss as to what to do for me.

I have c1-c4, then 5,6,7, are fused.All of my lumbar disks are herniated; my sacrum &amp; coccyx are &quot;broken&quot;. Three thorasic disks are herniated. I have used Fentynal(sp), oxycontin,mscontin and more. The Kadian is by far the best drug,for me for the following reasons: Effectiveness, Easier then the others to discontinue,decreases slowly (rather than timeis up &amp; severe pain abruptly appears. Miralax handles constipation nicely. After it was discovered that I had severe stenosis &amp; a bone spur punctured my spinal cord,i took 100mg twice a day. Five years agoP was a passenger in our Acura,when a Toyota Tundra going about 80 mph. Three years later we were hit again. I now take 500mg twice a day. I couldn't live a meaningful life without it. It is very expensive. My insurance COMPANYcharges me $60 A MONTH for qty. 360 of 100mg pills. I hate drugs. I need them &amp; I'm  grateful to have access to Kadian.

Chronic Pain	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	25-34	10/23/2008 3:12:56 PM	I have had neck pain for about 5 years now. I have seen three pain managment doctors. Taken all sorts of pain killers(percocet, vicodin, oxycodone, lyrica, ect....). Have had epidurals and radio frequences branch block. Nothing has worked. My current Doctor gave me kadian 20 mg 2x a day. This pill has done little to nothing for me. I dont know if it is the dose or if it is the medication itself. I hope to find something that works for me soon. I am tired of living with this pain.
Chronic Pain	LIsa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/22/2008 9:15:17 PM	Taking 20mg 2x/day. Terrible constipation. Taking Ultram for breakthrough pain 50mg 2x/day too. Also on 3600mg/day Neurontin, and Robaxin (muscle relaxer). Lots of meds, I know, but still having terrible pain.  4 back surgeries (2 fusions-lower back)in past 3 years. Glad to be off Loritab.  But, wish I knew if a higher dose of Kadian would be helpful.
Severe Pain	corky, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	10/18/2008 3:25:20 PM	Rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia for 18 years over the years have used Darvocet which no longer has much effect on pain, ultram only slightly worked.  The Kadian definitely helps with the pain.  I have tried 3 times using Kadian but always end up totally constipated even taking colace &amp; laxatives, to the point I'm in pain from not going #2.  So 3 times I have stopped the Kadian and all 3 times went into a withdrawal type of depression where I shake and cry for no reason. Guess I will have to suck up some of the pain and stick to some milder pain relievers.  Good luck to anyone using it, I hope you'll be able to take it and get help.

At least the ones that I'm aware of. It has little or no side effects and keeps me pain free 80% of the time. My pain usually increases at the end of the day which seems normal to me.

Other	kelleyred, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	6/30/2008 2:12:51 PM	I was just started on Kadian.. My pain management specialist has me on 10mg 2x daily.. Considering how much pain medication I've had to take in the last year for the Occipital Neuralgia I have, I'm not sure about the dosage. I'm really hoping it will work, but it's hard to find out how long it takes to get into the system. When you're used to that &quot;immediate&quot; effect, it's hard to get used to something that may take up to 2 DAYS to start working. ACK!!! We'll see... but, at the moment, I'm unsure.
Chronic Pain	Neegan Peter, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	6/23/2008 5:39:46 PM	A severe car wreck in 1978 left me with 26 fractures plus a crushed pelvis. They couldn't put humpty back together again and I have lived with severe chronic pain since. Getting help with pain in the 70s and 80s was nonexistant.  Finally in 1988 the Mayo clinic put me in their pain clinic. My local pain clinic, after trying nummerous meds and trigger point injections etc. They finally started me on narcotics.  Now, I take Kadian 200mg per day.  Some days it helps other days it doesn't.  I also take 10/325 hydrocodone up to 5 per day.  I have learned to deal with the constipation by taking 2 Colace stool softeners in the morning with the Kadian and two before going to bed.  I also eat fruit 3 times a day.  Mostly small servings of raisins, or  dark grapes but blueberries and raspberries in season.  I also put wheat bran in my morning oatmeal.  My Dr. gave me a plastic card that give me $50 off per each prescription.  I need two prescriptions each month costing me nearly $300 and I can't afford it much longer.  I need to increase my dosage approx. every 12 to 14 months as it becomes less and less effective as my body becomes used to the drug.  I don't know what comes next after my tolerence level has reached the point where Kadian no longer works.

Everything started when I fell and literally BROKE my tailbone off.And Yes, it hurt. Since then, I have had several falls due to having severe ear infections that have made my equalibrium off.  I went to about 6 doctors that wouldn't even fool with it, they all told me that I would just have to &quot;live with the pain&quot;-- my response- it is not their pain to live with. The last doctor I went to actually listened to my problem and started me on Kadian 50mg 2 times a day. OH MY GOD, WHAT A LIFE SAVER.  This medication has given me a chance to actually live my life instead of sitting inside and waiting for the pain to go away.Thanks to that one doctor, and THANK YOU KADIAN!!!!

My doctor will not change my medication due to upcoming surgery, so I have to grin and bear it.There should be better options rather than make patients suffer.

Chronic Pain	jfdyates, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	55-64	2/28/2008 8:42:26 PM	I HAVE BEEN TAKING KADIAN AND LYRICA FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS AND IT`S DONT KNOCK THE PAIN AS THE FENTANYL PATCHES DID BUT IT DON`T SWEAT YOU. I TOOK THE PATCHES FOR 8 YEARS AND THEY REALLY HELPED IF IT WERENT FOR THE SWEATING. I LIKE THE KADIAN BUT IT JUST DON`T RELIVE MY PAIN FROM 6 BACK SURGERIES AND TWO FUSIONS. I HAVE A NEUROSTIMULATOR BUT IT`S LIKE HAVING A LARGE BOIL TO LAY ON. THE KADIAN ALSO CONSTIPATES YOU SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE GLYCOLAX POWDER SO YOU`RE DARNED IF YOU DO OR DON`T. THE MAIN THING IS TO NOT HAVE SURGERY TO START WITH . I GUESS THIS IS GOOD FOR MODERATE PAIN BUT FOR SEVERE I DON`T KNOW THE ANSWER. I HAVEN`T FOUND ANYTHING IN TWELVE YEARS. 
Severe Pain	southernblubelle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/10/2008 10:31:44 PM	I have DDD and Scoliosis. This has been the only med that has even touched my pain. I have tried going off it several times when I am not in pain, but always come back to it after a day or so, then it takes a few days for it to get back into my system. I do not suggest this. If your on it, stay on it. IT WORKS GREAT!
Chronic Pain	isabel, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/1/2008 1:13:18 AM	I was prescribed Kadian about a year ago after suffering for more than 5 years of neck pain caused by a car accident. I feel this is one of the best most effective pain medications any drug company has come up with so far. I was amazed at the pain relief I've gotten from it with the only noticable side effect being constipation. I went to the Kadian website and they sent me a card that allows me to get Kadian from my pharmacy free of charge when combined with my health insurance coverage. It's definately worth the time to go to their website and see if you can get the same deal. Before it was costing me over $100.00 a month  Yikes!!  
Chronic Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/30/2008 12:08:49 PM	I've been undergoing conservative measures to treat my chronic pain for four years.  I've done everything ever suggested to help relieve my pain and had virtually no success, really, until my physician prescribed the Kadian.  I have only missed one day of work due to my pain in the 18 months I've been taking the medication.  I am very relieved that I do not have to rush into a surgical intervention (which I was on the brink of with the other treatment).  It is so much better to only have to deal with leg pain every day instead of the one entire side of my body!  
Chronic Pain	bjdrich, 45-54 Male  (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Male	45-54	1/26/2008 4:00:41 PM	My pain &quot;doctor&quot;, if you want to call him that, has no concept of what cancer pain can be like.  I do not recommend Kadian as a chronic pain reliever to a real, real pain patient.  Kadian is just something a pharmacy company is making money off of, they must put in nicotine just to addict you because the pain is still present unless you use a good &quot;breakthrough&quot; pain reliever.

Chronic Pain	Marrie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/18/2008 4:48:04 PM	I have had chronic bilaterral leg pain most of my life.  No one has been able to give me a full diagnosis.  I have been taking 100 mg. of Kadian 3 times a day for about 3 years now.  I still have days when I can't do my everyday duties, and the breakthrough pain happens about once a a day, but much less with the Kadian
Severe Pain		4	5	4			1/8/2008 12:01:11 PM	after years of suffering from spinal stenosis and several operations on lower back I am able to reduce the amount of narcotic meds by taking 1 30mg capsule daily and only resorting to other pain relievers for breakthru pain. only issue I can see is the constipation can be hard to deal with

Chronic Pain	marycc, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/24/2007 11:46:05 AM	After getting uneven and insufficient relief with hydrocodone for my lower back pain and sciatica due ostensibly to a herniated disc, the pain clinic I visit put me on 30 mg. once a day of Kadian.  I had instant relief, and it has continued for 3 months.  I've had such complete relief I am thinking of asking to have the dosage reduced, as I am experienceing excessive drowsiness.
Severe Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/15/2007 2:33:44 PM	It has an immediate great sustaining effect but i have been on this medication at 100mg caps for almost 2 yrs and the tolerance that i have has diminished the effectiveness of the med. My pain level was a 8-9 on a daily after the med it went down to a 6-7 and I thank God for the relief that I did have, I pray everyones strength and recovery in the Lord

Even though he has been on the medicine only a short time.  Other than some problems with his memory he is feeling better.  If you are ever in doubt ask your doctor to give more info.  This medicine CANNOT be taken with several other medicines.

Prior to it's use, I've had to sleep in a sitting position due to pain from a spinal injury for the last 6 years. Other than constipation and the criminal price for the medication, it works very well.

I have taken many different drugs trying to help with the pain. It wasn't until my doctor put me on this drug 7 yrs ago that I was able to get some relief. I was very happy with it until about a year ago when I became immune to its affects. I would recommend this drug to anyone with reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Hopefully this helps someone else with this debilitating disease.

It maintains just great. Been taking it for two years. Once I tried to not take it since I felt &quot;all better&quot; that's when I knew just how much this drug does for my comfort. However I still have not been able to stop the chronic constipation.

Have recommended to individual with CRPS also. She &amp; her doctor agree it's good.  There have been times while I was on large doses where I was somewhere between being asleep and being awake. Strange feeling but made the pain less intense.

Chronic Pain	srballantyne, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/21/2007 10:45:44 PM	After years of trigger point injections and cerbrospinal steroid injections, I continued to have severe pain from a damaged nerve casued by a collapse of c6-c7. The nerve pain radiated over my left shoulder and down into my fingers. My life became all about my pain and it was difficult to focus on other important things in my life. The pain clinic that I was seeing put me on methadone for several years which helped a great deal until I became to tolerant to that medication. My doctor suggested the new drug Kadian a time release morphine and now I take one 30mg tab in the morning and 1 at night. My pain is pushed back into the back of my mind and I have been able to resume a normal life. I am an avid sailor and enjoy outdoor activities and yard work. I am a big fan of kadian and have been able to allow my primary care doctor to take over my pain management because I am now stable.
