Sometime when I insert the capsule, it may or may not puncture the capsule. I think it needs to be upgraded. But as far as the medication goes, it has done wonders for me. Thanks God for Merck..

I stopped using &quot;Advir&quot; because it would cause a yeast infection in the back of my throat, even though I used a mouth wash after I used the inhailer.  I would like to know how other people like or dislike &quot;Foradil&quot;.

Most of them have steroid compund and I have an allergic reation to it. Foradil has helped quite a bit. AlsoI have become more active and lost 18lbs. which help quite a bit with my breathing.

Asthma	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	8/17/2009 11:50:51 PM	This medication was HORRIBLE for me. I had a massive negative reaction causing insomnia, panic attacks, and worsening of my asthma. I discontinued after 2 days. I highly, highly reccommend thoroughly discussing with your doctor other options. I am actually amazed that they placed me on this drug as I had heart palpitations with the Advair and they are in the same drug class. I am now on an anti-anxiety med and cannot wait for this junk to clear my system.

Asthma	bj30out, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/17/2009 1:10:27 PM	I have been using Foradil for over 2 years.  It is by far the best asthma medication I've ever taken.  However, I notice a gradual shortness of breath and chest pressure if I miss a dose or it's longer than 12 hrs. since my last inhilation.  I'm wondering if it's addictive ! Also, I just read that it shouldn't be taken as the only treatment for asthma.  I only have to use my albuterol inhaler on occasion, mostly when I forget to take the Foradil.  I'm getting a bit concerned about continuing to use this medication.  
Asthma	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	55-64	2/6/2009 4:50:43 PM	I have  been taking this med about 1 week and I am so exhausted it is all I can do to stay awake all day.  I am a very high energy person, not anymore I am half asleep all day does anyone have a remedity for this problem?  Other than that it is great.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/12/2008 11:21:43 AM	I use this as need for difficulty with breathing associated with Allergies/bronchospasms. I have exprienced some shaking/tremors and tiredness/fatigue. This is short lived.  There is no comparison to the relief I experience vs the side effects.  I have had no blood sugar change or issues.

Other	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/26/2008 5:33:15 PM	Prior to taking this drug I would get extreme shortness of breath and abdominal spasms from the shortest distance I had to walk. After taking this drug I am able to resume my normal daily activity of walking and gardening.  I am using this in conjunction with a water pill (furosemide and Micardis-HCT) all twice a day.

Other	75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male		9/18/2008 2:58:18 PM	I am taking this med for COPD in leiu of the albuteral treatment by mask. I no longer have to use the albuteral treatments. It along with Spiriva appears to be working for me. Shortness of breath continues to be a problem when exercising. Also, I am experencing some dizziness occassionally.

One inhaled capsule in the morning, and I'm symptom-free all day. Another one before bed if needed.  A lifetime of meds and regimens replaced by these little capsules. I haven't noticed blood sugar or fatigue issues, like some users.  I tell everyone I know how wonderful this drug is!

Asthma	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/5/2008 9:51:54 AM	I have taken theophylline pills twice a day for twenty years. I was put on Foradil along with Asthmanex to replace the theophylline and I can't believe the effects. I can breathe better than when I was only taking the theophylline. I was very skeptical about stopping the theophylline &quot;cold turkey&quot;. However, I have had no withdrawal symptoms and my breathing is great.
Asthma	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/31/2007 10:31:31 PM	This medication, combined with Qvar,  works much better for me than the advair I was formerly taking.  I dont wake up short of breath like I did while taking advair.
