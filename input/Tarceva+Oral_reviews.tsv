My hair looks matted and I have about ten itchy sores on my scalp at any given time which haven't gone away! They bleed because I feel the need to scratch them in my sleep. There is always blood spots on my pillow. Now I sleep with a towel on top of my pillow so it can be changed every day. My oncologist tells me to see the skin doctor  and I've gone several times to a dermatologist but I keep hearing the same thing like it will go away. I use a special medicated shampoo. Is there anything that can help? I mean tarceva is my second line of defense and I'm nearly cancer free. I was diagnosed with Lung and Bone cancer (stage 4)the bone cancer is gone!And the lung cancer has shrunk to 15. 2 being cancer free! Any suggestions to deal with the itchy hair matting scalp?

Took weekly chemo Taxol/Carboplatin for 14 months.  Then took Tarceva 150mg for over 2 years and the tumor continued to shrink.  I stopped for 7 months and the cancer appeared to be growing.  Just started back on Tarceva.The side effects are manageable.

She does have some itching but has been able to control it and had a some bout with rashes.  My Mom was given 10% chance of survival and beating lung cancer. 2011 was an awful year but 2012 has given given hope that she will completely beat this.  Tarceva has her cancer free now. She did have chemo and radiation but after all that she still had the tumor in her right lung.

The tumor in my right lung has shrunk and is described as scar tissue now. I have back pain because the cancer had spread to my back originally before being diagnosed. I feel that Tarceva has helped me survive as originally I wasn't given much chance.  I have to stop Tarceva occasionally because of the rash and the way it affects my toes.  Sometimes I stay off it 2 weeks at a time and sometimes only a week.  I currently take the pill every other day as I seem to be able to tolerate it better that way.  It seems to build up toxicity in my system--I would have terrible facial rash and diarrhea with bleeding toe nails.  I am grateful for the drug as I feel it has saved my life!! My doctor says that this is the top line treatment for my cancer. 5/16/12

He was 28 years old at the time. His Dr. prescribed him Tarceva as first line treatment due to my husbands refusal to do anything else. After being told he had up to one year to live, I am happy to say he is still alive. Whenever the tumors disappear, he stops taking it because of the side affects. The Dr. did recommend, lower dosage, for maintenance therapy, but my hubby is stubborn and refuses, so the tumors always come back. ( I recommend doing what your Dr. Says to do, keeping in mind you are your number one advocate.) He is currently taking Tarceva for the 4th time in 8 years. So far, everything is looking good. We received his blood work back yesterday and everything is in normal range.

Six treatments of Taxal/carboplatin and then took Tarceva for 18mos before it stopped working.  Dry skin, cracked cuticles hands/feet.  Have been on Alimta, Taxotere and Gemzar since and have just started Tarceva again.  Original diagnosis was 6-12mos.  My tumor has not grown and no lymph nodes affected.  No growth or changes and am hoping that the Tarceva will carry me along until something new comes on the market. (Age 66, female, non-smoker)

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	11/6/2011 7:58:47 PM	I'm 37, never smoked a cigarette in my life, diagnosed with metastatic NSCL in Feb 2011 after a series of respiratory infections, pneumonia and a chronic cough. I received chemo for 5 months, my cycles ran 2 weeks on, 1 week off. I initially started Tarceva in July, 150 mgs daily. I didn't do so well as I had the awful facial rash, nausea/vomiting, loss of appetite and rapid weight loss.  My oncologist switched to every other day for a few weeks. Currently my dosage is 100 mgs daily.  I am still dealing with the rash (facial, chest, shoulders, and now on below the knees to my ankles). Hydrocortisone cream has helped. My skin is extremely dry and painful. Vanicream gives me some relief. I have neuropathy in my fingers on both hands and fatigue (this has gotten better). I have not had any issues with diarrhea, shortness of breath, eyesight, nose/mouth sores. My last CTs showed that Tarceva is indeed working for me. The tumor in my lung shrunk from 4 cm to 2.5 cm. The lesions in my left and right lungs have become scar tissue or continue to shrink, and the lesions on my brain have turned to scar tissue as well. Even though I do not like the side effects from Tarceva, it is working and has given me a second chance at life.

Had surgery to remove top lob on  right side and third rib. I was on tarceva as a second round of chemo. Had to be taken off because of side effects. Put on Alitma now after 1year my pt/cat scan showed two marks on the 4th and 5th rib.This could be residual and showing up now that my body is getting immune to the Alitma or they can be new tumors. I started the Tarceva Nov6th. Now I just wait to see which side effects I get and if the Tarceva will work in getting rid of the tumors. I am told that I am beating the odds now by surviving 2 years. I hope that I can keep it up and survive as long as some of you have. I will update as things happen.

I took the chemo for a year until the Tarceva became available in 2004. I have been taking 100 mg for over 5 years. The tumors have been in remission in my lung for 5 years. All check ups satisfactory. As you are aware we are all different. I have the common side effects.I have fatigue and diarrhea side effects along with rash. Heat will aggravate the rash. Hot weather will not be your friend.You may also experience dry skin and nail splitting. For the diarrhea I keep 1 ammonium AD pill in my pocket for those timeit becomes a problem.  The longer you use the Tarceva the better you are able tohandle the side effects.  This has been a God send for me and my family. I thank God everyday for this medication.

Took 6mos of chemo of Carboplaten and Alimta. Cancer went into remission. Started Tarceva 12/08 and have been on it every since. At 150mg had several side effects, then onc.dropped me to 100mg. Still had a few side effects mostly related to sore and split fingers. I am now on 75mg for a month and have no side effects. Cancer tumors have turned to scar tissue. I thank God everyday for blessing me that I am still alive and feel healthy. I pray that it continues to work. I am interested to know how long one can take this medication without it harming other parts of the body.

I have been on tarceva for 1 year so far it seems to be working. No complications except at the begin with the pimples were terrible.

Her biggest problem is the skin on her legs, back of neck and scalp is breaking down.  She has large opened sores.  Has anyone else experienced this?  The tumors in her lungs are slowly shrinking.  She started on 150MG but her eyes and nose became infected, so she is now on 100MG.  It's an effective drug if you can tolerate it.  If anyone needs help financially with  Tarceva, contact Genentech- the manufacturer.  My mom doesn't pay anything for this drug.  God Bless!

She broke out in hives within 45 mins and then half an hour after that she got dizzy, fell, violently vomited, both arms went numb, and had seizure like shakes. We took her to the ER. She had an allergic reaction and now cannot take the drug. Has anyone else had this allergic reaction?

My face felt like it was on fire.  Ice packs helped.  I went in to see the nurse and she said my &quot;rash&quot; was not at all typical, discontinue the drug for now.  I had very high hopes and am still hoping my oncologist will find a way to make this work.  The itchy, sandpaper eyes and the darkened skin around the eyes were very  uncomfortable.  Benedryl helped, too.

He developed a very bad rash, which should indicate that the drugs were working -- NOT! The side effects were pretty tolerably; he was on pain meds so that balanced out the diarrhea. Pancreatic cancer is just a horrible disease; my husband passed away last week, 6 months after diagnosis. 
Cancer of the Pancreas	Astrid, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	11/1/2009 6:06:24 PM	My mother was diagnosed with Stage IV Pancreatic cancer.  After 4 session of Gemzar chemo with no reduction in tumor size and increasing 19-9 counts, the oncologist recommeded the usage of Tarceva in conjunction with the Gemzar. Reading the information in the package was scary enough for my my mom - indicated that pancreatic cancer patients taking this medication in conjuction with standard chemo lived, on average, 2 weeks longer.  But, trying to maintain positive and beat the odds of her terrible disease, my mom began the medication.  Within days she experienced a severe rash all over her face.  All self esteem she had was destroyed.  Until that point, she did not look like a sick person and was able to continue with her job as normal. She immediately discontinued usage, and her rash was gone a month later.  Though she remained alive for another 12 weeks, I am sure the Tarceva was the turning point for her with her disease; it dimished the positive attitude required to combat this condition. Pancreatic cancer patients -please speak frankly with your oncologist about the pros and cons of this drug.

The side of effects of this med are tough, facial rash, dry skin, fatigue, and loss of appetite.  This med was unafective in this case.  I was told that the drug works best on never before smokers, or with the genetic markers that are characteristic of Asian females.  Please use caution with this drug.  If it works for you - God Bless.  If it does'nt show results, then don't punish yourself.  I think this med is overated, and certainly overpriced.  My advise is to discuss this fully with your oncologist.  Best of Luck to those with this terrible disease.

The rash on my face, especially around my nose, mouth and chin is extremely uncomfortable--itching, burning, red with white pus--horrible to look at!!!  So far the diarrhea is somewhat manageable with Immodium.  I do not have much of an appetite and cannot sleep very well due to the burning of my face, eyes, scalp, etc.  I will have a follow-up ct scan in 3 weeks.  I don't know if I can live with this terrible rash.  I have been told to use hydro-cortisone cream with an equal part of vaseline, but it burns even more.  I have been using cold, wet compresses on the affected area for some relief.

Other	suzyfromsaco, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	4/14/2009 5:50:54 PM	I began Tarceva once daily. At the end of the 7th day of dosage, severe rash on face, neck and upper chest region. Diarreha (sp.) decrease in taste, mouth sores, very dry skin, skin on feet would peel off in small sheets like paper, irritation in swallowing (small sips of drink and small bits of food for comfortability in eating). Pain and dryness in eyes, with minor neuropathy, banging in ears, nervousness.Doctor rescheduled my dosage every third day.  This seem was easier on body, but side effects did not disappear, continued side effects in smaller proportion.  Time on Tarceva, 6 months.  I am currently off Tarceva, until June which a CT Scan will be taken to see how cancer is &quot;stewing&quot;. I am also having &quot;withdrawal&quot; symptoms from Tarceva, eyes are not so painful, nerves and fatigue are issues now.  Pace myself daily with daily chores, walks, does help. Naps are a necessity in afternoon due to these effects.  I have been challenged with cancer now for ll years,  I'm still breathing and still here on God's great earth.  My cancer was finally given a name at Dana Farber in Boston called Thymoma Cancer (from the Thymus Gland in center of chest)  It surely has been a &quot;ride&quot; all these years, but i have been fortunate that my cancer has not spread.  It has made its home in my left chest region as well as my center chest region with several lesions.  Hang in there guys! God loves you and so do I !

The medication did nothing except drain our pocket of US4250, yes this what we used to pay every month in Lebanon hoping it will help her or at least reduce  the pain or prevent the cancer from spreading . She passed away on January 27 2009. I hope all other patient with lung cancer will survive and live long. In memory of my sister Fawzieh

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/10/2009 7:32:22 PM	I am non smoker diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer in the spring of 2007.  My tumor could only be treated by chemo.  After first treatment the cancer was quiet for about 10 months.  I couldn't tolerate the 2nd round of chemo.  My oncologist started me on 150mg of Tarceva.  I had a severe skin rash, mouth &amp; nose sores, etc. after 5 days on the drug.  He immediately stopped treatment, I recovered in 5 days.  He lowered the dose to 100mg, I take it for 5 days and off 2 each week. I have been able to tolerate it quite well after 6 mos. When started cancer was agressive and had spread to other lung and in my chest.  After starting Tarceva, the first CAT scan showed all cancer cleared up except for the original tumor, which has been progressively decreasing since.  I do have a fatigue that comes and goes with other slight side effects.  So far this drug is truly saving my life.  I thank God for it.

Temor  has been stable for two years now.  Side effects can be managed. The most inconvenient side effect has been diahrehia but managed with Immodium.

I have used  creme to help the rash go away or at least not very noticable and diarrhoea which I have been able to control with Loperamide.  I only wish that this drug is available on the NHS as my insurance company will only pay for the drug until December (another 3 months) and I feel that this drug is working exceptionally well for me - its keeping me alive
Other	b1hearin, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	9/24/2008 12:37:32 AM	I have been diagnosed with displasia of the lining of the mouth. I started the drug sept 9 2008, it took 4 days for any symptoms of the drug to appear. Unfortunally hurricane IKE was hitting shore on the 5th day. By the 8th day of taking the drug symptoms were severe Rash bleeding on face and checst, diareaha after eating, 101 fever. ended up with cellulitis, kidneys near failure, ICU for 5 days 8 days total stay after 3 week still have rash 2000 white heads on my face alone. Be VERY CAREFULL with this drug. report any symptoms to your doctor immedately as they can turn severe with in 24 hrs. This drug helps many people it just will not work with my body. If you have to take this drug remain in close contact with your doctor and have a plan fi you cannot get intouch with your doctor. Notify your emergency room and have them keep a file on this drug as many doctors know nothing about this drug. Good luck to you
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	9/16/2008 4:56:02 PM	I started taking Tarceva in Sept 2005.  At first I was taking 150 mg but my doctor reduced it to 75 mg because of the extreme diarrhea and terrible rash on my face.  I am still taking it (September 2008) and although I still have problems with diarrhea I am alive and still working.  I will be 68 in October and have been able to enjoy my life and see my grandchildren grow.  I am married to a wonderful man and we enjoy life and each other.  I do not know how long this will all last but I know that without the Tarceva I probably would not be alive.  I have a PET scan every six months and will be due again in November.  I will try to write you again and tell you how I am doing.
Other	 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	3	1			7/21/2008 9:58:19 PM	My father had mesothelioma.He had been taking other chemo and improving.When the improvement slowed and then stopped,he was switched to Tarceva.In three weeks,he was dead.He lost several pounds a week,had explosive diarrhia,and suffered from dehydration,even while taking in a normal amount of water.The drug was stopped,but the problems continued.The first two weeks he had no strong reaction other than weight loss,but the last week devastated him,the onset of severe adverse reactions taking place in less than a day,and continuing even after the drug was stopped.Remember,Tarceva is a drug of last resort,but if the doctor prescribing it isn't very attentive to the reaction of the patient,it can be very deadly,very quickly.This occurred in southeast Virginia,so if you are using an oncologist in this area,remember that some of them aren't very up to date on the side effects and aren't too attentive to patients using this drug,sometimes not even returning calls.Use extreme caution in taking this drug,and make sure the doctor will be available to the patient immediately if adverse reactions occur,as time is short between onset and fatal adverse reaction to the drug.

She had the standatd chemotherapy for about 2 months, then after a break, she had 15 Radiation treatments on her lower spine (5th Lumbar). then she was place on a study using Avastin IV and Tarceva oral (150mg). She has been on this combo for over 1 year. overall, it has stopped the growth of the tumor in her lung-the radiated tumor never came back. However, the neuropathy she experiences is sometimes overwhelming- coughing, sneezing hurt her, her hands and feet have always tingled and hurt-sometimes quite a lot. Nothing has been effective to reduce this problem. Her Dr.receintly stopped the Tarceva after she ecperienced so many of the side effects all at once. Weight loss, rash(s), mouth sores, split lip/ finger tips. after being off of the drug for 5 days, she returned to normal. After two weeks the Dr. put her back on the drug at a lower dose 100 mg vs 150mg. She experienced rectal bleeding two weeks ago so the Dr stopped the every three week dose of Avastin-a Colonoscopy has been scheduled... the latest problem is Foot-drop.But the real important thing is that the combination of the two drugs do work. She had CT scans about every 6 weeks and they always show that the tumor is stable-no growth. and there is no growth anywhere else!
