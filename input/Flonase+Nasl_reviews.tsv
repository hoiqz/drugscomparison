Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	dpbrick, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	8/21/2012 3:08:34 PM	I don't know about all the side effects reported here.  Perhaps some people are more sensitive than others, or perhaps some people aren't following the recommended dosage.  I'm not questioning the reports; just stating my own experience. I have had nothing but great results with this drug, using it conjunction with fexofenadine.  Generally I use one spray in each nostril, twice each day, once in the am, and once in the pm.  I start using it only when fexofenadine, used alone, can no longer control my seasonal allergy symptoms.  I discontinue use, generally about the time of our first frost.I'm been very happy with it over about the last 4 yrs.  I don't like the idea of taking any medication every day, but when you can't talk without dripping nasal discharge, this is an alternative that works.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	1	Male	3-6	8/7/2012 10:32:37 PM	My son has been taking the generic of this drug and it works AMAZING for his allergies.  HOWEVER, side effects are extreme aggression, hitting, throwing things, not all all himself, and says he just feels sad :(  - he just turned 6.  not worth it, looking for something else!
Other	KitKat, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	7/18/2012 7:34:34 PM	My experience is ongoing with possible Acid Reflux side effect. The anxiety is gone, except that I worry now about loss of taste, smell and normal nasal passages.  Also, not sure of night vision yet. How long do these side effects last and can you overcome them?  I think I may have administered wrong by going into my nostril instead of inserting only the tip. I just keep hoping for the best, but the sore throat and heartburn won't go away. Suggestions? :(
Other	KitKat, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	7/6/2012 8:24:14 PM	A very dangerous drug that should not be given out on a whim.  I used to be healthy, now have Acid Reflux and smell and taste issues from this drug. Never again! Anyone here thinking about it better do some long term research and weigh the risks.  Glaucoma?  A possible side effect?  Why would you take it?  Wish I had learned more about it, I cannot say that enough.  This was I believe the biggest health mistake I have ever made.  Wish I could take that one day back. Now, just trying to recover.

It works. My acne has been worse during these years (coincidence?) and I have a bad case of eye floaters (coincidence?), but I can breathe. I am 39 years old and have also experienced weight gain, but think this is more likely due to lack of exercise and natural progression of things at my age. My sense of smell is very acute...no side effects there.

Also used Alegra-D for that three weel period. 63 old male.

I've been using daily for 2 years &amp; recently ran out of it.  I was to busy to fill the presciption &amp; guess what?  I'm much more calm, and relaxed without this stuff.

I also experienced palpitations and general anxiety. Discontinued and feel much better by using a natural nasal rinse method to wash my sinuses. I'll never use again because of this horrible side effect.

I have been using generic Flonase for about 4 days. My vision is blurry,headaches,nasusa,heavyness in my chest, achy and tight in my chest and really hard breathing. It does work to open up my nose but that doesn't make any difference if I smother to death in the process. Be aware of this product. I haven't been out of the house since I started this medication. Am also weak and have pain in my knees and swelling in feet/ankles, and in my face and throat. Will not take this again.
Chronic Inflammation of the Nose Not due to Allergies	Kris, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/23/2012 5:52:36 PM	I have been on and off the generic for a little over a year. It started for seasonal allergies, but now I am on it full time. I also take generic for albuterol, advair, an epinephrine inhaler, zyrtec-d for am, zyrtec for pm, ibuprophen, prednisone, and do simply saline irrigations. Last fall the zyrtec, flonase, and occasional albuterol were enough but now I can't breath at all with out this whole regimen. I am not blaming the increased severity of asthma on the flonase, my symptoms get drastically worse each year anyway and the doc suspects a possible underlying auto-immune disorder. The steroids have actually eased chronic joint pain that I always have. I haven't so far had the reactions described by others(some of the minor ones, at first, but they subsided after the first few months), many of what people are describing as reactions describe how I feel everyday without this medication, but if anything, those particular symptoms have improved or not changed. I'm an artist with a predisposition to glaucoma and can't afford to suffer the negative visual side-effects, but still take this medication combined with more frequent visits to the eye doc because of the benefits of being able to breathe. Please remember that this is a steroid (I hate that I'm always on 3 or 4 but can't breathe otherwise)and if you can get by without taking steroids, that's usually better for most people. I wouldn't recommend using this drug if an oral antihistamine works for you, but would recommend it to people who aren't helped enough without steroids.
Other	TF2012, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	1/30/2012 11:44:36 AM	My husband and I were put on this for chronic sinus pain (clogged sinuses). He was ok after one use! I used it for the first time and my heart rate shot up to 110bpm. I felt like I was having a panic attack. Then, an hour later, my sinuses drained with such ferocity that I had a coughing fit that lasted an hour. I will never take it again. Meanwhile, today, the day after, my sinuses are 10x more painful, also my ears, eustacian tubes and throat are all very sore- worse than they ever were without the drug. I'm going to invest in a neti pot and try to go the natural route.

One squirt per day in each nostril. It did help with the swelling, but I experienced a side effrct I wasn't expecting. After one month of use, I had a shortened menstrual cycle, and the following month my period was, for the most part, non-existent. I have always had regular cycles so this was very strange. After discontinuing the spray, my cycle is slowly getting back on track. Not worth continuing use of the spray.

Its worked quite well but now I that it is causing my nasal passages to dry out so bad I'm blowing out dried blood (GROSS). My sinus issues have moved from the left side of my face to the right. I think I will ween myself off of this until I can get an appointment and have her prescribe me something else. Maybe I'll use Ocean in the meantime.

I live a very healthy life so my doctors were puzzled as to why I had put on 15 pounds. they tested my blood and all things were fine, they came to the conclusion it was the flonase.  I miss my old body before flonase I now have stretch marks and cannot wear my pants.  the weight is coming off slowely.  I wouldnt recomend this product if you are sensitive to cortico steroids .

I used it at night before bedtime and it helped with breathing. Also slowed mucus from post nasal drip.I thought I knew about any possible side effects but there is one side effect that is rare...glaucoma. I awoke with the most terrible pain ever and experienced vomiting and trouble opening my eye. The pupil looked as if it had been dialated. Went to my Opthomologist. He diagnosed Angle Closure Glaucoma attack. My eye pressure was over three times the normal range. Doctor and staff worked for over two hours trying to get the pressure down and he finally performed a lazer procedure. Very dangerous and scary situation. I had just had my eye exam a few months prior and no sign of cataracts or glaucoma. Even though this is an unusual and rare side effect it should be made more known to people using the Flonase product. I could have and may still suffer some vision loss.

I used the product for about 5 months.  The symptoms were better but never gone.  I had medication from a dermatologist which eased symptoms but they did not go away until I stopped the flonase.   I also developed 3 skin cancer spots, needing removal during use.  I now have a more severe asthma and must take 3 different allergy medications to stop the cough and constant nasal drip.  I have trouble with most steroids  but this was the worst.  I also gained 5 lbs during treatment.I am sorry I used this treatment.   I did not get better but I got worse.

After taking it for a while, his hearing improved, but a lot of fluid hadn't drained. The doctor upped the dosage, and suddenly my son developed this weird head-shaking tic. We aren't 100 percent sure it's a side effect, so I was wondering if anyone had experienced anything similar.

When I first developed the symptoms, I thought it was just my body adjusting. I had been divinely healed of fibromyalgia after 5 and 1/2 years. I thought maybe I was exercising too hard and my body was just reacting. Then I thought this is about the time I started using Flonase. I used it for about 4 weeks. I developed three conditions:  asthma-like symptoms-difficulty breathing/like my throat was partially closed/wheezing and coughing &amp; extreme anxiety &amp; occular migraine-type headaches. I am weaning myself off it. I cut down this morning to about 1/2 spray in each nostril, and the symptoms went about about 90 per cent. I guess I found the culprit. I am going to use a over-the-counter nasal saline spray to keep my nose and sinuses lubricated.

I live in a valley in Oregon and it is a very moist and dusty pollenated valley This is teh Only med that relieves me completely. Unlike others I have never heard of taking other meds with Flonase. I do know that taking according to directions is imperative. I take this med because it has no interaction with my other meds for depression etc. Please make sure you are taking it correctly and that your other antihistamines are not reacting. thank You so much for yur in put

It keeps my nasal passages clear. I have been relatively free of side effects, apart from some slight bleeding when I have been using it for an extended period. Since the alternative is usually a sinus infection, I'm ok with that.

He felt that the medicine would help open the sinus passages to my ears as well.  After using 2 puffs in each nostril 1 x a day for one week I still had the problem in my ears. I also have become constipated with abdominal cramping and just now realized this problem began the day after I started this medication. I am stopping it today and hope I can get back to normal. By the way, my ears started clearing today after I took ibuprophen.
Other	az, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	4/10/2011 12:20:27 AM	I was prescribed this drug because I had a cough lingering after a recent cold.  All other symptoms of my cold had subsided (sore throat, nasal congestion, fever).  I've used this drug (one spray in each nostril) 5 times in the last three days.  About an hour after the last use, I noticed I could not smell or taste anything.  Also, my throat is getting sore.  As soon as I noticed the loss of smell/taste, I thoroughly rinsed my nose with a nasal saline rinse (which the doctor also recommended).  Sense of smell and taste are now returning.  The doctor also prescribed a cough suppressant (benzonatate) and recommended taking Sudafed until the Flonase kicked in.  If losing my sense of taste and smell is evidence of the Flonase &quot;kicking in&quot;, I'll pass.

After about 3 days started to feel really good, but after that came the side effects. Anxiety, backaches but worst of all numbness on the left side of my nose and also around my mouth and a little into the cheek.  Thought I might be having a stroke and had to go to the emergency room.  Stopped using Flonase and backaches and anxiety gone but still have a little numbness around the mouth area.  Hope this goes away.  I'll just use a nasal saline spray along with the neti pot.

It works great for me. I go from stuffed up misery and headaches to breathing normally again. I prefer this spray to decongestant pills because I don't like to take pills too often. Plus I don't like the bad side effects from the pills. This spray works immediately and is long lasting too. It opens up my sinus passages and relieves that pressure. I haven't noticed any bad side effects. Sometimes the spray trickles down the back of my throat. I don't swallow this residue but spit that out. Doing this may reduce the side effects. Recommended!

Since being on flonase, I have not had a single sinus infection and don't even seem to have allergies anymore. I have gone from visiting the doctor several times per year to once a year for my annual check-up. I've been on the drug daily for three years and have had no side effects.

It worked well almost immediately.  Since then, I have gradually experienced the following side effects: dry inside of nose acne (I used to have some very slight acne from time to time, but it got much worse and spread to my chest) enlarged face around my cheeks and jawline irregular periods worsened night visionI stopped the medication 2 weeks ago and my acne has completely cleared up.  I'm hoping everything else will go back to normal, too.

Never had migrains prior.  The only different thing I was doing was using Flonase.  I haven't used Flonase in 3 days and so far so good - I'll see what happens.  Very scary experience.  I won't use it again.

I noticed, first with the Nasacort, that my sense of smell was a bit &quot;off&quot;: kept smelling a bit of &quot;Cinnamon&quot; (I thought) the first year. Second year--smelled like &quot;Grasses&quot; ...not too bad.At some point I switched to the Flonase. Now I started smelling things like garbage and rot(!) All while doing GREAT for my allergy symptoms. However, I noticed it was taking longer for &quot;normal&quot; smell to return after season; and finally it got where I was waiting longer &amp; longer for ANY smell to return! (This can start affecting taste as well.)This concerned me seriously, and I won't use it any more. Tried something else last year (put in me in deep drowse by day 3)--and still trying to decide if I will try the Omnaris my doc has provided. I may just stick with Claritin/Fexofenidine.

I had the flu late March; two weeks later, I was nearly deaf from fluid in my ears.  My doctor prescribed Flonase.  I've found it makes me dizzy, while walking, while sitting in the car driving, etc.  I've been unable to figure out why I keep awakening during the night (thinking maybe it was my painful shoulder); now I'm beginning to believe it's Flonase...not worth it, I'm stopping this drug.

After years or suffering with migraines, sinus infections &amp; sinus headaches I finally gave in &amp; saw someone.  To my shock the specialist told me had sinus polyps! These are caused by allergies, which bring on the sinus headaches, which turns into a blinding migraine.  After a painful surgery of having them removed, I was prescribed an ongoing treatment of Flonase once a day with Rhinocort. Of course the first step is a 8 oz. saline flush. Yes the polyps are back, that happened only 6 weeks after surgery.  But this with the Rhinocort are the only thing that knock down the swelling internally enough minimize the blinding migraines.  There were actually weeks at time I couldn't even work because of them.  So for all the negative effects it may have, which some I can compensated for, I don't think I could function without it. I know this because I've tried. I went off of them (Flonase &amp; Rhinocort) for almost year. What a mistake!I paid dearly for it.  So if your side effects aren't severe, as some are, you might want to reconsider.  You might even want to see if your allergies are severe enough, if you have polyps.  The polyps make it impossible for your sinuses to drain &amp; in my case, at times my eyes would swell shut. My surgeon never has realised me, but thank God for the wonders of science!
Other	Elsie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	5/3/2010 11:41:42 PM	After my allergies caused a bad ear ache (Eustachian tube dysfunction) I went to the dr. who prescribed me Flonase. Within hours I developed a headache and just a fuziness that prevents concentration- which hasn't gone away since.  That night I began waking up at 3 am and haven't slept longer than 4.5 hours since starting taking it.  I noticed the loss of taste and appetite within a day or two, followed by loss of appetite (and really, there isn't much point in eating since there is no taste). After about 4 days I noticed anxiety and feeling on edge. Now I have been dealing with diarrhea- sever diarrhea. I'm not digesting food (it is coming out undigested which I have never seen or heard of before). So on top of not eating much, when I do I am in the bathroom within an hour. I have also been feeling feverish. I go from profound sweating to freezing.   I have lost about 3 pounds in 6 days. All of that while I have not been doing my usual workout routine of runing 25 miles a week. I do not have the energy to run and the heart racing makes it impossible. I tried for the first time today and after 10 minutes I thought I might collapse. I emailed my doctor to find out what else will help my ear ache (because it is not gone yet!).

I use the generic version. Because I am extremely sensitive to cortosteroids, I cannot take the two sprays a day because it makes me anxious and can trigger a hypomanic episode (I have bipolar II). It does not seem to affect my weight as system steroids have done to me in the past. I only use it from early March until the end of May because I am horribly allergic to tree pollen. If I didn't use it, I'd have asthma and laryngitis for three months, which was the story of my life for most of life until I was finally diagnosed in my 40s. I highly recommend this product!

I have so much nasal congestion many times I choke on it.  I asked my ENT to prescribe Flonase and used it for 3-4 months.  The nasal congestion is gone, but now my tongue feels like it has mold growing on it and I have the worst taste in my mouth that will not go away.  I quit using the Flonase six days ago and the horrible taste is starting to go away.  I don't know if the two are related but I would rather be full of congestion that have that disgusting taste in my mouth.

This stuff took a couple of weeks to &quot;kick in&quot;, but once it finally did my headaches mostly disappeared. I still get moderate sinus headaches on occasion, but nothing like what I had before.  I used this medication for a year with no major side effects.*  However, in the last 3 months I have begun experiencing minor nose bleeds about once a week, usually triggered by blowing my nose.  I also get a little bit of blood almost every time I blow my nose.  So far, this hasn't been bothersome enough for me to stop taking the medication. *Note: A minor side effect (not mentioned in any of the literature) that I have noticed from the beginning is that I have more boogers that I used to.  I find myself blowing my nose a lot more because of this.  Annoying, but not truly bothersome.

I find this product effective, but don't know why for the life of me the FDA allowed them to add phenethanol.. the &quot;rose smell&quot;. I sniff enough chemicals. I don't like shooting phenethanol right on my olfactory receptors. I don't imagine fluticasone does them much good, let alone adding this ingredient, which is also known to cause numbing of tissue.

Found it to be very ineffective for my non-allergic rhinitis.  Also has a nasty smell/sensation when sprayed. I have never used actual Flonase so the generic may or may not behave much like the original product.  I highly recommend Rhinocort.  I've been using it for 3-4 years and have found it very effective for non-allergic rhinitis, with no noticible side effects.

I agree with some of the other feedback that talks about how nasty this stuff tastes at the back of your throat, but it is the only medication that has completely cured the coughing.  I have noticed a tendency to get severe headaches since I started on this medicine, but believe me, ANYTHING is better than coughing all day and all night!!  Also, someone posted complaining that there isn't a generic equivalent available...there is, it's called Fluticasone Propianate Nasal Spray.

As for myself, the brand name works very well, but the generic was relatively ineffective.  I noticed no side effects from either, but I am really curious as to the big difference in my results of generic vs brand name.  And I wonder how many of  those reporting problems were using the generic.  Normally I am NOT anti-generic, but as for this drug I'll stay with the brand name as long as possible.

Other	None, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/19/2009 7:43:21 AM	I have lost my sense of smell &amp; taste for 6 months now and I am only 50.  I pray it will come back.  It has been so frustrating over the last 6 months, the loss is terrible.  I have been to my doctor and a specialist who only suggested that a full sinus/brain scan could check for a tumor. But some people just lose it.  Since the new information on it just came to me that I did try 1 spray in each nostril of Flonaise back in December.  Since I did not notice a difference I didn't use it agin the next day or thereafter.  Now I realize that the one time I used Flonase is the reason I have lost my senes.  I had been on Nasalcort for years prior and been very pleased but it began to lose it's effectiveness.  I just wish there was some way to find out if the senses will come back sometime but I do not know where to find out.  It was only one time and this should not have happened.

Went back to the Dr. and she told me how to use it properly. Shake, prime, insert high in the nose and point it towards the inner eye.  After I used it correctly I found it worked great.  I take it once a day.  Have not had any side affects.  You need to wean off of it.

Chronic Inflammation of the Nose Not due to Allergies	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	4/14/2009 3:16:31 PM	After 2 weeks of usage, my sinuses were never fully clear and I developed severe bloody noses like never before, sometimes 2-3 per day.  I'd rather live with the inflamed sinuses before having to worry about a bloody nose every time I blew my nose!
Other	angel eyes, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	4/2/2009 5:47:34 PM	I was prescribed Flonase after having chronic sinus infections due to allergies. I immediately developed a terrible dry cough and lung irritation and my nose began to bleed after 2 days of treatment. The smell and taste it left in my mouth was awful. Im forced to dicontinue use because although it helped open my sinus and nasal passages the cough and irritation is more than I can stand.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female		4/2/2009 2:04:24 PM	Major pain in teeth on right side, pain moved around--not the same tooth or teeth all the time.  I was NOT having significant sinus symptoms.  However, my dentist said he thought the pain was due to sinus inflamation.  My primary doc prescribed the generic Flonase.  I had never used nose spray before as I have only had sinus infections a few times in my life.  But I was willing to try anything.  It took 2-3 weeks, but the tooth pain cleared up.  I cont. taking it for about a week and then stopped.  Now only use it for a few days when I feel the tooth pain returning.  Don't know if that's the proper way to treat, but I'm not anxious to use steroids all the time, and hope this is not going to be a continuing problem for me.

I have only used Flonase (actually the generic equivalent) for two months and I am starting to blow out small amounts of dark colored blood from my nose. I did not have this problem before I started using this product. Nasonex did not help my sinuses either, but I did not have any bleeding problems and it is much more expensive. I will not be trying any more nasal sprays.

However, I have been taking over 5 years and now my nose bleeds quite often and the inside and outside of my nose hurts. I am afraid to discontinue, I don't want another sinus infection. But I may have to because the bleeding is not getting any better. 
Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/22/2008 8:51:19 AM	I'm never a fan of using drugs long term but with chronic sinus problems that were very dibilitating the only drug I found to work was Flonase(and I tried everything). Used it for 2 years with great results, and every time I went off from feeling better, symptoms came right back.  The doc verified no major side effects from long term use, so one shot in the morning is worth it to avoid terrible sinus problems.  Please note, drug requires 1/2 weeks use before it becomes effective so be patient, if you don't have any bad side effects it could drastically improve you quality of living! 
Other	mr bill, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	25-34	12/22/2008 12:47:00 AM	I have had chronic sinusitis from who knows what (allergies? bad genes?) for about 10 years. I would have a sinus infection for 90% of the year. Any time I got a cold, my sinuses would immediately get stopped up and turn into a full blown infection that would be terrible for a few weeks and then just become a low grade infection. I started taking flonase along with claritin and my symptoms all but went away. What a relief, until the MAJOR HEADACHES started plaguing me. I stopped taking the flonase for a few days and the headaches went away immediately. I tried using it again today (after I got stuffy again) and now I have a major headache again. I haven't had any headaches on any regular basis for 20+ years.It works, and I wish I didn't have to stop, but these headaches are brutal and just not worth it.

HOWEVER, after six weeks of using the drug, I have finally located the source of stress in my life: FLONASE.  I have been overly anxious, unable to focus, filled with anxiety that I didn't even think I had (causing me to make some VERY bad decisions), unable to sleep properly, having very vivid dreams, AND RAPID WEIGHT GAIN.  I gained twenty pounds since I've started taking Flonase.  I am going back to using Advil Cold/Sinus and using my Neti Pot.  I will deal with phlegm as long as I can be myself again.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	I'm_IL_LY, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/22/2008 11:19:17 PM	I've always suffered with allergy rhinitis and ended up with a horribly stuffy nose. This is the first product that has ever relieved and reversed the situation. Take note that you must use the medicine as directed. When I was first prescribed this medicine my nose had literally locked up. From all the blowing of mucus and the increased inflammation I could not breath out my nose at all. My doctor prescribed this to me along with pseudoephedrine and Zyrtec and by that night I could start to breath through my nose again. At that time my prescription was to take one spray up each nostril a day. I followed the instructions that came with the spray recently because my nasal congestion was very painful again. I used 2 sprays a day. One when I woke up and one when I went to bed. Finally, my symptoms have subsided and my inflamation has went down and I can breath again. I could breath better after about 3 days. Although its a slow acting medicine at times, because it takes repeated use, it does work which many nasal sprays across the counter rarely do. I've now switched back to one spray a day and will stop using it after this week is over with. For me, I don't have to use this product everyday/all the time. I use it for my symptoms, then I use it for another week after my symptoms are gone and I'm alright. Every now and then I may use a spray up each nostril when I feel that pressure in my nose as if my allergies are going to go hay wire or when I sneeze alot. I would highly recommend this product.

This took about two days to make a difference, which totally took away the pain and swelling in my sinuses.  Yes, it is like snorting rosewater (that's what it smells like), and I make sure to look down as I squirt it so that it goes where it should.  Other than that, I'm satified with it.

Flonase really helped treat that stuffy feeling in my nose. It was great for like 3 months after which I started getting more and more headaches until my life was one long unending headache. It was really too much and I abruptly stopped it. That was a stupid thing to do, I should have told my doctor and tapered of the dose. Anyway, the headaches stopped and I switched to rhinocort aqua which screwed with my sense of smell.

It works great for my allergies but I stopped taking both last night because of the terrible side-effects.  I have a hard time falling asleep, vivid dreams, wake up waay too early and can't go back to sleep.  I have a thickness at the back of my throat and a tightness in my chest and throat.  I am also really really irratable and achey.  I am going to try just a saline spray and back to clariten, it doesn't work as well but the side effects aren't worth it.

The problem with me is that I start to feel better and forget to use it. I have placed it on my beside to help me remember to use it each night and that has helped. It takes a few days to get the full benefit of the drug but it does work. I had horrible headaches before taking the med and that cleared up a few days after beginning. I was so stuffed up the doctor recommended using a nasal spray like Afrin for the first couple of days along with the Flonase. I used the Afrin about an hour before using the Flonase and with in two days my symptoms were gone. It works for me!Consistency is the key to this drug.

It smells like roses, which aggravates my asthma, which is why I quit it before. It gives me godawful headaches and feels like I'm squirting sulfuric acid up my nose. I don't see how this is beneficial but I'm tired of decongestants I have to get ID'd every 10 days just to buy and my insurance covers it. My vision is blurry since I started using it and the headaches make it difficult to concentrate. I still don't like this drug.
