Works like a dream (still get mild heat induced hives but not as severe and short lived) and I have not experienced any negative side effects.  Makes me a little drowsy but I take it before bed and am still able to get up early and go work out without any residual sleepiness.

Since starting this generic form, I have been much better.  i don't know enough about this drug but it has been a tremendous relief for me.

Persistent Hives of Unknown Cause	karmacc, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	8/1/2011 9:22:24 PM	Received this as a generic for Xyzal via mail order. Generic does NOT work the same. My throat is itching by midday and I have to take benadryl in addition to this to stave off hives that were completely under control with Xyzal. I would rather pay the Tier III copay of $150 vs Tier II of $50 to go back to Xyzal and back to allergy free. Medco included a letter with generic stating that my Dr's PA authorized generic. I sure do wish someone had asked me as I am the one suffering from hives and sinus allergies. I'd like to know what meds the CEO of United Healthcare takes so I could switch a few of his meds with generic equivalents. Let's see if he like carrying around 2 Epi-pens &quot;just in case&quot; his throat closes shut. 
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	glassartist, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	6/2/2011 4:51:37 PM	I have allergies and was originally prescribed XYZAL, which worked wonderfully!  Then this  generic version came out, and of course my insurance company insists that I go with the generic.  This is one case where the generic is NOT as affective as the brand name.  I still get relief, but not as much as with XYZAL.  Unfortunately I will have to stay with the generic for a while due to finances - even for the generic I hvae to pay $45 per month for this because it is not my insurance company's preferred treatment, and Claritan and Zyrtec do not work for me at all.  If I get the brand name, I would have to pay substantially more, and I can't afford that right now.  Still, this is better than taking claritan and zyrtek, which do nothing for me.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/17/2011 7:22:23 PM	I have had horrible allergies all of my life. Went thru every possible medication there was, had shots every week and still about every 3 months I would be at the ER. I started taking Xyzal a few months after it came out and have not had any allergy problems since. Last week my Drug Company sent me the new &quot;generic&quot; version LEVOCETIRIZINE DI-HCL Tabs. Even though they said it was exactly the same, the generic version is doing me HORRIBLE. In a matter of days I could stand long enough to brush my teeth without my legs getting so weak I had to sit down. Then my muscle aches started and I could hardly walk the backs of my legs hurt like I had climbed a mountain or something. Then THE HEADACHE of all headaches arrived. I suffered from Migraines when I was younger so I am no stranger to headaches, but this was by far the worst headache I have ever had. I missed work, I was so exhusted by the time I got a shower and got dressed I couldn't make it in. I stopped taking it and in a matter of 2 or 3 days I felt 90% better. So no matter if they tell you it is exactly the same.... you might react differently. This scared me! It was HORRIBLE!

KI have nasal allergies and chronic idiopathic uticeria (hives) and this med takes care of both. I have no sides effects what so ever. I would almost call this medication a wonder drug! It is now available as a generic!
Non-Seasonal Allergic Runny Nose	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	12/17/2010 7:25:39 PM	I was prescribed Xyzal in 2007 after all other antihistamines did not work for me.  I take it at night and have had no further problems with allergy symptoms. I live in south Tx. and have severe Mountain Cedar allergies and also dog and cat.  I have a dog. This drug has worked very well for me and is certainly definately worth the extra money.
Other	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	9/30/2010 7:16:42 AM	Started taking this 6 months ago after all other have not worked for me.  This works.  I have complete relief from seasonal and pet allergies, and I know it works because I have forgotten to take it a few times and my pet allergies come back.  This has not had any effect on my sleep pattern, I would have noticed since I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. No other side effects noted.  I had a few friends with bad allergies and they tried a sample that I was previously given and it worked for them as well with no problems.  The only issue is the price, I pay $50 for 1 months' supply, but I believe it is well worth it.
