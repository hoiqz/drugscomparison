He's feeling depressed and worried that he won't get well. I'm taking him back to he doctor tomorrow and hope to get some answers.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/14/2012 7:51:55 PM	I was prescribed Meclizine 25mg for episodes of dizziness associated with fluid in my inner ear, possibly allergy related.  I have only had to take a couple of doses, but the relief is nearly immediate.  Also, since it is an antihistimine, I think it's helping to dry up the fluid. Fortunately, I have not had the drowziness that others are reporting.

Plus problems with motion sickness--I guess  they are related.  This stuff is a miracle for me.  I would rather have the drowsiness, which is actually not bad at all compared to the horrible vertigo, the nausea and the feeling like you are going to pass out if you move your head.  I have been hospitalized twice with this issue, and the meclizine is the only thing that helps. I find that the prescription works better than the OTC, I don't know why, but for emergencies in case I don't  have my medication with me, I always carry Bonine, which is meclizine OTC.  Again, I find the prescription works better, but in a pinch, I use Bonine, or if necessary, Dramamine, which definitely makes me much sleepier than the meclizine.

Instead my vertigo causes the sensation of the room jumping up and down like the beginning of an old film reel. I have had to start taking two pills when I begin to feel a little loopy. One just does not work. Two pills quells it pretty quickly. I still take three a day unless I'm feeling loopy.

I've been taking this medicine since then.  Honestly, I don't believe it's very effective for it.  Maybe a little but I still find myself off balance, feeling like the room is moving, etc...  Vertigo is a pain to have.  I was hoping this medicine would be a miracle for me.  With two young kids that are very active I can't do much with them because half the time I feel off balance.  Does Meclizine work?  Mildy yes...But 85% of the time I find it ineffective for the most part.  It's disappointing because I was really hoping this would work.  At this point, I take another med for my headaches caused by the Vertigo, that is actually more helpful than anything cause it helps control the headaches.

I started at 15 3x a day. Now I take 12.5mg 2x a day.  It helps me a lot. As for feeling drowy it was not a problem for me.Others I know who take this say over time your body gets used to it and the sleepy feelings go away.I would recommend this to anyone with a balance problem.

The in-house clinic was suggested. I saw a nurse there that prescribed 25mg.Meclizine to me for the ringing in my ear problem. I am on Tramadol, Topamax and muscle relaxers for other problems that she was aware of. The ringing problem has returned but after reading about this drug I'm not sure I want to take anymore of it since it seems to be for something I don't have. I can't understand why I was given a vertigo drug in the first place.

Yes, will make you sleepy if you take too much, but with dizziness sometimes it is better to sleep. I stll keep it on hand for when I have bouts of vertigo when my MS flares up.

Prevention of Motion Sickness	Leah, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/18/2009 7:57:08 AM	Used before long road trip,and did not feel drowzy as taking Dramimine.My daughter is 14 and experiences terrible motion sickness. Bonine given to her before roller coasters and before long car rides/ plane trips and works very well with her. Bonine is ideal for two reasons, 1. less drowziness, and&#160; 2.chewable that tastes pleasent. The Bonine works faster as it is chewed and begins to work very quickly, absorbing through the tongue, thus entering the bloodstream faster than that of an anti-vert that is swallowed. I have even taken one during major motion sickness and it cleared my vertigo/nausea in a short time, about 20-30 min. We don't travel or go to amusement parks without it.

I have had Labyrinthitis (Vertigo) for about 2 weeks now.  The first 4 days were just terrible.  I could barely walk, couldn't focus, was very dizzy, had a headache and nausea.  Had to lay down or stay seated in one position to feel even 25% normal.  I stopped taking the medicine and felt a little better after a few more days.  I've been at about 80% normalcy for a few days now.  I went back to the doctor today and he prescribed a different medicine, Promethozine.  Not sure how much it is helping today but I do know it makes me VERY tired.  I'm just trying to get threw the work day.  I hope this sickness goes away soon.  I can't live like this.  Good luck to anyone that has this sickness.

At the time, I woke up one morning and had to crawl to the bathroom. No balance, severe nausea. Had to wear a patch behind my ear for about three months along with Antivert(Meclizine) Over the years I have kept an open prescription of this with me at all times. Adjusting some of the motions of my body has helped also when I turn over in bed or get up from bed. This is the only time it will hit me. It makes me sleep a lot but I have made it so far and that was 20 yrs. ago. I take it only as needed.

Also had the light headness and fullness of the head. Was given this when I explained how I felt and within 10 minutes the symtoms were all gone, then 2 weeks later went for a hearing test and my ears were tested for pressure and every since have had headpain and fullness of the head.Pills work some, but not like before the hearing test. I figure the ear pressure had something to do with this. MRI came back clear. This was only in the last month and a half. It felt so good to feel like a human being and now back to the same thing. But the pill does take some of the pressure out of my head.

I felt like I was on a boat for the entire day!  The dizziness was bad enough, but now motion sickness ALL day long (and I am not even enjoying a vacation cruise?)  No thanks - going back to the drawing board.  Has anyone else noticed this reaction to this medicine?
Motion Sickness	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	65-74	12/11/2008 1:24:09 PM	I had fluid in inner ear for 2 weeks, with blockage of the ear. After 3rd week of this, I woke up sick one morning with EXTREME nausea and almost nonstop vomiting. I needed an ambulance ride to the ER at the local hospital. After a morning of tests, including a CAT scan, I was diagnosed with &quot;benign positional vertigo&quot;. I was still extremely ill. I was given an iv injection of 4 drugs, one of which was meclizine. Five minutes later, I was well and after another five minutes, I was on my way back home. The doctor prescribed two medicines: 2x25 mg of meclizine per day and valium. I took only the meclizine (at night); it dried up the fluid in the inner ear, and I had no more problems with nausea.      I have allergies, and something in a southern California Santa Ana caused the fluid in my ear. I routinely take generic Allegra  and generic Flonase for my allergies, but they were insufficient during the Santa Ana caused allergy.      Generally, I tolerate meclizine well. It does not intefere with sleep. I take the meclizine at bedtime. I do tend to get drowsy in the late afternoon, which is usual whether I take meclizine or not.     One needs to know that any antihistamine can lead to urination problems (urine retention, difficulty in urinating) in males suffering from enlarged prostates. I am a 69 year old male with an elarged prostate. Meclizine causes me much less of a urination problem than does Benadryl (diphenhydramine), another antihistamine.

It is suppose to treat me for dizziness yet on the label of the bottle it says may cause dizziness. Which it is making it worse.

I was told that I had a mild case of vertigo and was prescribed this drug.  I was told to take it right before bed because it will make me drowsy.  I had to take it for a month and I felt drowsy all day, for 27 days of the 30 days I had to take it.  It actually made my dizziness worse during the night.  It didn't work for me because my symptoms are back again and I will REFUSE to take this medicine again!

I had three bouts with vertigo, but no hearing problems per se.Prescribed MECLIZINE @ Two 12.5 mg 3X a day. Probably too much.  I was also prescribed Sulfamethoxazole for the infection. I seem to of gotten some of the rarer side effects: dizziness (to the point of not being able to leave my house, can't drive, lack of coordination), blurred/double vision (strobing, I call it), headache, irritable.I've taken Dramamine before w/o any problem, and this is supposed to have LESS side effects? The constant dizziness is worse than the occasional vertigo (which seems to be gone),I've stopped taking it and feel better already. I have a Dr. appointment tomorrow and will see if I need a substitute.

Other than &quot;cotton mouth&quot;, I have had no ill effects. The drug is somewhat effective when I have an attack. It allows me to function, albeit at a reduced capacity. Without this drug, I am completely incapacitated by an attack. The vertigo and nausea are so severe, my only available action is to lay down and try to sleep until it passes. The time varies from a few hours to several days.

I am however SLEEPY as heck. It is a worthwhile trade off because nothing is like spinning and whirling (then nausea and vomitting). I'm more afraid of the spinning than the medicine. My dr. says there is no inner ear infection but it is still scary to know you are spinning for ???? reason. Overall this medication helps alot with the spinning and whirling.

It is not until the last couple of years that my dr. recommended Meclizine. It seems to work somewhat depends on the severity of vertigo. However, if your nausea/vommitting has kicked in, it's hard to keep this drug down obviously. It does make me sleepy and cause dry mouth. But dizzines does improve in a few hours. This med is also great in preventing motion sickness (ie; Cruising on rough sea). However, it's more effective when I took this drug couple of hours prior the trip. Check w your dr/pharmacist on how often you should take this for motion sickness prevention.
