Vaginal Inflammation due to Loss of Hormone Stimulation	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/19/2012 3:55:07 PM	I have been using this product for over 2 years and it has worked well for me.  No more extreme pain although sex is not 100% pain free.  I have had not one single side effect.  I had breast cancer that was ER negative so I'm hoping it is safe enough to continue using.  I plan to take that risk.

Vaginal Inflammation due to Loss of Hormone Stimulation	Dimples, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	55-64	3/14/2012 9:35:52 AM	I found this medication very easy to use. It did not work for me. I was using it 3-4 times a week (the recommended dose is twice a week). I have had to start using an estrogen vaginal cream which gave me much better results. I was disappointed that Vagifem did not work for me.

I haven't had any of the side effects that has been mentioned although I do worry about cancer because breast cancer runs in my family both my Mom and my grandmother (moms mom) both have had breast cancer.  My Dr didn't mention any side effects to me.  Although I find it kind of odd that I used to have headaches regularly and seems they have decreased some since I started meds

In reading the reviews below, I am concerned by the degree to which they confuse correlation with causation.  It's understandable but it appears there are effects that are due to the progress of menopause and not the use of the vaginal insert.

I have had headaches where before I rarely had them. I have had hair loss which was stopped once I reduced dosage to once a week and have also had acne which I have never had in my life. Also have experienced bouts of loose bowels daily during first two weeks of starting vagifem and now once or twice a week after taking dosage.  Blood tests showed my levels went from low 30's to high 40's after first 3 months and now I am waiting results of 6 month test at reduced dosage(1x week) so it does enter bloodstream.
Wasting of Tissues of the Vulva	Jan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	45-54	12/18/2011 11:40:55 PM	My GP prescribed this treatment as I have been experiencing dryness pain and discomfort in the vaginal area due to early menopause (I am 45).  I used the drug for the first 14 days, found it to be initially very painful inserting the applicator due to dryness.  It did resolve the vaginal dryness issue.  However, I immediately experienced headaches, blurred vision / dizziness (I rarely suffer from headaches).  Extreme mood swings, anxiety, bloating / swelling and tenderness around the abdominal area, water retention around the face and eyes.  Hot flushes worsened when prior to taking the drug they were a minor inconvenience and this affected my sleep pattern, felt very tired, difficulties focussing on tasks.  Spoke to my GP again on the 15th day and was advised that it was highly unlikely that the drug had caused all these symptoms and that it was the menopause.  I asked why I would have these symptoms within 14 days the GP said that I may be over sensitive to the drug. I decided to stop taking the drug, a week later and I am feeling much better.  I am using Isoflavones 40mg now which is derived from Red Clover and using vaseline for the dryness.

They refered to it as a miracle drug. Well,I don't think it is a miracle but it does work well. I have been on it for a year. It does help with dryness and painful intercourse. I have also noticed that my hair and skin have more oil. I was having a problem with dry hair and skin before vagifem. I have not experienced any of the side affects other women have had.

During this time, I was experiencing a dryness and uncomfortable feeling during sexual intercourse. Using a lubricant helped, but I had to use a lot and it was messy. I took vagifem twice a week for two weeks and have noticed more moisture in my vaginal area. Sexual intercourse is much more comfortable. I have noticed that my mood swings and evened out. I still get mild daily hot flashes, but I'm sleeping better and do not have night sweats anymore.
Other	works, but at what cost?, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	9/2/2011 1:09:38 PM	This medication is effective. BUT, and there is always a 'BUT', it gave me unwanted side effects. Headache and dizziness. May help 'down there' but makes it worse 'up there' (my head). Not worth it. I had very few headaches, until I started taking this drug. When I stop the med, headaches go away.  So... if this medication 'suppposedly' does not get into the blood, how can it effect me in such a profound way ?  Don't believe it doesn't get into your blood. I won't be taking this anymore. You have got to ask yourself the same question. Drug company benefits, patient loses. It is always that way, like when you go to Vegas. The odds are just like that, favorite the 'house'

I read them after I had just inserted my first dose.  I never moved so fast to get that pill immediately out of my vagina!  It's bad enough having vaginal dryness, but I am NOT taking the chance on losing globs of hair or waking up with a throbbing headache. I will look for something natural and pray I don't develop a yeast infection from this experience!  I had my reservations about taking it, since my mother had breast cancer when she was just slightly older than I am.  These reviews reinforce my initial gut feeling.  No, no and no.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	8/3/2011 1:09:10 AM	 BEWARE OF INSTANT SAVING CARD OFFER. It states &quot;pay no more than $10.00 on each of your next 4 presciptions of Vagifem 10mcg&quot; Using this card printed from website ended up paying $53.07 NOT $10.00. The pharmasist called, was told that there was a max NOVO NORDISK would pay. I called spoke w/ customer service manager, told she understood my accusing them of false advertizing and will pass along to proper person. She offered a small compensation to me ( one free refill) I have not accepted this offer . When I decided to try Vagifem, it was a $40.00 max cost 4 months @ $10.00), now it will be $212.28. THAT my friends is false advertising, and very bad business practice. It makes me question the trustworthyness of Novo Nordisk. I hope I have made an awareness that is helpful. By the way I'm on day 6 w/ this product so too early to tell, I'm taking it for vaginal atrophy. Because I believe in positive thinking, I'm afraid that the distaste for the company may hinder the effectiveness. Hope this was helpful.

However, in the past week I have had four migraines and now have a rash covering my legs and feet.   I will stop using and try to find a more natural remedy.  As a cancer survivor, it isn't worth the cancer risk to me.

Just began using it a few days ago because, at 56, I am NOT ready to give up on sex (which has become terribly painful). But I'm beginning to wonder if sex is worth the cancer risk?! I'll be using this for 2 weeks; hopefully, won't need it after that. Every time I use it, I feel like I'm injecting myself with cancer!

My GYN assured me it was safe, knowing my history of ER-positive breast cancer. Prior tothis I had been cancer free for 20years. I questioned him about theproduct insert warning women withhx of breast cancer not to use Vagifem. He still insisted it wasokay. One and a half years later, ideveloped breast cancer in same breast. I cannot believe this is simply coincidence. Has anyone hada recurrence of previous breastcancer after being on Vagifem?

The first time I used it (when it was 25mg), it helped.  I was still having periods so I would have to use it for 4 days after my period each month.  After 4 months of use, I had extreme breast tenderness (felt like someone beat them with a brick).  I stopped using it.  Tried it again 8 months later and the first one I used increased the burning.  Now the 10mg is prescribed so I tried that.  First one okay, 2nd one burns (still is 3 days later).  The only thing that has kept me from going insane is an OTC long-lasting moisturizer.  I'm not sure if I can put the name here so I won't.  It's not perfect.  It's messy and if you're really dry it can burn for a few days but should get better.  The Vagifem just keeps burning.  Vagifem also caused me to bloat.  With the OTC moisturizer, there are no side effects and it's safe.  
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	4/23/2011 6:28:02 PM	I've been using this once weekly for 12 weeks now.  I am definitely more lubricated which was the purpose for the prescription.  Side effects include: increased vaginal discharge in a slightly darkish color, mild headache and occasional dizziness.  The dizzy spells may be unrelated to the Rx and more genetic in nature as other women in my family have suffered that symptom in post-menopause.

That's why I started using it in the first place.  Now I am back to square one! The only help I can see is using it almost daily.  That would get very expensive.

I had  suffered really badly from urethritis and frequent bouts of cystitis, for several years during peri-menopause. Within a week of starting it all the urinary problems I had suffered with disappeared. Such a relief. I collected a new prescription two weeks ago, used Vagifem as usual and within two hours had chest pains, became really sore, and got dreadful symptoms of cystitis. Spoke to my doctor and got another Rx - same problem!! It's awful. When I checked the ingredients - one of them is anti -freeze. NOT GOOD!! Wish they'd change it back again to how it used to be.

It has restored my sex life, which was impaired by severe vaginal dryness and bladder disturbances since menopause. Over the counter remedies were useless. My gynecologist prescribed this,and he informs me it is safe.  After reading some of the information on line, I am quite concerned about the risk of cancer since I've used it for a prolonged period of time. I do not want cancer but would be miserable without a sex life. It seems like I should not have to make such a choice. Aren't there any other alternatives.

It does work somewhat and helps keep my bladder free of Urinary Tract infections also.  The best result for me has been more sexual desire and better sexual response, although it is nowhere near what it was pre-menopause or even during regular hormone therapy.  This result has not been the case for my friends who use it, however.  I really feel I need this treatment and am unhappy with the dosage reduction from 25 mg to 10mg.

I would not want to do something for comfort now, that will harm me later.  My OBGYN insists that it is safe for me, that the dosage is so low that it is not any worse than using a lotion with estrogen.  I will have to trust her for now.

I happen to have a very sensitive system and found that Vagifem didn't work for me at all. The reality is, while you may be inserting Vagifem internally within the vagina, The medication does go into your blood stream..  The vagina is highly vascular - how could it NOT effect the rest of your body!  I have to admit, Vagifem did seem to work initally, but after a few months of use.. the symptoms of my condition really didn't change that drastically and the reactions to the Vagifem were more bothersome than my initial diagnosis of Vaginal Atrophy!  Since using Vagifem, I have developed swelling in my hands, as well as tingling sensations in my feet and in my legs, behind my knees.   I have also noticed occasional pain in my left arm.I am NOT a hypcodriac, nor am I an alarmist or a person that just overreacts to things... These symtoms are VERY real and it appears a high number of you are also experiencing adverse reactions to Vagifem.  I am going to recommend that people look to NATURAL products to heal the burning, pressure, pain, etc.. associated from Vaginal Atrophy.  There are other ways to incorporate and rebuild estrogen in your system - i.e., Remifemin and Estroven. Try to include more SOY and flaxseed in your daiy diet.  Do some research ladies..   Good luck and please, pay attention to your body!  Stop the Vagifem and visit a GNC or local healthfood store for NATURAL alternatives to increase your estrogen.Good luck!

Refused to take any hormones and 8 years later I finally decided to take this because I am in a new relationship for about a year now and the vaginal dryness was killing my sex life. I am in my early 50s and this man is wonderful.(it wasnt him it was my vaginal dryness) Last thing I want is my sex life ruined.Been on it for about 2 weeks it has improved the dryness and made my orgasms better than they already were.I HAVE NOT had any side effects as what has been posted.I am usually very sensitive to side effects from any type of Rx. My copay is only $30 and with the flexible spending acct I have at work I get that money back..Win Win sitiuation for me!!!

It took away the dryness and pain. I enjoy sex again. I am 63 years young. I only wish I could use more often, my Doctor cut me down to once a week and she wants me to skip a month now an then, but I felt it was more effective using twice a week. But still once a week is better than nothing. It's so easy to use unlike the creams that are so messy. I can't imagine being without Vaginfem.

And now I know why I've been waking up with headaches. It's very discouraging to go from a very healthy sex life to not wanting it at all because of the pain due to vaginal dryness.

My GYN recommends it to all his post-menopausal patients.  I have not noticed a difference, but at my annual exams he assures me it is working.  He says it keeps me lubricated and healthy, and will prevent problems in the future.  I have been taking it for about four years.  I have asked him for a natural product, but he insists that since this has been proven to work, it only makes sense to use.  I have been going to this GYN for over 20 years, so we have an excellent rapport.

It also helps prevent UTI's because your tissues are not tearing and absorbing bacteria.  This is why it was prescribed for me. I was getting one infection after another. My doctor told me that my tissues were drying out and tearing.  I began using this Rx about 2 years ago.  It is a Godsend.  My infections have decreased to only a couple a year.  And there is less pain during sex. I am now 62 and am very happy with Vagifem.

I had a total hysterectomy 3 years ago and have had such dryness and horrible pain during sex. This seems to help with the dryness and there is no more tearing of tissues. The risks are minimal since I no longer have ovaries, a cervix or a uterus.
