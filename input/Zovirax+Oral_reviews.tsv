Shingles	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		4/19/2012 7:02:23 AM	I had a bout w/shingles as a teenager and the pain was unbearable. I went to my dermatologist and he prescribed me Zovirax[(pill) and in a couple of days the pain diminished. The rash also didn't last as long as he thought. For me the pill worked very well and in no time. I truly recommend it.

Other	poor auto imune, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	12/24/2010 2:01:50 AM	I got Cellulitis on the right side of my face making it well over a 3 hour period. which left me in a hospital bed for 3 days. Acyclovir Tab and Top has almost put me to a full recovery. The only side effect I really had to deal with was severe headaches. Which my doctors put me on Topamax and Citaloprma. It took a day but works great.

Although I have experienced burning, stinging, and tenderness while taking acyclovir but I haven't seen any blisters for about 4 months. I think my body is becoming immune to this medication.

Herpes Infection of the Eye	 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		2/23/2010 9:37:28 AM	Two years ago, after  a long day of lawn work, I felt what I thought was a foreign object in my left eye. Nothing was found and I was unable to sleep because of the worsening discomfort. The next morning I went to my very qualified eye doctor to get it checked. He looked at my eye for maybe ten seconds and asked if I had recently had a fever blister on the left side of my mouth. I had had one in the same spot that flared up maybe twice a year. He said: &quot;It's now on your eye&quot;. I assured him that I'm very careful not to spread the virus and he explained that we can't infect ourselves. The virus is in a nerve in that side of my face. If not treated very quickly this can cause blindness and it scars the eyeball. Thankfully, we were quick to treat this. He warned me that by that night I would be in pain and it was excruciating. He prescribed heavy doses of Zovirax to knock it out and it did within two days. I have taken the Zovirax daily since this happened and have had no fever blisters and no side effects that I know of. The thought of going through that again is frightening and I can't imagine life without this drug. It's expensive until I consider the value of my eyesight.
Cold Sore	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/14/2010 6:24:33 PM	Moved here 20 years ago and always had oral cold sores from stress or the sun. 15 years ago a doctor pescribed this drug for me, but I use on an as needed basis. When I feel that tingle I take 3-4 400mg pills and then the next day take 3. If the next day I don't feel anything I stop until the next outbreak. My sores have since decreased tremendously and don't need the medicine like I used to. I tell everyone about this drug because it is a lifesaver if you suffer from coldsores and is very inexpensive.

However, I am very sleepy and a little dizzy. I have also noticed a slight rash but more itchiness on my stomach. It worked great at stopping the outbreak but not sure if I can handle feeling so loopy all day. The side effects started within 1 hr of taking 1 pill. My prescribed dose is 2 pills a day.

Cold Sore	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	3/4/2009 8:15:09 PM	I have had a problem with chronic oral cold sores since I was 10 years old. Finally 13 years later when I got 3 sores at once I went to my doctor. He told me I have an immune system virus that is always fighting my immune system. When I don't get enough sleep or get sick my immune system becomes weak and can not fight off the immune virus. I then get sores in my mouth. He prescribed Acyclovir (Zovirax) 400mg for me to take. The sores went away the next day. Finally I can control these sores and reduce their healing time.

Cold Sore	SALLY, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/25/2008 11:50:03 AM	Affilicted with severe cold sores since childhood, tried everything in the early years, about 20 years ago begged Dr. for prescription of Zovirax which had been approved for genetal herpes (not cold sores).  Worked.  Have taken 400 mg daily since that time.  Take one tablet at night, never any problems, once in a while even on that dose I may have symptoms, and I up the dose to 3 tabs of 400 mg.  Stops it in its tracks.  Generic does NOT work for me.  It is expensive even on my insurance, my cost is about $1 a day.  Well worth it.  What many do not realize is that cold sores aren't just ugly, they are painful and an active virus, causing fever and general overall feeling of fatigue.  Herpes Simplex is a devious thing and as I understand it, over 90% of the world's population have it, but only a certain percentage of those are genetically inclined to suffer repeatedly.  Lucky me.  If you suffer from this and your Dr. balks at a daily regiman, he/she may &quot;behind the times&quot; in what they know about this drug and its effectiveness in many areas.  I belive I will have to take this for life, when I stop, the cold sores come back within a week or so.  Strong virus, and I do not have a &quot;compromised immune system&quot; from any other problem.  I am a strong, healthy woman with &quot;fever blisters,&quot; I do have many allergies and those probably lower my immune system to allow this virus to act up.  Yes, I did have a bad case of chickenpox when a child -- where most of over 60 picked this up. If you have repeated episodes of herpes (cold sores) you do NOT need to suffer from this.  This drug works.
