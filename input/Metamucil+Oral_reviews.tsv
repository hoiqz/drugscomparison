I have also had bowel incontinency for several months.  It occurred to me that it might be the Metamucil so I stopped taking it and the problem stopped.  I don't know if I was taking too much, but I did not have the normal bowel movement.  It was a good consistencoy, but I lost the slight cramping that I've always had with a good bm and I'm wondering if I might be allergic to it.

It has helped me TREMENDOUSLY! Not only do I have clean, smooth bowel movements, metamucil has been extremely beneficial for my digestive system. Foods no longer give me stomach aches and I am no longer constipated! Trust me when I say this stuff is truly the miracle I needed to feel good everyday. It taste great! No gritty and grainy drink at all.

He thought it would be okay.  Plus I wanted the extra fiber.  Have taken one glass per day for almost one year.  Started with Benefiber but switched to Metamucil for possible benefits in reducing Cholesterol. It seems you must take 3 glasses a day for Cholesterol reduction so I'm working up to that and now take 2 glasses.  Overall I am satisfied with Metamucil.

Possibly an allergic reaction.. but I don't know. Just thought it important to note my experience. Scary stuff.

I have been sick every day of my life for past 3 years. Dr thought I had chrones, but as of yet unable to find it. Tried every medication out there to stop the cramps and controll the runs/diahreah. All it took was metamucil buscuits. Who woulda thunk it. I eat 2 fiber biscuits in the morning and im fine all day. I do still move my bowels about 4 times a day, but for the first time they are formed and normal again. It has slowed my system way down. So greatfull to have my life back.

After taking it for a while, I started also watching my diet, less red meat, more vegetables and fluids, less sugar - it really made a big difference. Kindly recommend it - in fact, I am trying to get my parents on it also.

I was told by my gastrointestinal doctor to take it everyday. It does decrease the amount of pain I have from the IBS that I suffer from, however it tends to give me a lot of gas. Excercise has also helped me while taking metamucil.

I just don't like it.  I use Fiberstir.  It's the best fiber I've ever used.  You can put it in any food or drink.
