Has raised my HDL by 15 points to 70 but has not lowered total cholesterol of 260 mg/dl. I didn't want to be put on a statin drug for the rest of my life so I take this instead for now. I am a 50 yr old female with cardiovascular disease on both sides of my family tree.

PAD and high cholesterol are genetic so I feel it is important. The worst side effect is the flushing and itching.

It has been very effective in lowering my triglyceride level I did get a flushing feeling when I first started but Dr. said to take a 81mg asperin and it did help. It worked for me 
High Cholesterol	mava421, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	65-74	11/6/2010 12:47:54 PM	The Dr. originally ordered Niaspan but it became so expensive that my Dr ok'd the use of Slo-Niacin instead to lower my Cholosterol. It seems to be doing the job but it's a slow process. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CHECK WITH THE dR BEFORE CHANGING BETWEEN THESE TWO DRUGS. SLO-nIACIN IS HARDER ON THE KIDNEY THAN NIASPAN.
Increased Triglycerides and Cholesterol	Chloe, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	35-44	9/9/2010 10:32:26 AM	This Slo-niacin works very well for me.  I had stomach problems with triglyceride medications so my doctor changed to this.  I started with 250 twice a day for a week and then doubled the next week until I was up to 750 twice a day.  I absolutely must eat and drink fluid to keep flushing at a minimum.  I also take a baby aspirin if I' not going to be home just in case.  The flushing was scary the first time but eating and a baby aspirin seem to completely eliminate it for me.  When it happens, it feels like an indian burn on my skin that's exposed to air (not sure why) and goes away after 20 minutes.

I only take 500 mg in the evening at this time.  It will be increased to 750 at a few weeks.  I hope it continues to improve my LDL, HDL and Tri(s).

Increased Triglycerides and Cholesterol	tbtchygurl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	6/5/2009 5:10:40 AM	I started out on 250 mg 2x daily them was moved up to 500 mg 2x daily. I have been on this treatment for several months and just recently have experienced side effects. Did not have a problem before so I do not understand why all of a sudden it is doing this. Went to ER because of it and have scheduled a follow up with Dr. do not like the extreme heat and dizzy feeling. It does not happen all the time either so no way to predict when it will happen. If I could plan around it it might be different. Have had shortness of breath and swelling in legs as well as spike in blood sugar levels. At this point I am very concerned. I will learn to live with it if it is determined that it is lowering triglyceride and cholesterol levels because they are so out of control I end up in hospital with pancreatitis.
High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	6/2/2009 1:51:28 PM	I have suffered from high cholesterol for my entire adult life.  After spending years on statins and taking excessive amounts of pain killers for the muscle pain, my doctor told me that I really could not tolerate the statins.  With total cholesterol nearing 500 and low HDL giving me a terrible ratio, I started on SLO-Niacin.  I have been on it for about 5 months.  I experienced the itching and hives-like feelings for awhile until my body adjusted to it.  I still have occasional bouts of flushing if I take the Slo-Niacin too soon after having an occasional glass of wine with dinner.  Other that that, I am very pleased.  My total cholesterol is now in the upper 300's and still coming down.  My ratio is now normal. I started with 500mg and increased to 750mg twice a day.  I am very pleased with this product.
Low HDL Cholesterol	lyle holm, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		5/10/2009 7:12:15 PM	I am 91 years old. about 20 years ago I had a heart bypass operation and after a short span i started having angina pains again I was treated by adding stents to my heart veins. That helped for several years before they started all over again. My heart doctor recommended that I take slo-niacin 500 MG's Tab twice daily and after a very short while my angina pain stopped and has never retutned. About 3 weeks ago I started havin Bowel Problems I was neither constipated or loose bowel but I could not control my bowel movement. there was a contant sepage and I had absoluutely no control.  I could not make it start or make it stop.I went to my regular doctor and after looking over my medications he said that he was quite sure that it was my slo-niacin that was causing it. He asked me to stop taking it and I rebelled. Let me backtrack a bit, I have been taking one regular asprin every day for all these years, trying to avoid more heart problems and also to avoid the Flushing caused by the slo-niacin. Just prior to my bowel problem my heart doctor told me to stop the regular asprin daily and start taking a baby asprin every other day. I told my regular doctor this and he said well try going back to your original dosage and see what happens That was last monday and yesterday I had what I would call a normal bm for the first time in a long time. I don't have any idea if this is just my body playing tricks or if there is a fix hear. Time will tell. About three weeks ago   
Low HDL Cholesterol	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	45-54	4/20/2009 10:02:24 PM	I started out at 250 then increased after 2 weeks to 500  I am now on 750 and am still doing great no side effects. I have to reach at least 1000mg to see if it has brought my HDL up as it was only 38 when I started out. The only thing I can say is just stay with it if you can tolerate it. I do drink lots of water during the  night but it never said that was a side effect. 
Low HDL Cholesterol	mmorris, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	45-54	11/15/2008 10:23:03 PM	I've taken the product for the last 4 days.  I started with the 250 mg.  I get itching all over my upper body.  Very annoying.  I can't stand it.  Hope it will subside.  Need to call my doc and find out when I should expect the itching to go away.  If not, I don't think I'll be able to continue with the product.

(yay, me!) Cut my triglycerides by 60 pt by adding 1 T. flaxseed meal to morning oatmeal so try this first!  Re: Slo-Niacin, I take food with this, have only gone up to 375 mg so far, but had a pretty strong &quot;niacin flush&quot; last night that lasted one hour due to not eating.  Will keep on and hope my labs are better by Dec -not convinced yet that I need 1000mg/day will see how much my body can take...
