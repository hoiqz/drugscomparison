Prevention of Motion Sickness	Carnation, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	65-74	1/5/2012 12:02:55 PM	I use 1/2 or 1/4  of a patch at a time as I only weigh 115 lbs. I do get a little blurred vision and I change the patch every 3 days. It does really irritate the skin behind my ears, but other than that there are no side effects for me. I used to get very seasick on a cruise and end up with oral meds anyway. This works well for me.

After the 2nd day of my cruise, I was not bothered by motion sickness even in very rough seas; however, my pupils were dilated like they are when I see the eye doctor. I was unable to read anything or see anything close up. I've had the patch off for about 12 hours now, and my eyes are getting better, but that side effect was seriously an issue for me.
Prevention of Motion Sickness	55-64 Male  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	7/18/2011 4:54:47 PM	Used to prevent seasickness on a cruise. Did not suffer any motion sickness at all. Only noted side effect was a little dry mouth - not too bad. Will use again on my next cruise. Slept like a baby.
Motion Sickness	Kathy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	5/26/2011 1:32:07 PM	Horrible, horrible drug. Took it for a cruise.started getting dizzy after removal the day after removing patch. Have been dizzy, nauseous and vomiting , blurry vision for 6days now. Feel awful. Went to dr. but he said he had never heard of anyone getting these symptoms. I hope this goes away soon. Don't know what to do. Please everybody stay away from this drug.
Motion Sickness	whamo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	2/18/2011 3:07:22 PM	Twice I have used these patches to prevent motion sickness while on a cruise.  I did not experience any motion sickness while wearing the patch, but within 24 hrs of removing it I began feeling extremely dizzy, light headed, headaches and fatigue.  I relate it to when you're a kid and would spin around and around to get the dizzy feeling afterward.  I haven't fallen down yet, but feel like I easily could.  The 2nd go around with these symptoms were more mild than the first.  The first time I ended up seeking physician help for vertigo and was completely immobile for 3 solid days.  The symptoms are in episodes after that.  Finally, after 10 days or so the symptoms subside.  I now know what the cause it and will never use the patches again!
Motion Sickness	rudolf, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	1/12/2011 6:35:25 PM	I used the scopolamine patch on a cruise several weeks ago.  It worked great.  I used one patch for three days, then another one for another three days.  The only side-effects were some blurred vision when reading and dry mouth. When the cruise ended and we were on land I removed the patch and 24 hours later I felt as if I was on a rocking boat all over again.  I threw up, had diarrhea, was so sick.  It was awful.  So, I put a half patch on.  That helped to get me through the week so I could go to work and feel normal. Then, at the end of the week I took the patch off and, sure enough, 24 hours later same scenario.  I decided not to apply another patch because these symptoms were so terrible.  For a week I have been going through the &quot;withdrawl&quot; symptoms and it has been a nightmare.  I felt as if I was going to hallucinate at one point.  It gave me the worst anxiety attacks that made me very dillusional.  It was terrible.  I would not advise anyone to take this for a cruise.  The effects after the scopolamine is removed are not worth it.  I am a 31 year old female, weigh 110 pounds.  The patch is the same dosage for everyone.  I assume the dose was too large for me, so if you are a bigger person maybe the effects would not be as negative as mine.  In the future I will try a natural method to sea sickness.    
Other	7-12 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	1	Male	7-12	9/13/2010 8:44:15 PM	My son was prescribed the patch to &quot;dry up&quot; his constant drooling caused by a medical condition &quot;polymicrogyria&quot; I put 1/2 of the patch(per dr. order) on him on a saturday by sunday evening he refused to eat, wasn't feeling well and extremely lethargic. I couldnt even get him to drink anything and it is now going on 2 days of no food intake. however, I am forcing him to drink water. He has not been acting himself and I know he really isnt feeling well, even his teacher called me from school to tell me he wasn't himself and not eating or drinking anything. I am happy with the effectiveness however I will not be using it any longer due to the negative effects it has had on him even 24 hrs. after removal.
Motion Sickness	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	65-74	10/1/2009 11:13:24 AM	I used this on my first cruise for 3 days then used 1/2 patch for 2 days. Worked great.  24 hours later I am in the emergency room so sick I just wanted to be put out of my misery. It took 3 days to get where I could go back to work so a 5 day vacation turned into 9 days off. I am still woozey some and feeling off kilter but other reviews I have read say maybe 10 to 15 days to feel better.  I can only hope.....
Motion Sickness	Matt, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	45-54	8/7/2009 11:58:35 AM	I post this to maybe help someone else.... I applied the patch on day 1,4 and 7 of my boat trip- the 'patch' worked well with no problems except for dry mouth.It was not until I had removed it for 24 hours (a Saturday afternoon) that the problems started. I began to feel disoriented, light headed, loss of appetite, extreme fatigue. But the worst feeling was the anxiety and the feeling of having no emotional control. Minutes went by like hours, I felt as though it was difficult to breath at times. I could not do anything to take my mind off it because I could not concentrate on anything at all. The only time I felt better was for a brief period after waking from a nights sleep (I did sleep well given the fatigue) and naps  and then the symptoms restarted. Then, after waking Monday, I passed out and struck my head on the floor, requiring several stitches. The amazing thing was that I felt no pain from the injury until two days later when the drugs side effects began to wear off. It was the most happy Ive ever felt to experience pain.I can say that the 4 days these symptoms occurred (Saturday through Tuesday) were some of the worst Ive ever experienced in my life- it was that bad. 10 days later, I am fully recovered, back exercising and my normal energetic self. Suffice to say I will never use Scopolamine again and will discourage anyone who typically experiences drug side-effects (like myself) to avoid it as well.
Prevent Nausea and Vomiting After Surgery	patient, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	6/6/2009 1:01:25 AM	I was given this patch to prevent nausea and vomitting after a breast lump removal. I wore the patch for 24 hours and was told to remove it by my physician.  I did not become nauseated while wearing the patch but did become very uncomfortable after removing it.  The side effects after removal were very uncomfortable.  I became dizzy, my mouth was dry, my voice was hoarse, my legs felt unstable to walk and my hands shook to the point where I was unable to write.  I do NOT recommend this drug to anyone.
Motion Sickness	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	5/4/2009 8:01:32 PM	I felt dizzines the entire time I used this medicine although it got better over time.  I wore it for five days because we were doing a lot of travel (one patch for 3 days, another for 2 days).  It did help to prevent motion sickness. When I finally took it off, I got the worst headache and nausea of my life.  The pain was terrible. I didn't know that there could be withdrawl symptoms after using it.  It was worse that the motion sickness would have been.
Other	dede, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/6/2009 2:34:49 PM	It was easy to use, but it has been the WORST medicine I have ever used. Found out about ALL of the POSSIBLE side effects!! Wore the patch form 6:30pm till 1:pm next day and the side effects are horrible!! I guess if your'e not allergic it might be great for inner ear dizziness, but wow add the side effects in with the inner ear stuff, yeah!! 
Prevention of Motion Sickness	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/22/2008 10:50:26 AM	The eye dilation looks a little creepy. Sometimes the dilation can lead to pain in mild lighting; to handle that sunglasses are helpful.It can be really hard to deal with the 'off patch' time, due to the lack of the drug. I find letting the patch sputter out,keeping the same patch on four or five days, helps cut down some of the 'off' times problems. Although, when used for more than a week I felt the desire to avoid arguments and was uncharacteristically non-confrontational and driven(a bad time to take an argumentative English class). The slight mood changes are mostly not noticeable except during longer periods of use. The patch does help me with my recurring motion sickness with an unknown cause.
Motion Sickness	Tom, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	1	Male	65-74	8/14/2008 5:01:03 PM	This drug was great at preventing the motion sickness however the side effects that my wife had isn't worth using it again. She has been off the drug for 7 days now and continues to experience nausea, headaches and a slight dizzyness, which she completely avoided on the cruise?. She hasn't felt good since we came off the cruise.
