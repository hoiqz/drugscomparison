Recurrent Cold Sore	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	5/22/2012 9:18:40 PM	As soon as I feel that &quot;cold sore tingle&quot; on my lips, I take 3 tablets immediately. The one dose does the job in stopping or decreasing the severity of the sores. The important thing is for timing of the dose. I have 3 tablets with me at all times!

Shingles	Itchy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	10/11/2011 10:11:02 AM	I was into the shingles infection about 5 days when I went to the doctor.  It looked just like poison ivy.  She prescribed Famvir. The shingles spread like wildfire for the next 3 days. I have two days left of medication and I'm concerned I may need another round. No appetite. Heart palpitations. Tired.  Is it the drug or the shingles?  Hard to determine.

Genital Herpes	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	1/23/2011 10:51:13 AM	Unfortunately infected since 1979, before I had ever heard of the std.  Used all the early treatments with very little effect until famvir came along. It works well for me provided I start it at the earliest sign of infection.  If not results are the same as if not taking it at all.  Overall I'm satisfied with the medication. Have never experienced any side effects.

Valtrex stopped being effective, so my doctor switched me to Famvir, 250 mg./2xday.  I got a headache from it and it did little to stop new outbreaks.

If I take famciclovir, the cold sore will be kept very small or hardly noticeable. I wish I'd discovered this drug earlier.

Genital Herpes	happy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/28/2010 8:58:06 PM	I used to get 2 or 3 outbreaks a year lasting a week to 10 days. I started using Famvir 10/12 years ago and noticed much shorter, easier outbreaks with much more time between. Just having my 1st in almost 2 years. No noticable side effects. One of the few things that are worth the cost.

Shingles	gh, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	3/22/2010 4:19:32 PM	This medication definitely diminished the neuralgia and course of the shingle outbreak.

My heart started racing and I had difficulty breathing. My chest and back were in a lot of pain. My heart rate shot up to 118 and my blood pressure was 178/92. I may have had an allergic reaction but I have stopped taking this med after 1 dose and don't plan on continuing it. I will use the cream that was prescribed for me and thats it. I would not anyone to experience anything like I had gone through. It was an horrible experience...
Shingles	awandlp, 65-74 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5		65-74	11/26/2009 12:17:16 PM	A year ago, I had a painful case of Shingles  on my right side (back &amp; stomach). Two month ago I began having severe pains on the right side of my head, ear &amp; jaw. This pain was not accompanied by visible sores. I saw a neurologist and had a cat scan (which was negative). The pain persisted until I had a chance talk with a friend who is a dermatologist. He diagnosed my condition as a bout of shingles and recommended Famvir.  Three days after taking  500MG, 3X per day the pain was completely gone.  No side effects and I was told to complete the usage until all thirty pills were consumed.

I take it at the first tingle (I always keep 1 pill in my purse)and the sore does not get as big or last as long as usual.  It has been very effective for me.

Recurrent Infection caused by Herpes Simplex Virus	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	5/1/2009 8:31:41 AM	I had been taking Valtrex and was allergic to it. My doctor switched me over to Famvir (Famciclovir) and I'm allergic to that one, too. :-( I took it when I saw the first signs of an oral outbreak -I started get extremely itching around my mouth with a bumpy rash after taking the medication. My top lip and skin above the lip became swollen. I have yet to find a drug that works for me.
Prevent Recurrent Herpes Simplex Infection	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/1/2009 12:00:00 PM	I have had Herpes Simplex for years.  After going through several different anti-viral treatments, Famvir works the best for preventing outbreaks and when there IS an outbreak, helps to reduce the physical signs the best too!

Genital Herpes	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	10/28/2008 10:18:37 PM	Valtrex didn't work one bit for me. I have been taking Famvir for about 2 years and it has seriously reduced the severity and frequency of my breakouts. I have the confidence to share real intimacy with my partner- we've been together 1 1/2 yrs- and he is free from any hint of infection as well. I was able to deliver my daughter vaginally because of Famvir as well. I had some side effects to start- but they went away after my body got used to it. I could not live a normal, happy life without it! I am very grateful.

I can't begin to tell how painful this infection is! Finally, I was given Famvir and it's great! It starts working immediately. It is an expensive drug but well worth the cost!!! No other medication is needed. It's that wonderful, and has NO side effects.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/20/2008 7:10:42 PM	I have a extreme case of Impetigo (skin infection) on my nose. My dermatologist prescribed this along with my MD's script of Keflex. I do not have herpes and have never had a cold sore or fever blister but he says this will help with healing.  I feel for those of you that have herpes. While I don't have that condition I do have HPV.

I didn't get relief until my doc gave me Famvir (pill thing) and Lidocane (topical anesthesia).
