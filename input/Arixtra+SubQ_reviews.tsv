Deep Vein Thrombosis Prevention	txnursie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	45-54	5/22/2012 12:40:14 AM	Since coumadin therapy failed for me, I have no choice but to be on Arixtra or another type of low-molecular weight heparin for the rest of my life. (clotting disorders)I've had terrible knots forming in the abdomen, huge hematomas. I kept thinking perhaps I'm giving them wrong but I've been a nurse for 17 years this summer and have been giving myself heparin injections off and on since I was 20 yrs old (25 yrs ago!) I've given more injections than you can imagine but something horrible is happening with these. These knots are HUGE and deep and painful. Anyone have any suggestions?

Poor consumer information.  So new that pharmacists and doctors are not familiar with it.  I can't find any long term clinical studies either.

Deep Vein Thrombosis Prevention in Knee Replacement	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/14/2011 6:00:37 PM	I don't want to minimize the benefits of Coumadin/Warfarin but it just does not work for me. I have been on it three times and the INR level was never achieved to the MD's satisfaction which happened again in the 72 hours after surgery.  I asked for an alternative therapy and am very pleased that my surgeon prescribed Arixtra. I was a little uneasy about the self administration but I was fortunate to have a superb nurse at the hospital who took me through the process, watching me as I delivered my first dose. Basically, if you can remove a splinter yourself, sticking your tummy is a walk in the park. I am only on the med for 10 days as a precaution after revision surgery of a total knee replacement.

I didn't have any trouble giving the shots w/the self-retracting super thin needles. He didn't have any redness, itching nor bruising, which would've been very easy to see as he doesn't have any pigment in his skin. What may also have helped is that I didn't inject the last tiniest bit of moisture to make the needle retract. After the 1st time I noticed that it kind of slammed down &amp; then bounce out, so I injected all the med, removed the needle &amp; then &quot;hit the bottom&quot; to make it self-retract. He is VERY easily nauseated, &amp; had no trouble on this drug.

No pain at injection site when follow directions. No side effects and  I am sensitive to many medicines.  Glad to have health coverage at $70 per 2.5mg dose 1x day - covered at 80% after my high deductable is met.
Treatment to Prevent a Blood Clot in the Lung	teresafromnc, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	6/9/2011 6:24:19 PM	In 2002, I treated for portal vein thrombosis was placed on coumadin. During the 2 years I had reoccuring lung clots in upper and lower lobes. Lovenox and now Arixtra have been a miracle drug for me. No clots in 4 years. This will be a life time drug for me also.  My condition today is fair with much fatigue. I also have Budd-Chiari syndrom which the Arixtra is helping with the inflow and outflow of liver. I am blessed to be given a longer life with my family..never take this for granted!
Blood Clots in Deep Veins and in Blood Vessel of the Lung	Queenie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	1/19/2011 4:53:50 PM	Have tried all blood thinners with no success. I was unsuccessful at becoming therapeutic on warfarin, and had horrible hematomas  with lovinox. I like that you don't have to change ur lifestyle to fit around arixtra. And I have been very pleased with the guarantee of not having a dvt while being on this medication. This was not the case in both of the blood thinners before, I still had clots while on blood thinners previously. Overall, arixtra has less side effects and is working out great considering the alternative. 
Other	frustrated in nj, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	45-54	10/1/2010 10:46:18 AM	I have antiphosolipid antibody syndrome and have been on warfarin for 3yrs. A recent misdiagnosis of a blood clot has now left me with no choice but heparin for life. I have found the cost of arixtra to be exhorbitant compared to warfarin and the bruising and hematomas are awful, though not as bad as lovenox. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis Prevention	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	9/12/2010 4:40:44 PM	I was put on fondaparinux because Warfarin made me cold, feel nauseous and (worst of all) my hair go very thin. (I only noticed Warfarin did this because I was temporarily put on low weight molecular heparin and felt much better). So far I feel OK on fondaparinux too. My hair is getting thicker again and I feel warmer. I sometimes feel nauseous still but maybe I just have a weak stomach? The main thing is - no blood clots and no visits to check my INR. My only issues are that the needle is thicker than with heparin so it's sometimes a bit hard to jab it in but so far I have had no bruising with it in comparison with the heparin. I also think it is terribly expensive (fortunately not an issue for me as I'm on the NHS in the UK but I still feel guilty about the cost to the hospital - and I suppose I do ultimately pay for it in National Insurance -  compare 10p per dose on Warfarin and &#163;32 a dose on Fondaparinux!)   
Acute Blood Clot in a Blood Vessel Supplying the Lungs	plattgail, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	8/17/2010 1:28:45 PM	I have read all of your reviews looking for side effects and negative comments about Arixtra. I have been on the injections for 10 months and have just been told I will be on them for life. I developed blood clots while on chemotherapy and radiation for cancer. My potassium levels are high and the Doctors think it may be a result of Fragmin, Lovinox - and now Arixtra. Has anyone else had that problem? What side effects can be expected with long term use?
Other	godsrancher, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	5/10/2010 9:40:55 PM	I have Factor V Lieden [homozygote= a  recessive gene from both parents] and a hematologist prescribed Arixtra.  4 months into the shots I was experiencing depression but just thought I was lazy as I had never had depression before.  At 6 months was put on Lovenox [thought I had developed a blood clot while on Arixtra] and 1.5 days later the depression was gone.  Still waiting to see what blood thinner I am to be put on.  Lovenox long term causes osteoporosis.  I wish I could find a list of side effects on Arixtra as no drug is without side effects.

Blood Clot in a Deep Vein	Percyfaith, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	55-64	11/17/2009 10:59:16 PM	Been dealing with DVT Blood clot in my left leg for about 1 month. Warfarin and Lovenox did not work on my clot and I had to be in the hospital on Heparin and then have vein surgery to remove the clot.I have not been on Arixtra very long but I think it or Heparin, Coumadin (warfarin) and or Lovenox may be causing me a great deal of hair loss. I've got other issues. I am coming off of 2 months of cancer treatment (2 weeks of Chemo and 30 Radiation treatments for Anal Cancer). I was unaware that blood clots often follow cancer treatment. A long flight 10 hour home from my cancer treatment center (CTCA) in AZ did not help the blood clot problem. I am also hypothyroid and had to change from taking Armour Thyroid to Synthroid and Cytomel one month ago so lots of factors going on with me. To boot I am a believer in holistic healing and hate being on drugs. I originally thought I'd be on Arixtra shots in my stomach for 3 months -now my doctor is suggesting 6 months. I don't think I can do that that long and I am considering do the 4 months and then getting on supplements specifically an Anti-Thrombic Kit (Containing the following 7 items)Choline Citrate (one teaspoon with Magnesium Formula)Curcumin (6/day) (no blood thinners)Fish Oil FormulaFlax Oil (1 tsp/day)Garlic Extract (100 caps)Ginkgo Biloba PlusMagnesium Formula (2 to 3 with choline as needed for pH)Beyond drugs, supplements, good organic nutrition and mild daily exercise I believe in the Grace and Power of the Lord Jesus Christ. I pray for wisdom for all of those who read this... that God will lead and protect us as we seek health.

Other	lkander, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/11/2008 2:29:24 PM	I had surgery in my leg and was prescribed this drug simply to prevent blood clots.  I went to fill the prescription and nearly fainted when the cost was $50 a dose, one dose a day. I was furious with the Dr. and called him to discuss any options.  He said, &quot;oh yeah, aspirin is another option that will work just fine.  The only difference is that the anti-coagulation properties of aspirin last 2 weeks, Arixtra only lasts 24 hours.&quot;  I walked back into the drugstore and bought a 98 cent bottle of aspirin and saved $505.02

Shots given in the stomach are very rarely felt. One negative comment; the video accompanying the starter kit shows giving the shot at an angle, but hospital and other written instructions say to inject at a perpendicular angle. I do the 90 deg. in the fatty stomach tissue - absolutely no problems.

Had numerous DVT hospitalizations on warfarin.  Now am treated effectively, no weekly labs, no more clots and no dietary concerns as with warfarin.  Overall, VERY satisfied.

I get a few painful sticks but nothing more than uncomfortable for a few seconds.  I'm on Arixtra for life so I wanted something easy as well as effective.
Deep Vein Thrombosis Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	10/7/2007 6:27:33 PM	I'm warfrin resistant so after 3 hosp. stays this is it. Some pain during/after injection, but nor horrible. Peace of mind has been huge. Now I know my condition is being treated and a relapse is unlikely.
