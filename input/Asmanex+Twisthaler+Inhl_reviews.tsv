Asthma	Nicole3, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	65-74	8/4/2012 7:31:18 AM	This drug does not correct the basic symptom, i.e. breathing difficulty. It reduces it. A side effect however is that it produces a growth of heavy hair on my chin. The hair is not like normal facial hair -fine and fuzzy, it is thick and stubborn. I am having it removed but this is a  common effect that should be made known.

Asthma	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	55-64	3/28/2012 12:06:24 PM	Longtime Pulmacort user. Insurance pushed Asthma doctor to change. Transition was difficult. Insomnia and nausea over, but very intense dreams. Concentration on work and activities is different. Asmanex is doing a great job with my breathing, just not as active. Hoping the activity level comes back.

I have been using this product for many years, and obtain it through the VA in San Diego.Recently I opened a packet and white powder poured out. I therefore didn't use that unit, but since I get 3 at a time, I went to the next one. I feel guilty that I did not report this incident, and wonder if I should have.

Asthma	NC_RRT, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/14/2011 5:21:48 AM	As a respiratory therapist &amp; life long asthma sufferer,  I chose this inhaler in the 220mcg x 60 doses after cost &amp; result comparison.  I found it more affordable for me since I have to pay out of pocket for any asthma preventative.  I am able to use just 1 puff a day so my 60 puff inhaler lasts 2 months at half the cost of other inhaled steroids.
Other	patient_zero, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	12/2/2011 11:48:34 AM	Chronic sinusitis resulted from using the Asmanex Twisthaler for just three days.  Four weeks after discarding the inhaler, I am STILL in agonizing and debilitating pain.  Consultations with two physicians have proved futile in resolving this problem.  An appointment with an otolaryngologist is scheduled for next week.  A warning label needs to be added to this product regarding SEVERE adverse sinus reactions so that the patient can be alerted prior to using this medication.
Asthma	Tiffany, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/13/2011 7:44:36 AM	I am very satisfied with this inhaler. I was previously taking Advair. It has stopped working as well as before. I had developed nighttime asthma in addition to the asthma attacks during the day. I am proud to say I have not been woke up at all at night with asthma attacks any longer.

Add to that my hair has started thinning and my weight loss stopped within a week of starting it. I've been using it for about 5 weeks now I'm debating if I should bother continuing. I'm definitely not seeing enough benefit to justify the cost and I don't think my asthma is extreme enough to warrant the use of a drug that sounds this  dangerous (read some of the side effects - yikes!).

ABOUT NINE MONTHS AGO I OPENED AN EMPTY DISPENSER TO SEE HOW IT WORKED AND IT WAS FULL OF POWER. I OPENED FIVE MORE EMPTIES AND THEY WERE ALL FULL. I COULD'NT BELIEVE THEY WOULD OVERFILL THAT MUCH. I OPENED A NEW UNIT AND IT HAD THE SAME AMOUNT OF POWER AS THE EMPTIES. THE DIPENSER WAS NOT PUTTING OUT ANYTHING. I HAVE A PICTURE OF THE POWER FROM AN EMPTY AND A FULL UNIT I CAN SEND ANYONE FROM TBRADF8950@AOL.COM  I WAS USING THE 220 UNIT TWICE A DAY. WHEN I SEE DESCRIPTIONS FROM USERS I WONDER IF IT IS LIKE A PLACBO. YOU CAN CUT HALF OF THE WHITE TOP OFF YOUR EMPTY DISPENSER AND TURN THE BOTTOM OVER AND ALL THE POWDER WILL FALL OUT. YOU CAN ALSO REMOVE THE TOP AND TAP THE UNIT UNIT ON A TABLE AND HARDLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN A FEW SPECKS COME OUT.

I has all but gone away and I breathe so much easier. I have developed a itchy rash mostly around my waist and there are some welts. Could this be a side effect of the medication?
Asthma	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/24/2011 4:42:47 PM	I developed asthma as an adult (I was a smoker for 13 years; my entire family smoked around me growing up) &amp; was using a rescue inhaler many, many times a day.  I began using Asmanex about 2 months ago &amp; have not used my inhaler even once in the last 3 weeks!  My thirst has increase but I chew a lot of gum &amp; drink plenty of water to combat that.  I also have had weird, vivid dreams and a little trouble sleeping.  An even exchange for being able to breath in my opinion.Very easy to use:  twist the dial, inhale, replace the cap where the arrows line up.  There is a counter on the package for the doses remaining.  I always brush my teeth afterwards.I'm not sure if this type of steroid causes weight gain but in 2 months I have not gained/lost weight.  I have not really changed my exercise or eating habits.

Asthma Prevention	Sen, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	35-44	11/16/2010 5:47:17 PM	Wasn't a problem getting started. Just followed what doctor said. I don't have any asthma or wheezing. But have side effects - coarse voice, body pain, tiredness, sleeping early and feeling dull. Tried Singular few years ago; it was worse (body pain, felt beaten up by 10 guys end of the day) and discontinued.I broke open the container after 30 days use and found lot of fine powder medicine inside. I guess that is the way it is. There is enough for more than a month. But you can only use 30 doses for the device to work effectively.

People need to know doctors misdiagnose heart conditions as asthma and pneumonia. Asthma medications make heart failure WORSE! If this is your first time to be diagnosed with asthma - demand a clinical rule out of a cardia problem. Don't take no for an answer - I did and ended up with Class III heart failure and a case of thrush.

My Dr. had said it may feel like nothing happened -- but it did.After 2 weeks I began to develop bad headaches. I was constantly consuming Tylenol, Motrin, Excedrin, etc. I stopped taking Asmanex, and my asthma is back in the dumps. I would take that over the headaches though. I rinsed my mouth/gargled as instructed but also developed dry/sore throat.

Asthma Prevention	Mary, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	55-64	12/7/2009 11:15:42 PM	Asmanex Twisthaler worked well for me the first year but about 5 months ago I was experiencing severe pain in my joints and all up and down my legs.  I told the doctor and he changed me to Symbacort which gave me good results but had terrible weight gain.  Now I am back on Asmanex since Symbacort gave me the same muscle and joint pains but with severe headaches as well.  I can breath again but now am having the same reaction I had before with the muscle pains.  I don't know what to do??  My doctor is putting me back on Advair and hoping I will be able to tolerate that.  The worse part is the weight gain, and my doctor doesn't beleive is caused by the medication but I can't lose weight when I am on this medication.  I just hope they develop something soon that will help all of us with these breathing problems.
Asthma	tish, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	7-12	12/7/2009 4:13:54 PM	My 7 year old son started this medication for cough variant asthma.  Within 2 weeks, he began having trouble in school.  He has been physically aggressive with other kids, and depressed while at home.  This is totally out of the norm for him, and his teacher called me in to ask if there was something going on at home because there is a night and day change in his behavior.  I have discontinued this medication.  It did help his asthma, and was easy to use, but not worth the behavioral issues.

No breathing issues but itching all over. Now I am on Symbicort and I'm gaining weight and have sore tender areas in the corner of my mouth so what is a person to do. I try to stay clear of all that I allergic to but somethings are impossible and people just do not understand. Doctor do but my family is ignorant and not supportive. I'm a hard one to deal with on some meds. Why give me something that will or can make me  moody and gain weight? I have to many other health problems to be taking this. Weight gain + I'm Diabetic, hypertension......... I'm stopping  the medication to night to see what happens and call my doctor if I have anymore issues. I  am not going to take anything that causes me other health problems to go along with what I already have.

It really helped my asthma and kept me from having to use my rescue inhaler all the time...only problem for me was chronic insomnia.  I have had it with every single inhaled steriod so far...this time the insomnia became severe after about a month of use.  I'm so disappointed that I have had to stop taking it but I need to sleep.  Hopefully the doctor has another medication I can try.

It did, as predicted by my doctor, make my voice a bit hoarse for a while, but that's a small price to pay.  In my case, there have been no other side effects.

It is hard to use as not even the pharmacist knows how to use it.  I don't like the delivery system either, as you can't use it with the spacer.  The spacer made it easier for my son to take it himself.(with my supervision).  WE would all prefer if he could be back on the flovent or something like it.

I have not any side affects that I can link directly to taking this medication, but it worked far better for me than Advair, which gave me the worst migraines of my life.Overall I'm very happy with it, though now that I have returned to Canada from living in the US, I'm very dissapointed that it's not available here.

I can't believe the cost of it but i got it anyways and while it is preventing my asthma symptoms i just figured out why im feeling like im loosing my mind. it just dawned on me that all the changes in how i am feeling has been since i started this medication. I have a moderate headache everyday, i feel hungry all the time, fever everyday, bloating/gas, fatigue, dizzyness, sinus &amp; ear problems. I am glad i am not loosing my mind, i googled the symptoms and there EVERY symptom was! amazing how that works, im glad i have a follow up in a week cause i want to try something else.

Asthma	mandyacb, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	3/9/2009 12:56:19 PM	This medicine works great whem my asthma is really bad and nothing else works. I've been on it off and on for the past year.   However, the downside to it working great for the asthma is it makes me very angry and irritable, like major PMS to the extreme, and it makes me gain weight like mad too.  I was on it for 2 weeks the very last time I used it and I gained 28 lbs in 14 days.  I've tried other steriod inhalers for my asthma, and none work as well as this one does for the asthma.  I'm hoping to find one that works for my asthma without the side effects, but so far this is all my doctor and I have been able to find that works for the asthma.  It's a difficult choice to make...be unable to breathe and have no mood probs or weight gain, or be able to breathe but be a bear to be around and have my weight balloon up way high.  I am normally a very calm person, but with this I feel out of control under the surface.  The anger is controlable with constant prayer.  I seriously would not be able to control the anger without God and prayer.

Asthma Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	2/13/2009 10:17:04 AM	I was given Asmanex to take for 6 weeks for mild persistent asthma caused by cold weather and enviornmental pollutants. I have side effects such as head pain, earaches, mucle pain, menstrual problems, dry throat, chest tightness, fatigue, lack of energy, loss of appetite, and stomach cramps.  However, I do notice that I can take more satisfying, deep breaths.  Since my side effects were so bad my Dr. put me on the children's dosage and it has helped to reduce the severity of the side effects, but they are all still occuring. Hopefully, it works to reduce the inflammation and I can stop taking it after my six weeks are up.
Asthma	kaylorma, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	65-74	2/1/2009 6:05:38 AM	I am using 220mcg twice a day. It took about 4 days before I could feel the drug working. It does help with my breathing/wheezing, but I do have one side effect that drives me up a wall.  Itching....no hives, just burning itching.  I feel I will probably quit taking it or reduce to one a day to get relief. Is this a normal reaction? Do others have it? I am also on albuterol and nebulizer with albuterol and atrovent.

Asthma	geezer ken, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	65-74	1/7/2009 11:49:22 AM	It works great for me. I also have asbestosis. Been using it for over a year. Most prominent side effect is the raspy throat. The ladies think it's kind of sexy. I would recommend it if you're using a inhaler a lot. It also controls the inflammation inside of my lungs. For me that means less rubbing , less pain.   
Asthma Prevention	hfdad, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/1/2009 7:33:32 PM	It took 4 days for this drug to show some results, but after that I have been very satisfied with it. I used to use a rescue inhaler 3-5 times over 24 hrs. and now I don't need it unless I am doing something stenuous in the cold. I have been using it for 3 weeks now. I wish I had it a year ago.

The hoarseness is something I could live without, but as long as the medication works, I'll continue to use it in spite of the minor problem associated with it.

We had her in and out of hospitals and they doctors felt it was due to her B.C. so she went off it, and all other medicans,headaches finally went away. Started back on Asmanex and in less then a week her headaches are coming back. Has any one had simular problems??

Got to hotel, could not walk 20 steps to point I could not breath. I was given oral steroids, breathing treatments and  oxygen for 7 days. Back from vacation,got better, but within 2 weeks same conditions. Was given Asmanex and symptons have gone away.  I Have enviromental, bronchial ashma. Do need to make sure to rinse after each use. Dr thought it was better to inhale the steriods rather than take oral. I agree.Good procuct, never knew what it was like to feel that I was taking my last breath. Now I know.

The only concern I have is that it tends to dry you out and leaving your chest feel tight in the morning.I live in Florida and the pollen has been rough lately so my breathing is not that good.  Although diagnosed with emphysema my doctor just recently put me on this Rx.  I am also taking Serevent and Combivent.I am going to talk with my doctor about adding Singulair as I used to use it several years ago and it worked real well.  Only because I believe I have allegery related problems too.

It is costly though, because I have no insurance. Another thing is I have experienced some &quot;sexual side-effects&quot; with this drug. Has anyone else had this problem?

It would have been a lot easier had either the doctor or pharmacist given me a quick primer on how to properly use this product.  With all of the new dry powder inhalers making there way onto the market, each with their own device for delivering the drug, better steps should be made to show the patients the correct way to use each one.  Other than this issue, I am completely happy with Asmanex.
