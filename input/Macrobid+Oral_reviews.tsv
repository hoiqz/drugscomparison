I started on Macrobid and it cleared my u.t.i. and I had no side effects.  Love this medicine!!!
Other	Jessica , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/2/2012 9:09:12 PM	Less than 15 minutes after taken Macrobid I experienced uncontrollable itching, swelling and hives. As I tried to get up I felt really light headed and faint. I started feeling discomfort on my chest so immediately called an ambulance. On route to hospital I developed severe abdominal cramps. Since my body was compensating and my airway was still okay I waited to see a doctor for almost 2 hours. As I waited I was visiting the washroom with severe abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea. Finally as I was on a stretcher at emerg. the doctor poked his head in the curtain and without even looking at me ask me to go home and take Claritin. After being discharged I had a second reaction 12 hours later. I went to a different hospital by taxi. By that time my voice was really hoarse. Within minutes I was examined and Benadryl IV, epinephrine injection, ventolin and saline were administered. Then I was put on a heart monitor for 4 hours. I was prescribed prednisone 50 mg for 4 days, and Benadryl 4 times a day for a week depending on how quickly my side effects disappeared or improved. I was also prescribed an epi pen due to the severity of the anaphylactic reaction. Today I was asked to continue the prednisone and Benadryl for another week. It has been approximately 72 hours since my initial interaction, and I still have severe stomache aches, headaches and a lot of joint pain. I call Macrobid the new capsolated bee. I was told that if I ever took Macrobid again I probably would not make it to the hospital.

Coli Bacteria	az10, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	8/1/2012 3:00:53 PM	I am allergic to sulfa and Cipro (and other antibiotics in that family) causes severe anxiety problems for me, so my doctor prescribed Macrobid for my UTI this time around. Since I started the dosing, my UTI symptoms are gone, and for the first time in recent memory, an antibiotic hasn't caused terrible side effects. I'm sorry to see that so many people have experienced side effects, but I must note that all antibiotics work differently for different people -- why on earth people continue to take Macrobid after experiencing the very side effects that were listed in the documentation provided by my pharmacy is beyond me.
Other	debbieguymoore, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	7/29/2012 6:03:41 AM	The 1st 10 days I was on a monthlong treatment for a recurrent kidney &amp; bladder&amp; uti infection, I vomited everything that went in my mouth and had constant diarrhea and lost a pound a day because I was so badly dehydrated.  I was losing a pound a day and my throat and mouth were burned from stomsch scid. Then the next few days it was so painful that I could not move my wrists or ankles and my son had to rub them with arthritis rub. Then it made me feel like I had the flu.  I just took my last dose and will not go thru this hell again. I will use cranberry pills, golden seal and drink lots of water to keep everything working like it should.

I have never have a worse reaction to an antibiotic and I have been on a lot. CONSTANT headaches and nausea and body aches. I am done today and have not taken the pill and I am STILL having these symptoms. Avoid if possible.

Coli Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/15/2012 3:24:19 PM	Overall I have been taking Macrobiid for liike 3 months now only problem is I lost mii health Ins &amp; have 2 pay CASH 4 them and they're NOT cheap 155.00 for 60(one month)supply...Ciipro worked better BUT I was hospitaliized for C Diff Colitis that was HORRIBLE thought I was going 2 die. I usually have NO siide effects wiith Macrobid I make sure too take it with food tho &amp; I DO take Bentyl(drug for my IBS) which maybe I shouldnt because something is making my stomach hurt but I thiink iits the Diphemhydramine(Benadryl)I take  go 2 sleep at night I take 4 so maybe the belly pain is from that? Cramps are just SO wonderful 2 have =/ Anyways give the Macrobid a chance like take it for 2 days maybe 3 then see if you have ANY side effects. I honestly think the UTI pain is worse then these cramps but I dont know yet I will STOP taking Benadryl at night and see if that helps hopefully I can sleep without it. Macrobid 2X a day script is for 1 year!!(Chronic UTIs that are persistent,they come right back if I stop Macrobid)
Bladder Infection caused by Enterobacter	75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		7/4/2012 11:28:50 PM	My mother was prescribed this medication.  She is 76 and it has been the worst medication.  She told the doc twice that something is seriously wrong.  He replied , it really should not be the Macrobid, really?   Then how come she has had every single side effect listed.     I would never recommend this drug to any one and I hope she switches doctors fast.  Every doc should have take at least one dose.
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	Mrs. Wilson, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	6/22/2012 6:53:35 PM	It helped with the pain but after taking for one day, I started breaking out in blisters going from my head down to my hips. The itching is horrible. I'm still trying to find something that will make it go away. I took the meds only for 5 days before I realized what was goin on. I wish I had answers for it to go away.

This medication is dangerous and should be taken off the market. I was given a 5 day dose 100mg 2x day. I took only two doses and had numbness and burning in my arms, hands, and feet. Not to mention the shortness of breath, diziness and foggy head feeling that still has not subsided since I last took the med three days ago. Thank God for my holistic doctor who gave me a natural option. I refuse to take another antibiotic after this experience. I hope these side effect subside soon. 
Other	sandj, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	6/5/2012 2:28:32 PM	I was prescribed Macrobid for a UTI and quickly developed a high fever and severe flu like symptoms with no energy to eat or drink just after two doses (thinking it was my bladder infection ? ), with strange dreams anytime I fell asleep. After day 3 of taking it, I started to have prolonged migraine-like headaches, verbal disinhibition, confusion, poor concentration, severe neck stiffness leading to back pain, tingling of nerves, and mood swings. I was assessed and the doctor indicated that I had a severe but uncommon reaction to the medication and had me stop it taking it after 8 doses out of 14 doses.  She sent my urine culture to determine if I should get another antibiotic.  I have been off the med for over 24 hours and my neck and back still throb, but I am feeling better and thinking clearer.
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/31/2012 11:15:42 AM	My husband developed Lung Fibrosis from taking this drug.  He was on it for 14 days to prevent a urinary tract infection for a kidney stone procedure.  Six months later he was on a lung transplant list at Mayo and died before he received new lungs.  If on this drug and present with difficulty breathing notify your doctor and immideatly go off of it, especialy if you have a family history of lung disease.

Coli Bacteria	Franny, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	65-74	5/27/2012 9:55:40 PM	I was prescribed Macrodantin (generic for Macrobid) for recurring UTI's.  For about 2 years I was prescribed the antiobiotic periodically, alternating with Cipro. Due to rebound infections, I was placed on 100mg daily - macrodantin.  It worked for probably 12 - 18 months, before severe, sharp abdominal pains hit me, accompanied by unbelievable fatigue, even difficulty thinking.  Blood tests revealed alarmingly high ALT and AST liver function results. My liver was biopsied. Culprit medication was found to be Macrodantin. After a month of being off the med, my hepatic function returned to normal. But I do have a damaged liver, which will have to be tested for a very long time.  Sorry to report this bad result, as it was effective in the beginning.  I'm taking no antibiotics for the UTI's, just flodding with water, and cranberry extract. Never again!

I have taken 5 doses, I am irritable, not normal for me. My head is pounding, I am nauseas, and dizzy. My phsyciian even told me to stop it. I will never take it again. Not sure why this drug does this. Cipro never fails me.
Other	feelingcrappy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	5/22/2012 3:24:20 AM	I am CURRENTLY experiencing nausea, dizziness and chills as a result of taking this medication. I also had chest and stomach pain 1.5hrs ago, when I woke up from my sleep. This morning when I took the med I felt so sick to my stomach I thought I was going to pass out. Since I've never had an allergic reaction to medication I was not sure why I was feeling that way but I confirmed this evening that it's all a reaction to Macrobid. I never want to take this stuff again. It almost prompted me to go to the ER tonight.

After the 4th day of not being able to get out of bed I decided no more. I will never take this medication again.

I stopped taking after one day and am still am still experiencing weird head pains with some dizziness.  Will wait until the medication is out of my system as hopefully the head pain goes away before I start to take cipro which I have taken before with no problems.  I just hope my weird head pains go away.  This med should definitely be taken off the market.

Bladder Infection caused by Enterobacter	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	4/11/2012 4:18:16 PM	I am living a nightmare due to the side effects of this drug.  100mg 2x per day for 5 days and I have turned from a perfectly healthy person into a walking mess. Immediately felt extreme fatigue but blamed bladder infection.  Experiencing severe neurological effects, numbness and tingling in legs feet.  Unable to walk at times.  Unable to grasp pencil, fork or razer.  Unable to lift a cup to my mouth without two hands.  Extreme fatigue, dizziness. I have NEVER had a reaction to any drug like this.  I have been to a neurologist, am now being sent for brain scans etc.  Called company that made generic and could not get through.  Called FDA and they could tell me nothing that you cannot read online.  Rare effects of peripheral neuropathy that either reverse, dont reverse, or in rare cases people die.  Fortunately each day I am feeling a little better so I am optimistic I will be one of the lucky ones, but its an odd feeling to be in perfect health one day, and &quot;waiting to see what happens&quot; a few days later.  2 small children to take care of and scared to death.  I will never look at the drug companies or FDA the same way again.  This is truly frightening.

Coli Bacteria	SS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	35-44	4/11/2012 6:34:05 AM	Being allergic to both pennicillin and cypro I was prescribed this drug for a recurrent UTI, so I'm taking this drug for the first time. I am currently on day 3 of 100mg x 4 times daily for 7 days. My doc suggested taking an OTC anti- nausea pill half an hour before each dose to help with the nausea and it seems to have helped as I haven't thrown up or had any nausea. The drug itself seems to be working well as the pain from the UTI is getting better. I'm  being REALLY careful to eat properly with each dose, although it's difficult to force myself to eat that often. I'm drinking A LOT of fluids with each dose and throughout the day and so far the only side effects I've experienced have been fatigue and light-headedness. Counting myself lucky after reading other reviews of this drug!!

She went to bed and woke up during the night with severe pain in her stomach and itching all over. This morning she is still having stomach pain and a bad headache and now she is so weak she can barely move.I called the dr andtold them and they said  it was allergic reaction. I think its just side effects,which btw the dr and pharmacist both lied and said they really weren't any exceopt dark urine.The dr called her in cipro this morning(what she should have given her to start with)so I guess she can take it after all(GEEZ).BOTTOM LINE I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYBODY TAKE THIS DRUG UNLESS THEY WANT TO HAVE ALL THESE SIDE EFFECTS ALONG WITH THEIR ORIGINAL SYMPTOMS.PARENTS I WOULD TELL THEM THEY ARE ALLEGIC TO START WITH BECAUSE THIS DRUG IS DANGEROUS.GOOD LUCK TO ANYONE WHO BRAVES TO TRY IT!!!
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/27/2012 3:19:46 AM	I've had chronic cases of UTI for the last several years. At first I would be prescribed antibiotics such as ciproflaxin (Cipro) and would take it for a good 3-10 days every time a UTI would show up... but it would never completely go away. My gyno would then suggest I take it every time I had intercourse. It didn't work. My doctor suggested other antibiotics and I would show weird reactions to it. Finally, she suggested I take nitrofurantoin mono-mcr (Macrobid) after intercourse. It worked great, to the point I barely take it ever. I usually take it after intercourse while my diet hasn't been up to par (such as consuming too much sugar i.e. soda, juice) and not enough water. Other then that, it has worked perfectly.Additional Info: I also take the contraceptive pill such as Quasense (Seasonale). I've asked my Gyno and researched a bit on my part and both said there is little case to none of interaction between the drugs. So far, I'm in the clear. Of course, I don't suggest anyone to take that route and to always be careful and double up on protection.

I started having severe flu-like symptoms, fever, and feeling bad overall.  I went into the doctor today thinking I had the flu and he said it was likely bronchitis, and gave me an antibiotic, however, now I am wondering if the way I feel is due to this medication.

I have chronic UTIs at one to three month intervals, and Microbid is the only antibiotic that touches them.  I am so thankful for this drug and have had no side effects.  My doctor prescribes for ten days instead of seven like some of the reports.  It works quickly, but you must finish the whole ten days even if the symptoms disappear. I also take D-Mannose (found at the health food store or on line) which seems to help.  Going to ask my doctor about taking one dose daily and after intercourse as some people report as a preventative.

Headache started the 2nd day &amp; is now overwhelmingly painful.  Nausea progressed into vomiting today &amp; my stomach is rumbling, with rapid heartbeat &amp; dizziness.  Weird thing is, the pharmacist claimed that these are not normal side effects for this drug &amp; told me to call my doc.  I had &amp; office was closed.  I called doc again on hotline &amp; he said the same thing &amp; told me to go to emergency room!  Are professional unaware of what is happening?!  There must be something that works without making you sicker!
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	2/7/2012 2:03:52 PM	I have been having on-again-off again UTIs for the last 19 months.  My doctor always put me on cipro and it always helped.  One night I was suffering from a bad UTI and went to an urgent care clinic and the doctor/PA said that he would prescribe me macrobid because he didn't know of a time that it didn't clear out the infection. I took it and thought 'oh great! It'll be gone for good.'.  I finished the medication and 2 days later I swelled up around the face (although luckily not enough to cut off the breathing) and I spent my Saturday taking benedryl.  After all day of it not working I went back to the urgent care clinic and was given predinsone and pepcid.  Although both helped, the swelling has not fully gone away. Although I do have allergies, I did NOTHING that day that could have given me a reaction like this.  I am wondering if it is possible it is still a side effect/reaction to the drug since I had just finished off the medication a night or two before.  I have had all kinds of blood tests for autoimmune disorders and thyroid problems, more recently any allergies and all the tests are normal. This is the only thing that makes me wonder if it was this drug.  I did not really have any issues with it while taking it (except after a few days it made me so sick, despite weather or not I ate with it.) I asked the pharmacist after the initial swelling and he said it was for sure an allergy, would this 'allergy' still be hanging around?  I took the medication 2 weeks before Christmas.

The next day upon awakening, I had a severe rash on my torso, back, and groin area.  My doctor confirmed that I was having an allergic reaction to the Macrobid, a drug which I had never taken before.  Prednisone was prescribed (on a decreasing dosage) which has cleared the rash. Needless to say, this was a frightening experience.

I had been taking Bactrim for a full week without any changes in my UTI.  Doctor changed to Macrobid.

Hard to decide...they're both awful!

After several diff. antibiotics, this one FINALLY worked.  I am supposed to take one pill prophylactically after sex and that worked for years.  I have stopped taking them since I find voiding after sex &amp; drinking tons of water inhibited the infections.  Today, I have my first UTI in 3 years :( - I am on the macro bid 2x per day for 5 days &amp; today is day one &amp; I feel SO MUCH better.  Never had any of the problems everyone else mentioned, it's a lifesaver for me.

On day 5 I developed an odd cough and chest pain. On day 6 I developed a fever of 102 with severe vomiting, racing heart, body aches, chills, and a migraine. I became severely dehydrated and required 2 units of fluid in urgent care.  In addition, my liver enzymes were nearly double the normal values along with a high white cell count and elevated glucose levels.  I have been off of this drug for three weeks and still have some days where I experience shortness of breath and weakness. This drug is scary and I would NEVER take it again!

Coli Bacteria	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	11/28/2011 1:43:42 PM	After completing my seven day dose of Macrobid, I began itching and breaking out all over my body. I had a full body rash, hives and swelling of my feet, hands, face, lips and throat. I went to the emergency room twice for immediate help. Even though it did relieve my urinary tract infection symptoms,I'm aware that I have a severe allergy to this drug and I can never take it again.

After 2 days, it seemed to spread the infection to my kidneys.  Causing the need for another drug.  I have also had problems with this drug burning my esophagus, resulting in a trip to the ER.

I called my physican on Saturday  and she said it would probably go away and to keep taking drug and she told me to come in on Monday.By Sunday i stopped taking the drug and when i went to see doc on Monday,all the skin on the palms of my hand andbottom of my feet peeled off.The doc said that i was allergic...well thats why i called her???This a terrible medicine.

Turns out I had a UTI move into my kidneys. I am beyond pissed at the doctors there because they told me that I absolutely had to take this medication on an EMPTY stomach. I've been taking this for two days now, I am exhausted but cannot sleep due to my nausea, diarrhea, aches, and my kidneys are still killing me. I am not taking any more of this, even with food. This drug needs to be taken off the market.
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	papatient, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	10/30/2011 12:58:40 PM	I almost died LITERALLY..... after taking this medicine last Weds.  Went into anaphylactic shock, was rushed to hospital by ambulance with faint pulse.  If my husband wasn't home I would have died.  Was in CCU for a night.  Don't take this unless someone is around to watch you...... or just please, don't take at all !
Other	Misha123, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	10/27/2011 6:19:10 PM	I am 63 female and was diagnosed with ic. I didn't believe it. The dr finally prescribed elm iron. I have immune problems and react to most medicine. I struggled with urine test and one would say infection, another test was negative. Finally I got a ic specialist in Newport beach. First amoxicillin 500, burned my stomach up. Cipro is my standby. Three days after finishing I was on regimen of trimethropin and urelle burned as I voided and the trimethropin burned my stomach up. Then I got nitrofiratoin. Now I have dry cough and 102 fever. I feel like I have the flu. Thank God I read about prelief. It is saving from killing myself, just joking. Maybe you can avoid those drugs and ask more questions when the medicate you to death
Urinary Tract Infection due to E. Coli Bacteria	janiskw, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	10/22/2011 7:56:19 PM	I have taken five pills so far.  The dosage is two per day.  The first thing I noticed was a headache, and it hasn't gone away yet.  The next problem was shortness of breath.  Both of these problems started after the first pill.  Now a constant low-grade fever.  And last night, muscle cramps in both legs (calf).  I don't know if I will continue with this medication.  I feel so CRAPPY!  I would almost rather have the UTI.  And after reading other people's reviews, I'm very apprehensive.

If it makes you ill...stop taking and call your doctor. I was on pain medication, I have acid reflux and IBS. After taking this for a couple days I was sick as a dog. Up all night sweating, chills,nausea,chest pain,dizziness,weak,headache. It's not worth the suffering when theres so many other antibiotics out there to chose from. I felt better with the UTI ! 
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	cali_chick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	10/13/2011 1:49:56 AM	Awful, awful drug!!! I didn't research first and thought I was just sick. I didn't see that long term neuropathy and drug related lupus are possible side effects.I had joint pain, numbness/tingling in left hand, chest pain, back pain, headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, and the list goes on and on, because of this dang drug. Horrible, horrible drug.
Urinary Tract Infection due to E. Coli Bacteria	JessM78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	10/12/2011 5:53:25 PM	I was first prescribed this drug in 2000 for a UTI and had to stop taking after a few days due to shortness of breath and other problems. Wish I'd remembered it'd bothered me back then. Was just prescribed it a week ago for a UTI and I am DYING. Had terrible stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, low grade fever. Was given 100mg pills, 1 pill twice a day. Stopped it after the 5th pill which was 3 days ago. I'm still having very frequent diarrhea. Wouldn't doubt it's colitis and I've read this drug can cause it and can leave you with it for up to months after stopping it. NEVER AGAIN and I hope I can start feeling back to normal soon.
Urinary Tract Infection due to E. Coli Bacteria	kimberly1, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	10/3/2011 10:06:46 PM	I had my first ever UTI in July and was prescribed Macrobid. I've been on antibiotics before for other things but this was the WORST antibiotic I have ever taken. I feel so strongly about this medication that I really just want to tell people about my experience with it and hopefully caution some against taking it. I hardly ever review things but this was an awful medication. I guess the dosage was too high but macrobid left me with awful stomach problems (i think it might've even been colitis) that persisted long after I finished my dosage. Sure, it cleared up my UTI but at the expense of messing up other bodily functions. If you can avoid taking this, please do. I had another UTI later and was put on Cipro- it worked SO much better and I had pretty much no side effects with it. 
Infection of the Urinary Tract caused by Enterococcus	65-74 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3		65-74	9/30/2011 12:16:44 PM	I am allergic to cipro and bactrim so this is the only drug I can take for my UTIs. Although it gets rid of the infection, it does make me feel sick to my stomach, lethargic and generally crummy. The price I pay to get rid of the UTI, I guess.
Urinary Tract Infection caused by Klebsiella Bacteria	Diana, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/29/2011 2:00:28 PM	I had a UTI and my Dr. presribed Macrobid.  This is my 3rd day of taking 100 mg., twice a day, and I am to take it for 5 days.  I have had no side effects and I'm sure my infection is completely gone.  I won't be afraid to take this med. again in the future if I ever need to. (I chose UTI caused by Klebsiella Bacteria for reason for taking this treatment, but I don't really know if that's correct.  All I know is that I had a UTI).
Urinary Tract Infection due to E. Coli Bacteria	SoCalDweller, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	9/28/2011 10:23:52 PM	In the middle of taking it, I began to have chest pain, headaches, dizziness, tingling in my fingers, back pain, and constant diarrhea. I was on 100mg for 10 days and a lil' over 2 weeks later, I AM STILL NOT THE SAME. I can't wait until every last particle  gets out of my system.
Urinary Tract Infection due to E. Coli Bacteria	caitlin06, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	9/25/2011 8:15:16 PM	I'm one of those unlucky women who gets a bladder infection every couple of months,even though I take all possible precautions against it. My doctor finally gave me Macrobid for a particularly bad infection and within hours of taking the first 100 mg dose I was feeling much better. Worked wonders for the infection, but for the last week I've had a horrible headache and I'm almost too tired to get out of bed. Today I started breaking out in itchy red blotches all over my torso as well. I've been taking the pills after eating a full meal and I'm drinking plenty of water. Thought it was just the infection, but after looking up these reviews I'm convinced that Macrobid is the problem.  I didn't even call out of work due to the bladder infection, but after taking Macrobid I had to take a sick day. If you want fast relief from a bladder infection (and who doesn't?), this stuff WORKS...but the side effects aren't pretty.
Urinary Tract Infection due to E. Coli Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/23/2011 4:25:59 PM	This medication is awful! I didn't even know I had a UTI (and I have them all the time, so believe me, I KNOW HOW THEY FEEL) and I was prescribed this by my OBGYN. I've always been prescribed Cipro (which is AMAZING). I took it for the full 7 days. I got a little nauseated sometimes after taking it, but I realized that I just wasn't eating enough with the medication. The day after my final dose, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I was nauseated, had muscle and joint aches, fever, irritable skin, numbness of my legs, etc. I thought that I was getting the flu until I read reviews. I feel awful!!!! The pharmacist said that it doesn't sound like a reaction, but it sounds like I'm just getting the flu. REALLY? So pretty much 50% of the people that have had the same symptoms as me is just a coincidence? Ugh. I will NEVER take this medication again.

Coli Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	9/21/2011 10:04:47 PM	I do not think that it took care of the infection all the way. I am still having back pain and muscle spasms in legs and fingers on one hand. I have numbness in face and sweaty hands off and on.
Urinary Tract Infection due to E. Coli Bacteria		4	4	2			9/14/2011 10:42:13 PM	This is my second time taking this drug for UTI. It works great, but I am dealing with side effects - headache, upset stomach, queasy. However, I will continue to take it unless the side effects become severe.
Urinary Tract Infection caused by Staphylococcus Aureus	mairzydoatz, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female		9/8/2011 4:43:55 PM	After 4 days on this medication I began to feel very bad, listless, aimless, very, very weak, depressed, barely able to walk unaided.  Continued thru the 7th day, and then stopped as I continued to feel worse and worse.  Was supposed to take it 10 days.   Ended up in the E.R., and was then admitted to the hospital for evaluation.  This is a very ugly drug for me.  I never felt worse than when I was on it.  The depression lingers now two weeks later.  Terrible feeeling.
Urinary Tract Infection due to E. Coli Bacteria	diabetic now, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	8/31/2011 3:17:15 PM	I took Macrobid for 7 days for my UTI...then was told to take as needed as I get UTI's frequently.  The initial dose cleared up the UTI.  I took one pill about 3 wks later and went to bed with what I assumed was the flu.  Was fine the next morning.  I again took one pill about a month later and had the same flu symptoms, but this time more severe...with trouble breathing and feeling like I was dying, trouble breathing.  I was told I developed an allergic reaction to it.  Within 6 mo. I went from a 113 glucose syrem leaven to 295 with an A1c of 12.6.  I AM WONDERING IF ANYONE ELSE HAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED DIABETIES SINCE HAVING A REACTION TO MACROBID?  I am 50, not overweight and diabeties does not run in my family.  My vision was the first indication that something was wrong.  I went from seeing everything clearly at a distance, but needing reading glasses to read; to not being able to see anything 5 feet away with any clarity to not needing reading glasses.  This switch happened twice, but the third time my eyes switched I could only see at a distance through the reading portion of my glasses.  I am just curious if this has happened to anyone else or if my diabedies is totally unrelated to the reaction to Macrobid.  thanks

Other	bb, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	8/17/2011 5:49:08 AM	I took this drug last year because I had recurring UTI, I took the pill, went to bed, and hours later, chest pain difficulty breathing woke me up in the morning. I had to go to the ER. I had an anxiety attack.Today, I went to the dr again because of the UTI again. I was very loopy so I didn't realize I got the same drug (although, the records should say that I had severe side effects before) so I took a pill at noon, slept, woke up at 8, felt severe headache (I thought I must have a tumor), felt very weak and all of a sudden, I'm coughing! so basically, flu-like symptoms. I wanted to throw-up, or at least I felt like I have to. My tummy feels uneasy, like it's grumbling but not really. hours later, I began palpitating. 112-116 resting BPM. I tried to just relax because I can't go to the ER (don't have insurance.I will never take this drug again.

I was given macrobid by the ER. ever since I started taking it, my heart races and makes me so dizzy I almost pass out. I puke constantly and always feel like im going to puke. My stomache is swollen and hurts. I cant eat. Im really tired. My urine is changing crazy colors from like neon yellow to a dark yellow brown. I dont make any bowel movements. And from all the responses to this pill, I think its time they come up with a different solution :(

I stopped this medication immediately, and it still took 7-10 days for the hives to stop itching and disappear.  Horrible medication.

No major side effects from this medication, some mild nausea but that could be due to the pregnancy.

Bladder Infection caused by Enterobacter	Christy, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	45-54	7/28/2011 10:34:45 PM	I just started Macrobid this morning and 9 hours later, feel tiried and achy like the flu and looked up this med.  I took my temperature after body felt hot to the touch, had chills,and achiness.  Temp. was below normal 98.4F. Heartbeat seems to be felt in chest (pounding sensation, just enough to notice) which in not normal. Slight burning eye sensation. I am not taking any more since the one dose I took this morning.  It has to be the med.  Even if not the med. causing it, can't be good for you with all the side effects of lung and liver problems.  Common sense!
Bladder Infection caused by Enterobacter	AT, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	55-64	7/17/2011 2:40:02 PM	I was prescribed a 10 day cycle for a bladder infection. I felt naseous, weak and ached but I muscled through because the infection was abating. Then, on the 8th day, I was bedridden with a fever and chills and couldn't move. Felt worse than the flu. Raised bumps appeared on my thighs. On doctors advice, I stopped taking the med. The symptoms abated immediatly although I continued to feel weak for a few days. Although the med worked, the price paid was too much.

I didn't start getting horrible side effects til I was taking this daily after 5 months. My arms and legs suddenly felt like they'd been shot full of novacaine. Diarrhea every day, muscle weakness, joint stiffness. I thought I had had a stroke! Proceed with caution.

Bladder Infection caused by Enterobacter	andi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	6/18/2011 12:16:11 PM	If you have any sensitivity to antibiotics, be careful with this one.  Had a UTI and doctor prescribed this.  I took one pill and within an hour I broke out in hives, then my breathing became labored, got so bad that pain in the lungs and abdomen area forced me to go to ER.  They said I was experiencing side effects of the medication.  One day later I'm better, but still hurts to breath, nausea, and headache. 
Urinary Tract Infection caused by Klebsiella Bacteria	kiskat, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	6/15/2011 3:11:44 PM	I took this for a UTI. I took one pill in the afternoon and almost immediately had a headache. I took the next pill in the morning. Shortly after, my headache got very bad, and I started having chills and fever. I became short of breath and dizzy. I went home and covered myself with 2 heavy blankets but I was still chilled. Then my fever started to rise. It went from 101 to 103. I then went to the ER. They ran all sorts of tests but found nothing. Finally, my fever broke. THIS IS VERY BAD STUFF! DO NOT TAKE IT!

Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	Judy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	6/8/2011 12:10:03 PM	After my first dose I developed a fever.  After 5 days of fevers I went to my family doctor who thought I had the flu.  After1 1/2 weeks I ended up in the hospital for 3 days and had to have a spinal tap and a brain scan. Bottom line is that I had Drug Fever, a severe allergic reaction which caused me fevers of 102 degrees and above. Terrible drug....be careful.

I took ONE pill and six hours later, had 101 temp, chills, terrible headache and joint pain everywhere. My blood sugar was elevated and blood pressure extremely low.This is not a medication that should be prescribed unless absolutely necessary...especially when a urine dip was normal with only a trace amount of blood and it took a urine culture to determine a minor infection. 
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	5/1/2011 10:15:56 AM	Normally for a UTI, I was prescribed Bactrim which was effective. This time I was prescribed the Macrobid. I had NONE of the usual side effects, however this drug did have unusual effects on me such as a decent amount of spotting for a few days and also instead of making me nauseated and have loss of appetite, it did the opposite. I was voraciously eating and felt the need to eat when I wasn't even hungry. After the pills ran out, my eating and appetite went back to normal.

I really do not like it, I've not had the more severe symptoms others I see here have...but this medicine just makes me feel badly. Headaches, exhaustion, inability to focus and depression are my primary side effects. I only have one pill left so I'll take it, but never ever again.

Later in the day vomiting started again, every 10 minutes for three hours, went to ER severely dehydrated, as soon as I mentioned the drug the doctor said thats what it is. She said she sees a lot of these cases. It has ben 24 hours since my last dose and still having nausea and severe stomach pains. Have never had a OTC drug reaction like this before.

I ended up 2 times at the Emergency Room for breathing problems and the worst allergy someone can imagine! I had hives all over my body, it was unbearable! I thought I was dying! It took several weeks to my body to recover!!!
Urinary Tract Infection caused by Klebsiella Bacteria	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	4/7/2011 10:09:13 AM	I sure wish the maunfacture of these drugs would specify that there is a Red 40 inside the capsule as now I will not know if it is the Red 40 or the other ingredients that is causing a reaction.  There are many prople allergic to red 40 and everything needs to be marked on the outside and listed in the perscription information printed out at the drug store. 
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	kat, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	4/4/2011 11:44:01 AM	i had taken this when i was young for an infection, so had no idea i would be one that would have the rare side effects. i was taking every night. after less than two weeks i had eye problems, unsteadiness, and headache. then the headache got so bad i couldn't even think of what to do. i should have gone to the ER. every time i stood up in the morning out of bed it felt like someone ran an ice pick up my brain stem. it lasted until i quit taking the med. and still a month later have some of the effects. it would have killed me if i hadn't realised what was causing the persistant pain up my brain stem.   it caused hypertention in my brain. so as long as i stayed laying down the headache was bearable but on standing and moving in vertical position was totally unbearable. i could do nothing.

I take it right away and it works quickly, I don't like taking meds so try and limit it to 3 or 4 days doses.  So far I haven't noticed any side affects except yeast infections.
Other	ebayfan, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/7/2011 3:29:28 PM	I took the generic form of this post operative as a preventative measure.  I had a sling done. I am not allergic to anything and very healthy.  I had a severe allergic reaction to the pill after the first dose. I took 3 of the 6 doses before contacting pharmacy and dr.  I have hives and severe itching.  It is now day 5 since I went off of it and I look like I am severely sunburned and have hives still. Pharmacist said it could take 7-10 days to leave my system.

Infection cleared up, but my platelet count plummeted. I have been trying to get my platelet count normalized ever since I took this medication. It is a scary, difficult problem for me now; I am on my second heavy dose of prednisone and have to see a hematologist every week. I would not take this medication again.
Urinary Tract Infection due to E. Coli Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	2/15/2011 1:33:17 PM	I have chronic UTI.  Usually the doctor gives me bactrium, but he decided to try this.  After almost a week of taking this medicine my symptoms did not improve and my whole body ached like I had the flu.  I have old injuries to my ankles and wrists and this medicine made those old injuries hurt.  I have quit taking the medicine and called my doctor so he would call something else in for me.  I will never take this medicine again.

Dr. put me on 100mg Macrobid 2x daily. Infection cleared up the 1st day of Macrobid, but I had nausea, vomiting, dry heaves, constant headache, tiredness. I didn't connect these symptoms with the Macrobid until the 2nd day of feeling awful. I finally stopped taking it after only 3 doses and I feel like myself again. I only hope the uti doesn't come back, but I will not take Microbid again. BTW, I have never had side effects from any medicine until this.

Other	Joanne, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	1/16/2011 3:55:24 PM	I took this drug for a UTI infection, but wasn't informed of the bacteria type.  Took first dose in November 19, 2010, 100 mg. four pills daily for one week. Darker urine, but nothing else.Then ANOTHER infection not even two months later, January 7, 2011. Prescribed 100 mg. twice daily for one week. The sixth day, started to feel tired. The seventh day, the last day of the prescription, I started to feel fluish - achy, tired, feverish. On the eighth day, I woke up with severe breathing problem and coughing, increased flu-like symptoms (achy, nausea, fever, profusely sweating) The trouble breathing was the worst.  I felt like I was suffocating and when I'd try to take a deep breath, which I couldn't, I'd start coughing like mad with nothing to show for it. My sister looked up the side effects and voila, they matched my symptoms.Today is the ninth day, and the symptoms are subsiding.  Woke up this morning coughing, some breathing difficulty, diharrea, nausea, and vertigo. Flu-like symptoms are gone.I am a very healthy individual who rarely gets so sick that I have to take any prescribed medication. Last antibiotic was for a root canal over a year ago. I just never get sick. I am 58 and had my last UTI when I was in my early 20's. I am alergic to penicillin and now, possibly sulfa drugs (mom and sister are allergic to sulfa).

Finally went to Dr. yesterday and received Macrobid. Last night I was so miserable (from UTI) that I wanted to pull my eyes out. Took dose last night, another this morning. Already starting to feel relief. Just a little lethargic today (even though i slept well)probably a side effect. But TODAY is the first time in 4 days I feel like I can function. 
Other	uti victim, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female		1/7/2011 1:12:28 PM	I have taken this antibiotic about 3 times over the years. It always causes intermittent nausea, intermittent headaches, and general malaise
Other	carol, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	1/3/2011 7:43:51 AM	I took Macrobid for UTIs on two occasions.  The only reason I took it a second time was because I did not realize that some of the effects I experienced the first time were due to the drug.  Each time I took it I ran a fever the first two days of treatment and experienced muscle weakness.  After a few days I began to have visual and auditory hallucinations.  One night I woke up and found my legs moving backward  involuntarily! It did clear up the UTI, but obviously has some effect on the central nervous system.  I now take cranberry tablets as a preventative because I am allergic to many antibiotics and want to avoid taking Macrobid. 
Bladder Infection caused by Enterobacter	Beth, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/1/2011 11:09:54 AM	I have had UTIs for over 20 years (I'm 49).  About 20 years ago my Dr prescribed Macrobid (I'm now using the generic) to be taken every time I have intercourse as a preventative measure.  This has worked so well that I am now only experiencing an average of 1 infection a year instead of multiples.  Prior to this method I did have some infections that led to bleeding and me going to the emergency room.  Since this preventaive treatment nothing that serious.  I still get a random infection if I become dehydrated (after watching a weekend of kids softball in the sun) or forget to take the med after sex.  When that occurs I take the med as prescribed.  I do feel some side affects - slight flu like symptoms the first day and a half but after that no real issues.  This medicine has changed my life and I have tried many over the years.  The side effects are well worth the medicine!

I have had many UTI'S in my lifetime, but this was the first time my Dr. prescribed Macrobid. Within the first 2 days I actually started to feel WORSE! I would wake up in the middle of the night shaking so hard I could hardly walk, almost passing out. Crying jags, thoughts of suicide, severe joint pain over my whole body, constant feelings of nausea, confusion and I could barely get out of bed and stand upright! I paid $45.00 out of pocket and I was actually feeling like I was going to die! I stopped taking it and threw it away, but kept the bottle so I will always know NOT TO EVER take this stuff again! I feel this should be removed from the market! I wouldn't recommend Macrobid to my worst enemy! This was the most horrible thing I ever experienced and it won't happen again! I feel you should be sued for the side effects of this garbage!

I ended up in the ER with a Kidney infection. My Dr finally prescribed me Macrobid. I had no side effects and it worked great. Haven't had one in 2 years until now and I asked for the same meds.
Other	ptcldarrin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	12/20/2010 3:12:09 AM	I started this medication on 12/13/2010 and had a terrible chest pain within an hour of taking it but didn't think it was related to the med at that time.  I had crushing chest pains, heart palpitations,dry cough and fatigue for the next 4 days.  Call the doctor and he told me to stop it.  Even after I stopped it I've still been having the feeling of a lump in my throat and shortness of breath.  If this continues tomorrow (2 days after stopping the med) I'll be going to the ER.  I've NEVER had an allergic reaction like this.  I hope it doesn't cause permanent damage.

Chest pain, difficulty breathing, jaw and ear pain, severe heartburn, dry mouth, GI issues and more, does it get rid of the problem?? yes, but at what price I will never use this again and this is day two. I cant sleep because I feel like I might die. Exercise caution!!!

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	12/12/2010 9:17:00 AM	This medication is horrible! As bad as my UTI was, the side effects were far worse. I remember having a UTI 5 years ago while I was pregnant with my daughter. I only wish I could remember what they gave me than for the simple fact that I had NO side effects. I got the nausea, runny stool, chills, and horrible migranes. And that was just in the fisrt 2 days! Now, on day 4, I have a horrible stiff neck along with chills. I have since been forced to cut my intake in half to 1 pill the past 2 days. Although, my UTI is virtually gone. I do not recommend this medication.

I would highly recommend this medication for UTI's.PS: I am highly sensitive to all med's except Advil.

I quickly started experiencing side effects from the taking this drug, which include headache, sore muscles, nausea and extreme fatigue - Sort of like getting the flu. The only good thing is the symptoms from the UTI were quick to go away and the medication if easy to take (twice a day orally with food). I would NEVER take this drug again!
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	55-64	11/1/2010 12:59:18 AM	At least my doctor warned me ahead of time that this medication might cause weird side effects.  I took Macrobid for two weeks without any noticeable side effects.  She wanted me continue for two months because of a lingering low-grade infection.  When I started taking it again, after a two week break, I got severe chills the next day, and went home with the &quot;flu&quot;, which never really developed into more than aches and feeling lousy.  What I felt for the next week was severe anxiety, nearing on panic attacks.  And a brain fog that left me unable to think straight or sleep well.  I would sleep and wake up exhausted.  None of this seemed like the symptoms that my doctor warned me about so I didn't think anything of it, except that I must be going crazy.  Until Day 6 when I woke up at 4 am, exhausted and yet unable to get back to sleep and that awful anxiety/tension racing through my body.  I thought about this being a possible medication reaction, so I got up and began researching online.  I didn't see any other people writing about all the symptoms I was having, but there were a few that were close enough, that I determined to stop it then and there.  It has been 24 hours since I stopped and most of the symptoms have cleared up.  I expect to sleep well tonight.  I still think it is a good medication for those who don't have side effects, but a doozy for those of us who do.  I'm glad my doctor warned me about it.

The side effects are really taking their toll.  I have woken up daily with a migraine and a high fever the last 2 days of over 102.  The reason I am staying on it is because of the posts on this site and the fact that this is my second antibiotic for this UTI, and it is working to get rid of it.  I hate that I have to feel horrible to get better!  Thanks for sharing your suffering so I knew I was not alone!

I usually take with a big glass of milk.  This morning I woke up @ 6:30 EXTREMELY DIZZY.  I attempted to walk to bathroom and bounced off of the hallway walls on the way there.  I staggered back to bed and awoke again at 9am feeling the same way.  I feel like I've just gotten off the Gravitron ride at the fair.  Its now about 1:30pm and I feel the same. If this continues tomorrow I will definitely call my urologist.  This sucks!  I haven't noticed any other side effects and I haven't had any UTI symptoms since I've taken this medication.

Took the first pill at night and the next morning I was sick to my stomach and had a terrible headache. That went away, but I had several headaches in the 7 days I took it. I also had little energy. I had some mild diharia, but ate yogurt to balance my system.On the 7th (last) day of treatment I developed a sore throat. Was blaming seasonal allergies, but now I think it is the med. Yesterday I felt feverish, but did not take my temp. I didn't know I had a UTI until a routine urinalysis showed it. Not sure it is gone, but I don't think I will take this med again.

Was prescribed Nitrofur-Macr 100 mg by my physician.  For the first three days I experienced nausea, headache and tiredness.  On the fourth day, I started with joint/muscle pain and severe swelling in my legs, arms and hands turning my skin bluish/purplish and my legs looked like the circulation was being cutoff.  The swelling was so bad in my hands that I could hardly drive my son to school.  Went to the ER and they diagnosed me with having a reaction to this drug.  Gave me a steriod to take care of the swelling.  To date I am now experiencing numbness/tingling in my right-hand which I believe is still the effects of this drug.  This drug should be taken off the market!
Other	Ellie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/23/2010 7:15:56 PM	I have not had any bad reaction taking this medicine as I always take it with food and drink LOTS of water while taking it.  Also eat yogurt twice a day.  Reading all the serious reactions to this medication makes me think that the people having the reactions don't know the side effects that they should be seeing their doctor about.  Fever, diarrhea, chest pain , joint pain etc.  These are all listed as symptoms that you should contact your doctor immediately about.  I think the key is getting enough water and taking with food as directed.  I am also sure that most people who had no reaction do not post their comments here.  So don't be afraid to take this med as long as you follow the directions and pay attention for any serious symptom and if your doctor won't listen call a pharmacist because they are the specialists for medication, not the doctor.  I learned this a long time ago.  Every doctor can't remember everything about every med they prescribe. Talk to your pharmacist!!!  I have avoided many drug interactions by simply asking them.  Good luck to all of you and if you see those bad symptoms don't let your doctor say it is nothing.  You know yourself better than anyone!  If they won't listen find a doctor who will!

I have worked in pharmacy for years so I know the drill well. So far it is working well. I am on day 4 and have just developed diarrhea. I will stay on the meds for the 7 days, but I will try to eat more when I take it. I am not a big eater and try and justify a bite of banana as a meal!!! UTIs can be dangerous, so I will finish out my course.
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	1vision, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1		55-64	5/29/2010 9:29:44 AM	It appears this drug has sent my best friend to the hospital 7+ times since first taking it for preventative mediciene having kidney stones.  7 attacks of Pluresy, 5 cases of Phneumonia and in hospital right now.  There is no other reasonable explaination why Drs cannot prevent this from happening.  This drug will and probably has killed many unsuspecting people through Pulmonary problems.  I am researching this and reporting it to FDA believing tests results not truth and seeking legal council

Urinary Tract Infection caused by Klebsiella Bacteria	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	5/21/2010 2:30:43 PM	I was recently prescribed this medication for a UTI.  Prior to picking it up at the pharmacy, I read the reviews on this site.  Needless to say, the reviews were a nightmare.  I came very close to calling my doctor and insisting something else be prescribed, but thought I would talk to the pharmacist first.  When I explained my concerns after reading these reviews, the pharmacist told me that she had not heard of terrible side effects, and assurred me that this medication is commonly prescribed.  I also mentioned it to two friends, who assurred me that they had taken it, without any side effects.  I followed the directions, and took the medication with food, and did not have a single side effect.  The medication worked as it was supposed to.

I am going through menopause and I seem to get uti's frequently, almost everytime after my husband and I have intercourse. Yuk..makes me afraid to have sex sometimes and that is horrible. Anyway, if I take it more than two days, one pill a day, 100mg each, I get the same reaction I did with Cipro, which is why I stopped taking Cipro. I get a horrible nervy pain in my skin. Starts on the outside of my vagina, then moves to the bottom of my thighs, up my thighs to my butt. It hurts to wipe myself and sit on the toilet. It lasts for about 2 days. Its just weird. Does anyone know if cipro and macrbid,(i take the generic of both drugs) are in the same class of medicines and has anyone heard of this before? otherwise I have no other side effects. Does anyone know of any antibiotics for UTI that have no side effects or just mild ones? what does everyone use for uti's? I am at a loss.. cant take leviquin either it makes me feel funny like I am so drugged. please help and let me know what you all take that is mild and doesnt have alot of side effects.Thank you

I think this drug should not be given to anyone.  Too many side effects and I have never had a reaction quite like this ever before...

Constant awful stomach pain, bloating, headache, the next day terrible diarrhea, fever, chills, flu like symptoms, and I was never allergic to anything before. However the pain of urinating was gone after the first 2 doses of this medicine, but all the other made me stop taking it after 3 doses, called my dr. and said not to take it anymore, just to drink plenty of fluids. And I have taking it with food, but I have never been so sick in my whole life as after this macrobid.

I have now been on it for two days (100mg twice daily.) My UTI symptoms have greatly improved, but I'm experiencing extreme fatigue, mild vertigo and some light sensitivity. That being said, the pain from the UTI was far worse, so I'll deal with the side effects until I'm sure the infection is gone.

I called my doctor's office to inquire if these effects were normal and a nurse practitioner said that these are usual for urinary tract infection.  I decided to stop the medication and on the first day I did, I felt like my old self, and did not have none of the symptoms I described.  This drug should be taken off the market.

I DID however find a way that almost totally elliminates all these symtoms while taking this drug and that is to eat ALOT of food before you take it like you just went to a buffet seriously I have a sensitive tummy sometimes and I ate alot even though my appetite was gone I ate whetevr was there and drank a whole glass of water WITH the medication and I have had no side effects except for the tiredness and headache which is o.k. with me. When I didn't eat alot and took the meds I was horrible sick with diarrhea so that was not good but I still took the medication DO NOT stop taking unless you absolutely have to. Hope I helped :).....Melani

The reviews make me nervous and I will keep a watch on things.  I have not noticed breathing or itching issues but I have been nauseated, have a headache and an extremely tired.  I also have noticed that I am beginning to get a bit achy. I wonder if these are symptoms that will progress or if that is all of the symptoms I will have.  I will probably call a pharmacist tomorrow.  I am allergic to sulfa so this is the best drug for me but I do not want to experience this for 10 days or more.
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	JC, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	45-54	3/4/2010 10:50:45 PM	I thought I was coming down with a UTI (I've only ever had 2 before, and I end to be almost asymptomatic and then suddenly acute). I was starting a new job and didn't want to risk it, so I had a urinalysis done at a local clinic. I didn't test strongly for a UTI but they agreed to give me antibiotics just in case.I'm allergic to sulfa so they gave me macrobid. That was a week ago, and I've been feeling like crap, so I decided to check the drug out here. I see that many other women share my symptoms: night sweats, muscle and joint aches (I thought I was either having a kidney infection, a ruptured disc, or horrible cramps.) I just took a dose, and I dread tonight, but you can be sure I'm not taking any more.
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	Lennie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/4/2010 10:50:56 AM	After reading the reviews I was very nervous to take this medication.  I talked to my doctor about it and he said you have more a chance of getting hit by lightning than getting any of those symptoms.  So I decided I would take the medication.  for seven days of use, I NEVER ONCE had a reaction. Completely got rid of the infection and no awful side effects.  So to all that is scared to take this medication, don't be.  I'm very pleased.

This morning I took it after breakfast and same thing is happening, nausea, stomach cramps on my right side, flushed face and itching around the mouth. What realy frustrates me I informed the Dr. that I have a high sensitivity to Antibiotic that cause Oral Thrush, every Penicillin I tried results in a Oral Yeast infections so bad that it makes me feel like my teeth are loose. The IDIOT still prescribed this for me, what the hell was he thinking that I am inventing these symptoms, let me tell you they are not pleasant. I will call the clinic and give them a piece of my mind. YOu are absolutly right this meds should not be on the market.

Causing numbness in my legs and my arms and my fingers.  Terrible pain in my lower back and stomach.  Much of this has still not returned to normal.

I've beenon macrobid for 8 days.  I've been having the fever, SEVERE joint &amp; muscle pain, SEVERE chills/shaking, headache, overall all fatigue, etc. I actually ended up at the ER and was admitted for 4 days on IV antibiotics (not MACROBID).  Since being released from the hospital my uro has me checking in, and while the fever has evened out, the pain in my neck, shoulders, arms, hips and knees is EXCRUCIATING! It kills me to get up from the couch or pick up my arms.  The nurse just told me to check with my GP as Macrobid &quot;could&quot; have some side effects like that.  I just jumped onto this site, and am stunned at how similar my situation is!  I thought I had H1N1 or worse!  I'm stopping this drug immdiately!

Other	thisisridiculous, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	3	3	3	Male	35-44	2/5/2010 3:25:58 PM	it is completely useless to 'rate' a drug such as this.  you people are not buying toasters!  at least one person will have any number of side effects with ANY drug.  that has no bearing on someone else being prescribed the same med.  everyone reacts in a different way, with the VAST MAJORITY of people not experiencing any side effects - you only hear from the people with complaints. also, 'rating' an antibiotic is especially useless because each particular organism carrying infection has a particular sensitivity profile for each antibiotic - so an actual urine culture (in the case of macrobid) is needed to decide before the fact if it has a chance of working on you or not!!!shame on webmd and other websites for even having these 'reviews'!!

All in all the pill did clear up my UTI, but I felt very sick for the duration I took the pill. I had itchy hands and feet, plus I just did not feel like myself. Very fatigued and just blah feeling. I couldn't wait to quit taking it, but I knew I needed to complete the entire Rx so the UTI could clear up.

It was like the swine flu.. I never have bad reactions to pills but this was the first time. Went to the doctor said I didn't have kidney infection, but he didn't believe it was Macrobid causing the symptoms.  But I do I told him to change to cipro then I felt back to normal.. This pill should be taken off the market!

Luckily I read the side effects on the paper that came with the prescription and called the doctor right away.  Can't believe that this med is still on the market with so many people reporting these same side effects.  Thank goodness I was only down for 48 hours!

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	1/18/2010 2:29:19 PM	I was prescribed Macrobid last week after developing a UTI. (Bactrim put me in the ER earlier this year so that was not an option) Macrobid seemed to work, symptoms gone in about 48 hours.Side effects, not great. I've had a headache for a week. Very sleepy and lethargic. Heart races more than normal. I have a sensitive stomach and suprisingly, not too bad for an antibiotic.I think I would take again if I had to, but I wouldnt request it, given a choice. 
Urinary Tract Infection caused by Staphylococcus Aureus	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	1/17/2010 11:13:29 AM	I was diagnosed with a low-grade UTI on thursday and told to take Cipro 500 ml twice daily. i get a call on friday afternoon saying that the strain of infection was resistant to Cipro and that i needed to try a different antibiotic. I was given Macrobid. I took the Macrobid a full 12 hours after the last dose of Cipro, only to develop stabbing pain in my lower stomach/pubic bone area, a massive headache and the shakes two hours later. I went the ER where the doctor told me that those didn't seem to be side effects of the drug. From what i've read about the drug, it seems like it very well could be an allergic reaction. They gave me steriods and benedryl as well as adavan to try and relax me. this is the day after and i still have the shakes. i will never use this pill again. it is not worth the horrible reaction!

Soon after, I experienced a hacking cough, headaches, joint pain and fatigue.  By the 4th day, I started having blury vision, which is when I stopped the medication, called my dr. and started a new drug which worked fine with no side effects.  I took Macrobid last year and had the same symptoms, but thought it was the flu -- I'm convinced it is the drug and I will never take it again!

What started out as a very mild infection has now turned into a full blown infection.  I was first prescribed Septra, generic. After 2 /12 days on it my symtoms were much worse instead of better. Told to stop this med and go on Macrobid,  Could only get the generic for this also from my Pharmacy.  Has not worked well for me at all. One day felt almost back tonormal, next day symptoms worse.  Test strip showed more infection than when I first startd medication. Some nausea with this med. upset bowels, but not the worse side effects.  Main side effect, not clearing up infection.  Mother was on this medication also for UTI.  She did get better, but within 10 days infection returned with a vengence!  I've taken the Brand name of this med. in the past and did well with it. The inferior generics are another story. This is the first time that I have taken med. for a UTI and it has not solved the problem.  Then I remembered that I had always taken the BRAND name until now.

I followed directions and took with food and plenty of water.  The most difficult part was convincing the doctor that I was having a reaction to the drug, rather than symptoms of the infection. I finally read to her the &quot;common side effects&quot; list that came with the prescrption and told her I wasn't taking another pill.  I'll never take this drug again.

It worked great keeping me infection free. Moved and new Dr. would not give for chronic problems so now I get bad infections again. Went to an urgent care clinic this time and they perscribed it. Working well so far (day 4) and no side effects. I am allegeric to many drugs so pleased this one works so well for me.

After ONE pill, she was sick all night like she was dying.  It was like the worst flu ever.  She DID take it with food, so ignore the posts here from those who work for the pharmaceutical industry that accuse everyone who posts adverse effects of this drug here of not taking food with it.  It isn't true.  She will never take this drug again.  I still am considering taking my mother to the emergency room 16 hours after ONE pill.

I wasnt sure it was a side effect to the meds because I had never experienced a side effect of that nature.  Continued to take it as perscribed, but on the third day, I could barlely get out of bed due to back, neck, and joint pain; especially the hips.  Going to work is out of the question due to the severity of the pain and flu like symptoms.  Will not take Macrobid nor will I recommend it to anyone else.
Other	Isis, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	12/4/2009 7:19:45 PM	This medication is a nightmare!!!  I had vomitting and diarrhea, nauseau all day, migraines that were nonstop, I was lethargic and dizzy, and my urine was the color of pickle juice!!! I have never had any adverse reaction to any other medications or antibiotics and I have never been allergic to anything but this was terrible!!! The only thing that helped to keep the vomitting at bay was eating saltines and that was the only symptom I could fix. The doctor perscribed it twice a day for 7 days, but by the 3rd day I couldnt do it anymore. I would not recommend this med to anyone!!

My face, lips, eyes, ears, were swollen and hurt badly.  My eyes were completly blood shot and I couldnt move them from side to side because they hurt so bad.  I have the worst headache ever!  My head was so swollen my ears were even closed.  Also I had painfull itchy palms and severe abdominal pain.  Benadryl orally did not work I had to go to ER to get injection and a dose of prednisone.  Worse allergic reaction ever! Good Luck to those who take it.

But after taking 3 capsules in 2 days I have an awful headache, stiff neck, dizziness, dry mouth, lethargy, and now I feel like I'm coming down with the flu. I feel worse as this second day progresses. Did the medication work for the urinary infection? YES. But at what expense to my body? I will not take it again.

And did not work. Macrobit or its generic did cause me side effects, light sensitivity, dry mouth, headache and nausea, tiredness. None of them unbearable but very uncomfortable at times not all the time. I hope it works yet UTI is so easy to get over &amp; over. Want to try more natural stuff and see how it works instead of all this antibiotics which will surely get me yeast. A never ending story.

I had to discontinue taking it on the 6th day as I could not tolerate the stomach cramps and nausea. It has caused me severe gastritis which is not responding to the usual meds for gastritis, ie: Nexium, Previcid etc. It has been three weeks since I stopped taking the medication and my stomach is still upset and cramping every day.

I am on Day 4 of the treatment, and I have experienced body aches, joint aches, headaches, extreme fatigue, and sleepines, and itching and redness on my hands, and forearms. However I never had any symptom with the UTI, but DR said the culture came back with infection so thats why Im on meds.

Pharmacist advised taking after breakfast and dinner, and to include some dairy in the meals. This may be the key to avoiding side effects. I was nauseous once, and threw up a dinner with no dairy, but  it was more likely from the 2 glasses of wine I forgot you shouldn't have on antibiotics. I felt some muscle fatigue, but my actual performance on the tennis court and in the gym was completely normal. These other reviews had me worried, so I thought I should post for some balance. Don't forget: go very light or not at all on alcohol, take 'em on a full stomach, and keep eating active-culture yogurt to replace the good-guy bacteria that gets compromised.

I thought I was having a reaction to the flu shot when I started feeling nauseus, achy, and fatigued.  After 6 days on the medication I developed severe hives all over my body, which required me to get a steroid shot.  It has been over 2 weeks and I am still breaking out in hives from time to time and itching every single day.  Can't wait for the itching to stop - how long will that take though?

Called Pharmacist and she said she had no problems with it. I have been fine as well.  Have one more dose left. It has worked for me. I wrote this due to the fact that most people that write reviews about things are usually negative reviews. So here is a positive one.
Urinary Tract Infection caused by Klebsiella Bacteria	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	11/5/2009 7:25:01 AM	This drug cause such severe allergic reaction it put me in the hospital with a fever of 105.  I also had a stiff neck, horrible headache, joint pain and weakness.  Unfortunately at the time this was not diagnosed as a drug reaction but something else.  I took the drug again for a bladder infection and had the same reaction.  This time I asked my Dr if it could possibly be the Macrobid that was causing the symptoms. The answer I got was &quot;maybe, it's possible&quot;. That incedent happened over a year ago. Yesterday I went in for another baldder infection and was given Macrobid again because the drug wasn't listed on my chart under allergies and at the time I couldn't remember what had caused the reaction.  I took one capsule at lunch before returning home.  At dinner the chills started and by 7pm I was feeling as if I wanted to die.  My temp only went up to 103 this time but the flu-like symptoms were horrible. Trust me, from now on if they EVER try to prescribe this medicine to me I will refuse it.  This is the worst side effects I have ever had from any meds.

I've been prescribed Macrobid for most of them and I've never experienced a single side effect until now....I developed a urinary tract infection during my 27th week of pregnancy.  My OB/GYN prescribed me Macrobid.  An hour after taking the very first pill I was extremely exhausted, I felt sick and dizzy, nauseous, and felt like I had just came down with the flu.  This is the end of my second day taking this medication and I tomorrow I will be calling my OB and telling her that I'd rather have a UTI instead of taking this medication one more day.

Today the flu symptoms are back and worse than ever.

I starting taking Nitrofuratin (Microbid generic) on 9/28/09.  On 10/4 I woke up with a terrible rash up and down both legs, from my ankles to my knees.  On 10/5, I started getting terrible flu-like symptoms - body aches, fever, general malaise.  On 10/6, my joints (particularly in my knees and ankles) started to hurt - so much so that I couldn't walk in the mornings, and if I sat too long, it was difficult to get up from a chair (and I am only in my 30's!).  By 10/7, my chest started feeling congested (I learned later that it was actually my lungs tightening up from the allergy).   Because of H1N1 and everything else out there these days, I didn't realize I was having an allergic reaction from the drug until after taking all 20 pills (2 100mg pills a day for 10 days).  As soon as I stopped the pills, the fever, the body aches, stiff joints and chest 'congestion' all were better within hours... However, since then (for the last 13 days), I am TERRIBLY itchy....Every few hours I suddenly break out in hives or itchy bumps in some place on my body (it varies - although my wrists are the worst)... I pop Benadryl when the itching becomes intolerable... but please someone tell me how long before this thing is out of my system and the itching stops???!!!  After what I have suffered, I would rather have my UTI back... :(

The side effects I experienced were extreme exhaustion, feelings of depression, mood swings, which I never get.  I have a few more pills remaining which I'll take, but if given the choice in the future I'll ask for something else.  I wish I would have known before hand so I could have warned my friends and family!

I experienced chest tightness, cough, extreme fatigue, joint pain, and nausea. I thought it was my infection getting worse so I took the second pill and continued to experience chest tightness until I looked online at possible side effects. Called my doctor and she said to stop taking it and take benadryl to alleviate any remaining side effects. I have taken this med in the past with no problem, so I don't know why it caused me to feel this way this time. I will never take this med again.
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	kmchris13, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	55-64	10/3/2009 9:03:43 AM	Most of the reviews have been written by females. I'm a guy who has kidney stones and am using this to prevent a bladder infection.  Worst side effects after 3 days (6 doses of 100 mg) is a constant migrane-like headache and elevated temp. Can control the headaches with OTC pain relievers and temp with lots of cold fluids.  So far no severe adverse reactions.
Other	patient, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	10/2/2009 3:31:35 PM	For a UTI, first Cipro was prescribed. After 2 pills, I couldn't sleep, and had pain and stiffness in my legs, so asked for a different antibiotic. Microbid was prescribed. After 2 pills, it was HORRIBLE! Awful headache, chills, nausea, anxiety, slight temperature rise, back burning in waves of burning, absolute exhaustion.It felt like I was being poisoned. I am sensitive to drugs, but this was the most extreme reaction I have had to an antibiotic. I had to go to the ER. This drug needs to be investigated more before it is so easily prescribed.

I almost died from it. I had severe trouble breathing, chest pain, severe headache and neck pain, high fever, hives on arms legs and stomach, back pain &amp; severe joint pain. I knew it was an allergic reaction because it was the only thing I was taking.  I took it in June and didn't feel back to normal until August. Also, after all that I went through, I still have the uti.

Now I am wondering after I have been off of it for a week can I still get side effects from it?About a week ago I started using a new soap and I started itching this week really badly and thought well maybe it was the soap, my husband got me some new soap for sensitive skin and then I put lotion on after that and I am still itching all over and I mean all over in every place. Could this be caused by macrobid even after a week off of it?

If given any other choice, I'll grab at that, but as I'm allergic to cipro, there's only this and sulfa to choose from these days. Can't keep anything down while on Macrobid if it's not prescribed alongside a set of anti-nausea pills. Horrible experience...

After day one the burning and frequent urination subsided. I am now on day three and feel no signs or symptoms of UTI anymore. I get UTIs very often, and I can tell you all that although you should always go to the dr and get a rx, over the counter AZO pills work wonders for me. After a couple of days of taking AZO the burning and throbbing lets up... also water and cranberry juice or cranberry pills taken with the AZO helps tremendously! I feel for all of you that suffer from UTIs because I know that they are one of the worst things go get... I would rather have the flu or go into labor over another UTI, to me this is one of the worst conditions I have ever experienced!

It is 4:00am and I have been taking this for 3 days. I woke again the third night in a row feeling extremly nausious and running to the bathroom. I have a very bad headache and can't sleep. My doctor prescribed a 5 day course for a UTI infection. I have had zero relief or even the hint of the infection clearing. I am in more pain after taking this medicine for the past 3 days. I wish I had read this website before I started it. I will call my doctor and ask to switch immediatly.

I was supposed to continue taking it until I had my baby to prevent further UTI's, and being 32 weeks, that is over two months. I took this drug as prescribed, with food, and drank plenty of liquids.  During the first five days, my UTI symptoms seemed to actually WORSEN, and then they got better.  However, after the UTI symptoms went away, I started displaying odd problems.  Migraine headache, extreme lethargy, itchiness of my hands and feet, and ultimately a nasty rash broke out on the tops AND bottoms of my feet, making it next to impossible to walk.  My baby's movement slowed down significantly while on this drug, and one day, she didn't move at all, which resulted in a trip to the L&amp;D to monitor her.  My appetite withered away, and I my blood pressure hit the high 130's for the first time ever in my life. I also displayed nausea and dizziness.  I was on this drug for nearly three weeks before I put 2 &amp; 2 together.  My husband and I discussed this with our physician and she didn't think the drug was the cause of my problems because &quot;it's a very benign drug.&quot;  Well, I stopped taking this five days ago and all of the negative symptoms went away within three days, except for the rash, but that has now subsided as well.  I will NEVER take this drug again.  Doesn't matter if you take it as prescribed - it made me miserable for three weeks and could have even caused problems for my unborn child!

After two pills I was in bed with flu symptoms. Fever,chills and aches and pains tormented me for the next twelve hours. This medication is awful and I would rather have the bladder infection.

Side effects included peripheral neuropathy, joint and muscle pain, severe arm weakness, photosensitivity and too many others to list.  Please, visit http://www.squidoo.com/d-mannose to read about my battle w/UTI's and how I found complete relief by taking d-mannose as a preventative.  100% natural 100% safe.  I don't sell d-mannose, I just want to help stop the kind of suffering I experienced.  These pharmaceutical drugs are so dangerous, they're hurting and in some cases killing people!

Other	concernedpatient, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	8/12/2009 3:37:12 PM	I took 3 doses of this for a nonspecific UTI.  Headache, lethargy and body aches started within 1 hour of 1st dose.  After 3rd dose, I began experiencing difficulty breathing, and then chest pain.  Chest pain is much worse after eating, for some reason.  I stopped the medication and am still experiencing symptoms 4 days later.  This medication should be reserved for cases that do not respond to other antibiotics, and even then, patients informed of severe side effect possibility.  Luckily, I researched side effects after 3rd dose, but not everyone would do this, and may assume symptoms are part of the illness, rather than a reaction.I am shocked that the doctors, nurse and pharmacist that I spoke with since this began, seemed totally unaware of these side effects.  Educate everyone please!  This is a terrible drug that should be used in extreme cases! Hopefully, I am not one of the unfortunate who will have permanent lung damage.
Infection of the Urinary Tract caused by Enterococcus	ohtoothfairy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	8/8/2009 7:06:46 AM	In the past I have taken the BRAND named Macrobid.  Yesterday I got a Rx and it was the generic brand.  I have been ill with a HORRID headache 3 hours after taking the first pill.  I have only taken 2 of these pills and now I have nausea along with this headache that wont go away.  With all these other symptoms I dont even know if it is helping with the bladder infection. I believe the generic is just not as good as the original and for the insurance to save money on Rx costs,  I am the one suffering.  NEVER again will I take this unless it is NOT generic.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	8/7/2009 8:15:40 PM	I took this to get rid of a bacteria. I just came from my Dr.(i told her i was on this drug for the past few weeks, prescribed by a specialists). I was tested for a few diseases, the rash caused confusion to her. My tests came back negative, she had no other help to offer for me!!It struck me to look this drug up, my God i couldn't believe it, it's like someone let the sunshine in!!My symptoms made no sense to her, but i have most of them. I took the drug for a few weeks, at first i was constantly in a sweat (well over menapause). I felt one morning like someone hit me in the back of the head with a sledge hammer, i had to lay down immediately, then came the fever the awful Chills, terrible abdomine pains, knees didn't work, muscle pain was unbelievable!!! Then came the rash, all over my body. I can't tell you how happy i was to find this information, my last pill was today and never to be taken again!

After my last dose (one week later), I was severly sick - high fever, achy, headache.  Doctor said I probably caught a virus and didn't make a connection to the Macrobid.  3 weeks later my UTI returned and Dr prescribed Macrobid again.  5 hours after I took my first pill, I was achy, chills, high fever, and very lethargic.  The doctor prescribed a different antibiotic, but only after I had to convince him my syptoms were from the drug.  Took about 2 days for my symptoms to clear, but they were the most awful 2 days ever.

I followed the prescription and unfortunately it did not eliminate the infection. Other than the medication not taking care of the infection, I had no adverse side-effects except for slight nausea due to not taking the pill with food. Now my doctor is recommending Septra. 
Urinary Tract Infection Prevention		1	5	1			6/27/2009 10:16:14 PM	I took nitrofurantoin, for 12 months to treat and prevent UTI's.  Over time I developed severe and debilitating pain in my arms, especially the joints and tendons, as a side effect of this drug.  Over a year later I still have painful symptoms that significantly impact my daily activities.  I did find a cure for my UTI's however.  Cranberry juice/pills NEVER worked for me, it actually made my bladder symptoms worse.  I discovered by chance on the internet a 100% natural and safe sugar called D-mannose.  It TOTALLY prevents my UTI's.  PLEASE, if you're suffers with UTI's, visit www.squidoo.com/d-mannose and read my personal story.  I'm not selling D-mannose, I just want to help prevent the kind of suffering I went through on this drug.

Other	arizwldcat, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	6/12/2009 5:46:47 PM	While this drug apparently made my UTI (not sure what the cause was, the doc's office didn't tell me!) better, I was plagued for 3 - 4 nights with severe chills and fever.  I was shivering uncontrollably.  Then, I had a low grade fever and felt lousy the entire time.  Now, I've been on the drug for 7 1/2 days, and the chills are subsiding, but I have had a severe headache for 3 days.  Nothing I  take makes it better.  I called the doctor twice.  The first time they told me it sounded like the infection was working its way through my body; this time, I begged to be taken off the drug and put on something else (I am not allergic to any medications and have always responded well to other antibiotic treatments), but the PA I saw (doc was out of town) refused to consider the possibility.  I won't be going back to HER, ever, and won't ever take this drug again.  It is most disturbing to read of doctors that don't believe patients.  I was told that my symptoms &quot;are not side effects&quot; of Macrobid, yet I keep reading about others having the same symptoms.  Huh.
Other	lisainwichita, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	6/5/2009 12:02:44 PM	Was relieved to find I had experienced similar adverse reactions as others on this post.  Was started on this drug for a bladder infection and 1 day into treatment, thought I developed the flu or mono.  Was only on this Rx for 3 days; on the day following my first dose, I developed a sore throat and headache. By that evening, in addition to the headache and sore throat, I had neck swelling and tenderness, calf cramping, wanted to sleep all the time, and was barely able to swallow. I've never had an adverse reaction to ANY Rx. Will STAY AWAY from this drug from this point forward! Wicked stuff.

I get UTI's often and have tried several different antibiotics and this one works the best and I experienced no side effects. My symtoms go away after just one day. (No more using Azo Standard-yay!)

Coli Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	35-44	5/19/2009 1:19:01 PM	I began taking Macrobid after the culture came back saying the original med prescribed wouldn't work. I developed a high (103) fever, couldn't take a deep breath, had zero energy for about four days. Called the pharmacist to describe my symptoms and she thought it was a reaction to Macrobid- went back to doctor and he thought it was delayed reaction to Bactrim (the original antibiotic). I took the last of the Macrobid, then was told to start taking the Bactrim again for the viral infection they thought I had. Ended up with a rash all over my legs that itched terribly about a week after I stopped taking Macrobid.Was prescribed low-dose Macrobid by gyno for after-sex use- took one and had the horrible joint pain all over again. After reading reviews here, I'm convinced it was a Macrobid reaction (both times) and that perhaps I'm NOT allergic to Bactrim after all.Too bad about Macrobid- I've had 7 or 8 UTIs in the last seven months. If I keep developing allergies to antibiotics, where will I be...?

This was horrible. I would suggest taking your first dose at home and with someone there.  I had no idea this was going to happen to me.

The pain was about a level 10.
Other	Cubs Fan 1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	4/25/2009 10:36:13 AM	Was given this as a prevetative after having a cystoscopy for persistent hemeturia without UTI. 2 pills a day for 5 days then 1 a day for 14 days.  After 3rd day I developed what I thought was spring time allergy; runny nose, cough, fever, aches, etc.  Took last pill last evening and this morning have a rash all over my feet and ankles moving up my legs.  Fever has been as high as 102.  I was ready to go to ER to get a chest x-ray and make sure no pneumonia but after reading this site I may need to get prednisone or other for allergic reaction.  Am allergic to penicillin/amoxicillin and now apparently this as well. Can't say about effectiveness as this was simply for a preventative measure.  Thanks for all of the input.

I felt overly fatigued and when I tried to get up and/or go out, I had an extremely elevated heartbeat, would get lightheaded and dizzy, and started to have tunnel vision.  The symptoms did go away within 12 hours of when the last pill I took should've been effective till.  I will never take this medication again.  Just reading the side effects, I have to wonder what is in a medication that makes it cause lung disease if it is used long-term.  As someone with asthma, I double-checked with two different pharmacists to make sure I could take this medication at all without any harm to my lungs and they said I could because it was only prescribed for 7 days.  Though I didn't have any immediate breathing issues, I had acute asthma issues less than 2 days after ending the medication.

The inside (crushed) of the capsules tasted horrible (mixed with moist food like pudding or applesauce.) The drug caused side effects, THUS FAR, of diarrhea, nausea &amp; neurological problems. My child has since been treated in the ER TWICE for NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS associated with this medication!!!  These symptoms include severe, sudden onset of headache, numbness &amp; tingling in the arm &amp; hand and blurred vision/partial blindness in one eye, again with a sudden headache. The first ER physician advised to stop this medication &amp; said it was likely to blame. Her liver count &amp; glucose levels were quite elevated as well. I hope the damage I've seen is temporary - PLEASE USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN GIVING THIS MEDICATION TO PEDIATRICS PATIENTS UNDER THE AGE OF 12!!! We will NEVER, EVER use it again!

Furthermore, my liver was damaged from its effects on my body. After a month and a half I'm feeling better, but what an ordeal. We should file a complaint with the FDA, because there are so many other better treatments for UTI, and besides I found out through medical advise that this drug is outdated.

About two weeks later, I broke out in hives which were releived by a steroid shot.  However, two days later I broke out in a severe rash over my entire body and  my eyes were practically swollen shut.

Within an hour of taking the first pill, my legs were cramping, my head was spinning, and I was extremely weak.  My legs felt as if they were going to give out when I walked and I had to use the wall for support.  This occurred again after the second dosage.  I called my doctor the next morning (after waking up with swollen eyes), they advised me to stop taking it immediately.  I'm not sure if it cleared up my infection at all though, I only took it for the one day.

Tongue was swollen, mouth and teeth went numb, bruised all over, stomach hurt so bad I could hardly walk, night/day sweats, nightmares, dizziness,oh and don't forget the severe headaches, back pain, fever, chills, nausia, vomiting, increased heart rate (over 100) blood preasure 159/118 and weakness. I could go on but I think you get the picture. My Doctor made me feel like I was making this stuff up and told me I needed to see a Dentist and he thought this was a dental problem (I have perfect teeth by the way). I have the greatest faith in my Doctor but it was somewhat disconcerning that I had to figure this one out instead of him. Listen to your body...You know your body better than any Doctor ever will!

I felt fine after I finished the bactrim, but woke up Monday morning with the horrible UTI feeling again.  I went back to the doctor and she prescribed me the macrobid.  I took one pill Monday evening and decided to get another one in before bed.  That was was a horrible idea to say the least!!  I took both a\pills about 5 hours apart from eachother and it may me so sick to my stomache.  I was honestly on the verge of vomiting at any moment.  I called my doctor and she said to wait for an hour and if the symptoms do not let up then I need to go to the ER.  I felt so much better after the hour!  The next day, I didn't start the medication until the last time I took it the night before. I took the pill and has no symptoms at all.  I took another one this morning and I feel fine.  A bit of diarrhea and tiredness, but I can deal with all of that.  I still feel a bit uncomfortable in that are, but I assume it's because I just started taking the medication.

She was very sick at her stomach, which increased over the course of 3 days. On the night of the third day she woke up gurgling and could not breath, she could not get up and had to be lifted off the bed, she also wet the bed. Her symtoms went on stopping the medication. I have no doubt it was this medication. So, if you decide to take this med, good luck. Also, My brother-in law took it and he said he thought he was going to die!

You guys scared the crap out of me.  I was afraid to take it.  Luckily, I have had NO side effects whatsoever.  I took it as prescribed &quot;with food&quot;.  No upset stomach, no headache, no diarrhea, no fatigue, nothing.  Not sure if everyone took it with food, but it sure worked for me.  As far as the dark urine?  I drink alot of water and only saw it within hours of taking a pill.  Besides that lets me know it's working.  Anyone reading about this medication really shouldn't worry, if you take it with food you should be fine.  I was.

Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	Marion Lynch, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	8/31/2008 9:04:05 PM	I have been sick for 4 weeks with this medicine.  I kept getting (or so I thought), urinary tract infections...they put me on macrobid which would fix the infection because my cultures came out clear; however, I was so nauseous, night sweats, chills, severe malaise, exhaustion, horrible headache, backach, that I thought the UTI kept coming back.  From my gynecogist, I went to a urologist and then to her partner when she was out.  The prescribed Microbid after intercourse...I would be sick all day in bed the next few days.  When the urologist said I was fine that I should go to my internist because there was nothing wrong with me with my kidneys, I did so.  I spoke with my physicians PA and then the doctor.  They both told me there was nothing wrong with me and that I must have experienced a viral infection (that lasted 3 to 4 weeks).  I told each and every doctor my symptoms after I took the medicine and NOT ONE said that I was having a severe allergic reaction until I looked it up on line.  I was very very relieved that I was not losing my mind; however, I am so disappointed in the medical community.....to have FOUR doctors who could not put 2 and 2 together is extremely disturbing.  I WILL NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG AGAIN.  I thought I was going to die.  And then to be told it was probably just a little viral infection (no cause or reason)...is so upsetting.  I am a college-educated person who rarely goes to the doctor and I was made to feel like a hypochondriac. Years ago I took flagyl which resulted in severe joint pain - the doctor said he had never heard of flagyl doing that to anyone and that it was definitely NOT A SIDE EFFECT.  I called my druggist who read me the side effects and sure enough join pain was there.  What the heck is wrong with these doctors??

I had 3 UTIs in one month this spring.  Dr. referred me to a urologist who prescribed Macrobid (forever prophylac use) to prevent future UTIs.Macrobid has indeed done a grear job at preventing any further UTIs, however it has been just about killing me to take this med for the last two months.  As I sat here reading all these reviews I was stunned to see the similarity in my symptoms as compared to other users.I get severe heartburn, chest discomfort (and pain), nausea, vomiting (bile), and the worst fatigue imaginable, not to mention the massive headache to go with it all, night after night as I was told to take it at bedtime (yeah right, who can sleep when they feel this ill?).  I have been wondering what in the world has been wrong with me for the last few months.  It's this darn drug!I really want to stay UTI free due to the unavoidable and necessary use of the indwelling Foley catheter, but OMG, I am so sick from this drug that I am seriously considering stopping this med.  It's a shame since it does really, really keep my bladder from getting highly infected, which can be extremely painful. But...at what cost?  Isn't there some other way to stay UTI free without feeling so horribly sick with side effects from this drug?Unless you are truly, truly desperate, I cannot in good conscience advocate the use of this highly effective but definitely debilitating drug!STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG IF YOU DON'T WANT SEVERELY HORRIBLE GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE ABDOMINAL PAIN! AND, LET'S NOT FORGET THE HORRENDOUS HEADACHE TO BOOT!

Also I think it made me a little depressed.  Got off that halfway and now im on this.  By reading the reviews sounds like it is going to be the same way.  Ive only taken 1 so far a couple hours ago and still feel alright.  I'll keep fingers crossed.

I was prescribed this medicine for a UTI and I did not have a culture sent to the lab, my symptoms went away for 2 days and then came back twice as hard and I had severe kidney pain.  This medicine made me nauseated as well and I have started a new anti-biotic without any hope of relief yet.

I am now convinced I am allergic to this drug. I took it for the first time one year ago and broke out in rash a week later. Rash lasted a few days and then went away. Questioned the drug at the time but never made the connection. Thought I would have seen effects quicker than a week after if it was truly the drug. I just took the drug again two weeks ago while at the same time being 35 weeks pregnant. Sure enough a week later I broke out in a rash again but worse. I have now had the rash all over my body for a week and am now 37 weeks pregnant and its all just too much! Hopefully it goes away soon. I WILL NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG AGAIN! Its not worth the pain and agony.

Other	shank, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	6/18/2008 10:38:25 PM	I was given this for two days/twice daily after a procedure at my OB/GYN to prevent a bacterial infection. I took the first pill and was okay. After the second pill I was convinced I had the flu  or they had accidentally prescribe a sulfa product which I am allergic to. I had to leave my daughter's softball game. I came home nauseated, with a migraine-like headache, and my hips and knees ached. My legs were weak and I was cramping in my calves. I am glad I was able to read these posts after my husband suggested I might be allergic to this product, so I could stop the product and let my doctor know my symptoms. It sounds like the people who took it longer had some pretty severe side-effects and reactions.

Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/15/2008 6:22:44 PM	I began getting UITs as a young woman, and have had so many since then, that the scar tissue in my bladder makes me very prone to them. After finally being referred to a urologist, I am now on prophylactic(preventative) Macrobid. I take one each time immediately after intercourse; and as long as I remember to do that, I am UTI-free...what a relief! It is very important to take Macrobid with food, and drink plenty of water. Many of the side effects I have read about could be due to the actual infection, as a UTI can move quickly, and it does take time for medication to even begin to kick in!

Doc felt is was not the medication but instead a virus and asked that I continue the final three doses.  MY MISTAKE.  Took final dose last night and now have itchy rash head to toe!  On doing research on the drug this morning, it is clear to me that I am having a severe allergic reaction to this medication.  Guess I'm going today for medical evaluation.
