Serious Decrease in Thyroid Function	Sofar, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	45-54	4/29/2012 1:08:06 PM	My provider added 25 mcg of liothyronine to my  levothyroxine because I wasn't responding as well as she thought I should be to the T4 alone. After several weeks of hyper symptoms, I fought through it and I have now stabilized. The worst side effects were restless leg syndrome, palpitations, racing thoughts/anxiety, and loose bowels. All of that has stabilized, and I take both my meds right before bed. Big difference in quality of life issues.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	Lynn G, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	3/21/2012 5:01:14 PM	I was put on this medication to increase my seratonin levels, as an alternative to adding more SNRI type medications, as it's considered an alternative therapy when weight-neutral options are needed.  It has really helped with my fatigue issues, as well as my overall happiness.  Initially, I had some sensitivity issues, but after 3 days or so I adjusted.  Each increase causes a recurrence and headaches, but we are treading lightly for that reason.  I have some digestive upset as well, but simple nausea medications combat this easily.

I AM BIPOLAR 1 AND DEVELOPED SEVERE HYPOIRRITABILTY. DR. TOLD ME TO REDUCE THE MEDICATION THAT I AM TAKEN CALLED CELEXA. THE COMBINATION OF TAKEN THE CELEXA AND THE LIOTHYRONINE SENT ME IN TO A TAIL SPIN. HOWEVER REDUCING THE CELEXA TO ONLY 10 MGS INSTEAD OF 20 HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. I HAVE'NT FELT THIS BALANCED IN OVER 3 WEEKS. MOODS KEPT CYCLING IN A VERY ERATIC WAY. ONCE I REDUCED THE ANTIDEPRESSENT CYLEXA I BECAME MORE STABILIZED. 
Cancer of Thyroid	JoeEstelle, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Male	45-54	1/10/2011 11:50:40 AM	I have Stage 3 papillary cancer.  All thyroids have been removed.  Just started on Synthroid and wanted to offer my one week usage.  I have not experienced any ill effects as of yet and hope none occur.  I was on a low-iodine diet for 2-weeks prior to this followed my 150 mCI of I-131, so I may be seeing some false positives.  Especially since I am now eating a normal diet.

Other	Jay, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	7/31/2010 10:41:55 PM	I have had problems since aug 02 when my daughter was born. I was 22. Lots of sypmtoms!!!  In 04 Dr tested my hormones.  Adrenal Gland Disorder. Progesterone was prescribed. Helped for about 6mnths. Upped dosage. Not much help. I dont take it any more. In 09 was having new and different symptoms. Very itchy hands and feet. Telling Dr about them. He said lets try something diff. I have been thru alot of meds. I was put on LIOTHYRONINE. In about 2 weeks my biggest symptom was gone! YAHOO! I take 1 in morn and 1 in afternoon (if i remember).  Now theres a diff symptom, my skin crawls and tingles in pathes and now its getting to the point that it is painfull instead of just annoying. Kinda like my skin is on fire. It happens only on my waist,butt, thighs and feet. I tell my boyfriend not to touch those areas.  It will last for about 3 days sometimes. I dont know what to do or if this is from the meds or just another symptom among the others. If I stop this med my yeast and bacterial infections will come back! Not an option. Any one heard of such symptoms?

And I feel Great! I've also lost 9 lbs so far with the combination over the course of 5 months. I dont' think I would have felt better been able to loose weight on synthroid alone. If your having the same problems try to convince your Doctor to try it. it work's!

Mild Underactive Thyroid	fluencymster,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female		11/17/2009 8:05:29 AM	I requested this medication after previous use of synthroid with no alleviation of symptoms.  I no longer have to take naps to get through the day, my skin is no longer too dry and my antidepressant med is working better.  My menstrual cycle is not as severe as before.  It did take several weeks for me to see consistent improvement, but that is to be expected.
