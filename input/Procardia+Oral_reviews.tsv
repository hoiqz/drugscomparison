Other	Shirley, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		8/28/2012 5:18:29 PM	I have been on this medicine for years, the 30 mg. My blood pressure began to go too high so the Dr. put me on 60 mg. Now I have been having nausea and dizziness after breakfast. I didn't think about it being my bp medicine until I read this article.

Early Labor	Concerned, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	35-44	4/20/2011 2:38:09 PM	I went into preterm labor with my daughter at 16 weeks. Keep in mind this was 15 years ago. I was given the drug Procardia to stop my labor. I took this until I was close enough to deliver my daughter safely. I have recently been in touch with the FDA and have been told this is a Class C drug and should not be given to pregnant PTs as it can cause birth defects. My daughter was born without a uterus, she has a partial cervix, only one kidney, enlarged optic nerves and hypothyroism. She also suffers from incontinence, AHDH, OCD tendencies, bi-polar, and has impulsivities. While no studies have been done on pregant women this drug has every ability possibly to cause these defects. It has been found in lab specimins to cause toxins in the placentia, amino fluid, and in the fetus. It can even caused the death of the fetus. They again have not been able to study this in pregant women because it is unethical - the words from the FDA - not mine. Please talk with your Dr about the risks of this medicine before taking it. Research it. If I had to take it over again, I would think twice. I had to be the one to tell my daughter she cannot give birth to a child ever. She may eventually go blind from glaucoma. She will be on meds the rest of her life. She will suffer from the embarrassment of incontinence. While yes this drug stopped my labor and I gave birth to her one week late, I feel it also played a role in her birth defects. Please be careful!

Tried to hang in there for 1 month.  Things only got worse.  Also, hives 6 or 7 times during the month (but I do get hives for no apparent reason, sometimes)

Other	Linda, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	5/31/2010 12:44:23 PM	I was put on Procardia in February because of reoccuring blood clots in my hands and feet. It worked great, and no more clots, however, during a 3200 mile road trip, I deveoped severe edema in my feet, ankles and calves. The edema would only partly resolve with elevation of my lower extremities. So unfortunately I had to stop taking the 30 mg tablet daily. Since I tend to only get the blood clots in the Winter, I'll have to find an alternate drug to dialate my blood vessels this Fall.

Other	nrj, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	2/26/2010 12:57:11 PM	Overall, this medication has helped me manage my blood pressure since being prescribed during my second pregnancy, but the side effects have been unforgiving.  I have been taking 90 mg Nifedipine for 6 years now. Since taking this medication I have experienced Tinnitus, poor gum health - which constantly needs treatment, tremors (shakiness), bladder issues, body stiffness, occasional headaches, and some edema.  I think long term use of this medication should be discussed with a specialist. I have decided to seek alternatives to this medication.

It worked very well. I took one pill/day. I was able to carry both my girls to over 37 weeks. It has worked so well, that we've decided to continue its use. So, I've gone from two pills to one!
Other	Wendy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	2/10/2010 2:11:52 AM	I was on this medication for high blood pressure, raynauds syndrome, and chest pain I was having. I started on 30mg. I noticed that I was having stiffness in my neck and shoulders and then would get a horrible headache in the back of my head. I continued the medication for 3 weeks to see if I would get use to it. I also get close watch of my BP to make sure it was staying within a normal range. I also was making sure that it wasn't due to my BP dropping too quickly as I am a RN. Anyhow, the stiffness in my neck and shoulders, as well as the headaches would not go away. So I had to go off this medication. Other than that it was working well for the raynauds, BP, and chest pain, but I could not live with the constant killer headaches.

Early Labor	Dissatisfied, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	1/15/2009 2:56:00 AM	This medication lowered my blood pressure so much that when I was asked to stand on the scales, I almost fainted. They used this to stop pre-term labor, but it made the contractions worse. At the time, I was 29 weeks along, and they adminstered once again for pre-term labor at 31 weeks, much to the same affects. The only thing that stopped the contractions was magnesium sulfate. If you are a pregnant patient, with the same issue as me, question the docotr on this choice.
