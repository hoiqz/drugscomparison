Other	Jean, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	5/6/2012 10:30:51 AM	Went to ER due to almond allergy. Neck, mouth,nose and eye involvement. The nurse pushed VERY SLOW through the IV to avoid unpleasant vaginal or skin burning. The relief was within an hour and today my skin color is back to normal. It will take a week for the blistering to slough off and another month for the bruising around my eyes to go away. HOWEVER, I have a few horrible side effects from this drug: Cannot sleep, mild water retention, headache, and hyperactivity. That being said, it is the best drug for my allergic condition. CAVEAT: READ YOUR FOOD PACKAGES! I am now showing allergies to things that don't CONTAIN almonds but are made in plants that also make almond food items - cross-contamination - and I am allergic to epinephrine...soooo...this is my drug.

Other	oberone, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	35-44	6/5/2010 1:29:05 PM	I suffer from Gout attacks in my great left toe and also my left ankle. The swelling from these attacks are so very painful. My last er visit the physician loaded me up on morphine. I have been on pain meds for over 15 years now and my tolerance levels for pain medications are very high. Which means morphine is a joke for me to even take to help. The Dr that night gave me Decadron through my iv. I was beyond excited as the swelling subsided within a hour to 2 hours. That was the first time the swelling ever went away that quickly. In return the pain went with it. If you suffer from gout you know how painful a attack is. I would recommend you ask your Dr for this medication immediately. I don't know if it comes in a pill form. But if it does I will definitely have it on hand for the next attack. I also take COLCHICINE 0.6 MG ,INDOMETHACIN 50 MG and ALLOPURINOL 300 MG . The COLCHICINE as you who take it is a last resort medication for gout attacks. Since the Decadron. I have not taken the other meds once. I hope this is helpful for those who suffer from Gout. I never post reviews or anything else online.  In this case I personally found something that truly helped me. It's a very good question to ask your Dr about this med. I hope this at least helps someone. Questions never hurt anyone.  Sincerely.Craig
Other	pinkrose, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	45-54	2/10/2010 10:40:19 AM	I was using this for double pneumonia, copd, and asthma while in the hospital. I was in the hospital for about 3 weeks. It made me gain weight, also made me eat alot. Decadron will burn through IV I felt it in the vaginal area and by the anus. I did find that if I mentioned this to the nurses and asked them to run it slow, they did and as long as it is ran slow you don&quot;t feel the burning. Hope that helps someone else out there for future reference.
