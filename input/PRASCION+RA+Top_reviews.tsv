Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/11/2011 9:09:51 PM	I love this product!  I have used many other acne treatments, and nothing has cleared up my skin like Prascion RA.  Most other products leave my skin red, dry, and flaking.  This product doesn't do any of that to me.  I use a little bit all over my face, and haven't had any pimples in over a year.  It is also covered by my insurance.

It's cost is outrageous &amp; my insurance didn't cover it, but my face required something so I bought it. My face is much worse, now.

It took doctors to get me this medicine which is covered by my insurance, easy to use and has my skin looking ten years younger.

I love that it contains sunscreen. I use it over another med and it takes a bit to spread it around.

Itching/burning and swelling began overnight.  My skin is sore to touch and look like I have been in the sun without sunscreen for many hours.
