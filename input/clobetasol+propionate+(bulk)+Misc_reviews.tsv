I tried a regiment of prescription drugs to no avail. My doctor prescibed Clobetasol Propionate and it immediately soothed the itching and healed the problem within 24 hours. It has been over a year since I had the itching. Today, I noticed a spot starting to sting on my elbow again. I got the Clobetasol Propionate out and used it. No more problems. I would recommend this prescription ointment for anyone who has a stinging/itcing skin problem that cannot be diagnosed by a physician.

Other	netters, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	5/3/2011 9:18:42 PM	I have had a tiny and big fluid filled blisters on my hands and big toes for over 30 years. It comes and goes. I went to my foot doctor and he scrapped the blister to test it for viral infection . It came back neg. Then he took the fluid out of the big blister on my toe to test for bacterial infection. It came back neg. Then he wanted to cut out a peice of skin to test it. I decided to get a second opinion and I am glad I did. The skin physcian place ,doctor took one look at my feet and said it was DISHYDROTIC ECXZEMA. He said it is hereditary and if one sibling has it more then likely they all do. He was right. My 3 sisters have it. just different forms of eczema. After all these years I finally have a answer to what this stuff is... I have allergys and am allergic to foods and medicines. The doc said that people who have allergies usually have eczema of some sort. I am allergic to latex ,bandaids,neosporin,cheap shoes ,rubber and so many dies purfumes and so much more. No one was ever able to figure this out except the skin doctor.I am so glad that I finally know after all the other doctors couldnt figure it out ...This med seems to work and will use for the rest of my life since eczema will never be cured.It will just take it away and then it will come back. For all those people My symtoms of this DISHYDROTIC ECZEMA were first it would be sharp pains in the toe like being stuck with a needles  and on my big toe. Then a day or so later the blisters would fill with fluid,and be very ichy. Then after the blisters were there for a week or more then it would turn dark red even almost dark purple . Then it would get hard and dry and I could peel it off like a scab,after about 3 weeks. Very painful blisters. To anyone that has this or thinks maybe they do go to the skin specialist for a diagnosis so you dont have to go thru all the pain and scrapping of the skin like I did. Very painful it was and for nothing. All there test were neg.. I will only go to the skin doctor.

The ointment relieved the itchiness &amp; moisturized the skin to help it heal. The affected area healed well.  I've also used it on scratches or bug bites that were itchy; this helped the healing process &amp; stopped me from itching.

Finally a cortisone shot cleared it up but it tries to reoccur  so I have found that using this ointment now holds it at bay. SO it does work for me that way as long as I use it before it becomes too severe.

My doctor prescribed.an Antibiotic.  This did nothing, in fact the itchy bumps got worse.  Last week he prescribed Clobetasol Propionate Foam.  Within two days the bumps and itching were almost gone and what a relief!  Its now been 6 days and I only have one small spot left.  For me this stuff worked wonders!

Other	Minesweeper, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	65-74	6/25/2009 12:01:47 PM	My dermatologist diagnosed eczema as the cause of recurring rash like symptoms between my fingers; primarily the left hand. She prescribed CLOBETASOL PROPIONATE USP 0.05% CREAM as a treatment.Unfortunately I have not had the RX long enough to evaluate the effect but it seems to clear up the continuous low level itching. I handle a lot of plants, grasses, leaves and other outdoor substances quite a lot. I'm also under treatment for rather severe allergies. For the first time in more than 40+ years I have, thus far, gone through this season with NO allergenic outbreaks at all. I take injections (2) twice a week. I'm not sure if/how all this is connected but I'm heartened by the positive comments from male users of this drug for skin diseases of various intensities.

Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	45-54	12/25/2007 10:24:10 PM	I have severe eczema on the palms of my hands and fingers (flaking, cracking and bleeding). I work in a warehouse so I have to constantly protect my hands with either band-aids or worse .. gloves. The first time I used this ointment it was great. I used it for two weeks and my hands cleared up. I applied it during a second outbreak and nothing happened. For me, sometimes it works and sometimes it dosn't. I find it works best when you moisturize often with a 'safe' moisturizer like Cetaphil or Eucerine. My Dr. recomends the ointment over the cream. The ointment can be messy (like vasoline) but gets absorbed rather quickly. If anyone would like to contact me with tips for help (or for tips for help) with ezcema feel free to contact me at hubum@yahoo.com - any help is good right?
