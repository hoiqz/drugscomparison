Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	9/27/2012 8:15:34 PM	How is this poison on the market?  Had horrible burning when I used it last night, and it hasn't stopped.  The infection was far less annoying than this.  24 hours later and it burns, itches, throbs, and feels absurdly swollen.  I wish I'd looked here first and would have saved myself this misery.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	tngal, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/19/2012 6:10:29 PM	This product provided me with instant relief. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. The irritation was gone in minutes, providing a sense of well being.  The next day I felt better than I had in days. It may not work for everyone, but it does work, so don't discard the idea before trying.

I called my drs office and they were VERY familiar with seeing this type of reaction. I was advised never to use it again!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	3/2/2012 4:21:55 PM	THIS PRODUCT HAS NOT DONE THE JOB IN MANAGING A SIMPLE YEAST INFECTION. NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE A PRODUCT THAT INDEED WILL. WHAT A WASTE

I've been to the doctor so much lately, I didn't want to go for what I was pretty sure was a yeast infection, since it was similar to the last one I had. &quot;Oh,&quot; I thought, &quot;I can manage on my own!&quot; HELL NO. I experienced INTENSE itching almost immediately, and then woke up in the middle of the night in SO MUCH PAIN. I'm limping around today, and my labia look like miniature testicles. I don't know what to do and amy trying to get an appointment with the doctor to fix this damn mess I've made... A curse on this product! 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/12/2011 6:18:03 AM	So wish I had read these reviews before taking it.. I now know never to take something w/out researching it. Like most people on here I awoke 4 hours after taking the medication with INTENSE itching, pain, and swelling. And I only took about a sixth of the actual dose. DO NOT TAKE THIS PRODUCT. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Owwwwww, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	9/18/2011 12:12:25 PM	OMG! Extreme burning and swelling hours after taking this. I woke up in the middle of the night in terrible pain. By morning I was in the bathroom trying to scoop the product out with a Qtip. Then I took a warm shower to get it of. The product is sticky like vaseline. Now some parts of my outer vaginal area are bleeding. I have applied vaseline to the areas hoping to avoid scarring. I am about to take some Zyrtec and advil now. This never happened to me when I use Monistat. Horrible product!! DO NOT USE!!!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	justjoan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	9/12/2011 11:06:13 PM	I used this product once....years ago when it first came on the market b/c it was one of the few one day treatments....and just out of curiosity i decided to check out the reviews to see if my experience was similar to others who used the product. Apparently they have not changed the formula since i used it....the same excruciating pain and awful swelling and itching....something that one does not forget...Not sure how a product with such overwhelmingly negative outcomes can remain on the market....
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5		25-34	9/2/2011 5:04:58 PM	Actually my experience was good. I'm not going to lie, I came across this website because when I first applied it yes I felt burning, tingling and intense itching so it made me panic BUT within a few hours my yeast infection was gone.ALSO there is a difference I notice between myself and alot of other women who took it. I did NOT apply it at bedtime. I actually applied it in the morning so I was up and about walking throughout the day. That may have something to do with it. Maybe its not good to use it and go to sleep. I put on a pad and went about my day. Another thing I did was used anti itch cream. That helped with the itching. Soooo I wouldn't say it's horrible.I'm only writing this because someone may be like I was earlier in a pinic thinking they are going  to experience it get worse. My advice is don't take it and go to sleep. Take it in the morning. I took it at 7:30am and by almost 4 felt soooo much better. Good luck ladies.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	8/3/2011 9:20:24 AM	I took this last night and like most other reviewers, I now find that the area is extremely swollen. I am not experiencing the pain or burning, however I think it is more itchy than before I took the medication. I only bought it because ShopRite stopped selling the Monistat 1 day which has worked for me in the past. I would never buy this again!

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	13-18	3/8/2011 1:08:12 AM	This is a wretched and sadistic product. I feel like I am being tortured slowly. This is the most unpleasant burning, itching, swelling, etc. That I have endured
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	cleanpc, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	2/20/2011 4:35:11 PM	I used this product last night after trying numerous home remedies that hadn't worked. And I must say that I had none of the swelling that most people are reporting. Upon the intial insertion, I will admit that there was a burning sensation but it wasn't unbareable and only lasted for 10-15 minutes which I expected cause any medicine that kills fungus in your vagina normally causes some brief discomfort. I woke up this morning and my vagina feels like its back to normal. So I would reccommend and re-use this product.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	2/11/2011 9:04:52 PM	This is by far the worst medication on the market. With all the pain, burning, itching, and swelling, there should be something someone could do to get this product off the market.  Buyer beware!!!!! 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	should know better, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	1/6/2011 9:33:25 PM	Like previous reviewers I wish I knew about the terrible, and long lasting pain, swelling and itching caused by using this product.  I will never try over the counter treatment again! I'll call my doctor first.  It should be removed from sale.  
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	12/16/2010 7:15:45 PM	OMG! If I only knew my vagina would get so swollen, I would have never used this product. I'v had a yeast infection before, but never self-treated. Boy did I make a big mistake. I used the one day treatment and the next day I could barely walk without feeling the discomfort of my swollen vagina. I really hope I get some relief soon. BEWARE of this product.At this point, I'm not even concerned about the yi..i just want the swelling to go away.

Worst pain I have ever experienced, I will take a yeast infection over this burning, swelling and itching any day. Talked to my Gynecologist and she recommended using hydrocortisone cream on the outer areas to help with the burning and itching. Please warn against this product! 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	gc, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/9/2010 7:36:35 AM	PLease do not use this. It is worse than having the infection. I will be heading backt to the store to get something for the horrible itch and burning.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	crazyitln, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	7/18/2010 9:59:37 PM	This is the worst product I have ever used. I felt extreme pain, itching, and swelling after using it worse than the yeast infection itself. Id rather have the yeast infection than this as a cure. Ive had to take pain meds just to live with the pain. Its been 5 days and I still have swelling, itching and pain. I cant believe this is still in the stores, it needs to be removed.  This product sucks.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Still-in-Pain, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	5/31/2010 10:51:47 PM	I had insane symptoms, and it took me over a WEEK to figure out that the tioconazole had CAUSED them. I was afraid of something serious, given the all over burn, inside and out, swelling, itching, pain....unbelievable. When will I feel normal again? I probably still have the underlying yeast infection, but I'm afraid to treat for it....
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	4/12/2010 4:19:19 PM	Yes ladies, this product is terrible!  It has been 6 days and I am still not cured, not to mention the incredible swelling and itching/pain it caused.  THIS IS NOT A GOOD PRODUCT, BEWARE!  Wish I read these many negative reviews before...

Extreme burning, swelling..can barely sit down.  I went to the walk-in thinking the infection wasn't responding to the treatment...when it was the treatment itself that was the problem.

After reading the other posts, I can without a doubt say that I had every single sypmtom described.  Horrible burning, unbelievable swelling, foul odored discharge.  I am just about back to normal after about 7 days post use and many Benadryl and Advil.  Needless to say, I will never use nor recommend this prodect to anyone. HORRIBLE!!! HORRIBLE!!! product.  
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	2/7/2010 5:54:52 PM	I totally agree I wasted 20 hard earned dollars and it didn't work just made it worse I should get my money back 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva		1	5	1			2/6/2010 9:30:20 AM	Horrible! Pain...swelling....why did I use this product! 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	1	1	Female	25-34	2/3/2010 9:04:19 PM	OMG- DO NOT USE...I wished I had read this before taking this medicine.  All the same awful things you have just been reading about- burning, swelling, and pain!  I ended up sitting in a warm bath and taking a mixture of Benadryl and Advil so that I could stop crying.  Awful!

I do not recommend this product at - it needs to be taken off the market.  I had to go see my doctor because the side effects are so bad.  PLEASE DO USE THIS MEDICATION AND PLEASE TELL ALL YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS NOT TO USE IT.

This medicine is crazy. I feel worse than I did before. I don't know what to do??? At least I know that I'm not alone. This product should definitely taken off the market.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	11/28/2009 12:05:08 AM	Unfortunately I did not read the reviews on this product before using. Two days after using Vagistat 1, I experienced intense burning and itching.  It is 7 days later and I still don't feel well.  My doctor wants me to use it again.  Never happen!!!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	historyteach, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/26/2009 10:49:55 PM	I used this medicine about 30 minutes ago, and I literally cannot stop writhing or moaning/groaning with the itch and pain.  This is quite possibly the worst feeling I have ever had.  Ever.  In the past half hour I have had more discharge, more itching, and more pain than I did before taking the medicine.  AWFUL.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	tanisha, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	9/2/2009 10:05:20 AM	I like the others dont know why i didnt learn before. i used vagistat when it first came out and the next day i was done. the itching and the swollen clitoris was too much for me. i was completely irritated. now as some hours have gone by i feel a litle better but not like i do when i used monistat one. that by far was the best treatment ever for one day use. i feel itchy still and very uncomfortable. if this doesn not improve in 3-4 days i am going to use my monistat 1 day and hopefully that will work. this product is terrible. stick to whats best and first. monistat. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Izzy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	8/12/2009 10:16:38 PM	I also used this product without looking at the reviews.  I am nearing the end of day 1 and things got so bad that I went to the doctor to make sure I didn't have some kind of other infection besides yeast.  They did tests and I was told I am clear (no yeast either) but I am totally swollen and the itching has pretty much been replaced by burning.  From what I have read here I only have another day or two left of this but.... I will not be using this product again.  I'll stick to the 3 to 5 day treatments.  As previously described, within a couple of hours of using the product (at bedtime) I felt intense burning that lasted for quite some time.. .and then the swelling started.  It's been a pretty crappy experience overall.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	8/6/2009 5:29:53 PM	I chose Vagistat-1 to treat my vaginal yeast infection because of the ease of use and 1 day application.  It did take care of my infection, however it inflamed my vaginal area so much that I could hardly walk the following day.  It was exquisitly painful to the touch.  It was still painful on day 2 but much better.  I've used other brands 3 and 7 day preparations without incident and I will use them again when needed. I don't know if it's the 1 day dose or if I'm allergic to the active ingredient but I will never use this product again.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	M, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	7/25/2009 2:05:54 PM	When I got this product I felt it would work because my symptoms were not bad.  After inserting the ointment I had a large amount of yeasty discharge.  I thought it was the ointment coming out until about a day later when my symptoms worsened.  It should be against the law to sell this product.  I am now trying aloe gel from the plant. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Burning, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	7/2/2009 4:09:46 PM	I cannot believe I didn't read these reviews before I bought this product. One day treatment? On sale at drugstore? I was sold. What a mistake! My symptoms got so much worse immediately upon taking it that I began to Google around to see if I was having an unusual reaction. Voila -- tons of reviews like these about how bad the product is. Honestly, if I could rewind and do it again, I wouldn't take this product in a million years. The burning and pain after taking was not at all worth the convenience of a one day &quot;treatment&quot;. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	6/16/2009 8:12:14 AM	I have used this product twice and both times I had the same result with the symptoms getting worse: increased itching, pain and swelling, but no cure. Why didn't I learn my lesson after the first time I don't know. This product should be taken off the market and NEVER SOLD TO ANYONE!!!!!! 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Mima, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/28/2009 1:42:20 PM	I'm so surprised by the negative reviews. I thought this was the best product ever. I had tried Monistat 1 in the past and that drug created all the symptoms the reviewers are writing about. This one was fantastic and it will be the only one I use from now on.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Warning78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	5/4/2009 8:11:17 AM	I have experienced the same reactions as the other reviews.  It has made my symptoms worse; burning, pain, itching. I haven't been able to sleep through the night since the initial application. If I could go back in time, I would have gone with a 3 day.  
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	4/20/2009 3:30:47 PM	Worst product ever! It took away the itching, but only temporary enough to let me fall asleep. Woke up in the middle of the night uncomfortable, burning and completely swollen. DO NOT USE!!!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	3/7/2009 4:09:03 PM	I (like everyone else on this site) had pretty severe reactions to this drug.  swelling, itching, burning and severe discomfort for days! DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	prideofalexis1, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	2/13/2009 6:57:05 AM	As like the other women whom have posted here, I too am experiencing the swelling of the vulva area and having a differcult time sitting down.  Although the itching is gone, it is now replaced with swelling and pain.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	cherrybery545, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	2/8/2009 3:13:26 PM	Not only did this product not work, but it made my symptoms worse. It says that symptoms should improve after a few days, but instead the &quot;yeast&quot; smell grew more intense as the days progressed. If I had used a three day treatment it would already be gone by now. But alas, I tried to save time and instead wasted time AND money. Please ladies... do not use this or any other one day yeast infection treatment. They do not work and, therefore, make the situation worse.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Amy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	11/26/2008 8:22:16 PM	I have intense burning of my vagina and my labia is so swollen it looks like a pair of lips. I mhave never had this happen before in my life I am scared to death.  Going back to doctors in the morning. I wish I hqd read the other reviews before using.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female		11/15/2008 3:54:28 PM	I only experienced slight burning, was lucky enought to avoid major side effects. But did not cure my yeast infection, I will have to try something else. In all: waste of money.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	7/15/2008 5:22:18 PM	I too experienced intense burning and swelling. I am calling my doctor because it seems like my symptons got worse after using this product. DO NOT USE EVER!!!!

Within a couple hours i had an intense burning pain in my vagina. I had to take a sleeping pill in order to stand pain. This morning i am still burning and i'm having a difficult time sitting. Calling my dr. and will never use this product again.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	2/20/2008 2:16:29 PM	Upon application I initially felt burning and tingling (which I expected based on the packaging, though it seemed pretty sever). By morning, my entire vaginal area was extremely swollen and painful, beyond anything I have ever imagined. Two days later and lots of showers, I'm still suffering. I can barely walk or sit and will never use this product again. Perhaps its an allergy, but I have taken an oral cousin (Diflucan) of this drug without problems.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	9/25/2007 9:16:48 AM	i used the medication last night and i woke up at 2am with my entire labia and vulva swollen.  i am also experiencing burning during urination, with blood in my urine.
