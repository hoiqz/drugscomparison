Also I have read not to take over 12 puffs per day but my physician says 16. What does this mean?

Other	Ringer, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	65-74	1/23/2012 1:10:15 PM	Using for last 3 months for a dry cough. Apparently mucus is going down into the stomach causing the cough. Also given Rabeprazole (small yellow tablet-twice daily) This seems to be working. My concern is long term use and the possibility of worse side effects than the dry mouth and slight pain in the sinus area after using the spray. Any long time users out there?
Other	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	5/29/2011 5:42:44 AM	I use two puffs twice a day for the last year.  It reduces and mostly takes away the whizzing.
Emphysema	Bert, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	4/20/2011 2:35:15 PM	Atrovent works decently well for me.  My problem is that I have no insurance and the out-of-pocket cost of this 25-day supply is $164.  With all my other medical expenses, that's a financial hit I can't handle in the long term.  Is there no generic for this?

No side affects from the inhaler, my breathing is much easier and the coughing has almost completely ceased. 
Emphysema	Jo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	10/24/2010 10:21:48 AM	Taken as initially directed, two puffs four times a day, my heart beats very fast and I have a strange taste on my tongue for a long time even with rinsing.  With the dose cut to one puff, three to four times a day, the fast heart beat doesn't occur, and there is not a strange strong lingering taste, even if I don't rinse.

My coughing has gone down and my breathing is much more relaxed. I have only been using it for a few days but it has already been effective.

So far, it has been fine, no side effects that are severe and my breathing has improved greatly.  My only concern is that I have a slight burning in my upper chest like that of a chest cold. THis occurs right after taking the medication.  I am also experiencing a dry cough that can get quite persistant but seems to be alievated when using a cough drop.
