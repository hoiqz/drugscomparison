Then I had to start paying for it on my own. It is truly beyond reach even for copayment. Dino law to the rescue, he has professional knowledge of drug companies and told me I could get the same thing over the counter. I do now at about $25 for a month or so supply. IT WORKS GREAT. And I can tell because without my enzymes I am in terrible pain. No more pain. And my wallet is not drained

It works much better than the last enzyme I was on I am not losing weight and my appetite has increased not to mention it keeps things under control. I have been taking enzymes now since June 2006 after a whipple proceedure. The biggest issue is the cost and finding a medicare plan that will cover it. My current plan has dropped it from there formulary so I am searching for another enzyme equal to this one or I may have to switch medicare plans.
Pancreas Organ Failure	Sam,  Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male		8/17/2010 9:32:43 PM	CREON CAUSES CROAN'S DISEASE and/or ULCERATIVE COLITIS!!!!!!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE!! I hope readers will read this and heavily consider my advice. I began taking Creon 24,000 2 weeks ago, and 1 DAY after beginning Creon I began seeing blood in my stool. Yesterday I had a colonoscopy to see what is going on because I was afraid it would be colon cancer, being that I had all the symptoms of colon cancer. The result of the colonoscopy was that I had proctitive colitis, (an inflammation of the rectum). The doctor told me this was either heredity or caused by possible anal sex. The &quot;heredity&quot; theory was totally bogus (bullshit) since there was absolutely no evidence of this online, and anal sex is even more of a ridiculous theory being that I would never stick anything up my ass other than the colon camera to see whats happening if it killed me. I later went home and spent hours online researching and finally realized this all started IMMEDIATELY after taking Creon, and to my surprise rectal inflammation is one of the side effects!! Here it is: Proctitive Coloitis eventually inflames your colon which is then called ulceritive colotis or croan's disease. These are very serious diseases of the colon that may be deadly! What's very suspicious is how new Creon is, and that it is THE ONLY medication available in the united states for pancreatitis! there is no other medication sisnce the government took Ultrace off the market. Ultrace worked for me before, when it was available; now the lobbyists working for this Solvay company that makes Creon were able to push it through so strong that they're the only company that offers pancreatic enzymes. They are VERY shady, especially since they charge $1013.00 for a 200 capsules! Then they have this payment program that they offer on their website, where you basically tell them how much you make, so they can determine how much they can rob you for!! PLEASE BE CAREFUL. 
Other	ReeAnnM, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/21/2010 6:14:02 PM	I have been on digestive enzymes since 1999 when I failed a fecal fat test, when I was was first turning chronic with the pancreatitis.  In February 2008 I had life giving surgery where my pancreas (and spleen) was removed, the pancreas broken down to cellular level, and the cells that control blood sugar were transplant back into my liver.  This surgery has kiterally saved my life!  But without a pancreas, I definitely need to take Creon every time I eat or even take other oral medications.  Unfortunately it is a very expensive medication because of recent FDA rulings that any medical that was grandfathered into approval, must got though the same testing as new drug.  So the number of enzymes manufacturers went from about 18 down to 3 presently, which further drove the price up.I am now in the donut hole with medicare coverage and I don't know how I am going to afford this medication I need to live.  Any suggestions are most welcome,

The generic substitutes just did not work as effectively as creon 24000. Judge the dosage by oil present in stool. They are expensive but with quality of life you just can not put a price on it!!!!!

My digestive system was damaged by antibiotics and I also have Crohns. My concern was I had a urinary track frequency and pain problem for about a year. Has anyone else experienced this side effect? The pain stopped when I stopped taking it. My doctor doesn't think the creon caused it, but I saw it listed as a side effect in the medication side effect section. I am having hypoglycemia symptoms now and started taking it again. Perhaps a lower dosage might help? Any input from users of this medication would be appreciated.

It is working great! I really believe its coating protects the enzyme until it gets past the stomach and lets it dissolve at the proper time and place. I am very pleased with Creon 20But,I may not be able to continue this great drug because of it's cost!! Please note that most drug warehouses do not store any of the enzyme drugs at the manufacturers recommended temperature !! I live in a hot state and heat is a killer for this drug---Pangestyne seemed to be more affected by the incorrect storage--bad batches were very common. I have not experienced that affect with Creon.
