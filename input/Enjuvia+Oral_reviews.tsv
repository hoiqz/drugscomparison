And I work out 4 days a week, I dont like the weight gain and i seem sleepy alot to. I see my doc next week and I am going to see about changing medication. I was taking estroven which is an OTC drug for menepause and it to took away the hot flashes and night sweats without the weight gain, so im getting off the Enjuvia

It was effective but did not completely get rid of my hot flashes and from time to time, I still felt like I was in a fog. My Dr. increased the doage to .625 and I began having heart palpitations and still had hot flashes at night. My Dr. then took me off of it and prescribed an anti-depressant.  This caused me to have anxiety attacks. So, I am very unhappy with all of the treatments so far and the fact that my Dr. is not willing to test any of my hormone levels. I am switching to another Dr. and hope to have relief soon.
Other	Sherry in VA, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	2/21/2012 9:59:15 AM	I am 49 and had a complete hysterectomy in 2006. I had been taking Estratest, but it was causing an increase in facial hair so I asked my OB-GYN for something different. Within days of taking the Enjuvia my BP elevated, I had constant headaches and the issue I already have with an accelerated heart rate and PACs suddenly stopped responding to the medicine (Toprol) I was taking. After doubling up all the dosages and nothing working, the cardiologist was stumped. On my own, I stopped taking the Enjuvia and started the Estratest again from a leftover prescription. Wow! Immediate relief from the palpitations, BP and headaches. Sorry, Enjuvia is not for me. I'm asking to switch back to Estratest.

After palpitations primary doctor told me to stop it to rule out med. Went back on it but wasn't helping so started on low dose Enjuvia 2 weeks ago. Hot flashes mostly gone but feel dizzy occasionally, anxious and memory is awful. Thought was something else til read side effects and other reviews. Will give it another week.

Other	Americana, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	1/10/2012 2:55:41 AM	I was placed on this drug due to having all the menopausal symptoms that were driving me crazy and I wanted to be on something plant based, so my doctor put me on Enjuvia and Premarin.  It worked wonderful after one month; no more hot flashes, sex life improved, slept better.  BUT after 6 weeks I started bleeding and had to go off of it. My doctor offered to adjust the dose but said I would have to have a uterine biopsy first and I refused, as I didn't think it was necessary and was caused by the medication.  Wish I had not had bleeding with it or I would still take it.

I had a hysterectomy &amp; oophorectomy at age 39 &amp; had no problems with Premarin.  In the 2 months I have been taking Enjuvia, I cry easily, feel tired, sleep 2 to 3 hours longer each night, get hot flashes, &amp; have diminished sex drive.  After reading other reviews, I finally made the connection between this med &amp; the way I feel.  Thanks.

The one side effect,so far, is imbalance. I can't call it dizziness but just crazy imbalance.  Wobbly and bumping into things.  My mind has cleared, I have more energy, and I'm not grumpy.

&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	8/2/2011 2:34:42 PM	Adverse event. I am a pharmacist/patient. Happily controlled hot flashes for approx. 8 months on Cenestin brand of estrogen (A) 0.625mg/day. This brand became unavailable and my gyn agreed with Medco to switch me to Enjuvia (estrogen B) 0.625mg/day. Approx. 2 weeks into Rx, developed intensely itchy, hivey rash on both shins, spreading to both forearms and slowly around my neck. Thought I would go out of my mind. Finally stopped the estrogen when I thought that might be the culprit and within 6 days, no new lesions, rash substantially better. Will probably be weeks before completely resolved. Needed oral prednisone 60mg/day, Rx and OTC antihistamines. Cenestin has since become available again and I'm deciding when to start retaking. Reported to this MedWatch (as a healthcare professional) as a probably side effect of Enjuvia.

I have been on enjuvia since sometime around there.. and I hadnt noticed any problems with it, except they had to bump me up to 1.25 mg to keep the hot flashes and night sweats away. Recently I have noticed dizziness/lightheadedness.. I have had memory issues but had blamed that on the chemo.. and weight gain after about 3 months remission.. and that was supposably normal.. but then the weight plateaued and I gained more weight.. I am relatively active.. go to the gym 2 times a week and play occasional sports. I will be talking to my doctor about these symptoms.. my short term memory is HORRIBLE.. someone tells me something.. 10 seconds later I dont remember them telling me. I seem like a ditz.. and I definately am not.. so frustrating!

That something was Enjuvia and it has worked for me.  It subdued my flashing and sweats very considerably and made my life so much more pleasant and bearable.  My doctor said that it is a mild dose of estrogen, not enough to cause problems for me with any endo still in my body but enough to calm down the menopause symptoms and she was right. I feel so much better and will continue on this therapy.
