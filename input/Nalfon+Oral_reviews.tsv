Rheumatoid Arthritis	edgreason, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/22/2012 7:06:21 AM	diagnosed via blood test and symptoms, at the age of 14.  at age 27 was experiencing severe problems with mobility and pain.  After starting Nalfon 400, relief was almost immediate, and with intermittent use, (I only took it when I was hurting bad) over the next year or so, I was pain free for years.   I tried asprin,motrin,ibuprofen,tylenol,I don't remember some of the others. After taking Nalfon, I was in &quot;remission&quot; for years.  I didn't need anything until I hit my late 40's and early 50's.  email me at edgreason@yahoo.com.  you can come meet me and I will testify.
Pain	SLang, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	8/19/2012 10:11:19 PM	Had it given to me as a sample for wrist pain. It worked ok, for that , BUT it is great for alot of my other aches and pains ( low back and also shoulder).  I swear by this drug and I recommend it to everyone becacuse I have tried everything.  The nalfon agrees with me well, no stomach pain,no side effects and rapid easing of ailment.  Have not been able to get the 200mg any more so i am getting the 400mg ( hard to find either at any pharmacy, they usually have to order it).  Have not seen generic either, dont know if anyone makes it??

I have the WORST menstrual cramps I have ever heard of.  For example, last night I woke up cramping, my period just starting, feeling so much in pain I was nauseous. Fenoprofen calcium is the only thing that unknots those muscles and allows me to function normally during the first few days of my period.
Other	Lenacs, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	11/17/2010 9:09:07 PM	Heel spur for about a month.....went to the doctor and was prescribed Naflon 400mg.....worked like magic after 24 hours. I am now  able to walk correctly instead of hopping. Costly but worth every penny.
Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	2	Male	35-44	2/16/2010 4:51:36 PM	I took this for a heel spur for two weeks, along with using a plastic heel support inside my shoe during the same time period. No improvement at all, ended up getting a steroid shot in my heel that cured the pain within 3 days. INTERESTING NOTE: The arthritis pain in my knees was pretty much eliminated during the time I took this medication, so it obviously works for some things.
Arthritis	hrjpayne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/31/2010 10:08:30 PM	I was in a severe car accident and have arthritis because of many surgeries. I was on Celebrex for a month and it just wasn't doing it for me. I have been taking this medicine for 3 weeks and I already see an improvement. This medicine helps me to go about my day in a more normal way.
Pain	irahs, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	55-64	10/20/2009 10:33:41 PM	Prescribed for Plantar fasciitis. The pain is almost gone!  Now I can walk without limping and concentrate on non-prescription treatments. My doctor told me to take it after I eat a meal because it will upset my stomach.  Was he right!  ALWAYS eat something before taking Nalfon.
Pain	lovelocklady, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	7/11/2009 7:37:52 AM	I have rave reviews for this NSAID.  I am a retired RN and took this insted of ibuprofen for all my aches and pain.  It's the best of them, but I can't find a company that sells the generic
Arthritis	Nalfon, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	4/3/2009 5:47:22 PM	I had an anaphyllactic reaction from this drug and nearly died!
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/12/2009 3:42:36 PM	My legs and feet were swollen.  Nalfon took the swelling away in just one 30 day treatment.  However, I have a family history of CAD and I suffer from HBP and high cholesterol.  I don't think this drug should have been prescribed for me.
