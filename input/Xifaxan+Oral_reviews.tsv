My mind was a fog and I had a temper which I never had.All this has gone away.I have HE. Hang in there,the loose stools, cramping and gas have subsided.This drug has been a life saver! I never want to go through an other HE episode again,thought I was loosing my mind. Remember don't eat too much protien,this causes more ammonia build up in the blood. Talking with a nutritionist may help you in making good diet choices. Good luck all!!

I've taken it for 2 weeks along with lactalose 2x daily. Things feel better except I have pretty good nausea each morning about 5am. I deal with nausea daily and am on other medications but it seems to have increased since adding this drug. They've said it's a miracle drug so I'll continue. I agree it is very expensive.

The drug created extreme blockages in my GI tract.  It is three weeks since I discontinued it but my colon still clamps shut and refuses to let waste enter into it and pass out.

Impaired Brain Function due to Liver Disease	Sheila, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	55-64	2/9/2012 12:44:07 AM	I have been diagnosis with 4th stage liver failure (but very recently been told it has improved &quot;self-healing&quot; to 3rd stage). I have been taking lactulose for excessive ammonia caused by bacteria in my system that my liver no longer filters for over 7 years.  It was always hit and miss with the lactulose and because of that I've been hospitalized several times (coma).  The lactulose and liver failure causes extreme gassiness, pain, headaches.  My doctor said lets try this.  I have been on xifaxan 200mg 3x daily since 1/20/12 and have never felt better.  No longer having stomach pain, gas, headaches.  For the first time in years I feel like a human being again.  It's 2/8/12 now and I will keep a log here if it helps others.  One thing I want to mention, there have been a few people mention mouth infections and muscle weakness and tiredness etc.  I have been diagnosis with an extremely low B12 and B6, and needing extra D3.  All of the symptoms that have been mention have been cured for me by taking a B12/B6 shot once a month and increasing my D3 x 2 daily.  So no mouth problems, tired muscles, aches and pains etc.  Not saying it's the answer for everyone but maybe worth asking your doctor about.Hope I've helped someone.

My doctor put me on Xifaxan 550mg, and the results have been remarkable. I have not experienced any confusion and have been able to decrease the amount of lactalose I was taking (unpleasant tasting stuff). Before taking the medication I had lost my ability to type without a typo in practically every word, and my handwriting was so bad I could't read it myself. Both of these problems have improved considerably. I feel a 100% better than I did and family and friends have noticed a major improvement as well. The drug can't cure the cirrhosis, but it certainly has improved my quality of life.

Diarrhea caused by E. Coli Bacteria	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	12/21/2011 9:20:31 PM	I have had IBS for 30 years.  When I am symptomatic, the diarrhea can be unpredicatable.  Every year or so, I get a bowel infection that requires heavy duty antibiotics.  Usually I am given CIPRO for 2 weeks, which has worked very well with little or no side effects.  I don't know if this medication is working yet because I am still experiencing diarhhea, gassiness, pain and burning in my abdomen at times during the day.  Probiotics do not work for me.  There are times when I get some chest pain.  I have 3 more pills left.  Will post when this course of treatment in done.

The drug seems to be working for this condition.  With that said, she constantly complains ob fatigue and stomach cramping.  Problem is that I don't know how much of this is related to the liver disease itself and how much is a reaction to the Xifaxan and she has difficulty comprehending the situation to help me decide if the drug is contributing.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	6/7/2011 8:05:11 PM	I'm shocked at all the great ratings!  At age 25, I had a stomach virus that lasted about 2 weeks.  A GI specialist gave me free samples of this drug.  My symptoms became worse and continued another few weeks.  I became lactose intolerant, seemingly overnight.  I stopped treatment and saw the GI Dr. again, who diagnosed me with IBS.  All this happened in a matter of weeks.  I suffered horribly with IBS for 6 months, to the point where I wanted to be put on anti-anxiety meds (I had previously been a very healthy young adult).  Then I started taking Align over the counter (probiotics).  I'm no doctor myself, but this is a serious drug and should only be taken for serious illness.  I believe the drug killed even the good bacteria in my intestines, causing the IBS.  Only a year and a half of Align has me feeling almost normal again.  Please talk to your doctor about possible side effects before taking this drug!

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	5/6/2011 10:18:27 AM	I started out having my gall bladder removed.  Then the pain continued. I took the breathing test and it was positive for bacteria. I started Xifaxan, within 2 days I felt better, then the cramping started. I read the side effects and realized they were the same pains in the gut area as the condition I had. Some other side effects I had were chest pains and vivid dreams.  I continued with the med and lived through the stomach cramping for about 3 days after the med was discontinued.  Now I feel great. No more pain and I actucally feel hunger pangs and not abdominal pain. After over a year of having stomach pain I wasn't sure if I was hungery or feeling pain. Now I'm sure and I'm feeling good again.  Hope this bacteria doesn't come back.  :o)

The doctor gave him 3 days to live in June 2009 and has been taking lactulos since then, which he hates.  He was prescribed xifaxan last month along with the lactolose and it has really helped his memory.  Does seem to make him weak, expecially right after he takes it.  As his caregiver, the side effects do not out weigh the benefits.

Dizzy, fatigue, nausea, muscle cramps, diarrhea. Aside from restrictive periods during the morning, I gradually have less nausea &amp; diarrhea, although fatigue sets in within half an hour of taking the dosage and must rest for at least and hour before daily routine.  The drug itself has been most effective after a month or so but dosage must be followed to the letter.  Overall, I have less episodes of insomnia and confusion since on this treatment, but have experienced flare ups. 
Other	Stevie B., 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	10/29/2010 11:06:05 AM	So I have to say, this so far has helped big time.  My body had more bad bacteria VS good so the doc put me on the 550Mg at 3 pills per day rather then the 2 as prescribed. The only side effect on the listed side effects is a little gassy but there was also one that is not on the list.  Within the first week of taking it I started going to the bathroom regularly for once but noticed an itchiness of my sphincter.  A constraint itch.  a good scrubbing with a wash cloth in the shower and Zinc applied daily and its not been unbearable but it is rather annoying to have to apply it after going to the bathroom 2-3 times each day.  Other then that I am completing my prescribed dose today and I hope to not have to come back to it being such an expensive prescription.  My issue with my Doc with on my follow up will be expressed is that there is no diet or food avoidances while taking this.  My gas side effect only came about when eating certain foods, like garlic powder and onions.  I now know that this issue can be resolved by eating healthier, mix in some yogurt and or a pro-biotic to my everyday routine and not allow the bad to out weight the good balance.  also a good thing to do as well is to wash your hands more often then not, the hand sanitizers only do so much and tend to leave a sticky and or smelly hands...  hope all else who have to take this drug have good luck with it and that it takes care of you issues.

I've had doses ranging from 600mg/day to 1200mg/day, the 200mg tabs and the 55omg tabs. For me, this drug seems to either work or not.  Sometimes it works all by itself with no side effects and sometimes it causes severe stomach pain and flu symptoms which happen slowly over a few days or so.My suggestion for anyone trying it or thinking about trying it, is to ask your dr if they have samples you can try.  My dr normally gives me anough for a week and a prescription in case it works! :-)

Other	Katina, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	13-18	9/21/2010 2:42:47 AM	I took this medication at 550 mg, 2x a day. I've been struggling with digestive problems for almost three years now, and this is the first medication that hasn't just been something to ease symptoms. As soon as I tested positive for Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth, my doctor had me on this. Within days, the bloating, gas and cramping eased, and my other GI problems started to dissipate as well. I'm very glad I found this drug. My only problem with it is that it's not a one time fix; while it will kill the bacteria for now, as soon as the bacteria regrows, as it will do with SIBO, I need to restart taking the medication. I don't mind taking the medication, because it actually provides relief, it's just a hassle.

I have had 2 colonoscopies and one endoscopy and everything looks clear. According to many sources, this may be Chron's, IBS, or possible bacterial infections in the GI tract. I just finished my 6-day course of meds and the pain has gone down by 75-80%. The bloating from the front of my stomach all around to my left side is still gigantic, and activities are still annoying that part of me. Overall, so far any sort of improvement is a Godsend.  I am pretty sure that I have IBS; this disirder is one of the toughest disorders to discover by a doctor due to the early stages in the medical field understandings. One day at a time and I hope to feel ok so I can try and raise my 4 kids and stop blowing off any family functions and other important obligations that I should be at. I noyice that some people have changed their attitude towards me because I won't show up for something- if they only understood the pain involved... Peace...

This condition has affected every aspect of my life and not in a good way. Severe pain, sickness everyday of my life for years.  I have been through every test and more than once with no answers. The last Internal Specialist I went to see Patted me on the back and said &quot;Good luck to you&quot; I am a prisoner in my own body and you say &quot;good luck to me&quot; I went to see, yet another, doctor and he prescribed Xifaxan and with much surprise and relief IT WORKED!!! I am feeling so much better everyday - I even am able to go and sit in a restaurant with my family with out locating the nearest restroom. The only sad thing is - when I am done taking the meds, how long will this relief last before the symptoms come back? It's good to feel normal again -- I enjoy the simplest of lifes experiences now, like leaving the house without locating the restrooms between my house and my destination.  I LOVE THIS MEDICATION!!

After my bypass, my ammonia levels were OFF THE CHARTS and made be super goofy, lethargic and made me very irritable! I was prescribed three Xifaxan/day (plus a change in diet w/protein reduction).This drug helped my ammonia levels drop. Its been over one year now and Xifaxan is TOTALLY AWESOME!

Without it I could'nt even think of names for simple things like dog or cat. My amonia levels start rising and I go into a coma without this medication.

FOR THE LAST YEAR I HAVE BEEN HAVING BOUTS (USUALLY 4-5 DAYS/WEEK)WITH BELCHING ACCOMPANIED BY THE SMELL OF ROUGHTEN EGGS, IT WOULD START OUT THEN GET WORSE AND WORSE WITH SEVERE BLOATING AND STOMACH PAIN. AFTER AN ESSENTIALLY NEGATIVE EGD, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AN OVERGROWTH OF BACTERIA IN MY SMALL INTESTINE, SO MY DOC PRESCRIBED XIFAXAN. I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW MUCH BETTER I FELT AFTER TAKING THIS DRUG, I FELT LIKE A BRAND NEW PERSON, NOW I DIDN;T HAVE TO ISOLATE MYSELF.  THIS DRUG IS A+++++

Other	Tomscott, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	1/10/2009 8:39:41 PM	I have an internal &quot;J pouch&quot; created by my surgeon when my colon was removed 19 years ago due to cancer.  I get frequent &quot;pouchitis&quot; because of bacteria, etc. which further increases my diarrhea problems because I don't have a colon.  I had been on Cipro on and off for 14 years to clean out the bacteria in the pouch but had mixed results.  I started taking Xifaxan 3 months ago with great results!  In fact I love it BUT I apparently I may be one of the 2% of people that react to this drug with muscle and joint soreness and light infrequent headaches.  I'm going to experiment more with it maybe by alternating with the Cipro but we'll see.

I am on Entecort and that has worked for several months but my symptoms came back. I have extream  bloating without the ability to release, cramping, all those nasty things people like us experience. This drug has really helped but I am not sure for how long.

Other	10 Lane, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	5	Female	55-64	6/28/2008 4:59:59 PM	I read about this drug being useful to treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome which has bothered me for years.  I tried it and it was great...in about a week I was feeling better and able to go about my life not having to worry about any explosions or cramps or gas or painful bloating.  The effect lasted about 5 months.  Now, after about 10 months, I am taking another course of the drug and hoping for a similar excellent effect.

I'd been disabled 4 years when Xifaxan became available.  The effect was immediate.  My energy level and cognitive abilities went way up from where they were.  I've stabalized, returned to work and been able to pursue my dreams.  I'm starting a Masters program in the fall.  My insurance covers the cost ($900 per month)and it's worth every penny!

Other	pookiepup, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	10/18/2007 3:00:11 AM	I had C-Diff caused by taking antibotics prescribed for a sinus infection. It upset the balance of good vs. bad bacteria in my system. The bad bacteria took over my intestines, resulting in pain and explosive diarrhea. After a colonoscopy and other antibotic treatments for 3 months I was prescribed the Xifaxan.  The symptoms started to clear within a week.  I am on my last week of a 4 week prescription.  It is expensive, but so far it has worked.

It does the job, but I need to take it every few months and it is extremely expensive.
