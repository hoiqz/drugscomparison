Other	epoole59, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/6/2010 8:29:14 PM	I have been using Lexapro for several years to treat Panic Attacts I have had for all of my teen and adult life. It took years until I found Lexapro that helped. But after many years of use, I started getting them again, so my doctor added this patch to assist in controlling my attacts. IT has worked wonderfully, stopped my hand tremmors and racing heart. IT also helps with my MS pain levels a bit and headachs I get from IVIG treatments monthly.I have no problem keeping the patch on at all. Just make sure the area is cleaned with a alchol wipe first, dried and secured without touching the sticky side of patch before putting it on spot you desire. Note, I also take Xanax 1 mg 2 X daily if needed, mainly at night and have found I do not need as often sense I use the patch, nor my pain medicine as often. Stress can often make chronic pain worse and this patch does help mine.I do, however, seem to want to nap more often, but do not feel drugged which is nice. I do not like feeling drugged and want to always have my wits about me.

I researched and found the inforamtion on these medications online. Thank God my MD agreed. The Catapres Patch and Paxil for me worked..i now get only one or two hot flashes a day, compared to previously 12-15 hot flashes in a day. The Paxil helped also with my mood swings.
