Other	Teacher, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	55-64	3/30/2012 11:19:36 AM	I was so excited that something might help the tinnitus that I experienced due to severe TMJ. I took the maximum dose for three weeks. During the last few nights I am waking up trying to take a normal breath. I have to sit up in bed trying to get air. Now I am reading the other warnings from other web sites and difficulty breathing is a dangerous side effect...why is this on the market with no warnings???? I will stop taking this immediately and hope others will do this. By the way, the ringing did seem to be getting better, but so is my TMJ so I don't know if this helped or not. 
Other	luce, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	2/5/2012 9:50:50 PM	i have had vertigo so bad all the time to where I felt miserable all the time. I was told about Lipo-flavonoid. I have been on it a month now. I had to change from taking it three times a day to two times a day. If I took it at night I could not go to sleep. Since I have been on this my Vertigo has improved 150%..... I am so thankful for this. How ever I am having a time with constipation now which is no fun. My stomach stays very swollen and that makes me very uncomfortable. Over all though the main thing is to help my vertigo so I can function and this truely does. Oh yeah it has gave me a ton of energy which is a good thing to. I would recommend this to anyone!!!

I wasn't sure if it was the lipo that was responsible or if it was a placebo effect, until I missed a couple doses and the ringing came back as loud as ever. I also haven't had a Meniere's attack since I started taking it, but I can't say if that has anything to do with it either. I wish there was more research on Meniere's to prove or disprove some treatment besides benzodiazepines which make me sleepy all the time!

Other	Hate The Ringing, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	3/30/2009 2:55:00 PM	I took this supplement for the annoying ringing in both of my ears which has bothered me for many years. I went by the dosage instructions for one month, however, when I began experiencing stomach cramps I decreased the dosage to half and continued taking for two more months (I was desperate for something to help eliminate the ringing in my ears and the instructions said it would take for 3-6 months before seeing improvement). I had to stop taking it after three months. The ringing in my ears did not improve and the cramping in my stomach increased. I did go to my doctor who agreed I should stop and said it could take 6 weeks for this supplement to get it out of my system. It has now been two months since I stopped taking it and the stomach cramps have disappeared. I was very disappointed that I saw no improvement in this most frustrating and annoying condition.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/17/2009 4:14:43 AM	Began taking this supplement over 4 months ago.  If anything the severe ringing in my ears is even worse than before.  This supplement has done absolutely nothing to lessen the ringing.  I have been taking the maximum suggested dosage.

I lost my hearing completely in me left ear and have had this god aweful rining. I heard about lipoflavonoid and thought maybe sure give it a try and tho still have ringing in my ears it's alot more controlled then it was before.  Therefore I am glad I have been using it.....don't know for sure if it was the Lipoflavonoid or maybe just that the nerves in my ears are healing.......either way something appears to be working so thought maybe I will stay on it for another couple months and see how it goes.
Other	Barbie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	9/22/2008 1:02:34 AM	Experienced intense heartburn / acid reaction , took less than prescribed two days ago ; now am having severe rectal pain ; as though i'd ingested a dozen jalapenos.  Not good.  My vertigo is worse than it was before i took this medicine although i don't contribute the worsening of my illness to this &quot;SUPPLEMENT&quot; , it added another problem which i didn't need, cannot recommend this to anyone and think there should be a warning label on the bottle.  SOME PEOPLE SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS  !
