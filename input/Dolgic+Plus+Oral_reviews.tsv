Migraine Headache	LindaMo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	11/4/2011 2:01:13 PM	I had migraines so severe that I had to have shots almost weekly!  They would put me out or make me so drowsy I couldn't function.  I was given shots of Stadol (a very addicting nasal spray but given as a shot in the doctor's offices that provide it) and nubane (a morphine derivitive).  I had a neck fusion done just over a yr ago and another to fix the one I had but my migraines have been less painful and not as often.  Since the fusion and taking Dolgic Plus I have not had to have shots but on very rare occassions.  I was on drugs given to those with psychiatric problems that had many side effects and could become addictive.  I am so thankful for this drug!  It helps after even just 1 or 2 doses.  Thank God!  If you are having migraines try this!  I hope it works for you too.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/28/2011 9:00:25 AM	This works amazingly. I have suffered from migraines for over 10 years and have little luck with medications. Many of them have terrible side effects for me or simply don't work. Dolgic is the first medication I have taken that gets rid of the pain and keeps it away all day with one, maybe 2 doses.

Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/26/2010 10:11:11 AM	My doctor prescribed the med to me for headaches that were leaving me totally incapacitated.  I was taking 8 extra strength tylenol just to get a little relief.  One of these takes it away within 20-30 minutes!  Totally gone doesn't come back. No drowsy feeling at all, only sensation is maybe a small bit more energy. (Probably because the headache is finally gone!)  Wonderful drug.  I have used them for several years.  But no more than 3 times a week as they can be addicting. Patients should be informed of this.

Tension Headache	chelsea, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	9/29/2009 5:07:37 PM	I was having severe headaches, not to mention waking up with earaches, my teeth aching in the middle of the night from extreme pain only to find out that the  cause of the headaches was due to grinding my teeth and clenching down so hard when I sleep due to tension.  This seems to be workng so far.  Only side effect is I feel a little drowsy at times, but the headaches are gone and I can function again.
Migraine Headache	nl.mccabe, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/30/2009 10:10:19 AM	I suffer from severe tension  and migraine headaches serval times a week, and I have for too many years. The pain and vomiting are so extreme that I usually end up at the doctor's office or e.r. to get shots to relieve them. So far while taking this medication I have been shot free(knock on wood). No side affects to speak of. The headaches themselves cause me to feel tired and nauseated but I have not noticed an increase in them due to the meds. However it is important to remember to take meds AT FIRST SIGN of headache for it to be most affective. I have waited a little too long a couple of times and have felt the difference. So far this has my approval. Just a little FYI for anyone not aware of this, they have shown a connection between frequent migraines and a high risk of stroke. So it may be something you fellow migraine sufferers should check into. And it may be worth the trade off of one or two small side effects to minimize your headaches.  I hope this helps some of you out there.

Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/8/2009 10:57:42 AM	I had tried every migraine medicine on the market and none worked for me.  I was put on Dolgic Plus and for the past 5 years it has worked great for me.  Takes my migraine away, unless I wait too long I may have to take a second tablet.  No side effects,  My answer to migraines.
Migraine Headache	Jean, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	55-64	11/16/2008 9:05:05 AM	I consulted my doctor because the pain over my right eye, top of my head and back of my neck would wake me from a deep sleep.  I would have nausea and lightheadedness withi this headache.  OTC Excedrin Migraine worked but the headache would just fade, not go away.  From the information sheet, it states it's more for tenson than migraine.  I don't like having to take it daily but if that'll relieve the pain, I'll continue taking for some time.

Other	sapatient, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/27/2008 3:33:40 PM	Recently I was diagnosed with a pituitary microadenoma. I have been suffering migraine headaches as one of the symptoms, and my Dr tried me on a few different medications. I would experience some relief, but not enough to function at work. Then my dr prescribed Dolgic Plus for me, and I have been taking it for about a month and a half.  It works very well.  There has only been 2 incidents where it didnt take the edge off the headache and make it to where I can function so I had to go back to her and she gave me a shot of another medication. I recommend this Rx if you suffer headaches.  I have read up on it and though one of the side effects is drowsiness, I have not experienced any. Its almost as if I was just taking tylenol with extra benefits without the grogginess.

I can only describe this pain as to that of a migraine headache.  These headaches I get are wicked.  My DR prescribed several meds until this one - and this one works, and works well.  I was in the hospital for surgery and was on morphine and still had this wicked headache.  I told them that I needed Dolgic to get rid of it. Not all drugs work for all people, thats why there are so many of them.  I am glad that I finally found one that works for me.  I do not suffer from any side effects of this drug.  I've been using this drug for three years.  
Other	Stormy , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	4/11/2008 1:50:58 AM	I think that this medicine is more leathal than any drug you could find on the stree ! Yeh it does what it is supposed to do, i guess, but the first time i was ever perscribed it i fell off a later, after a 10 day period, the medicine was gone, then the next day i was sicker than i had ever been. I was vomiting, mood swings, i was very aggressive and mean , and i got a headach that lasted for about 3 days, i couldn't eat or drink anything ! I will never take this medicine again !!!
Migraine Headache	nishy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	2/27/2008 7:17:10 AM	This has been the miracle drug I've been looking for.  Multiple doctors have put me on every perscription drug out there, and none even put a dent in my headaches. When you get these headaches 3-4 times a week and nothing seems to make them go away, then you find something that does.... It's nothing short of a miracle. I never noticed getting sleepy after taking it, or any other side effects for that matter. I 100% recommend to anyone to at least give it a try. Side note: for an over the counter option, Excedrine Migraine has the same ingredients minus the sedative, and seems to do the next best job for me....

Migraine Headache	lcaudle4141, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/11/2007 12:02:30 PM	So far so good with this drug Dolgic Plus, it certainly beats my other method that I have used for years Codine. It does make me a little tired but once you get used to it you will adjust. I have Migrane Headaches in the worse way and nothing has actually worked as well as this product so I would consider it if you have headache problems before taking Codine.
