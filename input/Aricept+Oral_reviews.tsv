Other	Corona70, 65-74 Male  (Patient) 	2	4	3	Male	65-74	7/1/2012 1:54:46 PM	My doctor prescribed 5 mg. Aricept 1.5 years ago when I complained about a mild increase in short term memory difficulty. (I am now 71 and male) I had had occasional vivid dreams and, more rarely out &amp; out nightmares. A few months ago, the vivid dreams became far more frequent and the nightmares somewhat more frequent. A few weeks ago, I began having nightmares almost every night, usually awakening my wife. The nkightmares became worse, hearkening back tu unplesant episodes and/or people. My short term memory is about the same as it had been before. The leaflet that comes with the drug warns of &quot;strange dreams&quot; as a side effect. After 1.5 years of taking the 5 mg. dose every morning, I am now going to ask my doctor about stopping it. I have had none of the other symptoms people cite. I do have depression, but I've always suffered from that.

It took persistance and switching physicians to get results. Her symptoms were; anorexia, not taste, no hunger, confusion, weakness, weight loss, belching, tired all the time, dizzines, lost 40 lbs. Still to early to see if any improvement. I've always felt that aricept was causing my mother's decline. I hope I'm right. Only makes sense knowing that aricept has been her only change in medication. After seeing the side effect, she has alot of the most serious ones

Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Type Dementia	55-64 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	4/30/2012 6:30:47 PM	My mother, who is 79, was prescribed Aricept by her physician to slow her form of dementia.  Within 3 days of taking this drug she was having delusions of people being in her house at night along with nausea during the day and night.  Unfortunately, for my mom, it took 3 weeks of having 2 or more delusions a week, for us to realize maybe it could be the drug causing them.  The fear I saw in her eyes when she thought she was losing her mind will never leave me.  When I called her doctor he said to take her off the Aricept...the delusions stopped IMMEDIATELY. My advice is be careful and watchful in giving this drug to elderly loved ones.

Alzheimer's Disease	45-54 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	4/15/2012 4:51:01 PM	Thanks to all of you who provided comments. My mom is 79yrs. old.She was diagnosed 3yrs. ago with Alzehemimers/Dementia in 2009 but we suspected it at least 4 yrs. before (we were told it was severe depression due to the death of our dad - her husband). She was put on Aricept by her family physician for approximately 3-4 wks until she was officially diagnosed. A visiting nurse discontinued the drug.Since then, mom has been on Namenda and the Exelon patches.  She lives with me so I can vouch first-hand. I'm happy she was taken off of Aricept. Namenda and Exelon patches seem to have slowed the progression of the disease. However, since we really don't  know exactly how long ago AWFUL AL invaded and possessed her brain, I have to  admit I'm at my wits ends. I argue with myself about many things regarding her. I love her so very much.

Yes, the first few months was up and down especially for her stomach.  Now she is doing well on it but can not take it with her vitamins or it makes her stomach up set.  She takes it in the morning which is easier for her to remember to take each day then at night. As for its effectiveness I must state her memory is not getting worse and she is able to function mostly on her own.  I wait for a drug out there that will actually reverse the memory loss but for now she will remain on Donepezil HCL the generic of Aricept.

I still lose a lot of my experiences and conversations, but am now able to actually carry my thoughts through the conversations instead of losing my place. My best advice is to not take it right before bed. I've had some very vivid dreams, and cannot imagine what they would be like if I had Alzheimer's and was already easily confused. Taking this in the morning seemed to cause muscle aches, but dinnertime seems to have done the trick.

After a severe fall last May the doctors (neurologist, internist, UCLA testing, etc.) the diagnosis was a combination of &quot;perhaps&quot; lewy body dementia, early-onset Alzheimers along with Cognitive Impairment syndrome.  I was diagnosed Aricept Nov. 2011 and after a few weeks, my mind was clearer, black cloud of depression disappeared, back to my old self.  This along with Mindfulness Meditation, psychotherapy and exercise has brought me full circle.  I am now able to drive again and do not have nightmares, hallucinations, etc.

Each time has not been good - the first time he was given it we asked that he not be given it again, but they do not seem to listen to us-he has delusions, sees things, is very hostile, has no short term memory at all.  This is scary stuff.  Yesterday I went to visit him at the hospital and they were ready to restraint him-he woke up not knowing where he was at or what they were doing to him, does not remember how he got there at all.  I AGAIN asked for them to not give him this stuff as the Dr there was telling us that he needed to go into a nursing home because of his condition HIS CODITION WAS CAUSED BY THEM GIVING HIM THIS STUFF.  What a joke.

We read about aricept and took him to his local doctor who immediately placed him on the medication.  It has been 7 days and each day has been one more disaster or dilehma and we have decided to remove the aricept from his daily drugs.  He is more confused, more verbal yet none makes much sense, hallucinating and having stomach and bathroom issues.  One week after being on the Namenda we could already see some significant changes - not on this med though.

I do not want to have this dreaded and fearful disease but I hope and pray that it will give me some peace of mind.  My mother, sister and other aunts are deceased but they had this many years ago.  If I can help others and stay calm within and hope I can live a long and healthy mind, body and soul.  I have to stay busy, keep current and of all things be patient with my self and be upbeat and positive and learn more on this disease.  I have wonderful professional doctors taking care of me.  I am grateful.  More tired but I need to rest when needed.  I am 72 years old, a widow for ten years and have a large loving family, with grandchildren and six great grandchildren.  I hope to keep on traveling and walking an hour and a half three to four times a week, have taken yoga for over 40 years and cannot give up.  I am a very spiritual person, do not like to get down and try to stay as upbeat as I can.  Remember I have only been diagnosed a little over two and a half months.  I always had ADHD but no one ever tole me until about a couple of years ago.  Well, I hope this gives  you some insight and will do whan I can to learn as much as I can and stay as well as I can.

She was more confused than ever before, forgetting her everyday routine, wanting to go to bed 3 pm in the afternoon, weak the list goes on. This was a frightening experience to see what aricept was doing to her.I immediately had her taken off aricept. Now I am waiting till it gets out of her system.

I spoke with the doc about trying this Aricept, because her memory lapses were so drastic in 3 short months, she went from living alone with my help on housework, ect. to needing my 24 hr care and management with all of her needs as her memory retention was down to about 15 minutes most days. I was hoping this would help, but she has been taking Aricept 10 for 2 wks, then I was to start her on Aricept 23 after 2 wks, along with what she has been taking for a couple of years for memory, Namenda 10- 2/day, along with Effexor for depression, and Metoprolol for her heart rate, and Hydrocodone 5 for occasional pain,Simvastatin for cholesterol,promethazine for occasional Nausea, and Lisinopril 5 for high blood pressure. On Dec 13th, of 2010, I gave her 1 of her pain pills for some pain in her left foot, THAT night, she didn't sleep at all, the next day was delusional, angry, de-fusing did not work, a few hours later, she was attacking,slapping,biting,&amp; saying I was abusing her! I needed help, this all infront of my baby at that! I called my Mom(her daughter)to let her know we were coming for a visit(10 pm-45min drive) I called my Neighbor, a man who worked in centers with Alzheimers patients, to help me walk her to the car, then she thought I was &quot;commiting her&quot; (she does not want to go into assisted living of ANY kind) as we got her seated and I buckled the seat belt, she grabs my hair w both hands and would not let go, Frank helped me get lose and she slapped him, and is &quot;suing everyone for kidnapping &amp; abuse&quot; My son in his seat, completely freaked out! Normally, NOT an angry, violent or a vindictive person, moodswings-yes, but nothing like this! I wish I had read these reviews BEFORE! Her doc is on vacation, but his substitute doc's nurse did tell me over the phone I could stop the aricept today, did!! Also, wishing her daugher dead! EVILDRUG
Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Type Dementia	Lisa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	12/16/2010 3:26:19 PM	I wanted to correct something I wrote yesterday.  I meant to write Aricept 23mg, not Aricept 5 or 10mg, was dangerous.  My Mother has been on Aricept 10 since 2006 and never had any problems with that one, no side effects at all.  I didn't see much as far as it slowing the progression really, but it was okay for her to take.  Aricept 23 however, had very severe side effects, as I mentioned above.  I would not recommend anyone try that one.  It was very severe in just 3 days, she was almost like a vegetable and I thought we might lose her soon, which is why the doctor took her off of it immediately and put her back on the Aricept 10, and just overnight she was back to who she was just before taking the Aricept 23, which was a whole lot better.  Be cautious before trying Aricept 23. My mother will be 83 on New Years Day.   Also, to those people who mentioned vivid dreams and hallucinations, mood swings, yelling, screaming and so on, that is all part of the illness itself, not so much the medication.  There are a lot of books out on the subject of Alzheimer's and the different stages and it explains it all in great detail.  The book I would reccomend is called:  Coach Broyles' Playbook for Alzheimer's Caregivers.  You can call The Alzheimer's Association at 800-272-3900 for a copy of it or go to, Playbook on the Web:  www.alzheimersplaybook.com. That is the one I have and it is great, it explains everything.  Be prepared though, some of it is very unpleasant, but at the same time very helpful in preparing you a head of time. My Mother probably had Alzheimer's for a while before she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2006, which is why the medication isn't that much of a help, like it probably would be to people who are caught in the very early stages, but she didn't start with the dreams and hallucinations until about 2yrs ago.   I hope this helps people to understand the disease vs. the medication better. God Bless everyone involved,caregivers and patients.

I had my Mother try it and had to stop after just 1 week.  She got extremely weak and couldn't stand up or eat or keep awake, she couldn't speak and what very little she did try to speak came out in words that made no sense what so ever, she kept missing the chairs and falling on the floor.  I called her doctor and told him what was happening and he said to take her right now and go back to Aricept 10 which she takes along with Nemenda.  Do not use Aricept 23, it can cost a persons life.  I tried it because my Mother is in advanced alzheimer's now, but at least she was still able to speak stand walk and eat and didn't fall over, I would rather have it that way for as long as possible, then for her to be a vegetable or overdose.

She has a strong family hx of dementia, and compared to the progression in my grandmother, the Aricept has definitely slowed her progression.  She has always taken it at night and has never complained of nausea.

I have checked 5 stars on &quot;effectiveness&quot;, &quot;ease of use&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction&quot; because I have no way of knowing if IT is effective, thus, no way to grade satisfaction, though ease was no problem.  Her condition continues to worsen, now being in 6th stage of alzheimers.  My main concern is why or  should she continue same?????

I halved the pills so he could take 5mg in the am and in the pm.  Seemed to cut the diahreea but this past week he has begun to get angry and agressive.  Yelling and vindictive and not at all the sweet, compassionate man I married last year.  I am stopping the aricept and telling the doctor to find something else that doesn't change my husband's personality.

She is now in a nursing home, where they treated her anxiety with added antipyschotic meds. The combination produced seizures and further brain damage. She now can no longer walk and is wheelchair bound. I was told by her original neurologist that arricept and nameda only works for patients with true alzheimers related dementia not any fo the others,such as vascular or frontal-temporal etc. The doctor usually knows within 3-6 months if there is any benefit to the drug. My aunt is still on these medications (about 4 years) with no efficacy. I believe she has deteriorated rapidly on them. The drug company lists on their website that they only work in 10-20% of patients. Why are doctors so widely prescribing these expensive and dangerous medications? For what purpose, Profit?

We call them lurches; no doctor seems to know what it is, but neurologist today prescribed clonopin to help with involuntary movemnts. We don't know if spasms, lurches, etc. are from the aricept, but it is scaring me for him to now start a new med to perhapscounteract side effect another.  The lurches can be very rapid and wear him out, also making it difficult to fall asleep.  I cannot get answer as to whether aricept is the culprit?  Or not.  He is 73.      HELP

My doctor told me that the horrible sleep disturbing dreams should stop over a short period of time.After three months I told my doctor that I could not stand the problems.  He told me to cut the dose to 5 mg.  I did that and I have been doing great for over a year.  My memory is much improved and my recall is much much better.

Mother woke up last night from very bad nightmare, it took everything to get her into bathroom (she started having diarrhea within 24 hours of starting the drug). It was like she was paralized with fear.  No more of this drug, especially after reading the other comments. She said it wasn't worth the side effects for a little less loss of memory.  Seems to be a drug for people 65 and under. Horrible side effects.

Alzheimer's Disease	75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	5	5	4	Female		3/12/2010 8:11:16 PM	My mother has been on Aricept since it first came out 13+ years ago! (She is 84). Unfortunately, it has cost us a forune, but it does help her. We took her off of it after about 6 years for just 2 days, and then put her right back on due to immediate decline. Then just a few months ago, she went into the hospital for UTI and dehydration. The hospital took her off Aricept and Namenda. She stayed off for about a month until I asked the rehab center about it. They put her back on it, and three days later she was much better cognitively! She started making some sense. Without Aricept and Namenda she was totally out of it. She would have had to stay in the nursing home. Now she is back at Assisted Living, dementia unit, and happy. I have read all the posts and had no idea that others had bad reactions to the drug. There were many questions about UTI's. I have been told that UTI's are more common in Alzheimer's patients, although my mother has only had 2; both in the last 6 months, and she was diagnosed with alzheimer's 14 years ago. By the way, over the years she has had most of the symptoms that everyone has described on the site (except diarrhea). Hallucinations, mood swings, combative behavior, confusing day and night, being hungry all the time, not being hungry at all. We have seen it all! Aricept goes generic at the end of 2010! (I don't think my mother will make it 'til then.)

We should have waited 2-3 weeks because the higher dose did cause insomnia and nightmares.  These went away quickly after stopping the medication for 4 days (drank more fluids to flush it out) and then she started back on 5 mg. and improved gradually - calmer, recalling more recent events, not names though, and more talkative again.  Working well for 8 months now.K.

We recently placed him in a memory center long term care.  He became quite ill within a few days of arriving.  Vomiting, no appetite, loss of muscle control, etc.  Found out 20 days later as he was being taken to the ER that they had increased his Aricept from 10mg to 20mg.  He is now eating, personality change for the better.  But he is not ambulatory and he seems less coherent than before.  Staff thought that he had the flu until now.  Very scary situation.  Trying to find out more about long term effects of an overdose of Aricept.  Thanks.

In the last 6 months she has been slowly getting worse in her short term memory and consistently repeating her stories and happenings. Her doctor felt that Aricept would help her regain some of her memory or at least slow down the progression. WRONG WRONG!! Within 2 days she was totally not herself, no short term memory at all, Nausea, Vommiting. She couldnt remember anything!! She only took it for 2 days and i was horrible!! Never again!!

Since I was so depressed the doctors suggested Electro-Convulsive Shock Treatments. (They said it would take a 33 gal.trash can full of medications to get me to where the ECT's would) So I had 24 ECT's.  I had alot of loss of memory with the ECT's.  So the Psychiatrist decided to try me on Aricept. This is when Aricept first came out.  It worked for me as long as I could afford to pay the price. I am sure it is probably a lot less pricey now. I intend to talk to my Psychiatrist to see if he would subscribe it too me again.  My ECT's were done in 1998 or 1999.  I am 53 years old now and I don't seem to be able to remember as much as I used to.

Since she started taking this drug, it has been one UTI after another (every 2 months). Her Dr graually increased the dosage from 5mg to 10mg.About two weeks into the 10mg she started having nightmares, leg cramps and was hearing voices, became very weak and shakey and lost her appetite. Her Dr said to stop (cold turkey)and those symtoms seem to have diminished slightly.  My questions are, how long does it take to flush ths drug out of your system and is there any correlation with this drug causing one UTI after another? Her body has become immune to the antibiotic we have been using to treat them. Any feedback re the UTI connection would be most appreciated.  Thanks

She always was frugal with her money, had about 3k in her checking account and now she just spends and scours catalogs. She is sending money to Russian Jews. Today I found out she is 600.00 overdrawn so I am taking her off this stuff. I think this drug is affecting her behavior. Now I am going to have to take away her checkbook and debit card. I read every review on here but have not seen one on over active behavior.

His response has been incredible. Short term memory is improved, much more interested in his surroundings and is back using the computer and surfing the web. He increased the dose to 10mg and so far no problems. Hopefully he will continue to improve for a while.

She did sleep alot at first, but then evened out. She was holding up pretty well, until the Medicare-D Rx hit the coverage gap, now it is over $200 to refill. Pharmacist told her, aricept wasn't proven effective, she stopped taking it for 3 weeks, she rapidly declined mentally.  She's on it again for only 2 weeks so far, but is showing definite improvement. She was a MESS without it. We'll see how the next 1-4 months go before we decide for sure.

I noticed a difference after about a 5 - 6 week timeframe he did not repeat himself as much, was eating more without me having to remind him and was again able to keep track of taking his medis most of the time. A big improvement as we got into the 2nd and 3rd months. Now he has seemed to level off but still surprizes me by bringing up info he had long since forgot. It was a problem getting him past the sickness but it has been well worth it. I feel he has gained several years.

Very positive results became apparent after about 3weeks. Good memory returned, cognitive skillsreturned, confusion disappeared. He hasreturned to his normal self that he was five years ago.He is nearly 99 years old and has returned to doingprojects around the house such as repairing andpainting things. He is amazing, and I attribute it tothe Aricept. He was going downhill fast previously.    He began treatment with 5 mg daily for 3 weeksto watch for side affects. He began taking it 8 a.mdaily, but we changed it to 8 p.m as he had slightdizziness. Also had minor soft stool, which went back to normal after one week. Dizziness stopped aftergiving dosage before bedtime.     He went to 10mg daily, beginning after 3 weeksof 5mg. He takes 5mg at 8 a.m. and the other 5mgat 8 p.m. He has never had any dizziness after thefirst week of treatment.      His appetite is excellent and he has no nausea.I recommend Aricept to others, and they have hadpositive results, though not quite as quickly as myDad has.       It has been nearly 5 months since Dad begantreatment and we still see continued improvement.

HER DOCTOR PUT HER ON ARICEPT TO HELP WITH HER DIMENTIA. SHE WAS ON THE MEDICINE FOR 2 DAYS AND BEGAN TO SLEEP LATER AND LATER EACH DAY. SHE WOULD TELL ME SHE FELT FUNNY AND SOMETHING WAS WRONG. I TOLD HER SHE JUST NEEDED TO GET USED TO THE NEW MEDICINE. SHE WAS ON IT FOR A TOTAL OF 9 DAYS. SHE WAS COMPLETELY MOBILE AND SELF SUFFICIENT BEFORE ARICEPT. AFTER THE 9 DAYS ON ARICEPT SHE WAS UNABLE TO WALK OR TO FEED HERSELF. ONE DAY IT WAS 2PM AND SHE WAS STILL SLEEPING. I HAD HER TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE SHE HAD URINATED ALL OVER HERSELF AND DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE WAS. THIS WAS ALL AFTER SHE HAD BEEN OFF ARICEPT FOR 7 DAYS. I KEPT TELLING HER TO LET THE MEDICINE GET OUT OF HER SYSTEM. AT THE HOSPITAL THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG. SHE SPENT 7 DAYS IN HOSPITAL THEN 3 WKS IN REHAB AND NOW SHE IS FULLY FUNCTIONING AND BACK TO HER BASELINE. SHE WILL NEVER BE GIVEN THIS DRUG AGAIN. I THINK FOR SOME PEOPLE IT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS.

She suffers from severe diarrhea.  It has also taken away her appetite.  Since being on this med, her short-term memory has significantly decreased.  We're not sure if it has done anything to help her, however we don't know where she'd be without it.  We will pose this question to her doctor and see if we can take her off with a problem.  The diahrrea combined with short term memory has been a nightmare.

My mother has been taking Aricept now for about 2-3 years. She takes the lowest dosage. 10 mg was hard for her so she went back to 5. However, except for nausea, it benefits her so much. If she doesn't take it, I can tell right away. Her memory and thinking skills are much improved and I believe that Aricept has significantly slowed her progression, since she was first diagnosed around 3 years ago. She is still at home and can manage daily tasks fairly well, although she can no longer drive or do things like balancing a checkbook. She is 77 this year and hopefully will continue to have a slow progression of symptoms. One thing that continues to be a major problem though, is her loss of appetite. She has lost approx 45 pounds over the last year or so, so I'm worried about the effect this will have on her overall health. Aricept has been a godsend for us.

I took her off the aricept before the last discharge from the Hospital. I took her for a test with her Gastro, and he didn't find anything to explain her condition, but since She has been off the aricept she is slowly gaining some strength back, and feeling alittle more hungry. I would rather have her back forgetting things than for her to have to go thru that again. Also found out my Mother's sister with Parkinsons was on aricept for a short time and had same symptoms, she took herself off, and is feeling better! So beware of Aricept, or you could be hit with a lot of Hospital bills!

My neuro-psych exam showed moderate cognitive impairment, so I began the 5 mg. dosage of Aricept (against my neurologist's wishes!)  I noticed an immediate improvement - I can now remember numbers, count change accurately, remember the television show I watched last night, and more!  MS is a difficult disease to live with, because I spend so much of my day feeling bad.  But now at least I can think clearly, even when I don't feel good.Hardest side effects to live with: the extremely vivid, yet really boring dreams.  Sometimes I wake up, thinking what I've dreamed is real, because it was so vivid.

He asked me if I ever had an eating disorder because the enamel on the inside of my lower jaw had been wiped clean by the bile from throwing up.  It cost me and my parents over $20,000 dollars to put crowns on all of my bottom teeth.  I am off of Aricept and god am I so much happier.

As cognitive deficits are a possibility, my husband of 26+ years and I asked my neurologist to prescribe this drug, more of a prophylactic, but my hubby says I am better. Of course, I don't know what I don't know. Alas.

She is 82 yrs old, and her anxiety is sliding her hands across her face, and sticking her tongue out around her lips.

I have mild to moderate memory problems due to several years of depressive episode. we both have had excellent results. we both take am doses due to pm side effects. if we skip a dose just 2 days, we notice the difference, she wont' talk or will be very confused, just sit and stare and I can hardly focus, express myself, and stumble for words. she's taken it for about 3yrs and I have for app. 1yr. Can't do without it.

I believe that Aricept is a miracle drug for me.  I was diagnosed with an alzheimer's type mild dementia in 2001.  Taking the Aricept I was able to work until 2004, and now I am on disability.  I believe that Aricept has slowed the progression of my condition to the point that I am still able to care for myself, including driving and living alone.  It might not work quite like this for everyone, but any productive time it can give a person is very much welcomed.  I can honestly recommend Aricept to anyone with this type of dementia.  But please allow enough time to get past the initial side effects.

I have only been on it 3 weeks and I do feel it has helped, and hope it will continue to improve my memory loss. I have not been diagnosed with dementia or early Alzheimer's- just moderate to severe memory loss. No side effects either. MaureenD
