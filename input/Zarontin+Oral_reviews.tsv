Petit Mal Seizures	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/22/2011 12:19:23 PM	I had epilieptic seizures from around 5 years old when (in 1958) my Doctor controlled it with a combination of Phenytoin and Phenobarbitol. The outcome of this was that I spent the next 6 years at school in a sedated and confused condition resulting in me being regarded by teachers ar retarded and by the school bullies as an ideal victim. At the age of 11 another Doctor prescribed Zarontin and turned my life around; within a year I was top in Sciences, English, Math and so on. After about 5 years of the new medication I had grown out of the condition and no longer needed treatment. I am now 58 and have worked for a number of the top consultancies in the world as an Electronic Design Engineer - none of this would have been possible without this extraordinary drug Zarontin. Thanks Parke-Davis you gave me my life back.

She has been on the medication Syrup for 6 months, started @ 8ml now up to 9 ml.  Since taking the medicine I have noticed her seizures have gone from the eye rolling to actual shaking.  They are occurring much more then they did prior to the medicine.  She complains of Stomach ache every day.  She is often tired during school and actually falls asleep in class often.  I am not so sure about this medicine being right for my daughter.

She started at 5 ml twice per day.  Now she is on 8 ml twice per day.  Recently she has been complaining of a gassy upset stomach and has vivid dreams/nightmares and cannot sleep through the night.  Her recent EEG's have shown some seizure activity, hence why her medicine has slowly increased.  Looks like we will be making an unplanned trip to the neurologist.
Petit Mal Seizures	7-12 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	7-12	11/22/2010 2:58:15 PM	My son was diagnosed with petit mal siezures in 4th grade (age 9).  Once starting Zarontin he became seizure free.  He had little to no side effects.  He stayed on it for 4 yaers twice a day without ever having (to our or his knowledge) another siezure again.  My wife was religious about his frequency and time of day (same always) for dosing.  He completely outgrew the illness and has been siezure and medication free since.  He is almost 18 now.  It was very beneficial for him.

Petit Mal Seizures	Worried Mom, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	2	2	Male	7-12	10/15/2010 1:05:36 PM	My son is 9 has been on it since July.  First dose 250 Mg in the morning &amp; 250 Mg in the evening made a huge difference. But because he was still having a few dr. started to increase. With each increases he has had bad appetite, feeling hot, bad dreams, throwing up, cannot drink dairy anymore.  Seizures have come back full force and now 1000 MG per day. We are winging off to a lower dose in hopes that lower is better.  Dr. wants to introduce Lamictal but I am deathly afraid.  We are fighting with insurance to get to a pediactric neuro.  Can anyone tell me if their kids are being treated by a general neurologist or a ped's.  Why wont insurance company automatically just approve this!  So frustrated.

It has totally controlled her symptoms.  Until recently, side effects were minimal -- very vivid dreaming/imagination, etc.  I don't know what other patients with this disorder were told, but we were told this is the type of seizure you outgrow by puberty.  My daughter entered puberty about a year ago.  Now, the past couple of days, she's had bad headaches and jumpy vision.  Not sure what's going on but am calling doctor tomorrow.

Will go off of this med due to these problems.
Epileptic Seizure	Naturally Concerned,  Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		2/22/2010 3:23:54 AM	I was diagnosed with Epilepsy at age 7. Unfortunately, after months of testing; CAT Scans, MRIs, blood work, (a 3 month hospitalization), it was determined that I had Gran-Mal, Petite-Mal, and Psycho-Motor seizures. I was initially prescribed Tegretol or Carbamazepine which worked moderately for about 7 yrs. At age 14, still having active seizures, the determination was made to try me on Zarontin... huge mistake! I was so disoriented and unable to function that I stepped into the path of an oncoming school bus and had no idea what to do to save myself. I hadn't even realized the danger I was in. Zarontin made me completely numb and unable to focus AT ALL. Because of this incident (23 years ago) I have been reluctant to accept any further treatment for my seizure disorder. I'd rather live with Epilepsy than die from reactions to improper medication. Coincidentally, as I got older and remained un-medicated, the seizures became more and more infrequent. I have relapsed periodically, during more stressful points. In all fairness, it should be mentioned that I was introduced to Depakote for a brief period in my adult years, but that proved ineffective for me. I currently manage a relatively seizure-free life without medication. I have found that nutrition plays a large role in my neurology. I am not a doctor, but would like to share some information that may help those suffering seizure disorders. Please avoid foods containing &quot;Aspartame&quot;; an artificial sweetener. This may help to control some seizures. http://www.sweetpoison.com/phenylalanine.html I only wish this info had been available to me years ago. I'm providing it in the hopes that it may help someone else, now.

Petit Mal Seizures	7-12 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	2		7-12	12/7/2009 2:24:05 PM	I have just put my 8 year old on this medication. And I am trying to figure out if other children experience side effects such as stomache, or headache? My daughter has woke up throwing up and I am not sure if it just takes time??? Any advise??
Petit Mal Seizures	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/16/2009 6:45:17 AM	My son was diagnosed with absence seizures at the age of 5. Zarontin is the only medicine he has ever taken and I believe it works wonders. He was testing very low in his kindergarten class before taking the medicine. About 3 weeks after we started the medicine he was in the top 3 of his class. Yes, it is very hard to have to put your children on medicines but, I believe this was the best choice by far.  In the beginning he was a little hyper shortly after his dose but, he has adjusted to all the side effects now. Did you know that a child with absence seizures also know as blank stare seizures can have up to 150 seizures a day? Well, I hope this helped someone out there struggling with the difficult decision to medicate their child. 
Epileptic Seizure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/13/2009 9:48:38 PM	When I was a little I used this pill, and it was the worse decision the doctors could ever prescribe me.  It caused numerious of complications and side effects that have created long term effects, especially on my eyes.  It affected my eyes to the point that I have to take care of them for the rest of my life.

Epileptic Seizure	richmondfc23, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	13-18	4/1/2009 9:09:15 AM	In my nine year experience of drugs to control epilepsy this one is the best by miles. Firstly, I have been put on a cocktail of 14 pills a day to control my tonic-clonic and grand mal seizures. At first, drugs like Lamictal and Epilim (I'm Australian) were not that useful and had too many side effects.When we rolled the desperate dice and I went on Zarontin it was almost instantly successful. However, as expected the transition for this drug to take effect on the body takes time. It is far from an overnight drug. As far as the side effects/ drug effictiveness ratio goes, this as a winner by far. It is heavy drugs. That is for sure, but unlike minor drugs like Lamictal which indecisive Neurologists flirt with, the biggest side effect would have been a loss of sleeping pattern. A fine compromise in terms of daily grand mal seizures or an inconsistant sleeping pattern.Just a final point of observation, if you want to put your child on this drug it may be tough. Two reasons for this. The pills are quite large. Possibly two centimetres long (0.8 of an inch), very thin though. however the taste of the liquid is simply horrid. A definite choice of tablet is imperative. When I was eight I couldn't keep the drug down so to speak.P.s (sorry about the unit), as I'm australian I use the metric system.hope I helped!
Petit Mal Seizures	mariasmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/31/2009 8:53:36 PM	While I really struggled with the decision to put my 9-year-old daughter on any type of medication when she was diagnosed with absence seizures, I am absolutely certain my doctor was spot on by prescribing the Zarontin.  I have seen zero seizures in the 5 weeks she has been taking it and her confidence and grades have improved dramatically.

Changed my life so far...
