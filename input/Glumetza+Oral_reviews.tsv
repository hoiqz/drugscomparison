Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	glumetza, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	65-74	7/20/2012 12:54:45 PM	I took glumetza for five weeks.  I suffered tremendous muscle pain for four of those weeks.  I realized the pain was caused by my taking glumetza because this was the only change in my medication.  I stopped taking the drug and phoned my doctor.  She also informed me to stop taking glumetza.  The only problem I have now is I still suffer from muscle pain.  I didn't take the medicine long enough to determine how effective is was in lowering my H1c.  I hope no one else experienced my pain and discomfort.

Been on this for about 6mos.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Brandi04, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/10/2012 12:00:35 AM	I have prediabeties and poly cistic ovarian syndrom.  My doctor started me on metformin which tore my stomach up, then he switched me to Glumetza, a time released version of the metformin.  I have my body back for the first time since puberty!  I've been on it for 8 months now, occasionally I become hypoglycemic (mostly when I'm running around all day and don't eat right) but I carry glucose tablets and they do great at taking care of the hypoglycemia.  I haven't had a high blood sugar in the last 5 months and my doctor thinks it may have gotten rid of my prediabeties, along with diet change of course.

Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Anna, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	13-18	12/16/2011 11:11:50 PM	I have been taking Glumetza for almost 4 years. I started off on Metformin, but it was too strong and caused some terrible stomach problems.  I take 500mg daily. Since taking Glumetza I have lost over 40 pounds and my cravings and periods are normal. Unfortunately, I have become quite sick due to the medicine. I actually have to go off the medicine every few months because it burns the lining of my stomach and causes some serious problems.  Since taking the medicine my immune system has become very low. I get sick very easily and I have developed some serious allergies to various foods and chemicals. That may be unrelated, but it happened after a few months of taking the medicine and it has become gradual. I also get sick every now and then for about a week and I have no appetite whatsoever, and when I do decide to eat, I become nauseous. I truly do recommend drinking lots of water when taking this medicine. I am not one that drinks a lot of water and because of that, I have experienced symtoms of lactic acidosis, which has caused quite a scare! This medicine is serious business and should not be abused. 
Other	sparkydog, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	11/17/2011 8:29:10 AM	I have been diagnosed with PCOS (ten years ago), but am also in the perimenopause phase of life as I'm 53.  I am insulin resistant and while my blood sugar levels are normal, as is my A1C, my insulin level was a little high.  I'm taking 1000mg daily (500mg once every twelve hours, with food).  At the time this was prescribed to me I was also told to take vitamins D3 and B12.  Initially the drug worked better than Metformin regarding the side effects, but about five weeks ago I started having extreme fatigue, difficulty taking deep breaths, and feeling like my heart is going to jump right out of my chest.  The dizziness that sometimes comes along has me afraid to drive in my car alone, and I have had several bad dizzy spells while shopping or dining out with friends.  I have indigestion almost constantly with Glumetza and feel hungry/nauseous all the time.  There is also a problem with constipation and while the meds might cause diarrhea it seems I am having the opposite problem.  I have been taking this medication for three months and now I suppose I am one of the few people who cannot take this type of medicine.  I will continue controlling my diet with the plan given to me by the doctor, but I will not continue with this medicine because it is not worth it to me to feel so wrung out all of the time.  Knowing that the side effects are what they are will give me additional incentive to stick to a good nutrition plan so hopefully I can avoid problems like this in the future.

I may get one every 4-6 months. I got off of it once and I was miserable. So for now I will continue and work on my diet a little more. Supplimenting with vitamins as well.

Started w/ 500mgs, then increased to 1000mgs. At 1000mgs my blood sugar dropped from 116 to 99 and my insulin levels dropped from 30 to 13! VERY SATISFIED with this drug!  NO SIDE EFFECTS yet...which is great.  Dr wants me to increase to 1500mgs now because she said 1000mgs more than likely wont be enough to bring on a menstrual cycle.  Will write again once I start the 1500mgs

My grandmother, father and now I have type II diabetes...I am not overweight but my family history keeps my blood sugars very high.

My Dr started me off on a low dose of 500mgs once per day and after 10 days she wants me to increase to 1000mg...curious to see what is going to happen when i up the dose but as for right now, i have no complaints

Tried two trials:  First time terrible fatigue.  Second time the runs, had to stop -- couldn't leave the hosue.  Steep drop in my vitamin D level to unacceptable range, RAISED blood sugar, including the three month measure, lowered insulin levels.

Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Sarah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/23/2009 9:41:55 PM	I started taking this about 5 months ago.  The first few months were rough.  I would have to run to the bathroom about 5 minutes after taking...but my digestive system seemed to get used to it after first 2 months or so.  My periods were about 5-7 weeks apart, sometimes longer.  Now they are about 3-4 weeks, which was my Doctor's goal to help me concieve.  Still some acne on my upper back, but not too bad.  I am about 115 lbs, and this drug didn't affect my weight too much.  I lost a few pounds at first, probably because everything went through me.  Only other concern is that my periods seem to last 8-12 days which is longer than I'd like.
